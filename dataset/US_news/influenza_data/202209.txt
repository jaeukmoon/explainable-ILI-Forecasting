Using data from a pediatric cohort in Managua, Nicaragua, we examine the effects of natural influenza virus infection on subsequent infection with the same influenza virus subtype/lineage across multiple seasons, totaling 2,170 RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza infections. Logistic regression models assessed whether infection in the prior influenza season protected against homologous reinfection. We sequenced viruses from 2011–2019 identifying dominant clades and measuring antigenic distances between hemagglutinin clades. We observe homotypic protection from repeat infection in children infected with influenza A/H1N1pdm (OR 0.12, CI 0.02–0.88), A/H3N2 (OR 0.41, CI 0.24–0.73), and B/Victoria (OR 0.00, CI 0.00–0.14), but not with B/Yamagata viruses (OR 0.60, CI 0.09–2.10). Overall, protection wanes as time or antigenic distance increases. Individuals infected with one subtype or lineage of influenza virus have significantly lower odds of homologous reinfection for the following one to two years; after two years this protection wanes. This protection is demonstrated across multiple seasons, subtypes, and lineages among children.

Children experience particular influenza risk and high attack rates during outbreaks3. The effects of homotypic influenza protection have been explored previously but rarely in longitudinal studies4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Several important studies have previously examined influenza infection patterns in a range of contexts, and with this study, we seek to build upon this historical work. The Tecumseh Study examined illness duration and the age-related factors driving this from 1965 to 1972 and 1976 to 1981, identifying age-specific infection rates and peak ages for influenza A and B infection12. The Cleveland and Houston family cohorts both conducted household-based studies to track outbreaks and characterize the incidence and noted the presence of protection from re-infection in some seasons but not others13,14,15. While these historical studies laid important groundwork for the examination of homotypic protection, they were limited in both power and by the laboratory techniques of the time, which restricted the ability to time infection events precisely. More recently, a range of cohort studies has been conducted in both temperate and tropical contexts to explore influenza burden and measure immune responses. The Flu Watch cohort in the UK demonstrated evidence that T-cell-based immunity provided protection from influenza infection in both seasonal and pandemic periods16,17. In children in Hong Kong, protection from reinfection for both A/H1N1pdm and H3N2 in one subsequent homologous season has been observed using serological samples and model simulation18,19. Other studies in Singapore and Vietnam have examined influenza dynamics and incidence but have not characterized the level of homotypic protection from symptomatic infection20,21. Additionally, no data exist showing protection from clinical infection or for multiple seasons which is crucial for influenza given varying antigenic change between seasons. Here we examine homotypic influenza protection in children utilizing natural symptomatic infections covering a much broader 9-year time span.Immunity to influenza is driven by antibody responses to surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Antibody responses to infection drive evolutionary pressures and antigenic drift, necessitating the creation of yearly influenza vaccines. For the development of next-generation influenza vaccines, it is critical to determine the extent of immunity conferred by natural infection22,23,24,25,26. In this analysis, we explore interactions between patterns of virus drift and duration of time between infections, showing how these dynamics drive protection from symptomatic influenza infection.ResultsBetween January 2011 and December 2019, we followed 2764 participants aged 0–14 years who experienced 2170 episodes of symptomatic, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed influenza. We identified 542A/H1N1pdm infections, 867A/H3N2 infections, and 798 influenza B infections, with 37 infections being co-infections.The dominant influenza A subtype fluctuated from year to year. A/H1N1pdm dominated in 2011, 2015, and 2018, and there were few if any cases in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017 [Table S1]. A/H3N2 was the dominant influenza A subtype in 2012–2014, 2016–2017, and 2019. Influenza B lineages fluctuated between B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, with B/Victoria being more dominant in recent years when lineage typing was routinely available. The subtypes and lineages underwent highly varied levels of antigenic drift over the study period [Figs. 1–3]. A/H1N1pdm viruses remained fairly stable except for a shift from genetic clade 6 to 6b in 2013 and a subsequent shift to 6b.1a in 2017. A/H3N2 viruses underwent more evolution, with a different genetic clade dominating circulation for each season after 2012. For influenza B, the B/Victoria lineage clade was very stable throughout 2012–2017, while more genetic change occurred in B/Yamagata during 2014–2017.Fig. 1: Influenza A/H1N1pdm epidemics and duration of protection across seasons.A Seasonality and clades of influenza A H1N1pdm cases among children in the study from 2011 to 2019.

With the exception of being infected in 2011 and experiencing a symptomatic infection in 2013, all seasons ≤4 years apart exhibited strong protection from repeated symptomatic infection. The strongest protection occurred for A/H1N1pdm cases in 2013, whose aOR for repeated symptomatic infection in 2015 compared to those who were not infected in 2013 was 0.01 (CI: 0.00–0.07) [Table 1, Fig. 1]. A/H1N1pdm cases from 2011 had a similar level of protection in 2015 (aOR: 0.14, CI: 0.01-0.75), as did individuals infected in 2015 against illness in 2018 (aOR: 0.18, CI: 0.04–0.50). Prior symptomatic A/H1N1pdm infection protected from repeated symptomatic infection equivalent to vaccine effectiveness of 80–99% over two years and 86% over four years. For seasons five or more years apart, no significant protection was observed. The antigenic distances between all seasons were <0.5 on the log2 scale, indicating relative stability over the study period. There was a shift from clade 6 to 6a from 2011 to 2013 that may explain some of the diminished protection during that time period [Fig. S2].Table 1 Influenza A repeat infection odds.Full size tableUpon stratifying A/H1N1pdm infections by age, patterns of protection persisted. There were some variations by age group: children aged ≥5 who were infected in 2011 were protected from repeat illness in 2013 (aOR: 0.00, CI: 0.00–0.27) as compared to children aged ≤4 who were not significantly protected (aOR: 0.23, CI: 0.01–1.32) [Table S2, Fig. 1]. Children aged ≥5 infected in 2011 were also significantly protected in 2018 (aOR: 0.00, CI: 0.00–0.22). Thus, while both age groups were well-protected from repeat symptomatic infections with A/H1N1pdm, older children (aged ≥5) at the time of infection were more strongly protected from subsequent homotypic A/H1N1pdm infection than younger children.The H3N2 subtype of influenza A tended not to exhibit as strong a protective effect as H1N1pdm, particularly across two or more seasons. Overall, A/H3N2 had a 1-year protection aOR of 0.41 (CI: 0.24–0.73) and a near-identical 2-year protection aOR [Table 1]. However, unlike for A/H1N1pdm, we only observed A/H3N2-associated protection lasting for 4 years for a single season-to-season comparison; all other protective durations lasted 1 or 2 years. There was significant protection from repeated illness for 2012–2014, 2013–2014, and 2014–2016 [Table 1, Fig. 2]. For each of these associations apart from 2012 to 2014, antigenic distances between dominant clades in the given seasons were <0.4 on the log2 scale, indicating that circulating viruses at that time were similar. We were particularly interested in examining associations around the 2014 season, where a major clade shift took place in the circulating A/H3N2 virus, as we wanted to explore whether natural infection would still provide strong protection in the aftermath of a significant viral shift. Among children who were protected in 2014 as a result of an infection in 2013, we observed an increased risk of repeat infection in 2016 (aOR: 1.67, CI: 0.83–3.18) demonstrating the effect of the clade shift on homotypic protection, though this risk was not statistically significant. Additionally, when we examined the three-year protection from only clade-shifted A/H3N2 3c2.a viruses post-2014, we found borderline significant protection (aOR: 0.55, CI: 0.30–1.03), indicating that while protection from A/H3N2 among children generally lasts for a period of 2 years this protection may last up to 3 years if there is less antigenic drift in the virus, and reinforcing the joint impact of time and antigenic distance on protection from influenza.When stratified by age, older children were better protected from repeated homotypic infection with A/H3N2 over mostly 1- and 2-year periods. Children aged ≥5 were significantly protected from 2012 to 2013, 2013 to 2014, 2012 to 2014, 2014 to 2016, and 2012 to 2016 (aOR: 0.00, CI: 0.00–0.26) [Table S3, Fig. 2]. However, children aged ≤4 infected in 2012 appeared to experience a longer duration of protection. Younger children infected in 2012 were not significantly protected from illness in 2013 or 2014 but were significantly protected from illness in 2016 (aOR: 0.00, CI: 0.00–0.35), 2017 (aOR: 0.00, CI: 0.00–0.33), and 2019 (aOR: 0.00, CI: 0.00–0.42); this discrepancy may be due to age-driven patterns of exposure and imprinting, or could be due to small number considerations. All results for Influenza A were similar in the sensitivity analyses conducted [Tables S4–S7].The B/Victoria lineage circulated more frequently in the study area during 2011–2019 and was more prevalent in recent years, coinciding with greater availability of lineage typing and permitting more comparisons. Overall, there was strong homotypic protection against repeated symptomatic infection with the B/Victoria lineage for all seasons 1 or 2 years apart (1-year aOR 0.00 (CI: 0.00–0.28)) [Table 2, Fig. 3]. This pattern of short-term protection was consistent for both younger and older children [Table S8].Table 2 Influenza B repeat infection odds.Full size tableWe observed limited seasons of B/Yamagata lineage circulation during the study period, so comparisons were only available between 2014, 2017, and 2019 seasons. Of these, significant protection was only observed between the 2014 and 2019 seasons (aOR: 0.11, CI: 0.00–0.65) [Table 2, Fig. 3]. When stratified by age, this protection remained for children ≤4 but was not significant for older children [Table S9]. There were minimal clade changes during the study time period, with no antigenic distances >0.6 on the log2 scale [Fig. 3 and S2]. Overall, we did not find the same pattern of protection from repeat infections among children from B/Yamagata as we observed for circulating subtypes of influenza A or B/Victoria. All results for Influenza B were similar in the sensitivity analyses conducted [Tables S10–S13].DiscussionUsing RT-PCR-confirmed influenza infections and sequencing data from 2011 to 2019, we found that children infected with influenza A/H1N1pdm, A/H3N2, or B/Victoria were strongly protected from infection in subsequent seasons. Our findings regarding patterns of clade drift and sequence change in Nicaragua generally align with prior observations of influenza’s global circulation, where influenza A/H1N1pdm and B viruses have been observed to have less seasonal drift with slower rates of antigenic evolution and fewer epidemics as compared to influenza A/H3N2 viruses27. Additionally, these results support prior findings that repeat influenza infections can differentially boost antibody and immune responses depending upon those strains encountered early in life28,29,30,31,32. Overall, we found that protection waned with time and greater antigenic distance.When we examined age-stratified results for A/H1N1pdm infection, we found that children aged ≥5 at infection experienced stronger protection than younger children. This accords with prior analyses showing that due to the slower rate of antigenic evolution in A/H1N1pdm, older children and adults are less susceptible to reinfection than young children32,33. This lower susceptibility possibly results from a broader level of immunity due to multiple exposures to A/H1N1pdm across multiple seasons; alternatively, this heightened protection may simply be the result of immune maturation or may be attributable to a broader spectrum of prior exposure to both H1 and H3 among older children who typically have a wider and more varied immune repertoire.While we observed similar patterns in A/H3N2 repeat infections, these results were more heavily dependent on the level of antigenic change between seasons. Such findings align with antigenic cartography studies demonstrating that A/H3N2 generally evolves faster and with more punctuated evolution than A/H1N1pdm and B lineages34. The A/H3N2 3c2.A clade that emerged in 2014 is unique, as it possesses a glycosylation site that protects an important target of neutralizing antibodies. This clade has continued to circulate and has dominated influenza seasons despite individuals being repeatedly infected and acquiring some level of immunity35. Despite this, we observed protection from 2013 to 2014 when seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness was low. Protection against circulating strains wanes faster against A/H3N2 than A/H1N1pdm19, which may explain why the period of homotypic protection observed here tended to be short, even after accounting for antigenic distances between dominant clades. Children aged ≥5 were generally better protected from repeat infection with A/H3N2, although children ≤4 infected in 2012 displayed a long duration of protection. Early life exposure to A/H3N2 significantly affects anti-3c2.A antibodies, so under-5 children infected in 2012 may have had different exposure patterns than older children, thereby driving an age disparity across season comparisons35.B/Yamagata tends to circulate more frequently in adults and exhibit greater genetic diversity than B/Victoria36,37. B/Victoria tends to infect younger individuals than B/Yamagata, which has been hypothesized to result from differences in the age-varying prevalence of receptor-binding structures38. Alternatively, the declining prevalence of B/Victoria infection with age has been attributed to strengthened immunity over time due to accumulated immunity and lower levels of genetic change36,37. In general, we observed protection from repeated infections with B/Victoria among children, aligning with previously observed patterns of protection, as children appear to develop immunity over time resulting in strong protection by adulthood. By comparison, we saw very little protection from repeat infection with B/Yamagata, indicating that children may not develop durable protection in response to B/Yamagata infection.This study is strengthened by our ability to study naturally occurring influenza infections in a population with high numbers of RT-PCR-confirmed positives. Influenza vaccination in Nicaragua is not common, with ~5% of our study population ever being vaccinated against influenza. Within this study, only symptomatic individuals who met testing criteria were RT-PCR tested, meaning that this analysis examined the effects of repeated symptomatic infection and excluded asymptomatic individuals. As we were primarily interested in the individual health effects of infection, we viewed this as an appropriate population. Because of the testing criteria for inclusion, we may have missed milder infections, which could potentially have biased our findings as the impacts of asymptomatic and mild infections could not be assessed by this study. While our main interest was in the role of symptomatic infections, we acknowledge that asymptomatic infections not captured by this study may have distorted the degree of homotypic protection found here by boosting immunity in between comparison seasons. Additionally, because the cohort used only includes children aged 14 or younger, our findings may not generalize to older populations. However, children are a highly vulnerable population for influenza infection and are major drivers of transmission; thus, we believe these findings have significant public health implications and are broadly generalizable to other pediatric populations, particularly those with low levels of annual influenza vaccination. One additional limitation is that we were unable to adjust in our analysis for the size of the influenza outbreak in each respective season; while we did limit our analysis for each subtype or lineage to those seasons where there was a clear peak, it is possible that some of the protection captured by this analysis was simply due to lack of exposure for certain individuals by chance due to lower viral circulation, rather than immunological protection. We do not believe that we would have observed the strength of protection noted in this paper simply due to lower circulation in certain seasons, particularly as the comparison group for each season was driven by the overall viral prevalence, but acknowledge that confidence intervals tended to be broader in seasons with smaller influenza epidemics.The presence of homotypic protection against symptomatic infection between seasons of naturally occurring influenza has been explored prior to this study, but not in a setting with many RT-PCR-confirmed infections. Overall, we found that individuals infected with one influenza subtype or lineage had significantly lower odds of being infected with that same subtype or lineage in a subsequent season. These findings show that establishing individuals’ prior patterns of influenza infections can predict their subsequent risk and contribute to better, more specific vaccine development.MethodsStudy proceduresThe Nicaraguan Pediatric Influenza Cohort Study (NPICS) protocol has been described previously39. Briefly, NPICS includes children aged 0-14 years and is conducted in Managua, Nicaragua, at the Health Center Sócrates Flores Vivas (HCSFV). Clinical history, sociodemographic information, and household characteristics are collected at enrollment. Annual visits are performed to collect blood, height, and weight data, and to re-administer surveys. All data is initially collected and managed via OpenClinica (OpenClinica LLC, Waltham, MA, https://openclinica.com/), which has been adapted and validated for the NPICS study. This study received ethical approval from the institutional review boards at the Ministry of Health of Nicaragua and the University of Michigan. Written informed parental consent is obtained for all participants, and verbal assent is obtained for all children ≥6 years. Parents agree to bring participants to the HCSFV at the first indication of fever; respiratory samples are collected for children meeting the testing definition of feverishness or fever of ≥37.8 °C with a cough, runny nose, and/or sore throat or lower respiratory symptoms.Between January 2011 and December 2019, participants were followed from enrollment to their exit date or through 2019; additional children were enrolled each year to account for those aging out of the study and occasional loss to follow-up [Fig. S1]. Confirmed, acute infections were categorized based on their influenza infection type (A or B) and subtype (H1N1pdm or H3N2) or lineage (Victoria or Yamagata).Participants were included in the analysis if they were followed during the entirety of an influenza season. For the primary analysis, individuals with homotypic infections (same subtype/lineage) during intervening years between the exposure year and outcome year under consideration in a given model were excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity analyses included such individuals.Influenza vaccination levels are historically quite low in the study population; while in certain seasons children aged 6 months to 2 years of age were prioritized for influenza vaccination by the government, influenza vaccinations at the health center are dependent upon donations and annual vaccination percentages within the cohort were never above 6%, with an overall yearly vaccination rate among all children in the cohort of 2.7% [Table S1]. There were no significant differences in vaccination rates between the two age groups under comparison in the study.Laboratory methodsSample collection and storage details have been described39. For RT-PCR testing, RNA was extracted from nasal/oropharyngeal swabs using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Corporation, Valencia, CA). Influenza A and B viruses were amplified and typed/subtyped/lineaged according to CDC protocols. In total there was 6 influenza A samples that could not be subtyped, and 50 influenza B samples without an identifiable lineage—these samples were subsequently excluded from all subtype/lineage-specific analyses.OutcomesThe primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza A or B infection, defined by a positive RT-PCR test. Symptomatic was defined as meeting the testing criteria of feverishness or fever of ≥37.8 °C with a cough, runny nose, and/or sore throat or lower respiratory symptoms.Statistical analysesThe effect of prior influenza infection on protection against subsequent, homotypic infection was assessed using logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% credible intervals (CIs). The exposure was influenza infection in a prior season, and the outcome was an infection of the same subtype or lineage in a subsequent season, examining individual-level associations between participants enrolled in the study during the relevant comparison years. Individuals with influenza infections in the intervening seasons were dropped from consideration for models comparing seasons separated by more than a year in order to accurately account for the waning effects of immunity. All models were adjusted for both age and sex and were run in R. Other potential confounders such as household crowding and underlying illness were considered and modeled in a directed acyclic graph [Fig. S4]. Ultimately we decided not to incorporate these variables into the modeling as their overall biasing effect would have been to attenuate the results toward the null, meaning that the findings presented here represent a likely underestimate of the effect of homotypic protection. In models grouped by age (>4 years vs. ≤4 years), the subject’s age group was determined by age at the time of the prior infection—this stratification by age was based on patterns of immune system development in children and commonly-accepted breakpoints in the literature, as well as the age structure of the cohort. The number of repeat infections (NRI) was determined for each set of comparisons between influenza seasons. To address the absence of repeat infections for certain comparison years (that caused convergence issues with frequentist models), we used Bayesian logistic models with non-informative priors of N (mean = 0, variance = 1000) on the beta coefficients. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.2).Phylogenetic analyses and antigenic distancesThe final sequence dataset consisted of HA sequences for 189 A/H1N1pdm viruses, 381 A/H3N2 viruses, 151 B/Victoria viruses, and 74 B/Victoria viruses collected from our studies in Nicaragua from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019, using clinical samples collected during that time. Sequences were aligned using mafft v7.47540 and assigned to clades based on defining amino acid positions using the align_clades.py script available from the seasonal influenza build of Nextstrain, with visual confirmation that viruses from the same clade clustered monophyletically using IQ-TREE 2.0.341. Distributions of clade assignments by subtype/lineage and year are available in the supplement [Figs. S2 and S3].To measure the antigenic distance between influenza HA clades within each lineage, we constructed time-resolved phylogenetic trees (mafft 7.475, IQ-TREE 2.0.3, and TreeTime 0.8.1) that evenly sampled strains across major geographic regions and each month between January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2020, with priority given to strains with available hemagglutination inhibition (HI) measurements. We assigned strains to major historical clades with Nextstrain (Augur 12.0.0, and Auspice 2.25.1). We selected corresponding HI measurements for these strains from data provided by the CDC, the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and previously described in ref. 34. With this approach, we selected 3015 strains and 6870 HI measurements for A/H3N2, 2894 strains and 4911 HI measurements for A/H1N1pdm, 2989 strains and 5087 HI measurements for B/Victoria, and 2964 strains and 4427 HI measurements for B/Yamagata.We calculated log2 normalized antigenic distances between pairs of strains with HI measurements and estimated serum potencies with a titer substitution model42. We calculated the mean log2 antigenic distance between each reference serum and all test strains in each clade, adjusted by serum potency of the corresponding reference strain, and then calculated the mean log2 distance between reference and test clades.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Properly cooked eggs and poultry are safe to eat. | Photo credit: Pixabay With avian influenza in the news again, many people may be wondering if it is safe to consume eggs and poultry products. Currently, there is no public health or food safety concern for Michigan residents. Avian influenza is a virus that is naturally found in the wild populations of many birds, including gulls, terns, ducks, geese, swans. In domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys however, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is devastating. HPAI has recently been found in Michigan in a small backyard flock, and has also been found in several other states. Consumers should be aware that if HPAI were to occur in Michigan commercial poultry, none of the food-related products from those flocks will go into the human food chain. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is safe to eat poultry and eggs when they are properly handled and thoroughly cooked. The CDC further asserts that “the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses, including HPAI A(H5) viruses.” For example, this means that over-easy and sunny side up eggs should be avoided. In addition, people should not consume meat or eggs from poultry that are sick. According to the CDC, highly pathogenic avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern, and no human cases of HPAI have been detected in the United States. To stay safe from foodborne illness, follow these tips from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs. Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food. Clean your cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and countertops with hot soapy water after preparing each food item. Separate raw poultry and eggs from other foods. Use one cutting board for fresh produce and a different one for raw poultry. Never place cooked food on a plate that previously held raw meat, including poultry, or eggs unless the plate has been washed in hot, soapy water. Cook eggs until the yolk and white of the egg are firm. Only use recipes that call for the eggs to be cooked or heated thoroughly. Using a food thermometer is the only way to ensure that poultry and egg-containing dishes are properly cooked. These foods must be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees F for poultry and 160 degrees F for egg-containing dishes.

A new study of the flu in the 48 contiguous U.S. states, using data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, has found that the answer is closely tied to local weather – specifically, to low humidity – and varies from state to state.Average humidity varies widely across the United States, but even in the most humid states, it begins to drop as winter approaches. Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and the University of Southern California correlated AIRS measurements of water vapor in the lower atmosphere with flu case estimates for each week from 2003 to 2015. The researchers found that in each state, there is a specific level of low humidity that may signal a flu outbreak is imminent. When this threshold is crossed each year, a large increase in flu cases follows within two or three weeks, on average.This chart shows low-humidity thresholds that signal flu outbreaks in 48 U.S. states. The color range from lighter to darker indicates lower to higher humidity thresholds, with the driest state, Wyoming, having the lowest threshold and Florida the highest. Units are kilograms of water per kilogram of air. Credit: NASA/JPL-CaltechThese threshold levels of low humidity closely parallel each state’s average climate. Although all 48 states have different thresholds, states with humid climates, such as those in the Southeast, have higher threshold values than arid states, including those in the West and Southwest.The study wasn’t designed to answer why lower humidity leads to flu outbreaks.Get the Latest JPL NewsSUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWSLETTER News Media ContactWritten by Carol Rasmussen2022-025Related NewsEarth.Powerful New US-Indian Satellite Will Track Earth’s Changing SurfaceEarth.International SWOT Satellite Spots Planet-Rumbling Greenland TsunamiClimate Change.NASA Helps Find Thawing Permafrost Adds to Near-Term Global WarmingClimate Change.First Greenhouse Gas Plumes Detected With NASA-Designed InstrumentEarth.NASA-Funded Study Assesses Pollution Near Los Angeles-Area WarehousesClimate Change.NASA Analysis Shows Irreversible Sea Level Rise for Pacific IslandsClimate Change.NASA Helps Build New Federal Sea Level Rise WebsiteEarth.NASA Mission Gets Its First Snapshot of Polar Heat EmissionsTechnology.NASA JPL Developing Underwater Robots to Venture Deep Below Polar IceClimate Change.New NASA Study Tallies Carbon Emissions From Massive Canadian FiresExplore MoreImage.Nyamulagira Volcano, Democratic Republic CongoImage.SWOT Captures Planet-Rumbling Greenland TsunamiImage.SWOT Captures Planet-Rumbling Greenland TsunamiImage.NASA's COLDArm Operating on the Moon (Animation)Image.Klamath River, OR and CAImage.Humboldt Glacier, VenezuelaImage.NISAR Radar Antenna Reflector Loaded for Return to IndiaImage.NISAR Radar Antenna Reflector Loaded for Return to IndiaImage.Cryoconite Holes on Matanuska GlacierMission.NISARAbout JPLWho We AreExecutive CouncilDirectorsCareersInternshipsThe JPL StoryJPL AchievementsDocumentary SeriesJPL Annual ReportJPL Plan: 2023-2026MissionsCurrentPastFutureAllNewsAllEarthSolar SystemStars and GalaxiesSubscribe to JPL NewsGalleriesImagesVideosAudioPodcastsAppsVisions of the FutureSlice of HistoryRobotics at JPLEventsLecture SeriesTeam CompetitionsSpeakers BureauCalendarVisitPublic ToursVirtual TourDirections and MapsTopicsJPL LifeSolar SystemMarsEarthClimate ChangeExoplanetsStars and GalaxiesRoboticsMoreAsteroid WatchNASA's Eyes VisualizationsUniverse - Internal NewsletterSocial MediaAccessibility at NASAContact UsGet the Latest from JPL Follow Us JPL is a federally funded research and development center managed for NASA by Caltech.

Read time: 7 minutes The influenza virus caused between 9–41 million illnesses and 12–52,000 deaths in the United States each year between 2010 and 2020. In a “bad” flu year, around 30,000 people die in the UK from flu and pneumonia. A 2018 study estimated that 30% of the burden of infectious disease in Europe is due to influenza. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 3–5 million severe flu cases and 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths occur worldwide each year.Those at high risk of flu complications are children younger than two years and adults aged 65 years and above, as well as pregnant women and people with certain chronic medical conditions. The best strategy for avoiding flu is to get a vaccine shot, with current vaccines offering protection against four strains of the virus: two type B and two type A strains. The WHO recommends vaccination as the main measure for preventing the disease and advises that healthcare workers receive a flu jab.Egg-based vaccines rule the roostMost flu jabs consist of key proteins from viruses replicated in eggs. “It is pretty old school. The virus is grown in eggs, harvested and chemically treated and then it’s purified to some degree,” says Kim Roberts, virologist at Trinity College Dublin. The most important component is the hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein at the viral surface, which is quantified after manufacture. “That’s the bit that your immune response generates most neutralizing antibodies against,” Roberts explains.There are some other types of flu vaccines. In 2011, a live attenuated vaccine for intranasal use was approved in Europe for children and adolescents. The UK vaccinated over 3 million children with this nasal spray in 2020–21. “This virus replicates a little bit in the nose and that stimulates a really good immune response,” says Roberts. In the US this vaccine is also licensed for adults. The US FDA approved one inactivated flu vaccine that is made in mammalian cells, rather than eggs, but production is limited. Egg-based vaccines rule the roost, and account for ~82% of the US supply chain this year. They dominate in Europe too. The process of making them has incrementally improved over 70 years, but still takes around six months. “There are multiple problems [with this production method],” affirms Roberts, one example being, “decisions in selecting strains have to be made eight months in advance.”Strains are selected by WHO experts in February for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, for example. However, rapid viral evolution can mean the vaccine does not match the circulating strains well the following season. Also, some strains do not grow well in eggs. “It’s a compromise between the strain that’s going to give you a good antibody response, and a strain that will grow well in eggs,” Roberts explains. Also, the chosen strains may adapt to replicate well in eggs, a disadvantage since we want them to closely mirror wild type viruses, rather than evolve into superior egg viruses.“Flu vaccines could be improved in many ways,” says Rebecca Cox, head of the influenza centre at the University of Bergen in Norway. “But at the end of the day it has to be cost effective.” One major issue is that the vaccines don’t boast impressive efficacy, especially amongst the elderly; CDC figures for the last 10 years suggest efficacy between 10–60%. “Moderately effective,” is how Cox sums up flu vaccines, though it reduced the risk of an adult being admitted with flu to a general ward by 37% and an ICU by 82%, a 2018 study found. Approaches to improve efficacy in the elderly include higher doses or adding an immune-boosting adjuvant. There is limited evidence thus far that newer flu vaccines are more effective, according to a 2020 study from the European Centre for Disease Control.Quest for the Holy GrailSince strain antigens drift and immunity wanes, it is recommended that vulnerable people get a flu jab every year. “Every three to four years you really need to update the vaccine, but the vaccine efficacy is low anyway, and some years the vaccine does not match the current strain well and you can have really low efficacy,” says Sunetra Gupta, evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford. This problem has long been recognized, and it has led researchers to pursue a universal flu vaccine, the “Holy Grail” of flu vaccinology. This is a vaccine that works against current and future strains. “Efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine have been going on for decades,” says Roberts.Such a vaccine could allow stockpiling for the emergence of a pandemic influenza strain. The last pandemic occurred in 2009, but there were flu pandemics also in 1918, 1957 and 1968. It will happen again, and the six-month process of making egg-based flu vaccines leaves the world vulnerable.Different strategies for a universal flu vaccine are being tried. There was one universal flu vaccine in Phase III clinical trials from BiondVax in Israel, but it reported disappointing results in October 2020. Another experimental vaccine (FLU-v from Imutex) stimulates killer T cells to target conserved internal proteins common to all flu viruses, which are not as variable as surface proteins. It has reported positive results in a Phase IIb challenge study. Such efforts are noted in this tracker from the Influenza Vaccines Roadmap initiative.Another approach is to redirect the immune system to more conserved areas of the hemagglutinin protein to get around its shape shifting that evades antibodies. Florian Krammer at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, has focused on the stalk portion, close to the viral membrane. He recently reported positive results from a Phase I clinical trial on healthy US adults. This tested the safety and ability of a chimeric vaccine that consists of different hemagglutinin stalks and head parts from avian flu subtypes, along with the AS03 adjuvant.The hope here is that antibodies raised by the vaccine would work against different strains, or even entirely new strains, of the virus. But this is not easy task. “It is difficult to do something that doesn’t happen in nature,” says Roberts. “Whether it’s a natural infection or a vaccine, most people don’t generate cross-reacting immune responses,” meaning responses that tackle different strains of the virus.Nevertheless, Gupta at Oxford has also been on the hunt for a universal flu vaccine. She noted that the receptor binding domain of flu hemagglutinin contains flexible loops that shape-shift to throw off antibody attachment. “The dogma was that anything that the immune system naturally sees in flu is highly diverse,” says Gupta, and therefore not suitable for a universal vaccine. She wondered if there were targets of natural immunity that varied, but were not highly diverse, and asked why certain strains persist for years, only to be completely replaced by another unique strain.Her research revealed parts of the head of the hemagglutinin protein that seemed to come in four to five flavors, which the virus shifted through over the decades. Changes alter the configuration of the receptor binding domain and mean antibodies for previous strains no longer bind so well. “It always has to circle back or keep reusing these epitopes,” says Gupta. “Once [the virus] mutated this region, [antibody] neutralization dropped dramatically.” She reported that young children were naturally immune to some historical strains, including from the 1930s, and that this was partly due to having the same epitopes close to the receptor binding domain. By including the four variations into one vaccine, Supta generated immune protection in mice to human H1N1 strains that have circulated since 1918. “We’d be able to vaccinate with a cocktail of four different epitopes and it focuses immunity on an area naturally recognized by the immune system,” she says. This is now being licensed by Blue Water Vaccines, who will fund clinical trials.Another trial planned for early 2022 will see four inactivated strains of avian flu either injected or sprayed into the noses of volunteers. “These are low pathogenic avian flu influenza viruses, chosen because they are the phylogenetic precursors to most groups of human influenza A viruses,” says Matthew Memoli, flu virologist at the National Institutes of Allergy & Infections Diseases. His hope is that deploying a cocktail of whole inactivated viruses will protect the old, the young and immune compromised. “A universal vaccine shouldn’t be just universal in the viruses in covers, but also in terms of the types of people it can protect,” says Memoli.Potential pandemic silver liningsUnfortunately, the pandemic has significantly slowed R&D on influenza vaccines, admit researchers. But SARS-CoV-2 accelerated two new platforms – viral vector and mRNA vaccines – a potential silver lining. “It will be interesting to see what happens with adenovirus vector-based vaccines and the messenger RNA and how that transforms the landscape,” says Cox. But she warns, “It’s not a given that they will be more successful for influenza.” What is a sure bet, however, is that they will be faster to design and manufacture – especially the mRNA vaccines. “Once you’ve identified the strain of virus that you want to base your vaccine on, it is much faster to make that messenger RNA,” says Roberts. This could drastically cut the eight-month time lag in generating new seasonal vaccines, meaning that the strains chosen would be a closer match to what is circulating in the community.Moreover, there have already been studies on flu vaccines using mRNA. “The results were okay, but weren’t fantastic,” notes Cox. Pfizer recently announced a trial planned for 2022, and Moderna is reportedly working on a COVID-19 and flu combo shot. Flu vaccine researchers are optimistic. “I think this will probably be a paradigm shift in vaccinology for influenza, in terms of these technologies now being adapted for large-scale production, which they weren’t before,” says Cox. It might even assist in the development of a universal flu vaccine.Flu vaccination will continue to be needed. “The flu situation is never stable. It changes every year, and we get periodic pandemics,” says virologist Elly Gaunt at the University of Edinburgh. “We are never getting rid of flu, because it has got a reservoir in wildfowl, and we can’t vaccinate every migratory bird in the world. Flu is not going anywhere.” A universal flu vaccine would be a perennial boon for public health. In the meantime, faster vaccine production using the newly validated platforms, may offer a superior vaccine, if their costs can be kept competitive.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Public health measures to control COVID, including social distancing, masks, border closures and reduced international travel, have worked to reduce the impact of COVID. But they’ve also led to a reduction, or changed the pattern, of other respiratory infections such as influenza, whooping cough and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A Productivity Commission report released last month showed whooping cough rates in 2020–21 were the lowest they’d been in years. Australia also didn’t experience much of a flu season in 2020 or 2021. This is good news as we didn’t want to have both flu and COVID circulating in high numbers. One concern, though, is these low rates may have lulled us into complacency. It might mean many people haven’t been in any rush to get their flu vaccine. What’s more, because very few of us have had these infections over the past two years, we have probably experienced less of a boost in any “natural” immunity. We need to be wary of these infections bouncing back, especially as we head into winter and our borders open to international travellers. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) last week released advice urging all Australians to get a flu vaccine once available, which is likely to be in March. Read more: We can expect more colds and flu as COVID restrictions lift. 5 germs to look out for Flu rates are way down Influenza activity is tracked at a global level by the World Health Organisation and used to decide on which flu strains are covered in the vaccine each year. In Australia it is a “notifiable disease”. This means laboratory-confirmed cases are reported to our National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. In 2020, there were 21,266 notifications of laboratory-confirmed influenza to this system — almost eight times lower than the five-year average, which is 163,015. In 2021, there were only 598 notifications up to early November. It’s important to note some of the reduction in flu cases being notified could be due to fewer people presenting to health-care centres and being tested. This means we may undercount flu cases, especially mild ones. However, we have also seen a reduction in more severe cases leading to hospitalisations and deaths due to flu, suggesting it’s a real decrease. Whooping cough is down too Whooping cough (also called pertussis) is at historically low levels. We usually experience an upsurge in whooping cough cases every three to five years. This is probably because we get a natural immune boost after exposure, which then tends to limit the spread and so the epidemic ends, however when our natural immune boost wanes we may then get an increase in cases. It’s also a “notifiable disease”. Our last big year was 2015–16, and if we followed the normal pattern we should have seen an increase in 2020–21. In previous years, notifications of whooping cough have been over 100 per 100,000 children, with the highest rates of 287 per 100,000 in 2015–16 and 357 per 100,000 in 2011–12. But in 2020–21 there were only 116 cases notified in children under 14 years old. That’s a rate of 2.4 per 100,000 children, substantially lower than 2011–12 and 2015–16. RSV has changed Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common viral infection that usually leads to an increase in hospitalisations every year, often before the arrival of flu. It can be particularly severe in infants under one year old. The COVID pandemic and associated public health measures may be behind a shift in the timing of RSV infections. In NSW from 2015 to 2019, the peak of infections was in autumn and winter. But in 2020, the peak of infections shifted to early summer. In 2020, RSV hospitalisations were lower in infants under 12 months and higher in two to four year olds, compared to previous years (2014–19). Vaccines are important for other diseases, too The reduction in flu, RSV and whooping cough is likely due to COVID public health measures. However, for whooping cough, the protection of our youngest infants is probably also due to the impact of maternal whooping cough vaccines during pregnancy. We don’t have much data on this yet, but one paper from Victoria showed an increase in whooping cough vaccine uptake among pregnant women. It climbed from about 38% to over 80% between 2015 and 2017. Another paper from southeast Queensland showed whooping cough vaccine coverage in pregnant women was approximately 70%. Read more: After a horrific COVID wave, India's health system is now overwhelmed by a different virus Real world effectiveness studies have shown a whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy is more than 90% effective in preventing young infant hospitalisations from the disease. For this reason, health authorities in Australia, the US and UK recommend a whooping cough vaccine be given during every pregnancy. Australian health authorities also recommend pregnant women get flu and COVID vaccines. We can’t be complacent Concerns about visiting health-care providers during COVID may have meant a fall in vaccine coverage for other diseases. This has occurred in some countries and has prompted an alert from the World Health Organization. Also, it’s clear fewer people have been naturally exposed to flu in the last two years. It’s possible having a flu infection in one year may give you some protection in subsequent years (though you really don’t want to get the flu). Both of these factors may mean we have lower protection when we finally get a flu season. With winter approaching and borders opening up, it’s possible we may see the emergence of flu again this year. In the meantime talk to your GP about any vaccines – including flu when it’s available – that you and your children may need to catch up on.

Newsroom Bird Flu Blog MDA Blog Pending Regulations for Public Comments Press Releases MDA Public Meetings Calendar Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Confirmed in Cecil County March 5, 2022 Maryland Poultry Growers Advised to Take Precautions Photo Credit: Edwin Remsberg ANNAPOLIS, MD — Federal laboratory testing has confirmed a case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) on a Maryland poultry farm. Following an investigation by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed a Cecil County sample tested positive for HPAI. The Maryland case comes one week after a HPAI positive in Delaware. Following the Delaware case, Maryland and its federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. To prevent the spread of the virus, depopulation of the affected birds has begun in Cecil County; nothing from the facility will enter the supply chain. The index farm is under a strict quarantine; only authorized personnel will be allowed on the premise. “Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle. All poultry growers, operators, and owners, including those who manage backyard flocks, must remain vigilant,” said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Joe Bartenfelder. “MDA, USDA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address and localize the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks.” Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors. It has appeared sporadically over the last several decades in bird populations throughout the globe. Wild birds can carry the virus without becoming sick, while domesticated birds can become very sick. HPAI is not a public health concern. Maryland growers should take the following precautions to protect their flocks: Restrict access to poultry by posting “Restricted Access” signage, securing the area with a locked gate, or both. Ensure that contaminated materials on the ground are not transported into the poultry growing house or area. Provide the following items to anyone entering or leaving any area where poultry are kept: Footbaths and foot mats with disinfectant; Boot washing and disinfectant station; and Footwear change or foot covers. Cover and secure feed to prevent wild birds, rodents, or other animals from accessing it. Cover and properly contain used litter, or other disease-containing organic materials to prevent wild birds, rodents, or other animals from accessing them, and keep them from being blown around by the wind. Allow MDA to enter the premises during normal working hours to inspect your biosecurity and sanitation practices. Maintain a log of those who access egg and poultry houses. Report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810 or 410-841-5971. Also contact the USDA at 866-536-7593. Read up about HPAI and biosecurity measures on the MDA website. Commercial chicken growers, backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov. In addition, the USDA’s Defend the Flock website has information on ways to help mitigate the risk of avian influenza, including instructional videos, additional biosecurity measures, and photos that show the signs of illness.

In January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidance for reducing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) transmission in schools and day care settings. But the increased focus on minimizing the spread of COVID-19 hasn’t stopped the need for research on other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza virus (flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which are also known to spread in child care settings. According to the CDC, the flu infects 9 million to 41 million people in the United States each year and leads to the hospitalization of 7,000 to 26,000 children. Linsey Marr, the Charles P. Lunsford Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering, is leading a team of researchers from the University of Michigan, the University of Pittsburgh, Emory University, and Georgetown University to investigate the transmission of flu in child care settings. Their project, MITIGATE FLU, which stands for Multidisciplinary InvesTIGation to Ease inFLUenza, received $8.8 million in funding from a grant through Flu Lab, an organization that supports bold approaches to defeat influenza. Marr said the team hopes to understand how behavioral and environmental factors affect transmission rates and identify the most effective interventions. “We know a lot about the structure of the flu virus and what happens to it in the body, but we still don’t have good answers to basic questions about transmission, like, ‘How much is transmitted by breathing in aerosols versus touching a contaminated surface?’ and ‘Why is it seasonal?’” said Marr. “Some of these same questions have also been raised about COVID-19.” The team has divided its research into three distinct, but related, projects. The first project focuses on improving the detection of the flu in an indoor environment. Currently, the flu virus collection and detection methods are limited by poor particle recoveries and inconsistent results from sample to sample. “Our goal is to innovate flu virus detection in these indoor settings to help us understand when children are exposed to the viruses and how many viruses they are exposed to,” said project lead Krista Wigginton, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan. To do this, the team will develop a robot that collects samples in a classroom via interactions with children. Researchers also will develop new methods for differentiating flu viruses that are infectious versus non-infectious. “Combined, these innovations in detection approaches will provide insight into the amount of infectious viruses present within the indoor environment in close proximity to children,” said Wigginton. “This will aid in the development of interventions that reduce the amount of infectious viruses in the air.” The second project, led by Seema Lakdawala at the University of Pittsburgh and Anice Lowen at Emory University, examines the efficiency of virus transmission modes, including aerosols, droplets, and contaminated surfaces, by using ferrets and engineered viruses. Further research will determine what non-pharmaceutical interventions are most effective for blocking each transmission mode. “Our goal is to create a new way to study the transmission of respiratory viruses that better mimics human settings and behaviors,” said Lakdawala. “We hope to translate observations from animals to child care centers during outbreaks of respiratory viruses including flu and coronaviruses to block the continuing spread of viruses among kids and to our communities.” Conventional animal model systems have not been effective at clearly differentiating among transmission routes. Therefore, the team’s engineering and aerosol experts have built a new system that incorporates tunable environmental parameters, ventilation rates, and detection sensors. Marr and Lakdawala have found in previous studies that the flu virus survives in aerosols across a wide range of ambient humidity. This project will extend those findings to ferrets by exploring the effects of humidity and temperature on modes of transmission. Researchers also will test interventions, such as humidifiers, air purifiers, ventilation rates, and simple engineering barriers, that could ultimately be translated to child care settings. In a project led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, a play space for ferrets with toys similar to those found in child care centers will be used to mimic environmental settings of human transmission.

According to Andrew Hashikawa at the University of Michigan, who co-leads this project with Emily Martin, children attending group child care are known to have high rates of acute respiratory illness due to their naïve immune systems. Their high susceptibility to infection makes these child care centers an important setting in which to evaluate respiratory illness-reducing interventions. The team will leverage the Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP), an ongoing illness surveillance network of regional childcare centers in the state of Michigan, and the Michigan Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation study (HIVE), which works with families to conduct ongoing active surveillance of viruses in the community. “We have shown that respiratory infections spread between children in child care centers, and these infections have major impacts on families,” said Martin, an associate professor of epidemiology at Michigan’s School of Public Health. “We believe that by developing interventions for the child care environment, we can reduce this transmission.” By studying the presence and quantity of virus detected on surfaces and in ambient air, the research team will compare classrooms with portable air cleaners, humidifiers, or improved ventilation to those without. “These three projects are strongly synergistic and will hopefully allow us to make a big leap in understanding transmission of the flu and how to reduce it,” said Marr. “Ultimately, we hope to reduce the impact of flu on human health and associated economic costs.” With this goal in mind, the MITIGATE FLU team will not only push forward strategies to stop the spread of flu each year but also provide a framework for the study of other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and coronaviruses.

The Detroit Zoo is moving birds inside as a proactive measure against bird flu. Raymond Boyd/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images CNN — The Detroit Zoological Society (DZS) says it is being proactive and moving birds at the Detroit Zoo inside due to concerns about avian influenza, which is highly contagious and deadly, according to the zoo. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed Thursday avian influenza virus was identified in a backyard flock of non-poultry birds in Kalamazoo County, which is about 140 miles west of Detroit. Similar infections have been reported across the United States in recent weeks. Workers at a checkpoint stand at an Iowa commercial poultry facility, reported to have been hit with a deadly strain of avian influenza which has forced poultry producers to kill off millions of birds in an attempt to stop the spread of the illness. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Avian Flu Fast Facts “This is an important preventative measure,” said Dr. Ann Duncan, director of animal health for the DZS. “By bringing these animals indoors, we can more closely monitor them and prevent contact with wild birds who may be carriers” of the virus. The virus can infect several species of birds, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OiE), including poultry. New cases of bird flu have appeared in more than 40 countries over the last six months, according to OiE. In the past few weeks, the USDA has identified the bird flu in Delaware, Maine, New York, Virginia and Kentucky. People in close contact with infected birds can contract the virus, but no human cases of the bird flu have been detected in the United States, according to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Credit: Hunter Desportes, Flickr Creative Commons. All Rights Reserved.ExpandMarch 1, 2022UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — The ongoing detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds and domestic flocks in several Eastern and Midwestern states is prompting urgent calls from Penn State poultry experts for flock owners — and others who may come into proximity to flocks — to step up their biosecurity practices. At risk is Pennsylvania's large poultry industry, the state's second largest agricultural sector with production valued at more than $1 billion annually. Pennsylvania is ranked fourth among states in egg production, and Lancaster County is among the top four counties nationally in sales of poultry and eggs. As of Feb. 28, the Eurasian H5N1 strain of avian flu had been confirmed in commercial poultry flocks in Delaware, Kentucky and Indiana; in small backyard or hobby flocks in Michigan, Virginia, Maine and New York; and in about 250 wild waterfowl in nine Eastern states that, like Pennsylvania, are part of the Atlantic flyway for migratory birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza, often abbreviated as HPAI, is a devastating disease that kills most poultry that become infected. The natural reservoir for all avian flu viruses, including the HPAI virus of current concern, is migratory waterfowl, which often do not develop symptoms. A 2014-15 outbreak of HPAI in the Midwest killed more than 50 million birds on commercial poultry farms, causing estimated losses of more than $1 billion. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture estimates that a major HPAI outbreak in the Keystone State could have a total economic impact of $13 billion, including a loss of jobs and wages. "No confirmed cases of this highly pathogenic H5N1 virus have been reported in Pennsylvania to date," said Gregory Martin, Penn State Extension poultry educator based in Lancaster County. "But with cases in surrounding states and in migratory birds traveling the Atlantic flyway, we should assume that the virus is present in our state." That means that all flock owners — whether they have two birds or 2 million — should have biosecurity precautions in place, according to John Boney, assistant professor of poultry science and Vernon E. Norris Faculty Fellow of Poultry Nutrition in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences. "Now is the time to revisit your biosecurity plan," said Boney, who serves as leader of Penn State Extension's poultry team. "If you don't have a biosecurity plan, it’s never too late to start one. Preventing the introduction and spread of this devastating disease is essential." The team advises flock owners and managers to review and enhance their biosecurity plans, while following these practices immediately: — Keep your poultry away from other birds. — Immediately clean up feed spills to avoid attracting wild birds on your premises. — Limit visitors to only those essential for business. Make sure all visitors follow your biosecurity plan. — Wear dedicated footwear and clothing while servicing your poultry to minimize the potential spread of the virus. — Sanitize boots, hands and tools before entering your flock premises. While Pennsylvania poultry owners prepare for a potential HPAI outbreak, Penn State's Animal Diagnostic Laboratory remains vigilant in monitoring for the disease. Rapid detection and diagnosis are critical for stopping the virus's spread. Part of the three-lab Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, the Penn State diagnostic lab in 2021 performed more than 90,000 tests for avian flu, a 20% increase over pre-COVID numbers. Patricia Dunn, clinical professor in veterinary and biomedical sciences and an avian pathologist in the lab, estimates that over her Penn State career, about 20% of her duties have been related to avian flu surveillance. "Luckily, most of the time results are negative, but that can change on a dime," she said. "Risk is quite high right now." Dunn noted that the lab routinely tests samples and birds every day because of Pennsylvania's robust avian influenza surveillance programs. "For example, all of our diagnostic cases of sick poultry, other than very young birds, are tested for avian flu, even if that is not high on our differential diagnoses list given the history and clinical signs in the case," she said. "Even cases presenting with mild egg production drops or slight decreases in feed and water consumption, but no overt illness, are tested for avian influenza. "Because low-pathogenic avian flu infections can present like many other diseases, we don’t want to miss these, either," she explained. "Some of those strains may mutate to HPAI if allowed to circulate in poultry undetected." Dunn said the Penn State lab has not investigated any suspected cases of HPAI in the state this year, "but we continue to be on the lookout."

Through her National Institute of Food and Agriculture-funded research project, Dr. Yuying Liang, with the UM College of Veterinary Medicine, developed eight vaccine candidates against highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. Research has shown that avian influenzas can mutate rapidly, and Liang said that this is a challenge to creating effective vaccines. “We do not know what strain or mutation of HPAI will appear or when it will appear,” Liang said. “Existing vaccines are unlikely to be effective in new outbreaks.” The key to reducing the spread of an HPAI outbreak is to have a targeted vaccine ready to deploy. “Our approach uses a live viral vector that would cause a strong and broadly protective immune response both in antibodies and T-cells,” she said. “Both are critical in creating a robust immune response.” Free viruses are ready to attack new cells. Antibodies can bind to these free viruses, blocking them from infecting new cells. Once viruses infect cells, antibodies cannot reach them. T-cells are needed to recognize and kill these virus-infected cells. The eight vaccine candidates are currently being tested on mice. Next research phase is to evaluate efficacy in a live animal. Supply chain issues caused by the pandemic slowed research progress. UM has patented and licensed Liang’s viral vector. “We were fortunate to receive NIFA funding to jump start our research,” Liang said. “This work has great potential for advances in both animal and human health.” USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service spearheads surveillance and education efforts on HPAI, while Agricultural Research Service scientists are researching effective ways to control the disease.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is currently posing a large burden on poultry and wild birds, globally. Since October 2021 there have been 1050 outbreaks of avian influenza A viruses reported in Africa, North America, Asia and Europe alone. These outbreaks affect poultry, wild birds and have consequences for humans. Following detection on poultry farms, millions of birds are culled which costs the sector millions if not billions of dollars. Furthermore, these outbreaks have had a devastating impact on wild birds; approximately 10 per cent of Svalbard breeding Barnacle Geese (Branta leucopsis) were found dead in the United Kingdom in January and around 8000 Eurasian (Common) Cranes (Grus grus) were found dead in Israel in December. Whilst avian influenza viruses do not normally infect humans, a number of zoonotic human cases have now been identified in China, Russia, and most recently in the UK, ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease. Global distribution of AIV observed from 1 October 2020-23 January 2022. Map from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations) Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) Global AIV with Zoonotic Potential situation updated (26 Jan 2022) In response to the unprecedented scale of these outbreaks, the National Avian Influenza Wild Bird (NAIWB) Steering Committee have released a technical issue update on the situation and risk to Australian poultry, wild birds and humans. Since 1976, there have been eight outbreaks due to HPAI in Australian poultry. The most recent outbreak occurred in 2020 in Victoria, resulting in approximately 500,000 poultry being culled. To date, all highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks have resulted from the spill-over of Australian wild bird strains of influenza into local poultry, with subsequent mutation into pathogenic variants. Importantly, Asian-lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have never been detected in Australian wild birds. Despite the intensity of ongoing outbreaks overseas, the risk to Australia remains low. However, increased awareness and vigilance by poultry producers and wildlife health professionals is advised as we know know that that wild birds import both Asian and north American lineage viruses to Australia, abet infrequently, and that our migratory birds are exposed to HPAI while in Asia. While wild birds are able to move these viruses around the globe, wild bird migration patterns are highly consistent. Specifically, long distance migratory birds are currently (Australian summer) found at their non-breeding areas, of which Australia is a key site for birds using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. As autumn approaches, wild birds will fly north towards their breeding areas in Siberia and Alaska. As such, there is currently low risk of importation of viruses from the Northern Hemisphere to Australia with southward migrating birds, however aberrations in bird migrations do happen. That is why the NAIWB surveillance program partners continue to collect and screen samples from Australian wild birds for avian influenza A viruses. I am a key partner to this program, and contribute to screening around 1000 samples from wild birds each year. In addition to long term surveillance, we have contributed to two large, multi-year studies. First, using more than 10,000 samples collected over 10 years and in collaboration with Professor Marcel Klaassen (Deakin University), we have identified the key reservoir species for avian influenza viruses in Australian wild birds which include key ducks and migratory shorebird species, and other key features dictating virus ecology such as rainfall. Second, in collaboration with government partners and the NAIWB surveillance partners, we have analysed all available genomics data to better appreciate patterns of virus introductions and circulating in Australia. We continue to do surveillance and research on avian influenza viruses in Australia as we still have much to learn about the factors that modulate patterns of influenza virus prevalence in wild birds, to identify incursions of overseas avian influenza viruses into Australia, and which factors dictate increased likelihood to spill over into poultry systems and potentially expose humans to these viruses News Archive 2024 January February March April May June July August September October November 2023 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2022 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2021 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2020 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2019 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2018 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2017 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2015 June July August October November December KEEP INFORMED Facebook Twitter Instagram Subscribe for the latest news, events and research For any media enquiries, please contact: Communications Team P: +61383441911 E: doherty-media@unimelb.edu.au Contact Us 792 Elizabeth Street Melbourne, 3000 Get Directions doherty-reception@unimelb.edu.au +61 3 9035 3555 Contact Us Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Keep informed Subscribe for the latest news, events and research First name Last name Email Subscribe We acknowledge the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation as the traditional custodians of the land where our Institute stands.

Osteopontin (OPN) is an essential regulator of cell death and immunity. However, the role and underlying mechanism of OPN in cell death in IAV-induced pulmonary injury remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that OPN-deficient (OPN−/−) mice were insensitive to IAV, exhibiting decreased viral loads and attenuated lung injury after IAV infection compared to those in wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, macrophage necroptosis was significantly reduced in OPN−/− mice infected with IAV compared to that in infected WT mice. OPN increased the expression of necroptosis-related genes and exacerbated macrophage necroptosis in IAV-infected THP1 cells. Notably, adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or OPN−/− BMDMs into mice restored resistance to influenza infection, and the rescue effect of OPN−/− BMDMs was better than that of WT BMDMs. Collectively, these results suggest that OPN deficiency in macrophages reduces necroptosis, which leads to a decrease in viral titers and protects against IAV infection. Therefore, OPN is a potential target for the treatment of IAV infection.

Due to frequent antigen variation and high IAV infection rate, it often causes pandemics. Although antiviral drugs make the clinical treatment of IAV infection possible, the emergence of drug-resistant mutants suggests that understanding novel targets and developing new therapeutics for IAV infections is essential. IAV is included in the Orthomyxoviridae family, members of which have a negative-sense, single-stranded segmented RNA genome [1, 2]. IAV infections have been reported to cause cell death in the lungs, leading to the activation of immune responses, which in turn, trigger acute respiratory disease [3, 4]. Previous studies have shown that programmed cell death pathways, especially apoptosis, play a vital role in IAV infection [5, 6]. Increasing evidence suggests that cells also undergo necroptosis, a caspase-independent cell death, after IAV entry [7,8,9]. Necroptosis is carried out by receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) [10,11,12]. Macrophages, innate immune cells capable of responding to IAV during the initial stage of infection, are the main immune barrier against IAV. Necroptosis in macrophages is closely related to the occurrence and development of several diseases [13,14,15,16]. For example, this process can directly lead to the formation of an atherosclerotic necrotic core and instability of plaques, thereby accelerating the process of atherosclerosis [17]. It has further been reported that necroptosis in lung macrophages is involved in the development of IAV-induced diseases [18, 19]. However, it is not clear which factors regulate necroptosis in alveolar macrophages during IAV infection. Osteopontin (OPN) is a major regulatory factor involved in cell death and immunity [20,21,22,23]. OPN plays an indispensable role in various diseases and processes, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammation [24,25,26]. Research has shown that OPN regulates gene expression within the immune system [27, 28]. In addition, OPN recruits macrophages to the lesion [29]. OPN influences the state of differentiation or activation of macrophages [30, 31]. Researchers found that the activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages was effectively inhibited by OPN silencing, which subsequently alleviated the inflammatory response and disease progression [30]. Moreover, OPN-induced M2-like polarization of macrophages promotes tumor growth and pathogen proliferation [32]. Furthermore, OPN can regulate the phagocytosis of macrophages [33, 34]. The literature data corroborated that FITC-dextran phagocytized by BMDM is significantly increased in the presence of OPN [33]. However, the role of OPN in IAV-induced macrophage necroptosis remains largely elusive and requires further study. Here, we define for the first time the contribution of necroptosis-related signaling to IAV-induced pneumonia using blood samples from IAV patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IAV-infected OPN−/− mice exhibited considerably decreased macrophage necroptosis in the lungs compared to that in IAV-infected WT mice. OPN−/− mice infected with IAV also showed decreased IAV replication in the lungs. Moreover, OPN knockdown decreased IAV replication by reducing virus-induced necroptosis in THP1 cells. Hence, studying the role of OPN in macrophage necroptosis is important in understanding the molecular mechanism of the occurrence and development of IAV-induced lung injury and exploring clinical therapeutic targets.ResultsPositive correlation between the expression of OPN and necroptosis-related genes in IAV patientsPrevious studies have established that OPN is closely related to the replication of hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, and HIV and progression of the subsequent diseases [35,36,37], but the relationship between OPN and IAV pathogenicity has not yet been clarified. Here, we collected samples from 82 healthy individuals and 85 IAV patients and performed real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. The data showed that OPN mRNA levels were significantly elevated in the blood samples of patients with IAV infection compared to those in the healthy control group (Fig. 1A). Necroptosis, a new type of programmed cell death, has been found to be involved in multiple tissue injuries [38,39,40]. Many studies have shown that Z-DNA binding protein 1 recognizes IAV RNA and activates RIPK3 [41], but whether OPN participates in necroptosis in IAV patients has not been reported. Here, we examined the mRNA levels of necroptosis-related genes in peripheral blood and observed a significant increase in RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL expression in IAV patients compared to that in healthy controls (Fig. 1B). In addition, we observed a strong positive association between OPN mRNA levels and RIPK3 or MLKL mRNA levels, but not with RIPK1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). Together, these observations suggest that OPN controls the activation of necroptosis in IAV patients.Fig. 1: Positive correlation between Osteopontin (OPN) levels and the levels of necroptosis-related genes in influenza A virus (IAV) patients.A OPN mRNA expression in blood samples from healthy control (HC, n = 82) and IAV patients (IAV, n = 85). B RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL mRNA expression in blood samples from healthy control and IAV patients. C Spearman correlation analysis of RIPK1, RIPK3, or MLKL mRNA levels with OPN mRNA levels. Data was analyzed by Student’s t test (two-tailed) and expressed as mean ± SEM. Spearman rank correlation was used to test for correlations.*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageOPN-deficient mice demonstrated moderate lung inflammation and injury after IAV infectionC57BL/6 mice were intranasally infected with IAV PR8 strain to establish an IAV-infected mouse model. We detected a significant upregulation of OPN protein in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) supernatants of WT mice following IAV infection (Fig. 2A). A similar phenotype was observed for OPN mRNA expression: expression was elevated in the lung homogenates at 24 h post infection (Fig. 2B). Similar to that in IAV patients, OPN expression was also upregulated in IAV-infected mice. We next used OPN-deficient (OPN−/−) mice to investigate the effect of OPN on IAV infection. After WT mice and OPN−/− mice were infected with IAV, lung tissues were obtained, and tissue sections were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histological analyses of infected lungs revealed that fewer alveolar regions were injured in OPN−/− mice compared to those in infected WT mice 24 h post-infection. Furthermore, infected OPN−/− mice showed fewer lung-infiltrating cells and a lighter thickening of the respiratory membrane than those in the infected WT mice (Fig. 2C). As expected, OPN−/− mice had lower serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 24 h post-infection than that in WT mice (Fig. 2D). In addition, we also detected the protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors in the BALF of mice 24 h after IAV infection. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) in BALF were all increased after IAV infection, but the increase in OPN−/− mice was less obvious than that in WT mice (Fig. 2E). Similarly, the mRNA levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the lung homogenates were lower in IAV-infected OPN−/− mice than in IAV-infected WT mice (Fig. 2F). These findings suggest that OPN aggravates pathological lung damage and inflammation induced by IAV infection. Next, we tested whether the decreased inflammation in mice with deficient OPN expression was associated with increased control of viral replication during IAV infection. As shown in Fig. 2G, the transcript levels of influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M) in OPN−/− mice after infection were significantly reduced compared to those in WT mice. We assessed the protein expression of NP in whole-lung tissues of mice after 24 h of infection using western blotting, and the results showed that the trend was similar to that of mRNA levels (Fig. 2H). These findings demonstrate that OPN deficiency contributes to decreased viral titers, reduced inflammation, and improved lung injury.Fig. 2: OPN deficiency reduces virus replication and decreases IAV-induced lung inflammation.A, B WT mice were infected with PR8 (1.5 × 103 PFU/animal).

H Lung homogenates were collected and subjected to western blot analysis. Each lane corresponds to an individual mouse. Lane-loading differences were normalized by levels of ACTIN.

The results suggest that RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL mRNA levels in the lung tissue samples from IAV-infected OPN−/− mice were significantly lower than those in IAV-infected WT mice (Fig. 3A). Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that at 24 h post infection, OPN−/− mice showed lower P-MLKL expression than that in WT mice (Fig. 3B). These findings showed that the upregulation of necroptosis-related factors induced by IAV infection is regulated by OPN levels, similar to that observed in IAV patients. Macrophages are critical for early control of viral replication [42]. To evaluate whether macrophages play an important role in IAV infection, we administered clodronate liposomes intraperitoneally to WT mice to eliminate macrophages in vivo (Fig. 3C). Histological results revealed that lung injury regions in macrophage-depleted mice were significantly increased compared to those in non-depleted mice 24 h post infection (Fig. 3D). Serum LDH levels were also markedly higher in macrophage-depleted mice after infection than in non-depleted mice (Fig. 3E). To investigate whether aggravated lung damage in infected macrophage-depleted mice was related to virus replication, we measured the expression level of influenza NP. Western blot results showed that NP levels were higher in IAV-infected macrophage-depleted mice than in IAV-infected non-depleted mice (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that macrophages play an important role in viral clearance during IAV infection. More importantly, IAV-induced necroptosis was considerably reduced after macrophage clearance, indicating that most of the cells undergoing necroptosis in the lung were macrophages (Fig. 3F). Previous studies have reported that cell death is one of the most common causes of decreased cell numbers [43, 44]. Moreover, we found that OPN regulates necroptosis and viral replication (Figs. 1C and 3A, B). Therefore, we explored whether OPN regulates macrophage necroptosis to control virus clearance. We obtained alveolar macrophages from the BALF of the mice in the four groups and performed western blot analysis. The P-MLKL level was significantly decreased in alveolar macrophages from IAV-infected OPN−/− mice compared to that in IAV-infected WT mice (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that IAV infection triggers macrophage necroptosis and that OPN deficiency attenuates IAV-induced macrophage necroptosis to restrict IAV replication and lung damage.Fig. 3: OPN promotes IAV-induced macrophage necroptosis in the lung.A, B WT and OPN−/− mice were infected with PR8 (1.5 × 103 PFU/animal). Analysis was performed on data collected 24 h post infection. A mRNA levels of necroptosis-related genes (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL) in lung homogenates were measured using qPCR.

The results showed that THP1 cells secreted OPN without stimulation, and OPN increased remarkably at the mRNA and protein levels after IAV infection (Fig. 4A, B). Next, we infected THP1 cells with recombinant PR8 expressing GFP and found that THP1 cells could phagocytize viruses (Fig. 4C). We subsequently demonstrated that IAV induced necroptosis-related gene expression in macrophages. IAV infection of THP1 cells resulted in an increase in RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL mRNA levels and P-MLKL protein levels in a time-dependent manner most significantly at 24 h (Fig. S1 and Fig. 4D). To further explore the role of OPN in macrophage necroptosis, we silenced OPN-associated genes in THP1 cells using OPN-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), with a silencing efficiency of approximately 75% (Fig. 4E). The knockdown of OPN in THP1 cells markedly decreased necroptosis-related molecules at the gene expression and protein levels after IAV infection compared to those with control siRNA (Fig. 4F, G). These results indicated that OPN promoted IAV-induced macrophage necroptosis. Similarly, OPN knockdown macrophages infected with IAV exhibited significantly lower viral loads than those in control macrophages infected with IAV (Fig. 4G, H). Collectively, these findings were validated when macrophages were treated with OPN-specific siRNA, further implicating the role of OPN in promoting macrophage necroptosis during IAV infection.Fig. 4: OPN knockdown inhibits necroptosis in THP1 cells infected with IAV.PMA was added to the THP1 culture for 24 h to stimulate THP1 cells adherence and differentiation into macrophage-like cells.

Bone marrow-derived cells from WT mice or OPN−/− mice were isolated and stimulated to differentiate into BMDMs by administering granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. Subsequently, we transferred WT or OPN−/− BMDMs intranasally into WT recipient mice. One day after transfer, macrophages were colonized in the lungs of mice, and the mice were then challenged with IAV. One day post-infection, lung tissues of mice in the different groups were obtained (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, the adoptive transfer of BMDMs restored the resistance of mice to IAV, and milder inflammation and tissue damage was seen in mice that received OPN−/− BMDMs than in the mice that received WT BMDMs. To further evaluate whether the transfer of BMDMs affected IAV-induced pulmonary inflammation, qPCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors in whole-lung tissues of mice. Transcript levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and IFN-γ in mice that received OPN−/− BMDMs decreased after IAV infection compared to those in mice that received WT BMDMs (Fig. 5C). We performed immunofluorescent staining for P-MLKL on lung tissues and observed that the staining intensity of P-MLKL was significantly lower in mice receiving OPN−/− BMDMs than in mice receiving WT BMDMs (Fig. 5D). Moreover, the viral NP level in mice receiving OPN−/− BMDMs was lower than that in mice receiving WT BMDMs, which may depend on the resistance of OPN−/− BMDMs to necroptosis (Fig. 5E). Thus, these results establish that macrophages play an indispensable role in IAV infection and that OPN−/− BMDMs can better protect against IAV infection than WT BMDMs. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that IAV induces the expression of OPN, which promotes IAV-induced macrophage necroptosis to increase IAV replication and lung damage.Fig. 5: Adoptive transfer of OPN−/− BMDM reduces tissue injury in mice induced by subsequent PR8 infection.A–E WT or OPN−/− BMDMs were intranasally transferred to WT recipient mice.

We found that OPN-deficient macrophages alleviate lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting necroptosis during IAV infection. The knockdown of OPN expression in THP1 cells further decreased necroptosis and reduced virus copies after IAV infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence of the role of OPN in IAV-induced necroptosis.Recent studies have reported that IAV induces necroptosis in IAV-infected mouse models. However, changes in necroptosis in patients with IAV have not been investigated. Here, we analyzed the expression levels of necroptosis-related genes in blood samples from healthy individuals and IAV patients and found that RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL mRNA levels in IAV patients were higher than those in the control group. Moreover, we demonstrated that OPN levels were positively correlated with RIPK3 and MLKL levels. These data suggest that OPN may have a beneficial effect on necroptosis during clinical IAV infection. OPN−/− mice were used to determine the role of OPN in IAV-induced lung injury. The results showed that IAV-infected OPN−/− mice had lower inflammatory factor expression and less viral replication than in IAV-infected WT mice. Our data establish that OPN deficiency protects mice from IAV-induced pneumonia. In addition, we found that RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL mRNA levels and P-MLKL protein levels in the lung tissues of IAV-infected OPN−/− mice were decreased compared to those in IAV-infected WT mice, further emphasizing that OPN regulates necroptosis after IAV infection.The role of macrophages in IAV infection remains unclear. Although macrophages seem to play a crucial role in the early antiviral response against IAV infection [45, 46], some studies have shown that macrophages significantly contribute to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis through the release of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands during IAV infection [6]. Our findings strongly suggest that macrophages promote virus clearance in the early stages of IAV infection. These results were consistently emphasized by increased viral loads, aggravated lung damage, and inflammation in macrophage-depleted mice. Moreover, the adoptive transfer of BMDMs restored the resistance of mice to IAV. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that macrophages may be the first immune cells in the lungs to encounter IAV, acting as guardians in the early stages of infection. Notably, the activation of IAV-induced P-MLKL decreased significantly after macrophage depletion, indicating that macrophages accounted for most of the P-MLKL expression after infection, helping them to undergo necroptosis. We further determined that macrophage necroptosis increased significantly after IAV infection by obtaining purified pulmonary macrophages and detecting P-MLKL levels. In vitro necroptosis of THP1 cells was also examined.The role of necroptosis in the occurrence and development of viral infectious diseases is controversial. Although some studies claim that necroptosis participates in virus clearance [8], other studies have suggested that it also leads to lung injury [47]. Our results suggest that macrophage necroptosis aggravates IAV-induced lung injury. Given our observation on the participation of OPN during IAV infection of macrophages, we sought to elucidate the role of OPN in IAV infection. In the THP1 cells, OPN knockdown decreased the mRNA expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, as well as the protein level of P-MLKL, after IAV infection. In addition, mice that received OPN−/− BMDMs had less lung damage than that in the mice that received WT BMDMs, showing that OPN−/− BMDMs were not sensitive to necroptosis. The in vivo and in vitro results indicate that OPN reduces virus clearance and aggravates lung inflammation by inducing macrophage necroptosis.Previous studies have shown that necroptosis of AECs prevents infected cells from becoming “factories” for virus replication [8, 48]. In this study, we detected the expression of necroptosis-related genes in whole-lung and alveolar macrophages but did not examine the effect of necroptosis of AECs on virus replication. Therefore, further studies should isolate AECs and alveolar macrophages to detect the expression level of necroptosis-related molecules and more strictly exclude the influence of AECs. In addition, to be more certain that the results obtained in our in vivo studies depended on necroptosis, MLKL knockout mice or MLKL inhibitors should be used to inhibit necroptosis. In summary, our data indicated that OPN regulates macrophage necroptosis. However, further investigation is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which OPN promotes macrophage necroptosis, contributing to increased lung injury and inflammation during IAV infection. Regulation of OPN expression may, therefore, be a new strategy for the treatment of IAV patients.Materials/subjects and methodsHuman samplesHuman blood samples from IAV infected patients and healthy controls were obtained from donors with their informed consent. From 2018 to 2019, 85 IAV infected patients and 82 healthy controls were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University. All patients were confirmed to be IAV-positive by detecting throat swabs with specific probes and primers.Animal experimentsMice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility of The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University and all experiments on animals were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University. 6–8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Hangzhou Ziyuan Laboratory Animal CO.

But as that flu pandemic dragged on, there was widespread confusion over when to rescind mask mandates—much like the country has seen two years into the COVID-19 pandemic.Photograph by Paul Thompson, Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesHISTORY & CULTURECORONAVIRUS COVERAGEThe lessons learned from 1918 flu fatigue, according to historiansMore than a century ago, exhausted Americans just wanted to forget about two years of lockdowns and mask mandates—but experts warn against repeating history.ByEmily MartinMarch 4, 2022•11 min readTwo decades after surviving an influenza pandemic that devastated the United States, Katherine Anne Porter recounted her experiences in one of the best-known accounts of the period—the 1939 novella Pale Horse, Pale Rider.In her story, Porter describes how many young people felt as though their lives were threatened by the dual strike of a deadly virus and World War I. Miranda, the main character, recovers from influenza, but sinks into depression as she attempts to rejoin society. The novella ends on a note of optimism, however, where Miranda dreams of a world with no war and no more plague, and she’d have time for “everything.”Historians say it’s unclear when the 1918 flu actually did end—and that’s partly because Americans were as tired of the flu as they are now after two years of COVID-19. Although cases continued to spike in 1920 and beyond, much of the historical record of the pandemic is from its first two years. Porter’s novella is one of the few written accounts of its enduring trauma and formal efforts to document the disease ultimately failed because Americans in the early 20th century simply wanted to forget the flu.Similarly, two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, fatigue has grown—alongside arguments about when to loosen public health measures like mask and vaccine mandates. But historian Nancy Bristow, who wrote about the novella in her book American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic, says that while going back to a pre-pandemic normal may be appealing, history shows it could have harmful implications both for this pandemic—and the next one.“That drive to not have to do what we’ve been doing carries with it a great potential to forget,” she says. “The ways in which Americans continue to think that these kinds of things won’t happen to us, that kind of American exceptionalism, you can only do that if you are a nation that is very, very capable of forgetting moments of its past.”Fatigue sets in over public health measuresFlu historians like Bristow point out that these two pandemics can’t quite be neatly compared. The world was dramatically different in the early 20th century—war was widespread, there were no influenza vaccines, and the U.S. didn’t have as robust a health care infrastructure to care for those who fell ill then. The virus also targeted younger populations and the pandemic response wasn’t politicized nearly as much as it has been now.But there are some similarities. During the early waves of the 1918 flu, there was a patchwork of public health responses from states and local authorities—and the outcomes of their various approaches to flattening the curve was clear. Cities like New York that implemented public health measures early had low death rates. Meanwhile, cities like Philadelphia that waited to implement health measures—and those like San Francisco that relaxed their measures too early—had higher death rates. (Here’s how U.S. cities flattened the curve during the 1918 flu pandemic.)Then, like now, there was also confusion about when to change or relax measures, says Thomas Ewing, a historian based at Virginia Tech. In Denver, Colorado, officials rescinded their mask mandate in November 1918 when the first outbreak of influenza had tapered down, but then a second wave hit the city, causing many to question if the mandate should be reinstated.“In both pandemics, there’s been a lot of confusion, there’s been uncertainty, there’s been resistance, there’s been conflicting, contradictory recommendations,” Ewing says.U.S. Naval Hospital corpsmen wear masks to attend patients in the influenza ward on Mare Island in California. Hospitals were also understaffed in the 1918 pandemic—but it was largely due to World War I. Today, there are few accounts of the adversity health-care workers faced.AlamyFor example, in December 1918, the U.S. Public Health Service—the government agency in charge of the pandemic response—worried that the public was relaxing its attitude toward the pandemic despite resurgences. In response, the Surgeon General issued a reminder to take precautions like masking and social distancing.At the time, plenty of individual people flouted mask mandates but there wasn’t much organized opposition to masking. One exception was the Anti-Mask League in San Francisco, which was formed in early 1919 after the city reinstated a mask mandate a mere two months after lifting it. The league held at least one public meeting with nearly 2,000 attendees to denounce the ordinance, according to the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine’s Influenza Encyclopedia.Bristow says that most of the pushback to public health measures was largely economic rather than political. Some city public health officials and politicians pointed to one another’s policies to curry favor in midterm elections, but the debates were largely over details like whether to reopen businesses before churches, rather than opposition to the measures as a whole.Still, as the influenza pandemic dragged on, public health interventions became even patchier. Masking policies were rescinded even as the country continued to see occasional spikes in cases—including when several cities recorded death rates in 1920 comparable to the first wave in 1918. Then, like now, there was some resistance to bringing back public health measures, like mask mandates.But by the end of 1920, the influenza pandemic had begun to ebb. Although the nation saw yet another small wave of cases and deaths in 1922, there was far less attention paid to those deaths because, unlike COVID-19, historians say that the influenza pandemic hadn’t been in the headlines every day for years. Meanwhile, physicians and public health experts also expressed optimism that future bouts would be less severe.Bristow wonders if resistance to public health measures would have grown to the extent the U.S. has seen in the COVID-19 pandemic had they been allowed to continue.You May Also LikeHISTORY & CULTURENearly 80 years after World War II, their voices recall the struggleHISTORY & CULTUREThe harrowing story of the photo that defined D-Day—and how it was almost lostHISTORY & CULTURESee powerful images of D-Day, 80 years later“Here we’re seeing that played out,” she says of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Americans don’t like to be told what to do.”Fatigue leads to forgettingLiving with the constant worry of catching influenza during the early waves of the disease had proven taxing on society. Like Porter’s novella, blues songs from the era mourned the catastrophic scale and powerful impact the influenza pandemic had on American lives. One of the best known was Essie Jenkins’ “1919 Influenza Blues,” whose chorus lamented the virus killed the rich and poor, and would kill even more people as part of God’s plan.That narrative resonated with those suffering the most from the pandemic, whose lives were remade by the experience.But as the pandemic began to ebb, others began to feel an optimism for the future, and longed to move past it. Historians say this may be why formal efforts to research the causes of the pandemic and take steps to prevent the next one ultimately failed.In the first year of the influenza pandemic, there was every indication that the U.S. Congress would do just that. Lawmakers at the state and federal level were concerned about future outbreaks and the public clamored for them to act. In 1919, Congress introduced a Flu, or Anti-Flu, Bill, which would have appropriated roughly $5 million for the investigation of the epidemic, with an eye to preventing future outbreaks.Customers get a trim at an open-air barbershop in Berkeley, California in 1919. Businesses closed for shorter and less frequent periods during the 1918 pandemic compared to today, but ventilation was still emphasized as an important way to avoid infection from the virus. AlamyThe law, however, soon lost steam. By 1920, the amount lowered to $250,000 as politicians objected to sending more funds to the U.S. Public Health Service—which was largely seen as having failed. Ultimately, no appropriation was made, which Nichols says “is part of the larger takeaway that the U.S. did not enact meaningful public health changes in the wake of the pandemic.”Likewise, the scientific community couldn’t sustain efforts to investigate the virus that caused the influenza pandemic. In 1922, an editorial published in the Journal of the American Medical Association argued that there was a need to continue this research. While some scientists remained dedicated to that cause, by 1925, another editorial in the same journal noted that the “intense general interest in influenza … died down rather quickly.”Nichols argues the country could have learned lessons about the importance of providing social safety nets and addressing health care inequities had it followed through on this research. Marginalized communities were at higher risk of dying from influenza in 1918 just as they are now with COVID-19—and yet there remain gaps in the country’s health care infrastructure that leaves them vulnerable to disease.Ewing agrees. He notes there was little attention to these vulnerabilities in 1918—but in 2020, the research is overwhelming, especially now as the lingering effects of COVID-19 start to manifest.Will we return to normal?The good news, Bristow says, is that it seems there’s one lesson the country has learned from the 1918 influenza pandemic and that’s in record-keeping.There is very little historical record or archival information from 1918. There was no real attempt to memorialize those who died in the 1918 pandemic because people just wanted to get past the trauma. Bristow says she had to sift through primary accounts from journals and newspaper headlines to write her 2017 book.That seems not to be the case this time around. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, libraries, historical societies, and local organizations began working to collect any and all records. Those records include individual testimonies, as well as efforts to find out how entire communities have been affected through interviews with grocery store workers, volunteer COVID-19 testers, children and their parents grappling with virtual learning, and more. There have also been a few temporary memorials to honor the victims of COVID-19.That attention to collecting records could be useful for making policies in the future that could help the country cope with the inevitable next pandemic. Or it could just collect dust if Americans again want the trauma from the pandemic to disappear from memory.Ewing predicts the strong desire to get past the pandemic will translate to a lack of commemoration or change, but Bristow tends towards optimism.“No one has escaped completely unscathed,” she says. “But will that make us more humane with one another, more caring of one another? My hope is that trauma that everyone has experienced at some level will make for a more robust reckoning in the aftermath than we saw in 1918.”Related TopicsHISTORIANSEPIDEMICSINFLUENZAWORLD WAR IIWARMASKSYou May Also LikeSCIENCEShould you be concerned about bird flu in your milk?HISTORY & CULTUREFrom the pages of Vogue to WWII battlefields—who was photographer Lee Miller?HISTORY & CULTUREThe incredible details 'Masters of the Air' gets right about WWIIHISTORY & CULTUREEverything we thought we knew about the ancient Maya is being upendedHISTORY MAGAZINEPearl Harbor was the only WWII attack on the U.S., right?

This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and factors influencing imported RIDs, with the goal of providing evidence to support adoption of high-tech, intelligent methods to early find imported RIDs and prevent their spread in China.MethodsWe obtained data of imported RIDs cases from 2014 to 2018 from the Inbound Sentinel Network of Customs and the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System in China. We analyzed spatial, temporal, and population distribution characteristics of the imported RIDs. We developed an index to describe seasonality. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between independent variables and imported cases. Data analyses and visualizations were conducted with R software.ResultsFrom a total of 1 409 265 253 inbound travelers, 31 732 (2.25/100 000) imported RIDs cases were reported. RIDs cases were imported from 142 countries and five continents. The incidence of imported RIDs was nearly 5 times higher in 2018 (2.81/100 000) than in 2014 (0.58/100 000). Among foreigners, incidence rates were higher among males (5.32/100 000), 0–14-year-olds (15.15/100 000), and cases originating in Oceania (11.10/100 000). The vast majority (90.3%) of imported RIDs were influenza, with seasonality consistent with annual seasonality of influenza. The spatial distribution of imported RIDs was different between Chinese citizens and foreigners. Increases in inbound travel volume and the number of influenza cases in source countries were associated with the number of imported RIDs.ConclusionsOur study documented importation of RIDs into China from 142 countries. Inbound travel poses a significant risks bringing important RIDs to China. It is urgent to strengthen surveillance at customs of inbound travelers and establish an intelligent surveillance and early warning system to prevent importation of RIDs to China for preventing further spread within China.Graphical Abstract BackgroundGlobalization, increasing air travel, and greater population mobility facilitate inter-regional spread of infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) [1, 2]. In 2018, there were 1.4 billion international trips, 10% of which involved Chinese citizens [3]. Increased population mobility leads to more rapid and higher volume cross-border spread of infectious diseases [1]. The 1918 influenza pandemic spread by sea and land, but its international spread was slower than cross-border spread of infectious diseases is today. Indeed, infectious diseases can traverse the globe within a single day [4,5,6]. More attention should be paid to surveillance, early warning, prevention, and control of cross-border spread of infectious diseases.Since the twentieth century, EIDs, especially severe acute respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs), occur constantly and have had an enormous impact on human health and social development [2]. Rapid development of human societies, convenient transportation, and frequent international exchanges have accelerated cross-border spread of RIDs, posing significant challenges to their prevention and control. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and spread to other countries through travel of infectious MERS cases. As of April 26, 2016, 1728 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases had been reported in 27 countries [7]. In 2015, Guangdong Province reported their first imported MERS case—imported from the Republic of Korea—but Guangdong’s rapid response and control avoided onward spread and outbreaks of MERS [8, 9].Over recent decades, several international studies evaluated the relationship between population mobility and spread of infectious diseases [10,11,12]. Two studies of travel-related infections, based on long-term surveillance data analysis, described the epidemiology of imported infections [13,14,15]. However, detailed epidemiological characteristics and influencing factors for imported RIDs in China have not been further explored and analyzed. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics and factors related to imported RIDs in China, with the goal of promoting use of high-tech methods to rapidly detect and prevent importation of key RIDs to China.MethodsData collection and resourcesWe obtained imported RIDs surveillance data and inbound traveler data, reported between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018, from the entry–exit sentinel network of customs (EESNC), which consists of 272 quarantine sentry points in the 31 provinces of mainland China [13], and from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) [16]. Imported RIDs cases were classified into Chinese citizen or foreigner based on documented nationality. We obtained data on 430 imported RIDs cases from 48 countries from NNDRS, and data on 31 302 imported RIDs cases from 140 countries from EESNC. Analyzed variables included gender, age, nationality, disease, time of importation, country of origin, province, entrance way, travel purpose, detection method, and main symptoms. Imported RIDs case data from the EESNC and NNDRS are routine surveillance data that were used under license for our study; all case data were anonymized.We downloaded global influenza weekly surveillance data of 174 countries for January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018, from FluNet (https://www.who.intools/flunet) [17] to analyze the correlation between the number of reported influenza cases in source countries and the number of imported cases in China analyzing with data from EESNC and NNDRS.Statistics on gender, age, and continent of origin of foreign nationals from 25 countries and regions traveling to China each year were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook (http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/Statisticaldata/AnnualData) [18]. However, the incidence of imported RIDs from Chinese travelers by gender, age, and continent could not be calculated because this information was not available on inbound Chinese travelers.Data management and quality controlTwo research staff unified criteria and definitions of the data elements in the data bases. Imported RIDs information came from linkage of EESNC and NNDRS; duplicates were removed. Because influenza accounts for more than 90% of the total imported RIDs, we evaluated the relation between imported influenza RIDs and region of origin. We made a scatter plot for the continents of origin using imported influenza data and annual influenza surveillance report data from source countries.Statistical analysisImported RIDs incidence per 100 000 travelers was estimated as the number of imported cases divided by the number of inbound travelers during a given time period. A seasonal index of imported RIDs was calculated by dividing the number of imported respiratory infections per month by the average number of imported RIDs per year. A seasonal index greater than 1 indicates that the number of imported RIDs in a given month was higher than the monthly average. We used a radar chart of the monthly seasonal index of imported RIDs to show seasonal distribution characteristics. Continuous variables were summarized as medians and ranges, and categorical variables were summarized as numbers and percentages. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between independent variables and imported infections. Data analysis and visualization were conducted with R version 4.0.5 (https://www.r-project.org/), using tidyverse, reshape2, RColorBrewer, lubridate, and basic R packages.ResultsGeneral characteristicsFrom 2014 to 2018, approximately 1409.27 million passengers entered mainland China by a variety of legal routes; 87.6% of the enterers were Chinese citizens and 12.4% were foreign nationals. During these 5 years, 31 732 imported RIDs cases were reported—an incidence of 2.25 RIDs cases per 100 000 international travelers entering China. The imported RID incidence in 2018 (2.81/100 000) was nearly 5 times that in 2014 (0.58/100 000). The imported RID incidence among foreigners (4.21/100 000) was higher than among Chinese citizens (1.97/100 000). Among foreigners, the incidence was highest in males (5.32/100 000), in 0‒14-year-olds (15.15/100 000), and in travelers from Oceania (11.10/100 000). The average age of the 20 758 (65.4% of RIDs) males importing RIDs was older than that of females importing RIDs [male median age: 34, interquartile range (IQR): 21‒48; female median age: 28, IQR: 11‒44]. Twenty-seven types of RIDs were detected, including influenza (90.3%), rhinovirus (3.2%), and others (6.5%) (Tables 1, Table 2, Fig. 1).Table 1 Characteristics of 31 732 imported respiratory infectious diseases cases in China, 2014–2018Full size tableTable 2 Incidence of imported respiratory infectious diseases in China, 2014–2018Full size tableFig. 1The number and incidence of imported respiratory infectious diseases among inbound foreigners by A gender, B age group, C continent, and D yearFull size imageSpatial distributionRIDs were imported from 142 countries and five continents, mostly Asian (52.8%), with entry along the developed coastal border areas of China. Most RIDs imported by Chinese citizens were imported from Thailand (14.1%), the Republic of Korea (7.9%), Japan (7.2%), and Singapore (4.2%). Most RIDs imported by foreign nationals were imported from the Republic of Korea (12.8%), Japan (10.4%), Vietnam (7.6%), and the Philippines (5.9%). Guangdong Province had the highest number of imported cases, followed by Jiangsu Province, and Shanghai (Figs. 1, 2).Fig. 2Spatial distribution of original countries and imported provinces in (A) Chinese and (B) foreignersFull size imageTemporal distributionFrom 2014 to 2017, the month with the most imported RIDs was July, with seasonal indices ranging from 2.79 to 9.97. In contrast, in 2018, the months with most imported RIDs were January–March (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Temporal distribution of imported respiratory infectious diseases from 2014 to 2018.

B Change of the seasonal indices of imported RIDs by month from 2014 to 2018Full size imageCorrelation analysisThe Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of imported cases and inbound travel volume was 0.775 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.547 to 0.896]. A linear relationship was observed from the scatter plot, and a best-fit line was calculated using the least-squares method. By simple linear regression, the slope of the regression line was 0.441, implying that the average annual increase of imported RIDs cases was 0.441 per 10 000 foreigners entering China. The simple linear regression model explained 58.3% of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.583); the regression model was statistically significant, F(1,23) = 34.5, P < 0.001 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The relationship between the number of imported influenza cases and the number of inbound travelers among foreignersFull size imageThe number of imported influenza cases increased with increases of influenza reports from source countries. Importation epidemiologic characteristics varied by continent. Asian countries imported the most influenza cases to China, but the number of influenza cases reported by Asian countries was relatively low (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Scatter plot of the number of influenza cases in the original countries and the number of imported influenza casesFull size imageDiscussionRespiratory infectious diseases have a huge impact on the health of people around the world. With increasing globalization, social, economic, cultural, and population exchanges across countries worldwide are increasing, and the prevention and control of RID cross-border transmission is facing significant challenges [19, 20]. We described the epidemiological characteristics of imported RIDs to China during 2014–2018, and showed that number of imported RIDs cases was positively correlated with the number of inbound travelers and the number of influenza cases in source countries. Influenza accounted for the majority of imported RIDs and showed seasonality that was consistent with influenza seasonality. The spatial distribution of imported RIDs was different between Chinese citizens and foreign nationals. Among inbound foreigners, the incidence of imported RIDs was higher in males, 0–14-year-olds, and people from Oceania. The number of imported RIDs increased with increasing inbound travel volume and increasing number of influenza cases in source countries. We believe the findings can help improve surveillance and early warning of imported RIDs, promote joint prevention and control of infectious diseases among countries with a high burden of RIDs, and protect the health and safety of people around the world.Other researchers have found differences in the incidence of travel-related infectious diseases by gender and age group [21, 22]. The differences are related to type of infectious disease, population characteristics, and destination of travel [22]. In our study, males and 0–14 year-olds were at greater risk of importing RIDs, consistent with previous studies [23,24,25,26]. Most travelers are male and may be more susceptible to RIDs due to risk behaviors and habits during travel. Children may be more vulnerable to respiratory infections because of a lack of adequate protection from infectious diseases and lower immunity than adults [27]. Most children have been infected with at least one influenza virus by the age of six [28]. Children infected with influenza during travel will increase the risk of infection in their parents and other relatives. Influenza risk can be reduced by vaccination in advance of travel [29].We observed seasonal fluctuation of imported RIDs, and such seasonality may be affected by several factors—for example, international travel on holidays and seasonality of RIDs in originating areas [30]. There is more international travel during holidays. The Chinese traditional Spring Festival in January and February and summer vacation for Chinese students abroad from July to August lead to large, temporary increases in international travel that can promote cross-border spread of RIDs. Influenza accounted for the majority of imported RIDs, and the seasonality of influenza imported to China was similar to influenza seasonality in Asian source countries. RIDs import peaked in January–March 2018, which was different timing than from 2014–2017. This unusual timing may have been related to the 2018 spring influenza pandemic in northern hemisphere countries [31].Travel volume is a key factor influencing the number of imported RIDs cases [32, 33]. Passengers who contracted an infectious disease before or during travel spread the infectious diseases to another country by cross-border travel. Generally, the risk of imported infectious diseases increases with increasing passenger volume. A previous study of the cross-border transmission of H1N1 showed a significantly increased risk of importing H1N1 from countries that received more than 1400 passengers from endemic countries [34]. Travel volumes, especially air travel volume data, are often used as an important variable for estimating the risk of infectious disease importation under certain conditions [35]. It has been reported that scientific travel restrictions can effectively curb the transboundary spread of infectious diseases in the emerging and reemerging infectious diseases outbreaks—a phenomenon that has been confirmed by the practice of combating infectious diseases in recent years [36,37,38,39].The number of imported cases is associated with the number of reported cases in source countries, which is likely related to the prevalence of the disease and population of the source country [40]. In general, the higher the prevalence of infectious diseases in a source country, the higher risk of importation into neighboring countries. However, to assess risk of importing cases, a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of RIDs in the importing countries is required, taking into account factors such as travel restrictions, cultural practices, social environment, distance traveled, transportation, and purpose of travel. We found that the average number of reported influenza cases in Asian countries of origin was lower than those in the Americas and Europe, but Asia had the highest number of imported cases. Travel volume variables can explain some of the variation, but some factors affecting the importation of infectious diseases require further study.In order to assess and predict the risk of importation, investigators have developed statistical models based on data related to importation, such as international flights information, the epidemiology of selected diseases, and demographic information of source countries [41, 42]. Given the preconditions of these models, it is usually assumed that all residents have the same chance of infection and that all infected people have the same chance of boarding an outbound flight. However, this assumption may be unrealistic, leading to observed differences between predicted results of a model and the actual situation. Therefore, additional factors influencing imported infectious diseases should be further studied and incorporated into predictive model analyses.We believe that there are additional factors affecting the epidemiology of imported RIDs that are in need of further exploration. For example, vaccination status influences imported RIDs. Environmental changes in temperature, humidity, air pollution, and sun exposure may influence RIDs spread [43]. Travel duration is often considered as a critical factor of imported RIDs. Since the data used in our study were mainly from EESNC and NNIDRS, it is possible to lose some information in our study and might lead to inexactly calculated incidence of imported RIDs.ConclusionsImported respiratory infectious diseases incidence increased from 2014 to 2018. Gender, age, continent, inbound passenger volume, and the number of reported cases in source countries were associated with the incidence of imported RIDs. With annual increases in international travel, the potential risk of RIDs spread to China rises accordingly. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen surveillance at customs for inbound travelers and establish an intelligent surveillance and warning system for imported RIDs to early find and prevent the RIDs from spreading to China. The health and safety of people around the world will be more effectively protected if infectious diseases are controlled in their countries of origin. It is therefore vital for the international community to support prevention and control of important RIDs for countries having limited resources.

We optimized and validated a highly sensitive RT-PCR based multiplex-assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses in a single-test. This study evaluated clinical specimens (n = 1411), 1019 saliva and 392 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), tested using two-assays: FDA-EUA approved SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets N and ORF1ab gene, and the PKamp-RT-PCR based assay that targets SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses A and B. Of the 1019 saliva samples, 17.0% (174/1019) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with the multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [91.9% (160/174) vs. 87.9% (153/174)], respectively. Of the 392 NPS samples, 10.4% (41/392) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with the multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [97.5% (40/41) vs. 92.1% (39/41)], respectively. This study presents clinical validation of a multiplex-PCR assay for testing SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses, using NPS and saliva samples, and demonstrates the feasibility of implementing the assay without disrupting the existing laboratory workflow.

Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the region of Wuhan, China, 77,343,652 confirmed cases with over 1,702,293 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported globally (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, last accessed December 21, 2020). In an attempt to curtail the spread of the disease, testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the single most important measure. Substantial emergency policy changes as well as state-sponsored funding have facilitated implementation of testing for the virus in the USA and around the world1,2. However, due to the diversion of personnel, resources, and supplies to SARS-CoV-2 testing, the testing of viral pathogens that normally cause seasonal respiratory tract infections has been marginalized. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. The Global Burden of Disease (2017) data has demonstrated that influenza contributed 11.5% of the total lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), leading to over 9 million hospitalizations and 145,000 deaths across all age groups in a single calendar year3. Further, co-infection with bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens has been associated with disease severity and death in the current pandemic. A report originating from Wuhan, China, identified that 80% of COVID-19 patients had co-infection with at least one respiratory pathogen, with the most common being influenza viruses A and B (60% and 53.30% respectively)4. The neglect of these co-circulating pathogens, especially influenza A and B viruses has generated serious public health gaps both at a clinical and epidemiological level. The potential impact of co-circulating respiratory viral pathogens during the ongoing influenza season is of major concern at both local and international public health levels. Further, with the COVID-19 vaccination already in use, testing for pathogens, especially the influenza viruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2, is already becoming the next diagnostic testing emergency.We must remain cognizant of the fact that the pandemic has caused a significant change in routine clinical diagnostic laboratories at the level of re-directing workflow, workforce, supplies, and validating new diagnostic tests5. It is only in the last few months that laboratories have streamlined testing for SARS-CoV-2, and therefore shifting to a new workflow and implementing new diagnostic tests, would only unsettle the already exhausted laboratory staff. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we have optimized and validated a highly sensitive RT-PCR based multiplex assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses in a single test, using the same workflow, instruments, sample types, supplies, and laboratory personnel currently utilized for SARS-CoV-2 testing (Fig. 1). Additionally, the assay was validated for both nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and saliva samples and demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to the FDA-EUA comparator assay (SARS-CoV-2 detection only). We contend that this novel multiplex assay can be used to screen for influenza viruses along with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and can be readily implemented in laboratories across the globe, using essentially the same workflow and rapid turnaround time (TAT).Figure 1Schematic overview of sample processing steps for saliva and NPS samples for SARS-specific assay and the multiplex assay. The two assays differ in the preparation of RT-PCR master mix preparation, and the entire protocol remains the same.Full size imageMaterial and methodsStudy site and ethicsThis single-center diagnostic study was conducted at Augusta University, GA, USA. This site is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) accredited laboratory for high complexity testing and is one of the main SARS-CoV-2 testing centers in the State of Georgia. The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Institutional Review Board A- BIOMEDICAL I (IRB REGISTRATION #00000150), Augusta University. HAC IRB # 611298. Based on the IRB approval, the need for consent was waived, all PHI was removed and all data was anonymized before accessing for the study.Patient specimens and settingThe study evaluated 1411 clinical specimens that included 1019 saliva and 392 NPS samples collected in either healthcare or community setting, tested using both the FDA-EUA approved SARS-CoV-2 and the PKamp RT-PCR based assays. As a standard protocol, NPS samples were collected by a healthcare worker using a sterile flocked swab placed in a sterile tube containing the viral transport medium (VTM) (Becton Dickinson, USA, cat no. 22053). The saliva samples were collected under the supervision of a healthcare worker in Omni tubes (Omni International, USA, SKU: 19-628D) without adding any media. All samples were stored at 4 °C temperature and transported to the SARS-CoV-2 testing facility at Augusta University, GA, within 24 h of sample collection, for further processing.FDA-EUA approved assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-specific assay)The assay is based on nucleic acid extraction followed by TaqMan-based RT-PCR assay to conduct in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, DNA amplification, and fluorescence detection (FDA-EUA assay by PerkinElmer Inc. Waltham, USA). The assay targets specific genomic regions of the SARS-CoV-2: nucleocapsid (N) gene and ORF1ab. The TaqMan probes for the two amplicons are labeled with FAM and ROX fluorescent dyes, respectively, to generate target-specific signals. The assay includes an RNA internal control (IC, bacteriophage MS2) to monitor the processes from nucleic acid extraction to fluorescence detection. The IC probe is labeled with VIC fluorescent dye to differentiate its fluorescent signal from SARS-CoV-2 targets. The samples were resulted as positive or negative based on the Ct values specified by the manufacturer (Supplementary file 1). For a detailed method, please refer to Sahajpal, NS, et al.6.PKamp assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses (Multiplex assay)The PKamp Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Panel assay (PerkinElmer Inc. Waltham, USA) is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) multiplexed test intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The oligonucleotide primers and probes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 include the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene and ORF1ab gene. The primers and probes for the detection of influenza A and RSV target regions of matrix protein. The primers and probes for the detection of influenza B target the regions of the nuclear export protein (NEP) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes. An additional primer/probe set to detect the endogenous control targets the RNase P gene and is included in the test. Qualitative assessment is based on fluorescence detections with TaqMan probes labeled as SARS-CoV-2 (FAM), influenza A (ROX), influenza B (Cy5), Respiratory syncytial virus (Cy5.5), and RNase P (HEX/VIC). The protocol for extraction and RT-PCR was described previously7. The samples were resulted as positive or negative based on the Ct values specified by the manufacturer (Supplementary file 1).Limit of detection studiesThe limit of detection (LoD) studies were conducted as per the FDA guidelines (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas). Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 reference control material (SARS-CoV-2: SeraCare (Mat. No. 0505-0159; influenza A and B: SeraCare (Mat. No. 0515-0001) was spiked into the negative saliva and NPS samples to serve as positive samples at 540 copies/ml, 180 copies/ml, 60 copies/ml and 20 copies/ml concentrations. The lowest concentration detected in all three triplicates was determined as the preliminary LoD. To confirm the LoD, 20 replicates of preliminary LoD were analyzed and deemed as confirmed if at least 19/20 replicates were detected.Data analysisData were analyzed for descriptive statistics and presented as a number (%) for categorical variables and mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. Ct values were compared using Paired T-test.ResultsClinical performance: saliva samplesOf the 1019 saliva samples, 17.0% (174/1019) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [91.9% (160/174) vs. 87.9% (153/174)], respectively. The concordance for positive results between the two tests was 80.4% (140/174) (Table 1). The Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 were comparable between the two assays (SARS-CoV-2: 29.2 ± 7.2 vs. N: 29.8 ± 6.4, ORF1ab: 28.0 ± 7.1), whereas the Ct values of housekeeping gene was significantly lower with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [RNaseP: 20.6 ± 2.05 vs. IC: 32.5 ± 2.0 (p < 0.001)], respectively (Fig. 2). Further, the number of tests resulting as invalid was significantly less with the multiplex assay compared to the SARS-specific assay [1.7% (18/1019) vs. 5.6% (58/1019) (p < 0.001)]. No samples were positive for either influenza A or B.Table 1 The overall and assay specific detection rate (%) and concordance data between two assays for saliva samples.Full size tableFigure 2Plot demonstrating the Ct values of N and ORF1ab genes in SARS-specific assay compared to SARS-CoV-2 in the multiplex assay.

The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to the SARS-specific assay [97.5% (40/41) vs. 95.1% (39/41)], respectively. The concordance for positive results between the two tests was 92.6% (38/41) (Table 2). The Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 were comparable between the two assays (SARS-CoV-2: 30.8 ± 8.8 vs. N: 31.3 ± 8.6, ORF1ab: 28.8 ± 8.6), whereas the Ct values of housekeeping gene was significantly lower with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [RNaseP: 23.1 ± 1.77 vs. IC: 31.3 ± 1.5 (p < 0.001)], respectively (Fig. 3). No samples were positive for either influenza A or B.Table 2 The overall and assay specific detection rate (%) and concordance data between two assays for NPS samples.Full size tableFigure 3Plot demonstrating the Ct values of N and ORF1ab genes in SARS-specific assay compared to SARS-CoV-2 in the multiplex assay.

The preliminary LoD evaluation for influenza A and B identified all replicates at the four concentrations for influenza B, whereas all replicates at 180 and 540 copies/ml were positive for influenza B. The LoD was established at 180 copies/ml for both influenza A, and B viruses, with 20/20 replicates being detected (Table 3).Table 3 Limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses for saliva samples with multiplex assay and for SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-specific assay.Full size tableLimit of detection studies: NPS samplesIn the preliminary LoD study using NPS samples, all replicates at the four tested concentrations (20, 60, 180, and 540 copies/ml) were detected for SARS-CoV-2, and the LoD was determined at 60 copies/ml, with 20/20 replicates being detected. The preliminary LoD evaluation for influenza A and B identified all replicated at the four concentrations for influenza B, whereas all replicates at 180 and 540 copies/ml were detected for influenza B. The LoD was established at 180 copies/ml for both influenza A, and B viruses, with 20/20 replicates being detected (Table 4).Table 4 Limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses for NPS samples.Full size tableDiscussionThis undocumented health loss due to seasonal influenza viruses has posed severe public health deficiencies, both at a clinical and epidemiological level8,9,10. Further, poorly documented co-infections in patients with COVID-19 continue to amplify the morbidity and mortality associated with the pandemic4,11. In an attempt to address these clinical and technical challenges, we propose a simplified protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 along with common co-infections. We have optimized and validated a highly sensitive, RT-PCR based multiplex assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and B viruses in a single test, using the same workflow, instruments, sample types, supplies, and laboratory personnel needed for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 1). The clinical evaluation of 1411 specimens that included 1019 saliva samples and 392 NPS samples demonstrated comparable performance of the multiplex assay to the SARS-specific FDA-EUA assay. Of the 1019 saliva samples evaluated with both assays, the detection rate was higher with the proposed multiplex assay compared to the SARS-specific assay (91.9% (160/174) vs. 87.9% (153/174). Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 with the multiplex assay were comparable to N and ORF1ab genes with the SARS-specific assay. The marginally higher performance of the multiplex assay compared to the SARS-specific assay might be attributed to the fact that in the multiplex assay, the amplification from two regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (N and ORF1ab genes) are detected with a single dye (FAM) for fluorescence detection. Thus, very weak positive samples that do not amplify sufficiently for the respective targets individually (N: FAM, ORF1ab: ROX) in the SARS-specific assay are being amplified to cross the threshold collectively in the multiplex assay [SARS-CoV-2 (N, ORF1ab): FAM). The concordance between the two assays was found to be 80.4% (140/174). Upon manual inspection of the Ct values, it was found that the discrepant results between the assays emerged for samples that show low viral loads with high Ct values, and only one gene detected (N or ORF1ab) with the SARS-specific assay. The findings were similar with NPS samples, with a slightly higher detection rate with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [97.5% (40/41) vs. 95.1% (39/41)], with a concordance of 92.6% (38/41) between the two assays. The Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 with the multiplex assay were comparable to N and ORF1ab gene with the SARS-specific assay. Further, the LoD studies performed with the SeraCare reference material demonstrated high sensitivity of the assay with LoD of 60 copies/ml for SARS-CoV-2 and 180 copies/ml for influenza A and B viruses, for both saliva and NPS samples. Notably, no samples resulted positive for influenza viruses A and B in this study. These results are in alignment with the prevalence of flu in this state, as reported by the Georgia Department of Public Health. The baseline levels were reported as 0–3%, with an incidence of 0.6% in the second week of December 2020 (https://dph.georgia.gov/epidemiology/influenza/flu-activity-georgia). Recently, in another single-center evaluation study, the LoD for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B were reported to be 5 copieseaction, but the LoD was not validated as per FDA guidelines, and remains to be validated12.We have previously discussed saliva samples that resulted as inconclusive and have argued that the rate of these invalid results would decrease with assays that include RNaseP gene as a housekeeping control7,13. Herein, the number of invalids significantly decreased with the multiplex assay compared to the SARS-specific assay [1.7% (18/1019) vs. 5.6% (58/1019): p < 0.001], and Ct values for the housekeeping gene was significantly lower (p < 0.001) with the multiplex assay compared to the SARS-specific assay. The RNase P gene is abundant in both the NPS and saliva samples, leading to a definitive result, whereas the addition of an external control (5 µl IC in SARS-specific assay) might be difficult to extract in complex samples contributing to inconclusive results. It is recommended that inconclusive samples be re-processed, and if the results still remain inconclusive, then patients need to be re-tested on a fresh sample. A major advantage of this multiplex assay has been that it did not cause any significant workflow changes in our laboratory. Existing platforms and even procedures remained essentially the same as those in use for the last eight months for COVID-19 testing. The only change was in the PCR master mix composition, which does not cause any change in workflow or TAT. The TAT with SARS-specific assay has been ~ 14 h for reporting ~ 800 samples/day, and the TAT to report results with the multiplex assay was found to be similar as assessed by an independent, blinded protocol.However, the study is limited by the fact that none of our clinical samples were known positive for influenza A and B viruses. To address this limitation, we obtained the SeraCare reference material for influenza A and B viruses. We performed the LoD studies by spiking saliva and NPS samples to validate the assay for the detection of influenza viruses. The second limitation was that Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was not validated in this study as the RT-PCR instruments available in the laboratory do not have the channel on which the dye for RSV detection was labeled. The manufacturers have appropriately provided the procedure for RT-PCR master mix preparation, where, TE (Tris-EDTA) was added instead of RSV probes in the solution. The laboratories that have instruments that can detect RSV can easily include the detection of RSV in addition to SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and B viruses. The third limitation was that it would have been ideal to sequence the non-concordant samples between the assays to resolve the discrepant results. However, due to exhaustion of the sample, additional experiments could not be performed. Nonetheless, despite these limitations, this study presents a significant and clinically validated assay that can be implemented for testing of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses, using NPS and saliva samples for population screening.

Every year, with enviable regularity, humanity is faced with great and little-known danger, threatening all of us with epidemics and the death of a large number of people. According to a 2018 report by the World Health Organization, over 37.6 million people are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to date, this virus has claimed more than 32 million lives [https://www.who.intuews-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids]. People are constantly threatened by many other and emerging viruses that cause the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, influenza A subtype (H5N1 [1] and H7N9 [2]), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [3], the Ebola virus [4], the Middle East respiratory coronavirus syndrome [5]. Today the ranks of these economically and socially dangerous infections have been replenished with another one - COVID-19, with more than 4.5 million deaths registered worldwide [https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331685CoVsitrep01Apr2020-eng.pdf]. Respiratory infections are of global importance, and the last two years have shown the particular importance of research work aimed at finding effective antiviral drugs, since the emergence of new viruses [3,4,5] and drug-resistant virus strains [6] has been a continuous process, leading to outbreaks and pandemics. A particularly high mutation rate is observed in viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, including all types of influenza viruses [7, 8], and coronaviruses [3, 5].Influenza causes annual epidemics that quickly spread from country to country, involving in severe cases (pandemics) a significant part of the world’s human population [9]. Despite the advances made in the field of chemotherapy, vaccination, and immunology of influenza, it remains a difficult-to-control infection due to high genetic variability and various long-term complications after the acute stage, leading to “latent” or secondary mortality caused not by the influenza virus itself, but by virus-induced secondary processes [10]. The rapid development of resistant variants of influenza reduces the effectiveness of the anti-influenza properties of active substances; therefore, the search for new compounds with antiviral properties is an extremely important objective of high priority.Chemical compounds isolated from plants are widely used in many different areas of activities that are successfully used in pharmacotherapy [11]. The flora land is rich in medicinal herbs and plants, which contain biologically active components providing the main pharmacological action. A significant part (about 24.4%) of these metabolite compounds are triterpenes [12]. Among them, tetracyclic and pentacyclic triterpenes as well as their semisynthetic derivatives possesses a wide spectrum of biological activity, including antitumor, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotection action [13, 14].The antiviral activity of this class of compounds also has a fairly wide spectrum. Triterpenes are active against viruses such as human immunodeficiency viruses, hepatitis B and C, various types of influenza viruses, acute respiratory viral infections, herpes viruses, human enterovirus, Epstein-Barr, and Zika viruses [15, 16]. The potential of triterpenoids as antiviral platforms is very promising. This is evidenced by such good examples as bevirimat - an anti-HIV drug derived from a betulinic acid [17], glycyrrhizinic acid—a native platform used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis [18]. Recently, 3-O-β-chacotriosyl oleanolic acid benzyl ester has been identified as a novel low molecular weight inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [19]. Therefore, research in this area is very actual and should be extensively continued.All of the above, in particular the ability of the virus to develop resistance to antiviral drugs, indicates the need to search and develop effective and cheap anti-influenza agents with a wider spectrum of action based on plant metabolites and their semisynthetic derivatives. Since often, the activity of chemically modified compounds is not inferior to and sometimes exceeds the activity of native compounds [20].In this context, in a continuation of our research in the field of antiviral properties of semisynthetic triterpene derivatives [21,22,23,24], a synthesis and an antiviral activity screening of a series of lupane, oleanane, and dammarane types amino-triterpenoids against the H1N1 influenza virus have been performed.Results and discussionThe literature data showed that nitrogen-containing derivatives of triterpenoids in A-ring led to an increase of antiviral activity, in particular, anti-influenza activity [25]. These results include mostly oxime and amide functions at C3 or C28 positions. For example, 3-oxime of betulonic acid and L-leucine-28-amide demonstrated 90% suppression of influenza virus A H7N1 (EC50 2.17, MTT/EC50 392.16) [26, 27] 3β- and 3α-amino-derivatives of oleanolic acid possessed inhibitory activity on HCV protease [28].Alnincanone having a framework of dammarane, echinocystic acid—lupane type triterpenoid, and methyl ester of ursolic acid possess pronounced inhibiting activity against influenza type A virus (protection index 60%) and high antiviral activity against influenza type B (protection index 80%) [29]. 3-Cyanoethoxy derivatives of dammarane triterpenoids alnincanone and dipterocarpol, 3-tetrazolyl derivative of dammarolide had a considerable activity with SI 10, 9, and 26 against influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) [30].The presence of the seven-membered azepane fragment in cycle A in various types of triterpenoids leads to an increased native and occurrence of new types of biological activity. Azepanotriterpenoids are the promising compounds toward M. tuberculosis [31], ESCAPE pathogens [32, 33], and HSV-1 [33].Taking in mind that to combine amino-function with the seco fragment in the A cycle of triterpenoids is also an effective direction in the search for antiviral platforms we have shown that lupane 3,4-seco-3,28-bis-N,N-methylpiperazine-amide has IC50 27 μM and SI 7.1 against Flu A H1N1 strain [34]. A lupane 2,3-seco aldehydoacid, diacid, 3-aldoxime derivatives can suppress the reproduction of HSV-1 and Flu A (EC50 from 0.06 to 21.3 μM) [35, 36]. Ethyl β-alaninate diamide 2,3 seco-lupane was shown to combine antiherpetic (EC50 4.1 μM) and anti-HIV activity (EC50 5.1 μM) [37] and C-28 amide conjugate with a 2-aminpropane-1,3-diol was the most active compound against herpes simplex virus type I (5.7 μM, MTC/EC50 32.2) [38]. Inhibition of the serotype A viruses with a protection index of 60% by 2,3- and 3,4-seco-dammarane acids was reported in [39].Based on our previous reports on the antiviral activity of nitrogen-containing triterpenoids [21,22,23,24, 34, 40] and considering the pronounced anti-influenza activity of lupane, oleanane, and dammarane triterpenoids in this work we focused our attention on a synthesis of a series of this type triterpenoids with 3β-amino, A-ring azepano- and 3,4-seco-3-amino-fragments and their evaluation against influenza H1N1 type. Need to note that semisynthetic dammarane triterpenoids have been a few studied against influenza viruses and search for new antiviral platforms based on this type of triterpenoids are a relevant direction.ChemistryAs was mentioned above, the triterpenes and their nitrogen derivatives demonstrated activity against different strains of the influenza virus.The three series of A-ring nitrogen-containing derivatives with 3β-amino, azepano- and 3-amino-3,4-seco-fragments have been designed and synthesized. These compounds are presented by new 4–6, and 8 (Scheme 1) and previously synthesized 9–19 (Fig. 1) triterpenoids.Scheme 1Synthesis compounds 4–8: a. CH3COONH4, NaBH3CN, CH3OH, 22 °С, 12 h; b. NH2OH HCl, Py, reflux; c. SOCl2, dioxane, 22 °C, 30 min; d. LiAlH4, THF, reflux, 3 h. The parent compounds were described in 1 [41], 2 [42], dipterocarpol 3 [43]Full size imageFig. 1The structures of compounds 9 [46], 10 [47], 11 [48], 12 [49], 13, 16, 18, 19 [50], 15 [51], 14 [52], 17 [53]Full size imageReduction amination was applied to prepare compounds with a free amino group at C3. The reaction of 3-oxoderivatives betulonic acid cyclohexylamide 1 [41], oleanonic 2-aminopyridine-amide 2 [42] and dipterocarpol 3 [43] with ammonium acetate in presence of NaBH3CN in methanol at room temperature lead to compounds 4–6 with yields of 82–89% after purification by column chromatography. Early compound 6 was isolated from a plant Astragalus genus [44]. The structures of compounds 4–6 were confirmed by spectroscopic methods (see Supplementary material S1–S9). In the 13C NMR spectra, the signals of the C3 carbon atom at the amino group were detected at δC 56.60–59.74 ppm, in the 1H NMR spectra Hα-3 proton signals resonated at δH 2.20–2.72 ppm as a doublet of doublets.The presence of NH2-group at C3 position of compound 6 is confirmed by cross peaks of nearby protons (Heq-2, H-3) in the {1H, 15N} HMBC spectrum with amino-nitrogen at δN ~31 ppm (Fig. 2). The stereochemistry of the chiral center at C3 was established using analysis of NOESY spectra and coupling constants of compound 6. Signal splitting of H-3 (δH 2.34 ppm) with coupling constants of 11.8 and 4.1 Hz indicates its axial position. The key signals for the configuration assignment are NOESY cross-peaks H-3 with H-5 and Hax-1 protons which are indicative of both axial alignment of the proton at C-3 and its α-configuration, which is confirmed the data [45].Fig. 2Key NOESY, HMBC, and COSY correlations of compound 6Full size imageThe treatment of dipterocarpol 3 with NH2OH·HCl in pyridine according to [43] and following Beckmann rearrangement of the crude oxime with thionyl chloride in dioxane at room temperature led to azepanone 7 (82%), the following reduction with LiAlH4 in THF afforded azepano-20(S)-hydroxy-dammar-24-en 8 (85%). The structures of the target compounds were confirmed by NMR data. The presence of amide fragment in azepanone 7 was confirmed by the characteristic signal of C3 carbonyl carbon which was detected at δ 176.29 ppm. In the 13C NMR spectrum of azepane 8, the upfield shift of the carbonyl signal C3 to region δ 63.11 ppm was observed. In the 1H NMR spectra, the signal of methylene protons at C3 atom was registered at δ 3.19 ppm.Thus, new amino-triterpenoids 4–6 and 8 have been synthesized for biological screening.Biological activityEvaluation of antiviral activityCytotoxicity and anti-influenza properties of the derivatives 4–6 and 8–19 were studied in MDCK cell culture against influenza virus A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1) Oseltamivir carboxylate was used as a reference compound. All results are summarized at Table 1. As one can see, the tested compounds were of relatively high cytotoxicity their CC50’s lying in one- to two-digits micromolar range. It was shown, in particular, that modification of the C-28 position of lupane triterpenoids with the introduction of a cyclohexylamine substituent in compound 4 leads to a decrease in cytotoxicity by 1.7 times compared to 3β-amino-olean-28-oate 9 containing a methoxy fragment. A similar situation is observed for amide 13, which is 13 times less toxic in comparison with azepanobetulin 12. Among the derivatives of the oleanane series, azepanoallobetulin 14 showed the lowest toxicity with CC50 46.7 μM. The azepenouvaol 15 is the most toxic compound among all studied (CC50 0.1 μM), but transformation of ring A on 3,4-seco-3-amino in derivative 18 decreased toxicity by 200-fold. The broadening of ring А from six-membered with 3-amino function to seven-membered azepane in dammarane type derivatives one results in some decrease of toxicity (compound 6 and 8) from 13.5 to 21.9 μM.Table 1 The antiviral activity of compounds 4–6 and 8–19 against Flu A H1N1Full size tableFor lupane, oleanane, and dammarane type derivatives 4–6 and 9–11 with the 3β-amino group at C3 position the SI against H1N1 virus ranged from 1 to 10. 3β-Amino-28-oxo-allobetulin 11 with IC50 2.6 μg ml–1 and SI 10 was established as the most active compound in this series.Taking into account the potency of azepenotriterpenoids as biologically active platforms [31,32,33], anti-influenza activity of A-azepanodipterocarpol 8, azepanobetulin 12, azepanobetulin-28-cyclohexylcarboxamide 13, azepanoallobetulin 14, azepanouvaol 15 and azepanoglycyrrhetol 16 were tested and SI values from 1 to 3 was established. The combination of the A-azepano fragment and the dammarane frame led to the best results in terms of anti-influenza activity and only A-azepanodipterocarpol 8 showed a good level of IC50 1.1 μg ml–1 and SI 19 being a lead compound in this series.Earlier, examples of the high antiviral activity of triterpenoid seco derivatives are presented [34,35,36,37,38,39]. Unfortunately, in contrast to the above data, 3,4-seco-3-amino-derivatives 16–19 were practically inactive against Flu A with SI values from 1 to 3. 3,4-Seco-3-amino-30-hydroxy-olean-12(13)-en 18 was a more active compound in this series with IC50 > 8.4 and SI 3. In this case, due to the small sample of compounds, it is impossible to say unequivocally about the inefficiency of the synthesis of seco-amino derivatives. It is also necessary to modify the 3-amino group of the fragment and further assessment of the structure-activity relationship of the obtained derivatives.In summary, among tested nitrogen-containing lupane-, oleanane- and dammarane-based triterpenoids, azepanodipterocarpol 8 and 3β-amino-28-oxo-allobetulin 11 demonstrated a high inhibitory activity against H1N1 virus with IC50 1.1, 2.6 μg ml–1 and SI 19 and 10, respectively. It was established that introduction of A-azepano-ring fragment into dipterocarpol derivative with a native side chain results in an enhancing effect on the antiviral activity.In conclusion, we have synthesized novel, previously unknown, derivatives of lupane-, oleanane-, and dammarane-based triterpenoids. Among them, dipterocarpol was shown to be a promising scaffold to produce novel N-containing bioactive derivatives including antiviral agents. Based on the results presented, focusing of the chemical library with further modification of A-azepanodipterocarpol in the side chain and synthesis of acylates on cycle A and study of structure-activity relation will lead to new effective compounds with high anti-viral activity.Despite inspiring results, several questions should be addressed at the next stages of the characteristic of virus-inhibiting properties of triterpenes. First, in the present study we demonstrate the anti-viral potential of triterpenes against influenza virus based on the results of CPE reduction assay with two lead compounds, 8 and 11, identified. Their activity should be further studied by virus yield reduction assay to demonstrate their direct anti-viral action to rule out non-selective cytoprotective or antioxidant activity.Second, in our experiments we used influenza virus A/PuertoRico/8/34 which is relatively old in terms of antigenic properties comparing to viruses currently circulating among humans. The spectrum of activity of lead compound 8 or its more active analog synthesized after focusing of chemical library, must be assessed using influenza viruses of A and B types, and different subtypes (H1, H3, H5, etc.) including contemporary isolates of influenza viruses.Third, the virus we used in our study is resistant to adamantane derivatives, Rimantadine, the well-known blocker of virally encoded proton channel M2. This was confirmed by demonstrating the low activity of Rimantadine in our experiments (SI = 5, Table 1). The activity of triterpene derivatives 8 and 11 is higher suggesting that their target differs from M2 protein.Finally, in the presented study we have demonstrated just the total virus-suppressing activity of compounds. The specific target and mechanism(s) of virus-inhibiting action of lead compounds as well as the ability of viral resistance development, should be assessed in further studies for possible development of novel antivirals. This will be a subject of further virology-oriented experiments.ExperimentalGeneralThe spectra were recorded at the Center for the Collective Use “Chemistry” of the Ufa Institute of Chemistry of the UFRC RAS and RCCU “Agidel” of the UFRC RAS. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a “Bruker AM-500” (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA, 500 and 125.5 MHz respectively, δ, ppm, Hz) in CDCl3, internal standard tetramethylsilane.

Before the experiment, virus was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10- to 12-day-old chicken embryos for 48 h at 36 °C. The infectious titer of the virus was determined in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC # CCL-34) grown in 96-well plates in alpha-MEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum.Cytotoxicity assayMDCK cells were seeded onto 96-well culture plates (104 cells per well) and incubated at 36 °C in 5% CO2 until continuous monolayer formation. To assess the toxicity of compounds, a series of their 3-fold dilutions at concentrations of 300 to 4 μg ml−1 in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) were prepared. The dilutions were added to the wells of the plates. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 36 °C in a CO2 incubator under 5% CO2. Further, a microtetrazolium (MTT) assay was performed on 96-well plates. The cells were washed 2 times with saline (0.9% NaCl), and 100 μl/well of MTT solution [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] at a concentration of 0.5 μg ml−1 in MEM was added. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 36 °C, the liquid was removed, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1 ml per well) was added. The optical density (OD) of the cells was measured on a Thermo Multiskan FC spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at a wavelength of 540 nm. Based on the obtained data, the CC50, the concentration of the compound that destroys 50% of the cells in the culture, was calculated for each specimen.CPE reduction assayThe compounds in appropriate concentrations were added to MDCK cells (0.1 ml per well). MDCK cells were further infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus (m.o.i 0.01). Plates were incubated for 72 h at 36 °C at 5% CO2. After that, cell viability was assessed by the MTT test, as described above. The cytoprotective activity of compounds was considered as their ability to increase the values of the OD compared to the control wells (with virus only; no drugs). Based on the obtained results, the IC50 values, i.e., the concentration of compounds that results in 50% cell protection, were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. IC50 values in μg ml−1 were then calculated into micromoles. For each compound, the value of the selectivity index (SI) was calculated as a ratio of CC50 to IC50.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the synthesis and evaluation of the in vitro anti-influenza activities of lupane, oleanane, and dammarane type A-amino derivatives was performed. The primary assay of tested triterpenoids against Flu A H1N1 demonstrated their SI values ranged from 1 to 19. Dammarane type A-azepanodipterocarpol showed the most significant antiviral activity against the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1), with an IC50 value of 1.1 μM and SI 19.

H5N1 virus infection leads to the disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier, a pathologic change that often progresses into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. The mechanisms underlying this remain poorly understood. Here we report that H5N1 viruses downregulate the expression of intercellular junction proteins (E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1) in several cell lines and the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice. H5N1 virus infection activates TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which then activates p38 and ERK to induce E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch expression and to promote occludin ubiquitination and degradation. Inhibition of the TAK1-Itch pathway restores the intercellular junction structure and function in vitro and in the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice. Our study suggests that H5N1 virus infection impairs the alveolar epithelial barrier by downregulating the expression of intercellular junction proteins at the posttranslational level.

This epithelial monolayer functions as a barrier to prevent the passage of proteins and other macromolecules from the alveolar capillary and microvessels into the alveolar space1. The alveolar epithelium exerts its barrier function largely through the intercellular junction structure: the tight and adherens junctions. The tight junction is a homodimeric structure formed by the interaction of the extracellular ring structure of occludin or the member of the claudin family, both of which are the four-pass transmembrane proteins3,4,5,6. The adherens junction is formed through the interaction of five IgG-like loops in the extracellular domain of E-cadherin or Nectin proteins. The intracellular C-terminal domain of E-cadherin and Nectin is engaged with β-catenin. ZO-1 is an adapter protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic regions of the tight junction and adherens junction proteins to form filaments, which stabilize the intercellular junction structure3,4,5.Claudins and occludin are the major components of the tight junction in epithelial and endothelial cells. Their expression is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels7,8. Of the total 16 claudins, claudin-1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -16 can be ubiquitinated by LNX1p80, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and degraded through the proteasomal pathway7,8. Occludin is ubiquitinated by Itch, a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, and undergoes proteasomal degradation7,8,9. Occludin ubiquitination occurs in the intestinal epithelial cells in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, in the tight junction of the Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis, and in the blood-brain barrier with brain ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury7,8. E-cadherin, an adherens junction protein, is ubiquitinated by several E3 ubiquitin ligases including Hakai, Fbxl20, and MARCH810. Ubiquitinated E-cadherin undergoes endocytosis in endothelial cells10 and proteasomal degradation in epithelial cells11. ZO-1 is ubiquitinated by interleukin-6 (IL-6)-activated Ubr-1 (Ub ligase E3 component n-recognin-1) in Japanese encephalitis viral (JEV)-infected astrocytes, leading to ZO-1 degradation and disruption of the blood-brain barrier12,13.Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common respiratory tract pathogen. Influenza often presents as seasonal epidemics and causes hundreds of thousands of deaths annually14. The prevalent subtypes of IAV that infect humans are the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. The 2009 influenza pandemic caused 150 to 600 thousand deaths15,16. H5N1 and its derivative subtypes (H5NX) are highly pathogenic IAV of avian origin17. Since it was first isolated in 1996 from diseased geese in Southern China, H5N1 viruses have spread to more than 70 countries. In addition to inflicting heavy losses to the poultry industry18,19, H5N1 viruses cause sporadic human infections17,20. A total of 861 confirmed human cases with 455 deaths have been reported in 17 countries since 1997. H5N6 viruses, the second H5 subtype that infects humans21, has replaced H5N1 strains as the dominant epidemic subtype in poultry22,23. By March 2020, 24 H5N6-infected human infections with eight deaths have been reported24. H5N6 viruses have a broad host range including poultry, waterfowl, wild birds, and some mammals such as pigs and cats25,26. H5N1 and H5Nx viruses pose a major public health threat24.Immunocompromised individuals succumbed to influenza A virus infections often develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Its pathogenesis is characterized by disintegration of alveolar epithelial and endothelial barriers and increased alveolar permeability27,28,29. Impaired barriers result in alveolar protein-rich effusion, edema, and infiltration with red blood cells and inflammatory cells. Alveoli filled with effusion and edema lose their gas exchange function leading to dyspnea27,29. Patients with the ARDS often progress into other serious conditions such as viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections, and multiple organ failure that account for a death rate of approximately 60%30,31. Local inflammation in lung tissue can increase the permeability of the vascular endothelial barrier3,4,27,28, whereas programmed death of alveolar epithelial cells may also disrupt the natural barrier of alveolar epithelium, leading to increased alveolar permeability27.We recently reported that H1N1 viruses suppress the expression of the intercellular junction proteins of the alveolar barrier at the transcriptional level by activating the Gli1 transcription factor32. Our present study focuses on the posttranslational modification and downregulation of intercellular junction proteins in IAV-infected cells and their pathological importance. Here we report that H5N1 viruses damaged the intercellular junction structure by accelerating the turnover of several junction proteins. Further investigation revealed that H5N1 viruses activated TAK1 and its two downstream MAP kinases, p38 and ERK, leading to increased Itch expression and ubiquitination of occludin and potentially other junction proteins. Our study provides mechanistic insights into how H5N1 viruses disrupt the alveolar barrier and advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of the H5N1 virus.ResultsH5N1 viruses down-regulate the expression of Gli1, Snail, and intercellular junction proteinsWe recently reported that H1N1 viruses activate the PI-3 and MAP kinase pathways to induce the expression of Gli1 and Snail, two transcription factors that play an important role in down-regulating the expression of intercellular junction proteins at the transcriptional levels32. Unlike H1N1, H5N1 viruses do not activate the PI-3 kinase pathway33. We first investigated if H5N1 viruses could also induce the expression of Gli1 and Snail, subsequently leading to the suppression of intercellular junction protein expression. Unexpectedly, H5N1 viruses did not increase but rather decreased the levels of Gli1 and Snail in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 (a human lung cancer cell line), NL20 (a human noncancerous alveolar epithelial cell line), and MDCK cells (a non-cancerous canine kidney cell line widely used for influenza virus study and for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) (Fig. 1a–c). However, H5N1 viruses still effectively lowered the levels of E-cadherin, occludin, and claudin-1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all three cell lines (Fig. 1a–c). H5N1 viruses down-regulated ZO-1 expression at much lower magnitudes than the other three junction proteins in these three cell lines (Fig. 1a–c). In addition, the levels of Gli1, Snail, and these four junction proteins were also decreased in A549 cells infected with a second strain of the H5N1 virus (CK10) and an H5N6 strain (Y6) (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: The H5N1 virus down-regulates the levels of Gli1, Snail, and junction proteins.A549 (a), NL20 (b), and MDCK (c) cells were infected with various MOI of H5N1 viruses (the SY strain) for 24 h or with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) for the indicated lengths of time. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of Gli1, Snail, and four junction proteins by Western blot. The density of the bands was analyzed by using NIH Image-J software and normalized by the arbitrary units of β-actin. Data are the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, compared to uninfected control. d, e The effect of influenza viruses on GLI1, SNAI, CDH, CLDN1, and OCLN mRNA expression. Total mRNA from A549 cells infected with the indicated MOI of H5N1 (d) or H1N1 (e) viruses was analyzed for GLI1, SNAI, OCLN, CLDN1, and CDH mRNA levels by RT-PCR. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01, compared to uninfected control. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.Full size imageWe next determined if H5N1 viruses downregulated the expression of Gli1, Snail, and intercellular junction proteins at the transcriptional level. As shown in Fig. 1d, H5N1 viruses increased Gli1, Snail, and occludin mRNA levels but did not affect the E-cadherin and claudin-1 mRNA levels in A549 cells. We reported earlier that the H1N1 virus activates the Gli1 promoter and induces Gli1 mRNA expression32. Here we show that H1N1 viruses did decrease the levels of E-cadherin and Occludin levels (Fig. 1e), probably from transcriptional repression by Snail since its expression is increased in H1N1 virus-infected cells32. Nevertheless, these observations suggest that H5N1 viruses suppress the expression of Gli1, Snail, and four junction proteins at the posttranslational level.H5N1 viruses downregulate intercellular junction proteins by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradationIn addition to being transcriptionally regulated, occludin and other junction proteins could be ubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation7,8. Here we tested if MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, could block H5N1 virus-induced junction protein downregulation. As shown in Fig. 2a, MG132 (5 μM) did not significantly alter the levels of E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 in uninfected A549 cells but largely restored the levels of these junction proteins in H5N1 virus-infected cells. We next measured the half-life of E-cadherin, occludin, and claudin-1 in uninfected and H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) (10 μM). As shown in Fig. 2b, the half-life of E-cadherin and occludin in uninfected cells was > 6 h in uninfected cells. H5N1 virus infection shortened the half-life of E-cadherin (Fig. 2c) and occludin (Fig. 2d) to approximately 3 h. While H5N1 viruses dramatically lowered the levels of claudin-1, they did not significantly decrease its half-life, probably due to the levels of claudin-1 already being low when CHX was added. (Fig. 2b, g). The effect of H5N1 viruses on the half-life of occludin was further investigated in A549 cells overexpressing occludin. As shown in Fig. 2e, f, H5N1 viruses accelerated the degradation of occludin in A549 cells transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding the FLAG-occludin gene.Fig. 2: H5N1 virus induces E-cadherin, occludin, and claudin-1 degradation.a H5N1 viruses accelerate the turnover of intercellular junction proteins. A549 cells infected with 1 MOI of H5N1 viruses were incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of MG132 (10 μM). Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot for the levels of E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1, and the viral NP and NS1 proteins with their specific antibodies. b H5N1 viruses shorten the half-life of intercellular junction proteins. A549 cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI). After incubation for 12 h, CHX (10 μM) was added and incubated for the indicated lengths of time. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1, and NP by Western blot. c Quantification of relative E-cadherin levels (from b). d Quantification of relative Occludin levels (from b). e H5N1 viruses shorten the half-life of occludin. A549 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1 expression vector encoding the FLAG-occludin gene. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were then left uninfected or infected with the H5N1 virus (1 MOI). After incubation for 12 h, CHX (10 μM) was added and incubated for the indicated lengths of time. Cells were harvested and analyzed for occludin by Western blot. The density of bands was analyzed using NIH Image-J software and normalized by the arbitrary units of β-actin. f Quantification of relative Occludin levels (from e). g Quantification of relative Claudin-I levels (from b). Data presented in c, d, f, and g are the mean ± SD from one of three experiments in triplicate. h, i H5N1 virus induces occludin ubiquitination. A549 cells were transiently transfected with an HA-ubiquitin expression vector alone (h) or plus the pcDNA3.1 expression vector encoding the FLAG-occludin gene (i). After incubation for 24 h, the cells were left uninfected or infected with the H5N1 virus (1 MOI). After incubation for another 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against occludin (h) or FLAG (i). Whole-cell lysates (WCL) and immunoprecipitates were analyzed with antibodies against ubiquitin, NP, occludin, and β-actin. The data represent one of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.Full size imageWe next tested if down-regulation of occludin in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells was indeed due to its ubiquitination. A549 cells were left untransfected or transfected with an expression vector encoding the HA-ubiquitin gene (Fig. 2h) or with the HA-ubiquitin expression vector plus the FLAG-occludin expression vector (Fig. 2i). After incubation for 24 hr, the cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses and incubated for another 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2h, i (top panels), there was no significant difference in the levels of total protein ubiquitination in the cell lysates of uninfected or H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells. However, immunoprecipitation with an antibody against occludin revealed that the H5N1 virus dramatically increased occludin ubiquitination in A549 cells transfected with the HA-ubiquitin vector or with the HA-ubiquitin expression vector plus the FLAG-occludin expression vector (Fig. 2h, i, bottom panels).H5N1 viruses induce Itch to ubiquitinate occludinItch is an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitinating occludin34,35. Here we tested if occludin was indeed ubiquitinated by Itch in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells. We first determined the ability of H5N1 viruses to induce Itch expression. As shown in Fig. 3a, Itch expression was increased in A549 cells infected with two strains of the H5N1 virus (SY and CK10) or the H5N6 virus (Y6) largely in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Itch siRNA dramatically decreased Itch expression in A549 cells (Fig. 3b). Itch knockdown blocked H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of occludin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 but did not significantly affect the expression of the NP and NS1 proteins of H5N1 viruses (Fig. 3b) nor the virus titers in the conditioned media of H5N1 virus-infected cells (Fig. 3c). Immunoprecipitation revealed that H5N1 viruses increased occludin ubiquitination in A549 transfected with the control siRNA but was unable to do so in the cells transfected with Itch siRNA (Fig. 3d). These observations suggest that Itch is the E3 ubiquitin ligase primarily responsible for H5N1 virus-induced ubiquitination.Fig. 3: H5N1 viruses degrade intercellular junction proteins by inducing Itch expression.a H5N1 viruses induce Itch expression. A549 cells were infected with various MOI of two H5N1 strains (SY and CK10) and H5N6 viruses (the Y6 strain) for 24 hr or with these viruses (1 MOI) for the indicated lengths of time. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of Itch and actin by Western blot. b Itch knockdown blocks H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of junction proteins. A549 cells were transfected with a scrambled control or Itch siRNA. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 virus (1 MOI) and incubated for another 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of Itch and junction proteins by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. c The conditioned media from H5N1 virus-infected cells were analyzed for virus titers by measuring the TCID50 values. d Itch knockdown blocks H5N1 virus-induced occludin ubiquitination. A549 cells were transfected with a scrambled control or Itch siRNA plus the expression vector encoding HA-ubiquitin. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 virus (1 MOI) and incubated for another 24 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against occludin. Normal mouse IgG was included as a negative control. Whole-cell lysates (WCL) and immunoprecipitates were analyzed with antibodies against ubiquitin, NP, occludin, and β-actin. The data represent one of three independent experiments.Full size imagep38 and ERK but not JNK activation is required for H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and junction protein degradationp38 induces Itch expression to degrade occludin36. Here we determined if p38 played a role in H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and the degradation of intercellular junction proteins. As shown in Fig. 4a, H5N1 viruses time-dependently increased p38 phosphorylation in A549 cells infected with 1 MOI of H5N1 viruses or dose-dependently increased p38 phosphorylation in A549 cells infected with H5N1 virus 24 hours post infection (hpi). SB202190, a p38 kinase-specific inhibitor, largely blocked H5N1 virus-induced p38 phosphorylation and restored the levels of E-cadherin, claudin-1, and occludin in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 4b). SB202190 slightly increased the levels of these proteins in uninfected cells but did not affect the expression of the NP and NS1 proteins of H5N1 viruses (Fig. 4b). SB202190 blocked H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression (Fig. 4b). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining revealed that SB202190 partially restored the expression of occludin and claudin-1 on the cell membrane of H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 4c). IF intensity analysis revealed that H5N1 virus infection significantly decreased occludin and claudin-1 signals located in intercellular junctions. This decrease was largely reversed by SB202190 (Fig. 4d). The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay revealed that SB202190 moderately prevented the decrease of electric resistance in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 4e). The effect of SB202190 on the permeability of the H5N1 virus-infected NL20 monolayer was not investigated due to the poor ability of H5N1 virus to decrease TEER in this cell line.Fig. 4: Role of p38 in H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and degradation of junction proteins.a H5N1 viruses induce p38 phosphorylation. A549 cells were infected with the indicated MOI of H5N1 viruses for 24 h or infected with 1 MOI of H5N1 viruses for the indicated lengths of time. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of p38 phosphorylation, NP, and β-actin by Western blot. b SB202190 blocks H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and junction protein downregulation. A549 cells were left uninfected or infected with the H5N1 virus (1 MOI). After incubation for 12 hr, SB202190 (10 μM) was added and incubated for another 12 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the levels of p38 phosphorylation, Itch, and junction proteins by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. The density of bands was analyzed using NIH Image-J software and normalized by the arbitrary units of total p38 or β-actin. Data represent the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. c SB202190 blocks H5N1 virus-induced disruption of intercellular junction structure. A549 cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI). The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of SB202190 (10 μM) for 24 h. The cells were fixed and stained with the antibodies against occludin or claudin-1. d Quantification of fluorescence signals. The monolayers immunostained for occludin and claudin-1 were analyzed for immunofluorescence intensity by using Image J software. The fluorescent signals of intercellular junctions were quantified and plotted as bar graphs. Data represent the mean ± SD of five random fields (40X) from one of three independent experiments with similar results. e SB202190 prevents the H5N1 virus-induced decrease of electronic resistance. A549 cells seeded in the Transwell inserts were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses in the absence or presence of SB202190 (10 μM). TEER was measured at the indicated times. The results represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.Full size imageWe next determined the effect of ERK on the levels of Itch and junction proteins. Again, H5N1 viruses dose- and time-dependently increased ERK phosphorylation in A549 cells (Fig. 5a). U0126, a MEK inhibitor, blocked H5N1 virus-induced ERK phosphorylation and restored E-cadherin, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 levels in A549 cells (Fig. 5b). U0126 did not significantly change the levels of these proteins in uninfected cells (Fig. 5b). IF staining showed that U0126 restored the expression of occludin and claudin-1 on the cell membrane of H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 5c). Immunofluorescence intensity analysis revealed that IAV infection significantly decreased the occludin and claudin-1 signals located in the intercellular junctions, which was largely reversed by U0126 (Fig. 5d). The TEER assay revealed that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway by U0126 moderately prevented the decrease of electric resistance in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 5e).Fig. 5: Role of ERK in H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and the degradation of junction proteins.a H5N1 viruses induce ERK phosphorylation. A549 cells were infected with the indicated MOI of H5N1 viruses for 24 h or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) for the indicated lengths of time. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot. b U0126 blocks H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and junction protein downregulation. A549 cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI). After incubation for 12 h, U0126 (10 μM) was added and incubated for another 12 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of ERK phosphorylation, Itch, and junction proteins by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. c U0126 blocks H5N1 virus-induced disruption of intercellular junction structure. A549 cells were infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI). After incubation for 12 h, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of U0126 (10 mM) for another 12 h. The cells were fixed and then stained with antibodies against occludin and claudin-1. d Quantification of fluorescence signals. The monolayers immunostained for occludin and ZO-1 in c were analyzed for immunofluorescence intensity by using Image J software. The fluorescent signals of intercellular junction proteins were quantified and plotted as bar graphs. The data represent the mean ± SD of five random fields (40X) from one of three independent experiments with similar results. e U0126 blocks the H5N1 virus-induced decrease of electronic resistance. A549 cells seeded in Transwell inserts were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses in the absence or presence of U0126 (10 μM). TEER was measured at the indicated lengths of time. The results represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. f H5N1 viruses induce JNK phosphorylation. A549 cells were infected with the indicated MOI of H5N1 viruses for 24 h or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) for the indicated lengths of time. JNK phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot. g SP600125 does not block H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of junction proteins. A549 cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI). After incubation for 12 h, U0126 (10 μM) was added and incubated for another 12 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of ERK phosphorylation, Itch, and junction proteins by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. The density of bands was analyzed using NIH Image-J software and normalized by the arbitrary units of ERK, JNK, or β-actin. Data are the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.Full size imageWe then determined if JNK activation also contributed to the H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of intercellular junction proteins. As shown in Fig. 5f, H5N1 viruses at a low MOI could rapidly induce JNK phosphorylation. SP600125, a JNK kinase inhibitor, largely inhibited H5N1 virus-induced JNK phosphorylation and did not restore but rather potentiated the downregulation of E-cadherin, claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 expression in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 5g). SP600125 did not affect the expression of the viral NP and NS1 proteins of H5N1 viruses (Fig. 5g) since it was added 12 hr after inoculation.H5N1 viruses downregulate intercellular junction protein expression by activating TAK1TAK1 plays an important role in activating all three MAP kinase cascades37,38. TAK1 phosphorylation was increased in A549 cells infected with two strains of H5N1 viruses (SY, CK10) or with H5N6 viruses (Y6) largely in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6a). Infections with these viruses led to rapid induction of TAK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6a). 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (5Z), a TAK1-specific inhibitor, blocked H5N1 virus-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, ERK, JNK, p38, and the p65 subunit of NK-κB. 5Z restored E-cadherin, claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1, and Itch protein levels in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 6b). 5Z added at 12 hpi did not inhibit the NP and NS1 expression (Fig. 6b). IF staining revealed that 5Z restored occludin and claudin-1 expression on the cell membrane of H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 6c). 5Z alone did not change the pattern and levels of occludin and claudin-1 expression in uninfected A549 cells (Fig. 6c). Quantification of immunofluorescence intensity revealed that H5N1 virus infection significantly decreased the occludin and claudin-1 signals located in intercellular junctions, which was largely prevented by 5Z (Fig. 6d). We conducted a TEER assay to determine if H5N1 virus infection led to the increased paracellular permeability of A549 cell monolayer seeded in the Transwell inserts. H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) significantly decreased TEER in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6e). The addition of 5Z (5 μM) did not alter TEER values of uninfected cells but almost completely restored the electric resistance in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 6e).Fig. 6: Role of TAK1 in degrading junction proteins.a H5N1 viruses induce TAK1 phosphorylation. A549, MDCK, and NL20 cells were infected with various MOI of the H5N1 viruses for 24 h or with the H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) for the indicated lengths of time. Cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of TAK1 phosphorylation, NP, NS1, and β-actin by Western blot. b 5Z blocks H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and junction protein downregulation. A549 cells were left uninfected or infected with 1 MOI of H5N1 viruses. After incubation for 12 h, 5Z (5 μM) was added and then incubated for another 12 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot for TAK1, ERK, JNK, p38, and p65 phosphorylation and for the levels of junction proteins with their specific antibodies. The density of bands was analyzed using NIH Image-J software and normalized by the arbitrary units of β-actin. Data are the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. c 5Z blocks H5N1 virus-induced disruption of intercellular junction structure. A549 cells seeded on coverslips were treated as above. Cells were immunostained with antibodies against occludin and claudin-1 and visualized under a confocal microscope. d Quantification of fluorescence signals. The monolayers immunostained for occludin and claudin-1 in c were analyzed for immunofluorescence intensity by using Image J software. The fluorescent signals of intercellular junctions were quantified and plotted as bar graphs. Data represent the mean ± SD of five random fields (40X) from one of three independent experiments with similar results. e 5Z blocks the H5N1 virus-induced decrease of electronic resistance. A549 cells seeded in Transwell inserts were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses. After incubation for 12 h, 5Z (5 μM) was added and then incubated for another 12 h. TEER was measured at the indicated times. The results represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01.Full size imageWe next determined whether TAK1 knockdown also blocked H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of intercellular junction proteins. As shown in Fig. 7a, TAK1 expression was almost completely silenced by TAK1 siRNA in uninfected and H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells. TAK1 siRNA blocked ERK and JNK phosphorylation induced by H5N1 viruses (Fig. 7a). TAK1 silencing alone did not significantly increase E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 expression in uninfected A549 cells but largely restored the levels of these proteins in H5N1 virus-infected cells (Fig. 7a). TAK1 silencing did not alter NP and NS1 protein expression (Fig. 7a) nor the virus titers in the conditioned media of H5N1 virus-infected cells (Fig. 7b).Fig. 7: TAK1 siRNA blocks the H5N1 virus-induced degradation of junction proteins.a A549 cells were transfected with a scrambled control or TAK1 siRNA. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) and incubated for another 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for TAK1, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation and for the levels of epithelial junction proteins by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. Relative protein levels were analyzed by quantification of the density of the protein bands with NIH Image-J software and presented as bar graphs. Data are the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. b The conditioned media from H5N1 virus-infected cells were analyzed for virus titers by measuring the TCID50 values. c H5N1 virus-induced occludin ubiquitination is blocked by TAK1 or p38 inhibitors. A549 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector encoding the HA-ubiquitin gene. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1 MOI) and then incubated in the absence or presence of 5Z (5 μM) or SB202190 (10 μM). Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against occludin. Whole-cell lysates (WCL) and immunoprecipitates were analyzed with antibodies against ubiquitin, NP, occludin, and β-actin. The data represent one of three independent experiments.Full size imageWe then evaluated the effect of TAK1 and p38 inhibitors on H5N1 virus-induced occludin ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 7c, H5N1 viruses increased occludin ubiquitination. 5Z and SB202190 blocked H5N1 virus-induced occludin ubiquitination. These results suggest that H5N1 viruses downregulate occludin by TAK1-mediated Itch induction and subsequent occludin ubiquitination.H5N1 viruses downregulate the levels of intercellular junction proteins in the lung tissue of miceFinally, we investigated whether H5N1 virus infection had the same effects in the lungs of virus-infected mice. As shown in Fig. 8, H5N1 virus infection significantly increased Itch and the levels of TAK1, p38, and ERK phosphorylation but decreased the levels of Gli1, Snail, E-cadherin, occludin, and claudin-1 in the lung tissue of H5N1 virus-infected mice. Of note, the levels of protein phosphorylation and total proteins among individual mice appear to be variable. This is probably due to the inherited nature of in vivo samples. We next determined the in vivo effect of 5Z on the expression of TAK1, Snail, and intercellular junction proteins in IAV-infected mice. 5Z treatment blocked H5N1 virus-induced TAK1 phosphorylation in the lung tissue and restored the expression of E-cadherin, occludin, and claudin-1 (Fig. 9a). 5Z treatment did not affect the levels of the NP protein of H5N1 viruses in the lung tissue (Fig. 9a). IF staining revealed that occludin and claudin-1 expression was significantly decreased in the intercellular junctions of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively, in the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice (Fig. 9b). 5Z treatment restored the expression of occludin and claudin-1 in the lung tissue of H5N1 virus-infected mice. 5Z treatment did not significantly change the virus loads in the lung tissue (Fig. 9c). H&E staining revealed widespread edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue of H5N1 virus-infected mice (Fig. 9d). 5Z treatment blocked these pathological changes in H5N1 virus-infected lungs (Fig. 9d). The pathological scores were significantly higher in the IAV-infected lungs than in the uninfected controls. 5Z treatment decreased the pathological scores of the IAV-infected lungs, compared to the untreated controls (Fig. 9e). Finally, we investigated if 5Z treatment had any therapeutic effect. As shown in Fig. 9f, 5Z treatment did not change the bodyweights of H5N1 virus-infected mice, compared to the vehicle controls. 5Z treatment also did not affect the bodyweights of uninfected mice. 5Z treatment did not significantly prolong the survival of H5N1 virus-infected mice (Fig. 9g).Fig. 8: IAV infection activates the TAK1-Itch axis and decreases the levels of epithelial junction proteins in vivo.C57BL/6 mice were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1000 pfu/mouse, 4 mice/group). Forty-eight hours post-infection, mice were sacrificed. The lung tissue was collected and analyzed for TAK1, p38, and ERK phosphorylation and the levels of Itch and the epithelial junction proteins by Western blot with the indicated antibody. The density of the bands from four mice per group was analyzed by using NIH Image-J software and normalized by the arbitrary units of β-actin. Data represent the mean ± SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.Full size imageFig. 9: 5Z suppresses IAV-induced TAK1 phosphorylation and restores the levels of epithelial junction proteins in vivo.a 5Z inhibits H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of intercellular junction proteins.

Mice were left uninfected or infected with H5N1 viruses (1000 pfu/mouse, 4 mice/group) and then treated daily with the same dose of vehicle or 5Z. Mice were sacrificed 48 hr after virus infection.

Mice were weighed and monitored for survival for 16 days. Percent of bodyweight changes f and percent survival g were plotted. *p < 0.05, compared to the untreated controls. h Schematic model of H5N1-induced disruption of intercellular junctions. H5N1 virus activates TAK1 through the Toll-like receptor 3 (TRL3), leading to the activation of p38 and ERK kinases. These kinases induce the expression of Itch, which functions as a ubiquitin ligase to induce occludin ubiquitination and degradation of occludin. Whether Itch mediates the degradation of intercellular junction proteins remains to be investigated. In contrast, H5N1 viruses activate the PI-3 kinase pathway but do not activate p38 and JNK in alveolar epithelial cells. Activation of the Gli1 and Snail transcription factors by H5N1 viruses suppresses the expression of intercellular junction proteins. H5N1 virus infection may also downregulate the levels of intercellular junction proteins in part by inducing the proteasomal degradation of these proteins.Full size imageDiscussionIAV infection impairs the alveolar barrier by disrupting the intercellular junction structure1,39. We recently reported that the H1N1 virus increases the paracellular permeability of the alveolar epithelium in part by activating the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway to downregulate the expression of intercellular junction proteins32. Our present study demonstrates that the H5N1 virus utilized a different strategy to downregulate the expression of intercellular junction proteins. Specifically, our study reveals that H5N1 virus infection activated TAK1 and two downstream MAP kinases, p38 and ERK. Activation of p38 and ERK leads to increased expression of Itch, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinated occludin and potentially other intercellular junction proteins7,8. Ubiquitinated junction proteins were rapidly degraded through the proteasomal pathway. In vivo experiments revealed that H5N1 virus infection induces TAK1 and p38 phosphorylation and increased Itch levels but downregulated intercellular junction proteins in the lung of H5N1 virus-infected mice. Our study highlights the importance of posttranslational regulation of intercellular junction proteins in mediating IAV-induced disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier.It has been long recognized that the expression of intercellular junction proteins can be regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels in cancer cells7,8,40. In particular, the Shh pathway can transcriptionally downregulate the expression of intercellular junction proteins such as E-cadherin in a variety of malignancies41. Emerging evidence suggests that viral infections can also regulate the expression of intercellular junction proteins by Gli1, a transcription factor in the Shh pathway42,43. For example, the hepatitis B (HBV) virus upregulates the expression of Gli1 and its target genes in hepatocytes44,45,46 by stabilizing Gli1 through its X gene47,48. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induce Gli1 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinomas and their tumor cell lines49 and in kidney tissue and glomerular podocytes50, respectively. We and others have shown that the H1N1 virus directly or indirectly activates Gli1 in Drosophila and in mammalian cells, leading to the disruption of their intercellular junctions32,51. Surprisingly, the H5N1 virus did not increase but rather lowered the levels of Gli1 and Snail proteins. Since both H1N1 and H5N1 viruses increased Gli1 and Snail mRNA levels32 (Fig. 1d), we speculate that the decrease of Gli1 and Snail protein levels in H5N1 virus-infected cells is due to their posttranslational regulation. Indeed, both Gli1 and Snail can be ubiquitinated and undergo proteasomal degradation52,53. Notably, although H5N1 virus infection decreased the levels of Gli1 protein, the mRNA levels of its downstream target gene, Snail, were increased. This suggests that Snail could be upregulated by other transcription factors such as NF-κB54, which was indeed activated by TAK1 in H5N1-virus activated A549 cells (Fig. 6b).Itch plays an important role in regulating inflammation and the immune response34,35. Itch activity is positively regulated by JNK and ATM and negatively regulated by the Fyn tyrosine kinase52,55,56. Itch ubiquitinates numerous substrates including Gli1, c-Jun, JunB, SuFu, B-Raf, p73, and p6352,55,56. We recently reported that H5N1 but not H1N1 virus activates JNK33,57. Interestingly, H1N1 viruses induce Gli1 expression32, whereas H5N1 viruses induced Gli1 degradation (Fig. 1a). These observations suggest that, while H5N1 virus only increased the levels of Itch protein weakly or modestly, Itch activity can be further increased by JNK-mediated phosphorylation and ATM activation. Moreover, we found that Itch was required for H5N1 virus-induced ubiquitination and degradation of occludin. This observation is in line with a prior study showing that Itch interacts with occludin and induces its ubiquitination and degradation58. VEGF stimulates occludin phosphorylation at serine 490 and promotes Itch-mediated ubiquitination9. Since inhibition of Itch expression also blocked H5N1 virus-induced E-Cadherin, claudin-1, and ZO-1, it appears that Itch may also downregulate the expression of these junction proteins as well as Gli1 and Snail by ubiquitination and degradation. It should be noted that in addition to the transcriptional regulation and post-translational modification, the expression of these intercellular proteins could also be controlled at the translational level by accelerating cellular mRNA degradation and the shutoff of protein biosynthesis. It is unlikely that H5N1 virus infection lowered the levels of cellular proteins by inducing cell death since A549 cells do not undergo necroptosis59, and inhibition of apoptosis by Z-VAD-FMK (Z-Vad), a pan-caspase inhibitor, did not restore the levels of intercellular proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2). Nevertheless, our study suggests unambiguous evidence that Itch plays a crucial role in downregulating occludin expression.In addition to suppressing the expression of various cellular proteins, Itch activation by the PI-3 kinase pathway in H1N1 virus-infected A549 cells supports IAV replication60. Though H5N1 viruses do not activate the PI-3 kinase pathway (Fig. 9h) but can induce Itch expression and activate it through TAK1. However, Itch knockdown did not change the levels of the viral proteins in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 3b) nor the virus titers in the conditioned media (Fig. 3c). In contrast, Su et al60 reported that Itch inhibition slows down IAV replication. The discrepancy is likely because the dose of H5N1 virus used to infect A549 cells was much higher than that used by Su et al.60. In addition, H5N1 virus replicates much faster than H1N1 virus.The MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in destabilizing tight junction structure by down-regulating the expression of intercellular junction proteins61. For example, activation of the ERK kinase pathway in HIV-infected human brain endothelial cells and in Endophilin-1-stimulated endothelial cells results in decreased ZO-1 and occludin expression62,63. Our recent study suggests that the H1N1 virus downregulates the expression of intercellular junction proteins in part by ERK-activated Gli1 (Fig. 9h)32. Our present study shows that H5N1 viruses induced Gli1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1d). However, Gli1 protein levels in H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells were not correspondingly increased but rather decreased, probably resulting from Itch-mediated ubiquitination and accelerated degradation. Nevertheless, we found that U0126, a MEK inhibitor, was able to block H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression. This suggests that ERK activation by the H5N1 virus contributes to the downregulation of intercellular junction proteins by inducing Itch expression. Along this line, p38, another MAP kinase, was activated by the H5N1 virus. Inhibition of p38 activity by SB202190 blocked H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and junction protein downregulation. Consistent with this observation, Jia et al.36 recently reported that p38 activation is required for Itch upregulation and occludin downregulation in the testis-blood barrier in Sertoli cells treated with the polychlorinated biphenyls mixture aroclor 1254, a group of environmental endocrine-disrupting compounds. Since JNK activates Itch64,65, H5N1 but not H1N1 virus activates JNK (Fig. 9h)33,57, one would anticipate that JNK activation contributes to Itch activation in H5N1 virus-infected cells. Unexpectedly, we found that SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, did not affect H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of intercellular junction proteins (Fig. 5f). It remains an enigma why inhibition of JNK activity, which should downregulate Itch activity, did not lead to the restoration of intercellular junction proteins (Fig. 9h).TAK1 is a serinehreonine kinase that can be activated by viral proteins or by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. For example, the Vpr protein and the gp41 glycoprotein of HIV-1 can bind and directly activate TAK1, leading to NF-κB activation and increased virus replication66,67. The A52 protein of poxvirus interacts with TRAF6 to indirectly activate TAK1, leading to p38 but not NF-κB activation68. The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the Epstein–Barr virus binds and activates TAK1, leading to JNK activation69. We recently reported that the H5N1 virus activates TAK1, leading to increased JNK phosphorylation and autophagy57. Wang et al. recently reported that TLR signaling by poly(I:C) or viral double-stranded RNA induces TAK1T187/S192 phosphorylation and its activation70,71. Our prior study suggests that the NS1 protein of H5N1 viruses can activate TAK1 by an unknown mechanism57. Our additional study herein shows that transfection with an expression vector encoding the NS1 gene of H5N1 virus led to the downregulation of occludin and claudin-1 but not E-cadherin and ZO-1 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Mechanistically, TAK1 activation by the H5N1 virus led to p38, ERK, and JNK activation, and that p38 and ERK kinases were required for the H5N1 virus-induced Itch expression and intercellular junction protein downregulation. These observations collectively suggest that TAK1 activation plays a central role in H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of some intercellular proteins.TAK1 activates diverse signaling pathways including NF-κB activation, necroptosis, inflammation, innate immunity, and autophagy37,38. Our in vivo investigation reveals that 5Z treatment did not affect the levels of viral proteins and virus loads in lung tissues nor alleviated the bodyweight loss and prolonged the survival of H5N1 virus-infected mice. The beneficial effect of 5Z treatment on the integrity of intercellular junctions and alveolar permeability is likely complicated by the anti-inflammatory response of NF-κB inhibition and the pro-inflammatory response of necroptosis. In addition, 5Z treatment may also interfere with innate and adaptive immunity against viral infections. Use of a TAK1 inhibitor as adjuvant antiviral therapy to improve lung functions does not seem appealing.We are aware that several questions remain unanswered in our current study. The first is the mechanism of H5N1 virus-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and claudin-1. While our study suggests that these two proteins are subject to posttranslational regulation in H5N1 virus-infected cells, and Itch appears to be responsible for H5N1 virus-induced degradation of E-cadherin and claudin-1, definitive evidence is lacking. Overexpression of TAK1 led to decreased levels of occludin and claudin-1 but did not significantly decrease E-cadherin expression; whereas overexpression of Itch only significantly decreased occludin expression. The second unanswered question is if Itch activity in H5N1 virus-infected cells is regulated by JNK. While several studies have shown that JNK can phosphorylate Itch at T222 and activate it64,65, it is not clear why inhibition of JNK activity by SP600125 did not block H5N1 virus-induced occludin degradation in our study; Third, the mechanisms of H5N1 virus-induced Gli1 and Snail downregulation remain unknown. Itch has been shown to ubiquitinate Gli1 in cancer cells52,53, whether this is the case in H5N1-infected cells needs to be proved.In summary, our study provides evidence that the H5N1 virus increases Itch expression in vitro and in the lung tissue of H5N1 virus-infected mice. Itch ubiquitinates occludin and its degradation. Downregulation of these junction proteins leads to the disruption of the intercellular junction structure and increased paracellular permeability in the alveolar epithelial barrier (Fig. 9h). Mechanistic studies revealed that increased Itch expression was mediated through TAK1-activated p38 and ERK kinases. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of IAV-induced downregulation of alveolar junction proteins and improves our understanding of the pathogenesis of H5N1 virus infections in lung tissue.MethodsReagentsSB202190 (#154447-36-6) and U0126 (#1173097-76-1) were purchased from Selleck (Shanghai, China). 5Z (#253863-19-3) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.

Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. A/mallard/Huadong/S/2005 (SY strain, H5N1), A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 (CK10 strain, H5N1), and A/goose/Guangdong/Y6/2015 (Y6 strain, H5N6) have been reported previously73,74,75. These viruses were prepared by inoculating 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonic chicken eggs. The virus titers were determined by a 10-fold serial dilution (101 to 109, and each dilution (105–109) in MDCK. The 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID50/100 μl) values were determined by using the standard Reed and Muench method.AnimalsAnimal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yangzhou University (Approval number #SYXY-23; date of approval: March 5, 2019) and carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Research Council. C57BL/6 mice (female, 6-8 weeks) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center at Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, China). 5Z stock was prepared by dissolving it in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted in PBS prior to use. Twelve hours prior to drug administration, mice were pre-treated once by i.p. injection of 5Z at the dose of 2 mg/kg body weight. Control mice were treated with the vehicle. Mice were then deprived of water 4 h before virus infection. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital administration (100 mg/kg body weight) and then infected with H5N1 virus (1000 PFU/mouse in 50 μl saline) intranasally. Mice were treated with the vehicle or the same dose of 5Z for two days. Forty-eight hours after virus infection, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. One part of the lung tissue was lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (weight/volume, 1:50) and analyzed for the indicated proteins by Western blot. A second part of the lung tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and embedded in paraffin within 48 h after fixation. The sections of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were dehydrated and rehydrated as described previously76 and then stained with anti-occludin (mouse mAb) and claudin-1 (rabbit mAb), followed by staining with Alex488-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (1:100), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. Normal rabbit and mouse IgG were used as the negative controls. Finally, the sections were stained with 10 μL DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 5 min. After washing the cells in PBS, fluorescent images were captured under a Nikon fluorescence microscope.To determine the therapeutic effect of 5Z, mice (6-8-wks-old, 9-11 mice per group) infected with H5N1 virus as above were treated daily with 5Z (2 mg/kg body weight in 100 μL PBS) by intraperitoneal injection for 7 days. Mice were monitored daily for body weights and survival for 18 days and were humanely sacrificed by CO2 inhalation when they became moribund or when the loss of body weight decreased by > 30%.HistopathologyThe sections (5 µm) of lung tissue blocks were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Pathologic lesions were graded by using a semi-quantitative histology scoring system in a blinded fashion as previously described77,78. The severity of lesions was graded on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 for none or very minor, 1 for mild, 2 for intermediate, 3 for moderately severe, and 4 for severe and widespread) based on the following criteria: (1) bronchiolitis (integrity of airway epithelium, necrotic bodies or denudation of airway epithelial lining); (2) inflammation (infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes): (3) alveolitis (damaged alveolar epithelial cells or denuded epithelial lining); (4) interstitial inflammation (inflammation in the alveoli or thickening of the alveolar interstitium); (5) hemorrhage (presence of erythrocytes in the alveolar air space, damaged capillaries and hemorrhagic effusions in the damaged areas); (6) edema (presence of proteinaceous material in the alveolar air space).Real-time quantitative PCR analysisTotal RNA was extracted from A549 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). RNA integrity was verified by electrophoresis. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit and SYBR Green Supermix (Takara, Dalian, China). The sequences of primers for Gli1: 5′-TTCCTACCAGAGTCCCAAGT-3′, 5′-CCCTATGTGAAGCCCTATTT-3′; Snail: 5′-GGACCCACACTGGCGAGAAG-3′, 5′-ATTCGGGAGAAGGTCCGAGC-3′; E-Cadherin: 5′-CGGGAATGCAGTTGAGGATC-3′, 5′-AGGATGGTGTAAGCGATGGC-3′; Occludin: 5′-CCCTTTTAGGAGGTAGTGTAGGC-3′, 5′-CCGTAGCCATAGCCATAACCA-3′; Claudin-1: 5′-GTGGAGGATTTACTCCTATGCCG-3′, 5′-ATCAAGGCACGGGTTGCTT-3′. Amplification of human GAPDH was included as a control. All expression levels were normalized to GAPDH levels in the same sample. Fold change was calculated by the ΔΔCT method. Percent expression was calculated as the ratio of the normalized value of each sample to that of the corresponding untreated control sample. All Real-Time RT-PCR analyses were performed in triplicate.Western blotCells grown in 6-well plates were harvested and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell lysates were prepared by spinning down at 4 °C, 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies (1:1000 or 1:2000) against the proteins of interest, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) and SuperSignal Western Pico enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). The density of the bands was analyzed by using NIH Image-J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and normalized by the arbitrary units of their corresponding total proteins or β-actin as indicated. Quantified results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) from three experiments in bar graphs.Gene silencingA549 cells seeded in a 6-well plate were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were left uninfected or infected with the H5N1 virus and incubated for 24 h. Cells were harvested and analyzed for the expression of TAK1, Itch, and other relevant proteins by Western blot. The conditioned media from H5N1 virus-infected cells were analyzed for virus titers by measuring the TCID50 values.Immunofluorescence stainingA549 cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well flat-bottomed plates and treated with H5N1 virus or pretreated with 5Z (5 µM) for 30 min followed by infection with H5N1 virus for 12 h. The cells were fixed with 100% methanol at -20 °C for 20 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and washed three times with PBS. The fixed cells were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking buffer in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then with anti-occludin and anti-claudin-1 antibodies (1:100) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, the cells were washed in blocking buffer and stained with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (1:100), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were stained with 10 μΜ DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 5 min. After washing the cells in PBS, fluorescent images were captured under a Nikon fluorescence microscope.Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)A549 monolayer grown in Transwell filter units (3-μm-diameter pores, Corning, New York, NY, USA) were left uninfected or infected with 1 MOI of H5N1 virus and then incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated inhibitors. The monolayers were analyzed for transepithelial resistance (Epithelial Volt-‘Ohm Meter, Millipore, St. Louis, MO) at the indicated time after virus infection. The measured values were calculated by multiplying the measured electrical resistance by the area of the filter. The results represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.Statistics and reproducibilityThe differences in mRNA levels and Western blot band densities in the cells left uninfected or infected with H5N1 virus in the absence or presence of various treatments were statistically analyzed by using an unpaired Student t test. Statistical analyses were carried out based on the data that represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The differences in the half-life of intercellular junction proteins and in TEER values between the uninfected A549 cells and H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells in the absence or presence of the indicated inhibitors were statistically analyzed by using a one-way ANOVA. Data represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. The differences in the infiltration scores in the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice (n = 4) left untreated or treated with 5Z were analyzed by using an unpaired Student t test. Differences in the bodyweights of untreated and 5Z-treated mice were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA test (n = 10). Differences in the survival of untreated and 5Z-treated mice were statistically analyzed by using a Log-Rank test (n = 10). A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistics were performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software 8.0 (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Here, we investigated the effects of MDAs on a targeted antigen delivery vaccine (TADV), which is developed by conjugating H9 subtype avian influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) antigen to single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies specific for the chicken antigen presenting cell receptor CD83. Groups of 1-day-old chickens carrying high levels of MDAs (MDA++) and 14-day old chickens carrying medium levels of MDAs (MDA+) were immunised with TADV (rH9HA-CD83 scFv), untargeted rH9HA or inactivated H9N2 vaccines. Immunogenicity in these vaccinated chickens was compared using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The results showed that the TADV (rH9HA-CD83 scFv) induced significantly higher levels of H9HA-specific antibody titres compared to the untargeted rH9HA and inactivated H9N2 vaccines in MDA++ and MDA+ chickens. Overall, the data demonstrates immune responses induced by TADV are not affected by the MDA in chickens.

Outbreaks of low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) and high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have resulted in severe economic losses to the poultry industry due to expenses associated with culling and quarantine, emergency vaccination programmes and loss of consumer confidence2,3,4. Despite years of research and control efforts, the number and severity of AIV outbreaks continue to increase around the world5. Surveillance and strict biosecurity are the key first line of defence against AIV. However, the biosecurity systems of current poultry farms are being repeatedly compromised and continued incursion of novel strains are causing disease outbreaks6. Therefore, vaccination is used as an additional measure to control AIV. Experimental and field studies have shown that vaccines can protect against clinical signs and death, reduce shedding of virus, and prevent contact transmission of the virus7,8,9. Previously, blanket vaccination against AIV was primarily used in enzootic countries like Vietnam, Egypt and Indonesia however, nowadays more targeted and risk-based strategies are used to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of the vaccination programmes10. The enzootic prevalence of H9N2 LPAIV across Asia, Middle East and North Africa has resulted in the routine AIV vaccination programmes using inactivated AIV vaccines in several countries in this region11,12,13. Furthermore, the prevalence of Asian lineage H5Nx HPAIV has compelled many countries to enforce AIV vaccination policies. In the European Union, “preventive” vaccination against H5 viruses has been allowed in outdoor poultry14. As a consequence, progeny chickens from vaccinated hens will have maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) in the first few weeks after hatch15.The MDAs are vertically transferred from mothers to the hatching progeny16. In chickens, serum IgY antibodies (functional equivalent of mammalian IgG) are transported from the hen’s blood stream into the oocyte (which becomes the egg yolk) through a specific receptor that recognises the Fc domain17,18. During the embryo development, the IgY antibodies are transported from the egg yolk into the embryo’s systemic circulation through receptor-mediated transcytosis19,20. This transport of IgY antibodies has been documented as early as seven days into incubation, and peaks towards the last couple of days before hatch21,22. Such MDAs passed through the egg to the hatching progeny (passive immunity) are important for immunity against pathogens in the neonatal stage, when immunocompetence is not fully developed in the chicks23,24,25. Furthermore, MDAs avoid the energetic cost of fighting off infections by the offspring and allow chicks to retain energy for growth and further development of the immune system26,27. However, MDAs can often interfere with the vaccination of young chickens by masking the specific epitopes of the vaccine antigen and thus, reducing the antigen presentation28. Additionally, it has been shown that B cell activation can be inhibited through a cross-link between B cell receptors (BCR) and the Fcγ-receptors IIB present on B cells by vaccine-MDA complexes29. This affects the induction of active immune responses following vaccination30. Several studies have reported poor induction of antibody titres after vaccination of chickens with MDAs31,32,33. Therefore, MDA interference is of major concern for the poultry industry, as it is one of the reasons for the failure of various poultry vaccines.The majority of commercially available AIV vaccines are inactivated whole influenza vaccines, largely produced in embryonated hen’s eggs. The use of such conventional inactivated vaccines remains a challenge due to the need for repeated administration, difficulty in differentiating infected from the vaccinated animals (DIVA) and interference from MDAs14. Various strategies have been developed in the recent years to overcome these challenges and enhance the overall immunogenicity of vaccines. One such strategy is the recombinant targeted antigen delivery vaccine (TADV) whereby protective antigens are selectively delivered to professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DC), macrophages and B cells34. Such antigen targeting can be done by either chemically conjugating the antigen to monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for selected APC receptors or by genetic engineering in which the antigen is fused to antibody fragments such as single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies specific for the APC receptors35. Several studies have explored antibody-based antigen targeting to mammalian APC’s via Dec205, CD11c, CD40, Clec9A and MHC II receptors36,37,38,39,40. The first in-human study of a protein vaccine targeting APCs was conducted with CDX-1401 vaccine (Celldex Therapeutics Inc., New Haven, Connecticut, USA) which is an anti-cancer vaccine targeting the human Dec205 receptor. This vaccine was proven to be safe and efficacious in phase I of clinical trials41. Moreover, the first antigen targeting study in seronegative chickens was also directed towards Dec205 receptor which showed a strong antibody response as early as fourteen days after priming42. Recently, we developed a recombinant subunit AIV vaccine by selectively targeting haemagglutinin (HA) antigen of H9N2 AIV to chicken CD83 receptors using single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies43. The recombinant H9HA Foldon-CD83 scFv vaccine (hereinafter referred to as rH9HA-CD83 scFv) was proven efficacious in specific pathogen free (SPF) birds, conferring faster and higher antibody response, as well as a robust protection against clinical signs, and a higher reduction of virus shedding compared to the untargeted H9HA Foldon vaccine (hereinafter referred to as rH9HA)43. The aim of the present work was to investigate the impact of MDAs on the immunogenicity of rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines. Here, progeny chickens were generated with H9HA-specific MDAs and vaccinated with rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv either at day-1 or day-14 post hatch. In addition, the immunogenicity of rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv was also compared with inactivated whole A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008 (UDL 01/08) H9N2 virus vaccine (hereinafter referred to as inactivated H9N2 vaccine) in day-14 old MDA positive chickens.ResultsAntibody response in mother hens vaccinated with inactivated H9N2 vaccineThe SPF White Leghorn Layer hens (n = 40) were vaccinated thrice with inactivated H9N2 vaccine. Blood samples were collected at different time points post vaccination for serological monitoring of anti-H9HA antibodies using a standard haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. The first blood sampling was carried out at 2 weeks post second vaccine dose (~5 weeks post first dose) where the average HI titre of mother hens was 1351 (10.4 log2, Fig. 1). As a significant drop in HI antibody titres was observed in mother hens at 18 weeks post first dose compared to 11 weeks post first dose (p < 0.05), a third dose was given at 24 weeks post first dose. This significantly increased the HI antibody titres in mother hens at the next blood sampling timepoint (29 weeks post first dose, p < 0.01). Following the third dose of vaccine, the HI antibody titres remained consistent until the last blood sampling timepoint (36 weeks post first dose). Fertilised eggs were collected at 36 weeks post first dose, when the average HI antibody titre of mother hens was 4096 (12 log2).Fig. 1: Anti-HA antibody titres measured by HI assay in the serum of mother hens after immunisation with inactivated H9N2 vaccine (UDL 01/08).Hens (White Leghorn) were given prime vaccination at 17 weeks old, and two booster vaccinations at 3 weeks (20 weeks old) and 24 weeks (41 weeks old) post first vaccination (indicated by red arrows). Blood samples were collected at different time points for the serological monitoring of mother hens. The HI titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum causing the total inhibition of 4 HA units of UDL 01/08 H9N2 virus hemagglutination activity. Fertilised eggs were collected at 36 weeks (53 weeks old) post first vaccination. The red box indicates average HI antibody titre of mother hens at the time of laying eggs. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 40) and analysed using paired t-test. The asterisk represents significant difference between the HI antibody titres at 11 and 18 weeks post first vaccine dose, and 18 and 29 weeks post first vaccine dose. **p < 0.01 *p < 0.05.Full size imageAnti-H9HA MDA level in the hatchlings reduces significantly by day 14 post hatchTen hatchlings were sacrificed at 1-day-old and bled to confirm the presence of MDAs. The remaining (n = 10) hatchlings per group were bled weekly until 42-days-old and then biweekly until 84-days-old to monitor the decline in the MDA levels. The hatchlings from vaccinated mother hens showed evidence of MDA titres against H9HA in both HI assay and indirect ELISA assay (Fig. 2). At 1-day-old, the hatchlings had an average HI antibody titre of 588 (9.2 log2) and anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titre of 21600. The titre dropped slightly (not significant) by day 7 post hatch and was more than halved by day 14 post hatch (average HI titre: 181 (7.5 log2), average anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titre:10900). The antibody titres rapidly declined further after that, and by day 35 post hatch the MDA levels were very low (average HI titre: 16 (4 log2), average anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titre: ~1000). After day 42 post hatch until the end of experiment at 84 days of age, MDAs were undetectable in both HI and indirect ELISA assays.Fig. 2: Monitoring the decline of anti-H9HA MDA in the unvaccinated MDA positive control chickens post hatch.a Anti-H9HA MDA measured by HI assay at day 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 70 and 84 post hatch.

Vet, Cat no: FLUH9S-10P) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Antibody titres were calculated as 10(1.3*log10 (Sample/Positive) +3.256). For a and b data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 10) and analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Statistical significance is shown with asterisks. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001.Full size imageThe rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine can overcome the interference of high MDA levels (MDA++) compared to rH9HA vaccineThe 1-day-old hatchlings had an average HI antibody titre of 588 (9.2 log2) and an average anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titre of 21600. Due to these high antibody titres, we designated these chickens as MDA++ (Fig. 2). The chickens in MDA++ groups were immunised at 1-day-old with rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines. Blood samples were collected at different time points post vaccination (pv) to follow the antibody responses in chickens with high MDA levels (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Anti-H9HA antibody titres measured by HI assay in the serum of MDA++ chickens immunised with rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines.The HI titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum causing the total inhibition of 4 HAU of UDL 01/08 H9N2 virus haemagglutination activity.

Statistical significance is shown with asterisks. **p < 0.01 *p < 0.05.Full size imageAt the first blood sampling point (day 14 pv) the rH9HA-CD83 scFv group showed higher HI antibody titres compared to the rH9HA group, although this was not significant (Fig. 3). The HI antibody titres in rH9HA and unvaccinated MDA positive groups steadily decreased after day 14 pv, and were below the predictive protective value of 32 (5 log2)6 by day 35 pv. On the contrary, chickens in rH9HA-CD83 scFv group showed an initial decline in HI antibodies until day 28 pv. However, the antibody titres rapidly increased after day 35 pv until the last blood sampling point (day 84 pv). The average HI antibody titre in rH9HA-CD83 scFv group on day 84 pv was 832 (9.7 log2) (Fig. 3).The results obtained from an indirect anti-H9 HA ELISA were very similar to the HI test; there were no significant differences in the anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titres between rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv groups at day 14 pv (Fig. 4). The antibody titres also showed gradual decline in both the vaccinated groups by day 35 pv. However, at day 35 pv, significantly higher anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titres were recorded in rH9HA-CD83 scFv group compared to the rH9HA group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, no anti-H9HA antibodies were detected in most of the chickens in rH9HA group after day 35 pv. Moreover, the chickens in rH9HA-CD83 scFv group presented a rise in the anti-H9HA antibodies after day 35 pv until the last blood sampling point (day 84 pv), mirroring the results observed in the HI assay. This concludes that targeting HA antigen via CD83 scFv significantly increases the vaccine immunogenicity compared to the untargeted HA antigen thus, reducing the susceptibility to MDAs.Fig. 4: Anti-H9HA antibody titres measured by indirect ELISA assay in the serum of MDA++ chickens immunised with rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines.The anti-H9HA antibodies were measured using ID Screen® Influenza H9 Indirect kit (ID.

These chickens were designated as MDA+. The chickens in MDA+ groups were vaccinated at day 14 old with inactivated H9N2 vaccine, rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines. Blood samples were collected at different time points after vaccination to follow the antibody responses in chickens with medium MDA levels.Unlike the MDA++ group, the chickens in the MDA+ rH9HA-CD83 scFv group showed a rise in the HI antibody titres after day 14 pv, and by the last blood sampling point (day 56 pv), the titres were significantly higher than the inactivated H9N2 vaccine and rH9HA groups (p < 0.001, Fig. 5). On the contrary, there was no rise in the HI antibody titres in inactivated H9N2 vaccine and rH9HA groups after day 14 pv. Moreover, the anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titres also showed a similar trend (Fig. 6). The rH9HA-CD83 scFv group demonstrated a strong and steady increase in the anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titres after day 14 pv and the titres were significantly higher than the inactivated H9N2 vaccine and rH9HA groups starting at day 21 pv (p < 0.01), day 28 pv (p < 0.001), day 35 pv (p < 0.0001), day 42 pv (p < 0.0001) and day 56 pv (p < 0.0001).Fig. 5: Anti-H9HA antibody titres measured by HI assay in the serum of MDA+ chickens vaccinated with inactivated H9N2 vaccine, rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv.The HI titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum causing the total inhibition of 4 HA units of UDL 01/08 H9N2 virus haemagglutination activity.

This suggests that the rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine carries almost equal potency in the MDA positive birds vaccinated either at day 1 or day 14 of age. However, more rapid increase in the antibody titres with rH9HA-CD83 scFv in MDA+ group (after day 14 pv) was seen compared to MDA++ group (after day 35 pv) (Figs. 3–6).DiscussionEarly age chickens with MDAs mount less of an immune response to vaccines compared to those that lack MDAs specific to the antigens constituted in the vaccines. Currently, there is no data available that describe the impact of MDAs on the immunogenicity of recombinant subunit poultry AIV vaccines. Here, we evaluated the ability of recombinant subunit AIV vaccines to overcome MDA interference by using scFv antibodies that target protective antigens to APCs. Using this approach, we developed TADV by conjugating HA antigen of H9N2 virus to scFv antibodies specific for chicken APCs (CD83) receptor. The rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine induced a high antibody response and a robust protection against clinical signs after H9N2 virus challenge43. To evaluate the ability of rH9HA-CD83 scFv inducing robust immune responses in chickens with MDAs, we produced MDA positive chickens by vaccinating hens White Leghorn with three doses of inactivated H9N2 vaccine (UDL 01/08) adopting commercial vaccination schedule for layer flocks44. The progeny chickens from the vaccinated laying hens showed an average HI antibody titre of 588 (9.2 log2) at 1-day-old, which was approximately 7-fold lower than the serum HI antibody titre detected in the mothers (average HI:4096 (12 log2)), consistent with previous observations32,44. The hatchlings displayed a significant drop in the HI antibody titre on day 14 post hatch, and by day 35 post hatch 90% of the chickens showed HI antibody titre below the predicted protective value (HI > 32 (5 log2))6. A similar trend was observed in the decline of anti-H5HA MDAs in broilers having an average HI titre of 548 (9 log2) at 1-day-old45. A previous study performed in White Leghorn layers with adjuvanted inactivated H7N3 virus vaccine showed a decrease in MDA-derived HI titres below predicted protective value (HI > 32 (5 log2)) by day 14 post hatch44. Furthermore, another study using inactivated H5N1 virus vaccine in broiler chickens, displayed a significant decrease in MDA-derived HI titres between day 3 and day 14 post hatch32,46. Likewise, hatchlings from Lohmann layer flocks vaccinated with an oil emulsion inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine showed MDAs for 3–4 weeks post hatch31. These differences observed in the decline of MDAs in progeny chickens could be attributed to (i) vaccine antigen and formulation (ii) vaccination protocol (iii) the time between immunisation of hens and collection of eggs (iv) number of antibodies present in mother hens during egg laying and (v) chicken breed.To evaluate the impact of MDAs on the immunogenicity of TADV, the chickens with high H9HA-specific MDA (MDA++, 1-day-old, average HI:588 (9.2 log2)) and medium H9HA-specific MDA (MDA+, 14-day-old, average HI:181 (7.5 log2)) were vaccinated with rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv) vaccines. A whole inactivated H9N2 vaccine was also included for comparison in MDA+ group vaccinated at 14-day-old, as 1-day-old vaccination of such vaccine in MDA+ chickens has been previously reported with vaccine failure47. In both MDA++ and MDA+ groups, the induction of antibodies after vaccination with rH9HA vaccine was markedly inhibited. Similarly, in MDA+ group the induction of antibodies after vaccination with the inactivated H9N2 vaccine was also inhibited. However, the rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine was lesser impacted by both high and medium MDA levels, with HI and anti-H9HA ELISA antibody titres significantly increasing after day 35 pv (MDA++) and day 14 pv (MDA+). Furthermore, a long-lasting antibody response (at least 3 months) was observed when MDA++ chickens were vaccinated with rH9HA-CD83 scFv at 1-day-old. Moreover, a direct comparison between the amount of HA protein in the inactivated H9N2 vaccine and recombinant subunit vaccines could not be made. However, 35 μg of rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv (equimolar concentration) displayed haemagglutination titre of approximately 256 haemagglutination units (HAU) which is four-fold lower than that present in a single dose of inactivated H9N2 vaccine given to the chickens (1024 HAU).Previously, live vector vaccines have exhibited variable sensitivity to MDAs48. For example, Herpesvirus of Turkey (HVT) expressing AIV HA protein has demonstrated less sensitivity to MDAs and shown to protect chickens even in the presence of MDAs45,49. However, other vectors such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV)46 and fowl pox virus (FPV) have shown to be more sensitive to MDAs50. One of the reasons for HVT overcoming the MDA interference is its ability to replicate in a highly cell-associated manner in lymphocytes which could provide a pathway that can stimulate cell-mediated immunity (CMI)51,52. Furthermore, HVT can establish a persistent viremia in chickens for at least 8 weeks following vaccination53, continuously expressing the foreign antigen in vivo. This can induce long-lasting immunity even in the presence of MDAs54. Moreover, MDAs are shown to exert more inhibition of T helper 2 (Th2)-biased IgG1 than T helper 1 (Th1)-biased IgG2a B cell priming54. The inactivated vaccines and recombinant subunit vaccines are known to primarily induce Th2 immunity55. Hence, they are thought to be more sensitive to MDA interference. This observation was evident in the present study whereby the immunogenicity of inactivated H9N2 vaccine and recombinant rH9HA vaccine was affected by MDAs. Surprisingly, recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine was able to overcome the MDA interference. The selective targeting of HA antigen to chicken CD83 receptor has shown to stimulate splenocytes in vitro for the production of IFN-γ. Additionally, rH9HA-CD83 scFv has also shown to induce a strong antibody response in vivo. This indicates that rH9HA-CD83 scFv could potentially induce both Th1 and Th2 immune responses43. The ability of rH9HA-CD83 scFv to induce Th1 response could have also contributed to its lesser susceptibility to MDA interference. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that vaccines can stimulate B cells for antibody production even in the presence of MDAs if they can stimulate type I interferon (IFN-α)30. IFN-α can bind to both interferon receptor and complement receptor 2 (CR2) on B cells. This dual receptor usage leads to a strong positive signal stimulating antibody secretion by B cells even in the presence of MDAs56. Thus, vaccines containing adjuvants like LPS and CpG oligonucleotides are able to breakthrough MDAs30,57. However, stimulation of chicken splenocytes in vitro by rH9HA-CD83 scFv showed no induction of IFN-α (Supplementary Fig. 1). Another mechanism reported for overcoming the MDAs is through IgM antibodies. It has been reported that antigen-specific IgM antibodies can form a complex with a vaccine antigen and complement protein (C3d), cross-linking the B cell receptor and CR2. Such cross-linking has shown to stimulate B cells in vitro even in the presence of inhibitory IgG30,58. Hence, it is possible that vaccines can overcome MDA interference if they can induce higher antigen-specific IgM antibodies. A higher induction of anti-HA IgM antibodies was observed with rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine compared to inactivated H9N2 vaccine and rH9HA vaccine in SPF chickens43. Therefore, this could be a potential mechanism by which rH9HA-CD83 scFv can overcome MDAs. However, the exact mechanism needs to be further investigated. Overall, the results also indicate that rH9HA-CD83 scFv is highly stable even in the presence of MDAs, unlike rH9HA and inactivated virus vaccines which are easily cleared out. This high stability of rH9HA-CD83 scFv could also explain the rise in antibody titres after the decline in MDAs.In enzootic countries like Egypt, inactivated AIV vaccines are administered to day 1–5 old broilers47. Hatchery vaccination regimes are administered at a preferable 1-day-old to optimise vaccine coverage and achieve early age flock immunity with the use of less resources59. However, immunisation of 1-day-old chickens with an inactivated vaccine has faced difficulties in developing good immune responses due to the interference from MDAs, resulting in vaccine failure47. The level of MDAs present in chickens at the time of vaccination is a key determinant for the success/failure of the vaccines. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal age of vaccination according to 1-day-old MDA titres. Studies have reported that vaccination of MDA positive chickens with inactivated AIV vaccine at 7–10 day-old (when MDA titre is low) results in higher immune response and protection compared to 1-day-old vaccination33. Several studies have demonstrated the limited value of maternal immunity in protection against AIV infection32,33. In some cases, progeny chickens from the vaccinated hens were partially protected from HPAI H5N1 infection only up to 2 weeks after hatch33. Hence, it is necessary to vaccinate chickens early, even in the presence of high MDAs to reduce the gap in immunity due to the decline of MDAs and delay in the onset of an active immunity60. Therefore, there is a high demand for vaccines that can be administered to 1-day-old chickens to induce an early immune response in high-risk situation. The results from the present study provide evidence that a single dose of the rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine can overcome the effects of high MDA levels when administered to 1-day-old chickens. Furthermore, it can also be administered to MDA positive chickens at later age (14-day-old), in situations where 1-day-old vaccination is not applicable.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that TADV e.g., recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv developed by selectively targeting chicken APC receptors induced significantly higher antibody responses in MDA positive chickens compared to the inactivated whole H9N2 AIV vaccine. Therefore, TADV can be regarded as the next generation of poultry vaccine that can overcome the MDA interference. However, further studies are required to test the protective efficacy of TADV against the virus challenge and field performance in the face of MDA in chickens.MethodsEthics statementAll animal studies and procedures were carried out in strict accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU on the use of animals for scientific research. All animal work was approved by the central committee on animal trials (Centrale Commissie Dierproeven (CCD)) in the Netherlands.Viruses, eggs and chickensA/chicken/Pakistan/UDL 01/2008 H9N2 virus (The Pirbright institute, UK) was used in developing the inactivated H9N2 vaccine.SPF embryonated chicken eggs (VALO BioMedia) were used for the propagation of UDL 01/08 H9N2 virus.SPF White Leghorn layer chickens were used for the generation of MDA positive hatchlings. All chickens were housed in isolation rooms with floor pens. All chickens were given food and water ad libitum for the duration of the experiment.Vaccine preparationTwo recombinant subunit vaccines; rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv were produced in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider’s (S2) cells and purified using His-tag affinity chromatography56. The HA protein used for making both the recombinant subunit vaccines have 98% amino acid sequence similarity to HA of UDL 01/08 H9N2 virus (GenBank accession number: ACP50708.1, HA1: 19–338 and HA2: 339–560). The inactivated H9N2 vaccine was made by propagating UDL 01/08 virus in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was inactivated chemically using 0.1% β-Propiolactone (BPL, Alfa Aesar) and three blind passages were performed in 10-day old SPF embryonated chicken eggs to confirm inactivation. This was followed by ultracentrifugation at 207,600 × g for 2 h at 4 °C for virus concentration. Both the recombinant subunit vaccines and inactivated H9N2 vaccine were formulated as water-in-oil emulsion. The HA titre of inactivated H9N2 vaccine after formulation was 1040 haemagglutination units (HAU)/ml and 5120 HAU/ml for immunisation of mother hens and MDA positive chickens, respectively. All vaccines were stored at 4 °C until needed.Vaccination of mother hens and generation of hatchlings with H9HA-specific MDAA group (n = 40) of SPF hens (White Leghorn) were immunised with 0.5 ml of inactivated H9N2 vaccine (UDL 01/08) containing 520 HAU/dose. The inactivated H9N2 vaccine was administered by the intramuscular route in the leg muscle. The first dose of vaccine was given to the hens at 17 weeks of age (T = 0 weeks post first dose), followed by second and third doses at 20 weeks of age (T = 3 weeks post first dose) and 41 weeks of age respectively (T = 24 weeks post first dose, Fig. 7). Blood samples were collected from the wing vein of the hens at 5, 11, 18, 29 and 36 weeks after first dose for serological monitoring. Five roosters were included only for egg fertilisation purpose, and therefore were not part of the actual study. Fertilised eggs were collected at 36 weeks after first dose (~11 weeks post third dose) and set to incubate until hatch. At this time point the mother hens (53 weeks of age) contained an average serum HI antibody titre of 4096 (12 log2). Ten hatchlings were sacrificed at 1-day-old and blood serum samples were collected to determine the level of MDA in new-born hatchlings at the beginning of the experiment.Fig. 7: Vaccination schedule of mother hens for the generation of anti-H9HA MDA positive offspring.40 SPF White Leghorn layer hens were vaccinated via intramuscular route at 17 weeks old with 0.5 ml of inactivated H9N2 vaccine (UDL 01/08, 520 HAU/dose). Two booster vaccinations were given at 20 weeks of age (T = 3 weeks post first dose) and 41 weeks of age (T = 24 weeks post first dose). Fertilised eggs were collected after 36 weeks post first vaccine dose and set to incubate until hatch.Full size imageVaccination of chickens with anti-H9HA MDA and blood sample collectionThe MDA positive hatchlings were divided into two groups; high MDA positive (HI titre:588 (9.2 log2), MDA++, 1-day-old) and medium MDA positive (HI titre: 181 (7.5 log2), MDA+, 14-day-old) (Fig. 8). Groups of 1-day-old MDA++ chickens (n = 10 per group) were immunised with 0.2 ml of rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines each containing 35 μg of rH9HA protein in equimolar concentration. Furthermore, groups of 14-day-old MDA+ chickens were immunised with 0.2 ml of inactivated H9N2 vaccine (1024 HAU/dose) and 0.2 ml of recombinant rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccines (concentration same as that given to MDA++ groups). A single vaccination was administered to all the groups via the subcutaneous route. Unvaccinated MDA positive chickens were also included in the study to follow the natural decline in anti-H9HA MDA levels. Blood samples were collected from the wing veins of the chickens at 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 70- and 84-days post vaccination. For unvaccinated MDA positive control group, blood samples were also collected from newly hatched and 7-day-old chickens by decapitation.Fig. 8: Vaccination schedule of MDA positive chickens.a Chickens with an anti-H9HA HI antibody titre of 588 (9.2 log2) were designated high MDA positive (MDA++) and vaccinated subcutaneously at 1-day-old with rH9HA (0.2 ml) and rH9HA-CD83 scFv (0.2 ml, 35 μg of rH9HA in equimolar concentration). b Chickens with anti-H9HA HI antibody titre of 181 (7.5 log2) were designated medium MDA positive (MDA+) and vaccinated subcutaneously at 14-day-old with the inactivated H9N2 vaccine (0.2 ml, 1024 HAU/dose), rH9HA (0.2 ml, 35 μg) and rH9HA-CD83 scFv (0.2 ml, 35 μg of rH9HA in equimolar concentration). Blood samples were collected each week post vaccination.Full size imageHaemagglutination inhibition (HI) assayWhole blood was collected from the vaccinated chickens and the sera separated by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The HI assay was performed in V-bottomed microtiter plates following World Health Organisation guidelines61. Briefly, two-fold serial dilution of the serum was prepared by mixing 25 μl of serum with 25 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, 4 HAU (in 25 μl) of UDL 01/08 H9N2 virus was added to the diluted serum and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, 50 μl of 1% chicken red blood cells were added onto the serum-virus mixture and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The HI titres were expressed as reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that causes total inhibition of 4 HAU of virus haemagglutination activity.Indirect H9HA Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The anti-H9HA antibodies in the serum of vaccinated chickens were detected using ID Screen® Influenza H9 Indirect kit (ID. Vet, Cat no: FLUH9S-10P) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1:500 dilution of the serum samples were prepared in the “dilution buffer", provided by the manufacturer. The plates were then incubated at 21 °C for 1 h. After the incubation step, the plates were washed three times with the wash solution provided, and further incubated with 100 μl of anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (1:10 dilution, ID. Vet, Cat no: FLUH9S-10P) at 21 °C for 30 min. Plates were again washed with wash solution, then 100 μl of Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added for 15 min. The reaction was stopped using H2SO4 and read at wavelength 450 nm. Negative and positive controls were provided in the kit and always included in the assay. The test was validated only if the mean value of the positive control optical density (OD) was greater than 0.25, and if the ratio of the mean values of the positive control OD to the negative control OD (ODPC/ODNC) was greater than 3. For each sample, Sample to Positive ratio (S/P) and antibody titre were calculated using Eqs. 1 and 2 respectively. S/P > 0.5 and antibody titre >732 were considered positive.$${{S}}/{{P}}\;{{{\mathrm{ratio}}}}:\,\frac{{\it{S}}}{{\it{P}}} = \frac{{{\it{OD}}_{{\it{{\mathrm{Sample}}}}} - {\it{OD}}_{{\it{NC}}}}}{{{\it{OD}}_{{\it{PC}}} - {\it{OD}}_{{\it{NC}}}}}$$ (1) $${{{\mathrm{Antibody}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{titre}}}}:{\it{log}}_{10}\left( {{{{\boldsymbol{titre}}}}} \right) = 1.3 \times \log _{10}\left( {\frac{{{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}{{{{\boldsymbol{P}}}}}} \right) + 3.256$$ (2) $${\it{{\mathrm{Antibody}}}}\;{\it{{\mathrm{titre}}}} = 10^{{\it{log}}_{10}\left( {{{{\mathrm{titre}}}}} \right)}$$Statistical analysisResults are expressed either as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

In addition to a vaccine for HIV, mRNA is being explored as a potential vehicle to create vaccines for several other conditions.1InfluenzaA messenger RNA (mRNA) influenza vaccine has the potential to improve on the current flu vaccine paradigm. Three mRNA flu vaccines began phase 1 clinical trials in 2020.Together, Sanofi and Translate Bio are investigating a monovalent flu vac- cine candidate for the hemagglutinin protein of the A/H3N2 strain of the in- fluenza virus.2 When the A/H3N2 strain is most dominant, flu activity may be more severe, particularly among at-risk groups, such as older adults and younger children.Pfizer’s phase 1 trial (NCT05052697)3 is evaluating the response to their mRNA flu vaccine in a group of healthy adults between 65 and 85 years across the United States. Participants will randomly receive 1 of 4 dose lev- els of the company’s monovalent vaccine candidate (A or B strain of the virus), 1 of 4 dose levels of the bivalent candidate (A and B strains of the virus), the quadrivalent candidate, or a currently approved quadrivalent flu vaccine.In July 2020, Moderna announced the dosing of the first participants in a phase 1/2 study of mRNA-1010, a quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate4 to eval- uate the safety and immunogenicity of 3 levels of doses of the vaccine targeting hemagglutinin surface proteins from 4 World Health Organization–recom- mended influenza strains. Moderna is also investigating an mRNA candidate (mRNA-1073) combining vaccines for COVID-19 and the flu.5Respiratory syncytial virusPrevious investigations into a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been unsuccessful, with early candidates ultimately strengthening rather than protecting against the disease.6 Currently, no vaccine against RSV exists.Moderna is now studying mRNA-1345,5 an RSV vaccine candidate that uses the same lipid nanoparticle as their COVID-19 vaccine. In late 2021, the company announced interim data7 from a phase 1 trial (NCT04528719) evaluating the tolerability and reactogenicity of mRNA-1345 in groups of par- ticipants between 18 and 49 years, 65 and 79 years, and 12 and 59 months. Results showed that at 1-month post vaccination, 50-μg and 100-μg doses were “generally well tolerated” in the study’s cohort of younger adults. Moderna expects the study to be completed in 2023.CytomegalovirusModerna’s cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate,8 mRNA-1647, combines 6 mRNAs into 1 vaccine aimed at protecting against CMV—a significant unmet need, according to a company press release. CDC estimates suggest 1 in 200 babies are born with CMV, 1 of 5 of whom will experience “devastating sequelae,” such as hearing loss, seizures, and blindness, as well as potential complications later in life.9The phase 3 CMVictory study (NCT05085366) will evaluate safety and efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection in women between 16 and 40 years. Investigators are aiming to enroll 8000 participants (6900 of childbearing age) across 150 global sites.Epstein-Barr virusIn January 2022, Moderna announced10 the dosing of the first candidate in the company’s phase 1 Eclipse study (NCT05164094) of mRNA-1189, an Ep- stein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine candidate. Although EBV—which causes infec- tious mononucleosis—affects “millions of adolescents globally,” there is no vaccine currently available.The goal of mRNA-1189 is to prevent EBV-induced infectious mononucleosis and potentially EVB infection itself. The vaccine contains 4 mRNAs that en- code EBV envelope glycoproteins gH, gL, gp42, and gp220.CancerCancer vaccines are currently being studied both alone and in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Some of these vaccines are personalized11—created for individual patients based on their tumor samples—whereas others target the proteins found in cancer cells more globally.1BioNTech and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals are currently collaborating on an mRNA cancer vaccine for advanced melanoma.12 The vaccine, BNT111, is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04526899). In late 2021, BioNTech was granted an FDA fast track designation based on “available preclinical and clinical data showing the potential of BNT111 to overcome current limitations in the treatment of inoperable therapy-resistant advanced-stage melanoma,” according to a press release.12BioNTech is also collaborating with investigators at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands in the phase 1 OLIVIA clinical trial (NCT04163094)13 to evaluate the W_ova1 mRNA vaccine in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. The first-in-human study is estimated to be completed in late 2023.Boehringer Ingelheim, CureVac, and Ludwig Cancer Research have joinedforces to study mRNA vaccine BI 1361849 (CV9202), a self-adjuvanting mRNA-based immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine to “mobilize the immune system” to fight tumors.”14 It contains 6 mRNAs coded for 6 different antigens commonly expressed in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).14 It is being investigated in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT03164772)15 as a combination treatment with durvalumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab for NSCLC.Moderna is studying at least 3 mRNA vaccines for cancer in clinical trials, 2 of which are personalized. KEYNOTE-942 (NCT03897881) is studying mRNA-4157 as an adjuvant therapy to pembrolizumab in patients with high- risk melanoma.16 KEYNOTE-603 (NCT03313778) is studying the safety, toler- ability, and immunogenicity of mRNA-4157 in patients with solid tumors, both alone in those with resected solid tumors and in combination with pembroli- zumab in those with unresectable solid tumors.17A third Moderna vaccine—mRNA-5671/V941—is in a phase 1 study (NCT03948763)18 as both a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab to target a specific cancer cell protein found in NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.This article was originally published by sister publication Drug Topics.ReferencesBillingsley A.

The study also highlighted the long-lasting seasonal impact of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic on seniors’ flu outcomes. Researchers investigated excess age- and region-specific mortality in the United States between 1999 to 2018 using data from death certificates. The prevalence of H1N1 in flu season appeared to help determine whether RSV or flu would have the upper hand, reported study lead Cécile Viboud, Ph.D., of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues. Flu deaths determined by seasons’ top virus Cécile Viboud, Ph.D.; Image credit: NIH The results revealed a significant decrease in the number of excess influenza deaths among adults aged 65 years or older since 1999. This age group accounted for 75% of excess flu deaths during the study period compared to 90% of excess flu deaths prior to 1999. Investigators attributed this change to the increased use of the highly protective influenza vaccine Fluzone High-Dose licensed in 2009 for use in older adults, and stable vaccination rates over time. In addition, the emergence of influenza A/H1N1 during the 2009 flu pandemic has shifted mortality toward middle-aged adults. Many older adults have had early-life exposure to similar viruses, likely shielding them from severe disease, Viboud and team explained. But they also found large seasonal fluctuations for flu mortality each year, with rates among the elderly rising when influenza A/H3N2 is the dominant virus. RSV testing could help lower high mortality rates Excess RSV mortality, meanwhile, was highest among the 65-and-older age group during the study period. And in seasons when H1N1 is dominant, it was associated with more deaths than flu, the researchers found. Unlike the findings for flu, annual RSV mortality was less variable by season but more so by geographical location. The South Central region had the highest mean rates, while the Pacific Northwest had the lowest, investigators reported. Despite RSV’s substantial association with mortality in seniors, testing for the virus is not widespread, the authors noted. The study results may provide a benchmark to help clinicians and other stakeholders evaluate respiratory virus interventions, including new or improved immunization strategies, they concluded. “A better understanding of RSV testing practices is an important area for future work given recent changes and would provide further evidence to support recommendations for an RSV vaccine and monoclonal antibody products soon to be licensed,” they wrote. Full findings were published in JAMA Network Open.

Some information may no longer be current. A cartoon of a European influenza hospital, J. Braakensiek, 1889 / Wellcome Images “Sneezes for All. That Fashionable Influenza Will Surely Cross the Sea.” On December 13, 1889, this headline—half jest, half warning—was tucked into the top left-hand corner of page seven of the New York Sun. “Europe has an epidemic of influenza,” the (New York) Evening World blared, “but do not be frightened. All agree that this latest fad is not dangerous to life—only annoyingly disagreeable to him who has it and excruciatingly funny to him who has it not.” And so, in the waning days of 1889, tucked between news articles about twenty-cent Christmas trees and the execution of a Japanese man for a rooming-house murder, the first hints of a pandemic were reported to a US public in terms at once reassuring and dismissive. “The first symptom is a sneeze,” the article continued. “Then the nostrils will feel dry. There will be a tightness of the chest. You will cough a dry cough and your throat will be sore. Then you will wonder if life is really worth the bother of living, your spirits will go down, your ambition ooze out at the ends of your fingers and a languor will possess you. You will not care whether school keeps or not for about ten days, then you will brace up, and in another week you will be able to laugh at your neighbor, who is just beginning to sneeze his head off.” The winking irony of the reporting would, in a matter of weeks, abruptly end. Fifteen days after the Evening World’s report, on December 28, 1889, Thomas Smith, a twenty-five-year-old from Canton, Massachusetts, became the United States’ first recorded “Russian flu” fatality. New York was particularly hard hit as Americans received glimpses of the full horror of the pandemic racing across the globe. “Nearly 600 Fatal Cases Reported in Paris in One Day,” read a headline in the New York Sun. “The influenza is spreading and is very fatal,” the article stated, accompanied by dispatches from Paris (“Fully one-third of the populace is prostrate”), Vienna (“The hospitals in this city are crowded with patients suffering from influenza”), Lisbon (“Two thousand have the influenza, including the Queen”), and cities across America. In New York, a famed acrobat in a hit play caught “La Grippe”; his manager received a certificate from his doctor stating that he “would probably not live through the night.” In Boston, 25,000 people were reported sick with the Russian flu, and authorities said that as much as 10 percent of the city’s population had been infected. Ultimately, more than 1,200 New Yorkers and 15,000 people across the United States died in the first few months of 1890. The dead numbered over 1 million around the world. Listen on The Deep Dive The Spanish Flu Rewrote History. Will This Pandemic Do the Same? The North Knows What It’s Like to Fight a Pandemic The Lost Plague It has long been assumed that the Russian flu was just that: an illness caused by an influenza virus. This was a relatively clear-eyed assumption to make. After all, in the absence of any other major respiratory viruses, influenza was the only suspect. There was also the matter of timing. The Russian flu followed on the heels of successive influenza pandemics in 1729, 1781, and 1830, all of which had emerged at roughly fifty-year intervals, a fact that made it rather predictable that a new influenza would strike in the waning decades of the nineteenth century. (Without microscopes powerful enough to see the structures of viruses—the electron microscope was invented in 1931—scientists had only a dim sense of the pathogens causing these recurring flare-ups.) This influenza hypothesis was bolstered nearly thirty years later, after the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3 percent of the world’s population. In the aftermath of the Spanish flu, experts pointed to the Russian flu as its likely viral precursor, a harbinger of doom that humanity had failed to heed. It wasn’t until the SARS epidemic, when a pathogenic human coronavirus was first recorded, that scientists started to question whether the twentieth century’s obsession with the flu might have been misplaced. While it was conceivable that the Russian flu was a precursor to the Spanish flu, the two pandemics produced subtly different symptoms. Perhaps most strikingly, the Russian flu had a peculiar telltale symptom: the loss of smell and taste, which was common among those infected with coronaviruses but not among those with influenza. In 2005, with SARS fresh in his mind, Belgian virologist Marc Van Ranst decided to dig into the origins of HCoV-OC43, a human coronavirus. While our species has become the natural reservoir for OC43, Van Ranst knew that the virus’s closest relative wasn’t a human coronavirus. Instead, OC43 was nearly indistinguishable from—or 98 percent identical to—bovine coronavirus, which infected only cattle. This meant that OC43 almost certainly emerged from sustained contact between coronavirus-infected cattle and human beings. By charting the 2 percent of genomes that differed between the two closely related viruses and then applying a molecular clock analysis to track how long those changes would have taken to arise, Van Ranst was able to pinpoint the moment when the virus first diverged from its most recent viral ancestor and began to infect our species. He was helped in this effort by Susan Weiss, an American microbiologist who had spent the 1980s and ’90s identifying which sections of coronavirus genomes were prone to mutation and how key changes made the viruses less deadly. When he ran the molecular clock analysis on OC43, Van Ranst landed on 1890 as the year it had separated itself from its closest ancestor, bovine coronavirus. Because molecular clock analysis is more reliable the closer the zoonotic leap is to the present, the time period of uncertainty around OC43’s emergence was also relatively narrow: between 1859 and 1912. That’s when Van Ranst realized that the evidence pointed to a coronavirus pandemic hiding in plain sight. The Russian flu was not, in fact, one of the influenza pandemics that regularly appeared every fifty years. Instead, Van Ranst proposed that shifts in the epidemic triangle—a model for tracking infection involving a pathogen, a host, and an environment—leading up to 1890 had caused the ideal conditions for a coronavirus to jump from cattle to humans. Beginning in 1850, cattle across the world began to suffer from a disease that caused fever, respiratory tract infections, and dysentery. Because these livestock were transported cheek by jowl, the infection, known as cattle fever, reached pandemic levels. Fevered cattle, driven across wide prairie expanses or shipped for weeks by boat, would drop dead en route; whole herds were felled by the disease. Ultimately, using nineteenth-century technologies, scientists identified the purported agent of disease: Mycoplasma mycoides, a deadly and highly transmissible bacterium that spreads through herds via respiratory droplets. But the case was hardly closed. As far back as 2005, researchers pointed out that the symptoms the bacterium produced were essentially indistinguishable from those of bovine coronavirus infection. And, while M. mycoides can’t infect humans, the fact that OC43 and bovine coronavirus were 98 percent identical meant that the newly emergent CoV could likely—and eventually did—jump from cattle to human beings. (From which source bovine coronavirus first emerged is a mystery, though the virus is closely related to rat, pig, horse, and bat strains.) The novel pathogen just needed the right environment to reach its human hosts. Van Ranst and others suspected that the real cause of the Russian flu had been lurking in cattle herds throughout the late nineteenth century, hidden by the more easily detectable M. mycoides bacteria. Beginning in the 1870s, countries across the world began massive culling operations, some of which lasted decades, to eradicate cattle fever. Millions of herds of cattle were slaughtered to stop the spread, which put humans and infected cows in prolonged and intimate contact. As cattlemen in fields and barns held the animals in place, readying them for their deaths, human and animal breaths commingling as the beasts were dispatched into darkness, both bacteria and virus would have found their way from cow to man—but only one of those pathogens would have been able to flourish in its new hosts. Repeat this scene over two decades and across the world, and the chances of a zoonotic jump move from unlikely to inevitable—but only, of course, if the pathogen had the right tools to survive the journey. OC43, like so many members of its viral family, had those tools. That it succeeded is beyond debate. Billions of copies of the virus circulate freely among us, evidence that it has attained the viral equivalent of immortality: OC43 has become endemic among our species. SARS pushed researchers to probe the origins of known coronaviruses throughout history. It also launched a search for new members—and new threats—emanating from the viral family. And so, while Van Ranst was decoding the byzantine trail of mutations that led OC43 to separate itself from bovine coronavirus, other researchers were stumbling upon evidence of coronaviruses that had also successfully made zoonotic leaps. The 2004 discovery of HCoV-NL63 by Dutch virologist Lia van der Hoek marked the first time scientists had isolated an endemic human coronavirus since OC43 and 229E (both benign) were discovered in the 1960s. In the wake of SARS, Van der Hoek’s detection of NL63 revealed a stark reality: our species was more deeply entangled with the Coronaviridae than anyone had realized. If the field of coronavirology had been a backwater before SARS, it became something of a curiosity after the epidemic went global. Still, nobody knew how long the family had been evolving to master our host biology and carve out a home within our bodies. Van der Hoek wanted an answer, so she cross-referenced the genomic makeup of NL63 with its known relatives and discovered that HCoV-229E was its closest known match. Unlike OC43 and bovine coronavirus, though, NL63 and 229E weren’t nearly identical; they were more like distant cousins, sharing only about 65 percent of their total structure. This placed the moment that the two viruses branched off from each other much further back in time. But when? One of Van der Hoek’s graduate students, Krzysztof Pyrc, set about trying to find an answer. By charting the differences in the genomes of NL63 and 229E and then watching the speed of each virus’s mutations, Pyrc wound the clock back to a wide historical range, 966 to 1142, and then to a specific year, 1053, when NL63 emerged out of the zoonotic sea to conquer the human species. China’s Northern Song dynasty was an imperial era that ushered in a period of political stability and harmonious social relations after decades of civil war. During this time, the population of China boomed from roughly 32 million in 960 to more than 100 million by the fall of the dynasty, in 1127—almost 30 million more citizens than the Roman Empire at its peak. Kaifeng, the capital, flourished, its million-plus residents densely packed together in close quarters. As the Chinese political state stabilized, land and sea routes kept expanding, reaching farther and farther away and bringing contact with new places, new people, and undoubtedly, new pathogens. In short, it was the perfect environment for an emergent virus to exploit. Over a span of nearly two decades, from 1041 to 1060, ten major epidemics hit China, an unprecedented conflagration of disease. But that was just the beginning. The spike in epidemics would continue over the next eighty-five years, until the demise of the Northern Song dynasty, with twenty-eight major epidemics mentioned in official court records. In the years when NL63 is estimated to have emerged, one philosopher-physician classified the illnesses of the epidemics as “cold damage disorders.” Xu Shuwei, a Northern Song physician, compiled case studies of such disorders. His reports of cold damage disorders caused by epidemic diseases—which he described as arising from “warm winds”—are tantalizingly similar to the set of symptoms caused by human coronaviruses. It was a warm wind that Xu pinpointed as the cause of an epidemic he saw spread after a border conflict with one of China’s many neighbours. “When warm wind causes a disorder, there is spontaneous perspiration, the body feels heavy, the patient sleeps a lot, his breathing through the nose makes snoring sounds, and it is also difficult for him to speak.” Update the language, and Xu could have written the US Centers for Disease Control’s Symptoms of Coronavirus list. We cannot say for certain that NL63 was the pathogen that drove decades of epidemics across China. We can, though, rule some others out. The Black Death, which killed as many as 200 million people, emerged as a pandemic only in the middle of the fourteenth century, roughly two centuries after the Song dynasty. And, though influenza viruses, which cause many of the same symptoms as human coronaviruses, are believed to have been present in China for at least many thousands of years, the first recorded flu pandemic didn’t occur until 1580. So, while the escalating epidemics ultimately outlasted the Song dynasty and can’t be definitively linked to NL63, they may nevertheless mark one of humanity’s first protracted battles with the Coronaviridae. There is a version of modern human history in which the pandemic potential of coronaviruses was recognized early. If it had been, the careful work of coaxing life-saving information out of these bloated, balloon-like virions could have begun with the nineteenth-century Russian flu rather than at the dawn of the twenty-first century, during the SARS epidemic. In that other version of history, humanity would as a matter of course have undertaken early and concerted efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines, just as we have for influenzas. Coronaviruses, widely considered curiosities, concealed dark pasts as terrifying human pathogens. The sad truth is that innovation in epidemiology, the science of epidemics, is a frustrating kind of progress, always facing backward. The epidemiologist’s job is to discover the origins of epidemics in order to control them. The harder task is preventing those that have not yet emerged. Each time a novel pathogen creates a foothold in human hosts, we’re reminded of just how poor our species is at anticipating the viral threats we will inevitably face. The sources of flu contagion have long been obvious. Birds and pigs, familiar animals with which our species coevolved, have since the nineteenth century been known as byways for influenza strains to mix, recombine, and find their ways into human beings. But the animal sources of the Coronaviridae have proven elusive. Genomic sequencing, DNA manipulation, vaccine development—for all the cutting-edge scientific tools at our disposal, we have had a glaring inability to fully grasp the dangers emanating from this strange and bulbous family and to determine its animal origins. Part of this inability has been due to timing: the Spanish flu, that cataclysmic event, occurred just as our knowledge of viruses and our technology had matured to the point that viruses could be seen. Though it took until the 1930s, the Spanish flu was eventually ID’d correctly (as were two other influenza pandemics, in 1957 and 1968) under microscopes. The absence of pathogenic coronaviruses during this stretch meant that humanity fixed its gaze squarely on the danger it could see: the flu. Still, our failure to match the threat posed by coronaviruses was part of a broader pattern. For all the scientific successes of the twentieth century, this period was actually marked by a steep and quantifiable decline in the rate of scientific production. By the 1930s, the prevailing assumption was that each new invention would speed the next in a kind of “geometric progression.” But, throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the biggest rise in patents per capita in the United States actually took place before 1870, at a time when most of the nation’s population was still living in the countryside. In the subsequent century, the US population boom obscured the fact that creating inventions was getting demonstrably harder. While the number of scientific workers in the United States tripled between 1950 and 1993, the country’s rate of scientific production remained stable, meaning that it took more people and bigger teams to produce the same number of discoveries as before. On average, research productivity has dropped 5 percent every year since the 1930s. Nowhere was this drag on innovation more evident than in the pharmaceutical industry. By the 1950s, morphine, penicillin, Aspirin, insulin, and chemotherapy, along with vaccines for polio, measles, smallpox, and tuberculosis, had been developed by or in partnership with private pharmaceutical companies. But the sheer glut of life-saving medicines they produced in the first half of the twentieth century left them with a choice: either take a chance on more difficult goals, like vaccines for rare or emerging diseases—and risk costly failures—or use their library of intellectual property to make incremental improvements to existing products that were surefire money-makers. By and large, they chose the safer route. This trend continued well past the turn of the twenty-first century. For all humanity’s awe-inspiring discoveries, our capacity to meet new viral threats has largely calcified in the face of ruthless market forces. By 2003, when SARS emerged, the creation of drug therapies and vaccines for novel pathogens had slowed to barely a trickle. And so, when, after more than a century of lying dormant, the Coronaviridae family once again threatened our species, it found us made vulnerable by hubris, rigidly fixed on the dangers of the past, and unable to muster our forces to contend with what might lie ahead. The future, it seemed, had been ceded to our enemies. Excerpted from The Invisible Siege: The Rise of Coronaviruses and the Search for a Cure by Dan Werb. Copyright ©2022 Daniel Werb.

Photo by Debbie Hill/UPI | License Photo March 4 (UPI) -- The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Friday it has confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in a flock of Missouri chickens. "State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease," APHIS said in a press statement, "Birds from the flock will not enter the food system." Advertisement APHIS said it tested a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Stoddard County that "confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza." Samples were tested at the University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. APHIS said it is working closely with state animal health officials on a joint incident response. Citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, APHIS said the recent avian flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. Federal and state partners are jointly working on additional surveillance and testing in area around the flock that tested positive for avian flu. The United States has the strongest avian flu surveillance program in the world, APHIS said, and USDA is working to actively look for the disease in U.S. commercial poultry operations.

What does that mean for people?Rich Kirby, Patch StaffPosted Tue, Mar 1, 2022 at 1:25 pm ET|Updated Tue, Mar 1, 2022 at 6:42 pm ETOver the last five years, low-pathogenic bird flu has been found in Connecticut on three occasions​, according to the state Department of Agriculture. (Jenna Fisher/Patch)CONNECTICUT — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued a warning Monday that avian influenza — H5N1, or "bird flu" — has been detected in wild ducks in the state.As part of their routine surveillance, DEEP scientists first detected the highly pathogenic virus in one New London County duck and 20 ducks in Middlesex County on Feb. 16. Nine more mallards in New Haven County were discovered to be infected on Feb. 23. Connecticut wildlife officials and the U.S. Department of Agriculture continue to monitor the situation. The disease travels as birds migrate into new areas. Over the last five years, low-pathogenic bird flu has been found in Connecticut on three occasions, according to the state Department of Agriculture.Find out what's happening in Weston-Redding-Eastonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeBird flu has proven dangerous primarily to other birds, and wildlife officials are asking Connecticut bird owners to report anything out of the ordinary with their birds. Anyone who may suspect a bird on their farm may have died from unknown causes should call the state veterinarian at 860-713-2505 or email ctstate.vet@ct.gov. Signs of avian influenza include depression, decreased feed and water consumption, decreased egg production, soft or misshapen eggs, and respiratory indicators such as coughing and sneezing. The USDA has published a guide for poultry farmers with more information on how best to protect their flock. People can catch bird flu, but when they do, it has almost invariably been from birds and not other people. Its rarity is a boon, as it has shown itself to have a high death rate among those who become ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

These studies have focussed on determining the possibility and severity of coinfections with secondary pathogens (viruses, fungi, and bacteria). However, researchers observed that coinfection rates varied across studies. Study: Time-Dependent Increase in Susceptibility and Severity of Secondary Bacterial Infection during SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Image Credit: Maxx-Studio/Shutterstock Background Previous studies have shown that bacterial pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus aureus, etc., cause secondary infections with other viruses, e.g., influenza A virus (IAV). Recently, researchers detected Pneumococcus from the throat swabs of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did not require intensive care unit (ICU) admission or ventilator support. The use of face masks, as a non-pharmaceutical measure, has significantly reduced bacterial transmission. Scientists stated the importance of understanding whether SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes individuals to bacterial infections. Prior studies have indicated that the impact of secondary infection by bacterial pathogens appeared to be lower during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this condition can change over the years with the emergence of new variants. Scientists revealed that neutrophils and macrophages, which clear bacteria during viral-bacterial coinfection, have been reported to be dysregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A prior study used animal models to investigate the viral and immune dynamics in the lower respiratory tract. It reported that bacteria could enhance the pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Several studies associated with influenza-bacterial coinfection revealed that vulnerability and pathogenicity of bacterial coinfections are time-dependent, with the greatest mortality observed when bacterial infection occurs at seven days post-virus infection (pvi). During influenza, the gradual increase in susceptibility to bacterial coinfection occurred predominantly due to reduction or dysfunction of resident alveolar macrophages (AMΦ). Bacterial infection remained dynamic throughout IAV infection and maximal at seven days pvi. Prior in vitro studies have shown that AMΦs become productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, which initiates altered cytokine production and responsiveness. Additionally, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, myeloid dysfunction, delayed IFN responses, and CD8+ T cell depletion have been reported. Researchers have stated that more studies are required to understand the possibility of bacterial coinfection and how this would impact the immune cells, viral, and pathological dynamics. A new study A new study published on the bioRxiv* preprint server has evaluated bacterial susceptibility during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It further determined if a synergy exists between SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcus. In this study, researchers triggered mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice and, subsequently, coinfected them 3, 5, or 7 days later with pneumococcus. Scientists reported that bacteria failed to establish infection at three days pvi. However, coinfection occurred at 5 and 7 days pvi, with increased lethality in a sex-independent manner. This time-dependency is similar to that of influenza-bacterial coinfections; however, the lethality during the SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcal coinfection was found to be delayed. Researchers reported that viral dynamics and lung pathology remained unchanged within the first 24 hours of coinfection. A decrease in immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in the coinfected animals' lungs at five days pvi but not at seven days pvi. The authors stated that more studies are required to determine the severity of coinfections at later time points. The findings of this study are in line with previous reports that showed viral-induced changes to the number or functionality of AMΦs might be due to IFN, which makes them less efficient to clear bacteria. Scientists have indicated that more studies are required to understand how a productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of AMΦ changes infection dynamics. Additionally, the impact of the altered production of IFN and their phagocytic capacity need to be further studied. IFN-independent mechanisms of macrophage dysfunction should be examined to understand the severity of coinfection. Scientists believe that viral-induced changes in bacterial receptor expression and binding, as well as the degradation of epithelial integrity, could facilitate bacterial adherence during IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study revealed that type I IFNs remained unchanged after SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcal coinfection. However, neutrophil infiltration was reported in coinfection at seven days pvi, which indicated a differential mechanism is associated with enhanced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumococcal coinfection. Interestingly, researchers observed that cytokine production was largely unchanged at 24 hours pvi. Researchers indicated that even though coinfections are generally linked with hyper inflammation with enhanced disease severity, this was not the case with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza-pneumococcal coinfections, where tissue inflammation was not altered. Conclusion The findings of the current study strongly indicated an increased susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to bacterial infection in a time-dependent manner with increased disease severity, pulmonary bacterial burden, bacteremia, and neutrophilia. The findings of this study are extremely important, especially due to a sustained immune activation after coinfection, which might increase the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome even in patients with mild COVID-19.

We need to prepare for the next challenge with evidence and knowledge. (Shutterstock) BY Gerry Wright March 2, 2022 Health & Medicine Infectious Disease SHARE As we move into the third year of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, it’s important to ask what we have learned and what we have done to prepare for the next infectious-disease crisis. It could be an outbreak of Lyme disease, an epidemic of measles or another full-blown global pandemic of influenza or coronavirus. It could be a threat that emerges from the ongoing challenge of antimicrobial resistance and the steadily fading power of established antibiotics. One thing is certain: COVID-19 will not be the last challenge of our time, and even while we are striving to tame the current pandemic, we need to prepare for the next challenge, using evidence and knowledge.

Infectious diseases For most of human history, infectious diseases have been the leading cause of death, preying mainly on the very young, the old and the most vulnerable among us. Scientific advancements in the 20th century reversed this historical trend — at least for a time. Our ability to control infection through public health measures such as clean water and by developing vaccines, antibiotics, antiviral and antiparasitic agents has changed the way we live — and the way we die. For most of human history, infectious diseases have been the leading cause of death. Hampstead Smallpox Hospital, London. Wellcome Collection. Statistics Canada data show that controlling infectious diseases has bought us more than two decades of extra life, on average. It’s a remarkable achievement, and as a result, diseases of aging — cancer, cardiovascular illness, chronic ailments, and degenerative neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s — are now the major causes of death. What we should have learned over the last few decades, however, is that our control over infection is illusory and that we remain vulnerable. The 1970s saw the emergence of swine flu and Legionnaire’s disease. The ‘80s brought HIV/AIDS, the ’90s witnessed Ebola and the early 2000s brought the return of influenza with H1N1, the first SARS crisis and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). During that same period, the pharmaceutical industry put antibiotic discovery on the back burner, favouring the invention of more profitable treatments for chronic diseases, with their endlessly renewable prescriptions. Without alternatives to penicillin, antimicrobial resistance has become, like climate change, a slow-moving but inexorably advancing global crisis. Infection control The current pandemic has forced governments, public health officials and the health-care sector overall into a prolonged emergency footing, showing us very clearly that we cannot take infection control for granted. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that infection control cannot be taken for granted. (Shutterstock) At the same time, we have been able to benefit from ongoing advancements in fundamental research and development. These advancements have enabled swift response to the current crisis with multiple vaccine platforms, do-it-yourself diagnostic tests featuring unprecedented sensitivity, new antiviral drugs and antibodies, and the real-time production of robust evidence and information to keep pace with every turn in the pandemic saga. Information technology has developed with amazing speed, providing the opportunity to disseminate critical information instantly. The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, for example, was available to researchers across the globe well before the COVID-19 virus arrived on their doorsteps. Still, this same technology has also provided a platform for those who would discredit these scientific advances, oppose public health sector leaders, and even interfere with front-line workers caring for patients. One Health Infectious diseases are almost always what we call One Health problems. The term refers to the intimate link between human and animal health, agriculture and the environment. Microbes that cause disease often move easily between reservoirs in the environment, animals and people. Human encroachment into previously remote regions continues at an alarming rate, exposing us to previously isolated viruses, bacteria and parasites. Climate change is creating new vectors to spread these diseases, such as ticks and mosquitoes migrating into newly warmed environments. As climate change continues and the demand for nutrition grows, strains on the environment will generate new infection challenges. Seeing three unique, novel coronaviruses (SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2) jump from environmental reservoirs into humans in the space of two decades should have spurred us to be vigilant, alert and prepared, yet we still aren’t ready enough. Complacency Public-health infrastructure, research into infectious diseases and the development of new therapies have been neglected for decades. Before the pandemic, our increased lifespans and ability to neutralize some infections with preventions and treatments had lulled us into complacency regarding the infectious diseases we had once rightly feared. With such easily accessible global travel and a standard of living that relies on international trade, turning back the clock is impossible. We must anticipate and prepare for more outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. We need to establish robust research networks and be able to mobilize them quickly when new problems emerge. We need to invest in biomedical and biomanufacturing infrastructure that can respond urgently to these challenges enabling us to rapidly produce new vaccines and drugs. If we do not invest continuously in these platforms, we will doom ourselves to still more crises that we could have anticipated and prevented.

They explain that catechins (or flavanols) present in green tea inhibit the proliferation of viruses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) by forming a protective barrier in the pharynx.Related Posts Airtel Nigeria inspires Nigerians in new Home Broadband TV Commercial Ondo guber: Defend your votes, PDP Chieftain charges electorate Ruga demolition: No amount of intimidation, blackmail will deter us — Wike On flavanol, in particular, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), has a direct anti-viral effect and physically binds to and flushes out viruses in the URT.According to them, “EGCg and epigallocatechin (EGC) bind to the hemagglutinin spike on the viral surface and neuraminidase to inhibit attachment of the virus to the cell surface, thereby preventing influenza infection.“Given the evidence that EGCg, a main component of tea catechins, provides effective protection against influenza virus and adenovirus, it may also protect against respiratory infections caused by other viruses.” Interest in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that may slow or prevent the spread of the infectious disease has increased due to recent pandemics involving influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and COVID-19.Measures that can reduce their impact and severity in the early stages is deemed key in the fight against infection. There is considerable research on the efficacy of NPIs, such as hand washing, wearing masks and physical distancing, in reducing the transmission of respiratory infections have been performed, but limited documentary proof supporting the effectiveness of tea gargling and tea catechin, therefore the efficacy of the intervention is “not well accepted”.IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE‘Officials initially offered to help but when the number of able-bodied citizens at the centre increased, they left us unattended to’Why Ogun Tops List Of ‘Yahoo Boys’ In Nigeria ― Governor AbiodunPolice, Amotekun after criminals on Lagos-Ibadan expresswaySuspected cannibal pays N500,000 for boy’s human organs, says ‘that’s my favourite meal, especially the throat’ Court awards Nnamdi Kanu N1 billion over invasion of his home by military, asks FG to apologiseOne study reviewed by the team demonstrated consumption of catechin capsules reduced the incidence of influenza-like symptoms by 32.1 per cent, and another noted “strong effects” following consumption of large amounts of catechins per day.

Dr Farida Al Hosani, Infectious Disease Expert and Executive Director of Infectious Diseases and Official Spokesperson for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Health Sector, has joined the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework) Advisory Group as a Member for the period 2022-2024. Members of the Advisory Group are appointed by the Director-General of the World Health Organisation and serve, in their personal, expert capacity, for a period of three years. The key goal of the framework is to improve and strengthen the sharing of information about influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, and to increase the access to vaccines and other pandemic related supplies for developing countries. Commending the recognition, H.E. Matar Saeed Rashed Al Nuaimi, Director General, ADPHC, said, “This accomplishment celebrates a distinguished career and is a source of pride for us all, given the significant standing that the PIP Framework holds on an international level. H.E. Dr Farida Al Hosani has been an active participant across global, WHO level activities, as well as playing an integral role in the UAE’s response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, becoming a pioneering figure and adding to a long list of Emirati females engaged at an international level within their related fields. He added: “This would not have been possible without the support of our wise leadership who have provided Emirati women with the tools and resources to succeed, whilst also emphasising the efforts that Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Mother of the Nation, has provided Emirati women, in-turn becoming a global role model. H.E Dr Farida’s appointment is testament to our ambition to reinforce a world-class healthcare system in the emirate and instil ADPHC’s mission “'Towards a Healthy and Safe Society” for Abu Dhabi community.” H.E. Dr Farida Al Hosani, Executive Director of Infectious Diseases and Official Spokesperson for the UAE Health Sector said: “I am honored to be joining the World Health Organisation’s PIP Framework Advisory Group and to have the opportunity of contributing my expertise to addressing global pandemics and advancing pandemic preparedness at a global level.

It was adopted in May 2011 by the 64th World Health Assembly which comprises 18 members drawn from three Member States in each WHO Region. The main purpose of the Advisory Group is to monitor the implementation of the PIP Framework and provide evidence-based reporting, assessment and recommendations regarding its functioning to the Director-General of the World Health Organisation.

It changes every year depending on what scientists believe will be the most dominant influenza strain that season, according to East Meadow Medical. It's estimated that the flu shot helps prevent roughly 105,000 flu-related hospitalizations in the United States, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Despite the positive benefits, there are side effects from the flu shot that recipients should be aware of beforehand. First, it's important to understand that flu shots are safe. Every year, tens of millions of Americans get the vaccine with little-to-no negative effects (via the CDC). However, there are mild side effects that can occur, including soreness or redness at the injection site, headache, fever, nausea, muscle aches, dizziness, and occasionally, fainting. These symptoms are completely normal, with many people feeling nothing after their flu shot, but you still should be aware of them. However, severe reactions can occur, and it's suggested to go to the nearest hospital if you believe you are having a strong allergic reaction (via the CDC). Dizziness is your body's reaction to the flu shot Pheelings Media/Shutterstock The flu shot works by using a deactivated version of the expected dominant influenza strain from the upcoming flu season. This teaches your body's immune system to develop antibodies that can fight against that strain, according to Cedars-Sinai. This is also why it's impossible to receive the flu from the vaccine, despite myths about the flu. Side effects differ from person to person, as each immune system will react differently to the flu shot. For example, everyone's symptoms are different when they have the common cold. Some people develop a high fever, while others just have the sniffles, according to Prevention. The same thing is true with the flu shot, which is why you may be experiencing dizziness or fainting while someone else does not. This can be remedied by sitting for a few minutes or eating a snack before and/or after the shot, according to Healthline. However, it's important to note that dizziness and fainting are not unique to the flu shot. The CDC has received reports of people fainting from almost every type of vaccination and is most common in teenagers. If you become dizzy after all shots, mention this beforehand to the person giving you the flu vaccine (via Healthline). Recommended
