In addition to seasonal infections, the risk of an influenza virus pandemic emerging is extremely high owing to the large reservoir of diverse influenza viruses found in animals and the co-circulation of many influenza subtypes which can reassort into novel strains. Development of a universal influenza vaccine has proven extremely challenging. In the absence of such a vaccine, rapid response technologies provide the best potential to counter a novel influenza outbreak. Here, we demonstrate that a modular trimerization domain known as the molecular clamp allows the efficient production and purification of conformationally stabilised prefusion hemagglutinin (HA) from a diverse range of influenza A subtypes. These clamp-stabilised HA proteins provided robust protection from homologous virus challenge in mouse and ferret models and some cross protection against heterologous virus challenge. This work provides a proof-of-concept for clamp-stabilised HA vaccines as a tool for rapid response vaccine development against future influenza A virus pandemics.

In addition to regular seasonal outbreaks caused by strains circulating within the human population, there have been numerous influenza virus pandemics in the past century resulting from a new influenza strain entering the human population, with the most recent occurring in 20092,3,4,5,6. Of additional concern are the avian influenza (HPAI) viruses such as H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 that have caused sporadic spillover events with high fatality rates (~30–50%)7,8,9. While these viruses do not currently exhibit efficient human-to-human transmission, the potential for a novel virus that does possess such transmissibility is significant, which could result in another global pandemic8,9,10,11,12,13. A large reservoir of novel avian influenza viruses is present in aquatic birds, further highlighting the pandemic potential of influenza viruses14,15.Current influenza vaccine production mostly involves virus propagation in embryonated chicken eggs, before chemical inactivation and “splitting” of the viral components using surfactants. The vaccines are delivered as multivalent formulations containing antigen from three to four circulating strains including two influenza A and one or two circulating influenza B viruses16. However, these vaccines have shown suboptimal efficacy, ranging from just 10–60% over the last fifteen years17. As such, these must be updated and readministered annually. However, due to the lead time required to formulate a new egg-based vaccine, potential difficulties generating a virus that replicates effectively in embryonated chicken eggs and limitations in availability of eggs, these approaches are not well suited to a pandemic response18. To counteract the threat of a potential influenza pandemic, either a universal influenza vaccine or technology to be able to rapidly respond to the novel virus and develop a vaccine is required.The antibodies induced by current vaccines are primarily directed towards the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which is the virus glycoprotein responsible for binding to host cell receptors and initiating membrane fusion19,20,21,22,23,24,25. HA consists of two domains: the head and the stem. The head domain contains a large degree of sequence diversity (34–59% between subtypes) and rapidly accumulates mutations, which is a major factor contributing to the lack of vaccine efficacy and need for annual updating26. Conversely, the stem domain of HA is structurally and functionally constrained and therefore more conserved across subtypes. A number of monoclonal antibodies against the HA stem, which primarily afford protection via Fc-mediated effector functions rather than virus neutralisation, have been shown to be broadly reactive and protective against highly divergent influenza viruses27,28,29,30,31. As a result, a good proportion of the next generation of universal influenza virus vaccine candidates are aimed at stimulating broadly reactive stem-specific antibodies. Most approaches have used recombinant protein technology, utilising trimerisation domains such as the bacteriophage T4 fibritin foldon or the leucine zipper GCN4 to constrain HA in its pre-fusion conformation and retain key stem domain epitopes that are not available for binding in the post-fusion conformation. While these approaches have increased stem-specific antibodies upon vaccination, limited cross-protection has been observed32,33,34,35,36,37. To focus the immune response on stem-specific antibody induction, stem-only HA proteins have been trialled34,37,38,39. Good progress has been reported, with multiple vaccines capable of inducing these stem-directed antibodies subsequently providing a degree of cross-protection34,36,37,38,40,41,42,43,44,45. However, reduced immunogenicity and the need for improved structure-based design to improve the stability of stem-only constructs, are still hurdles to be overcome.An alternative approach is the use of platform technologies, which are capable of being rapidly applied to vaccines against a wide range of viral pathogens. Such technologies have proven invaluable in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, with numerous vaccines progressing to clinical trials within a matter of months from virus discovery46,47,48. One such technology is the molecular clamp, which utilises the highly stable trimerization domain comprising the 6-helical bundle formed in the post-fusion form of viral fusion proteins, to both constrain trimeric virus glycoproteins in their pre-fusion conformation and serve as a universal purification tag. We have applied this approach to a number of potential emerging viruses49, and to the rapid response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic50. Here, we investigated the application of this platform technology to develop an influenza A virus HA-based vaccine without the limitations of traditional influenza virus vaccine approaches.ResultsCharacterisation of HA-clamp proteinsTo demonstrate the utility of the molecular clamp stabilisation domain for a recombinant HA-based vaccine, we made several HA constructs from diverse, medically relevant influenza A viruses. HA ectodomains (without the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains) from recently circulating seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, as well as those from H5, H7 and H9 avian influenza viruses that have previously caused human infections, were cloned into a mammalian expression vector upstream and in frame with the molecular clamp sequence (HA clamp) separated by a GSG linker. As controls, the HA ectodomain was also cloned into an expression vector with no molecular clamp sequence (termed ‘HA Sol’—soluble) or into a vector containing the foldon trimerisation domain (HA foldon), which has previously been used to stabilise HA33,51 (Fig. 1A, B). Plasmids were then expressed using the ExpiCHO expression system and HAs purified from culture supernatant via immunoaffinity purification. Purified proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C), which showed that all proteins were pure and expressed as the uncleaved precursor HA0, except for H5 Sol and H5 clamp, which were fully cleaved into the HA1 and HA2 subunits. This is in line with expectations, as the HA1/HA2 cleavage site for H5 is polybasic, containing six sequential Arg/Lys amino acids.Fig. 1: In vitro characterisation of HA clamp antigens.A A schematic of the HA gene showing the design of HA, HA ectodomain with no trimerisation domain (HA Sol), HA with the foldon trimerisation domain (HA foldon) and HA with the molecular clamp trimerisation domain (HA clamp).

G Representative micrograph from negative-stain TEM of H3 clamp and H 2D class averages of H3 clamp.Full size imageNext, proteins were analysed for their oligomeric state via size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase column. The prefusion conformation of HA exists as a homotrimer52,53 and, consistent with this, all HA clamp proteins eluted at a volume consistent with that of a HA trimer, with only minor evidence of aggregation observed (Fig. 1D). Conversely, HA sol proteins were mostly high molecular weight aggregates or monomers, with only H3 sol showing some degree of trimerisation. While the H1 foldon protein separated primarily as monomeric HA with a small proportion of HA trimer, the H3 foldon protein was primarily HA trimer with a minor proportion of monomeric HA. Stabilisation of the soluble trimeric protein was also demonstrated with H5, H7 and H9 (Fig. 1D).To structurally characterise the H1 and H3 clamp proteins, the peak size-exclusion fractions were collected and analysed by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1E–H). Proteins appeared homogenous and of the correct size (~10 nm). Additionally, 2D class averages were consistent with reprojections from previously published crystal structures of HA54, suggesting that the molecular clamp was indeed constraining HA in its pre-fusion conformation.Binding of a panel of previously reported mAbs, known to afford protection via neutralisation or Fc effector functions, was also assessed. Both head- and stem-reactive mAbs were chosen and, their binding sites are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Head-specific HA mAbs are potently neutralising and protective and tend to be reactive with HA in both its pre- and post-fusion conformations55,56,57. In contrast, many stem-specific mAbs are reactive only with pre-fusion HA owing to the significant structural rearrangements and loss of epitopes that occurs in the HA stem domain upon transition to the post-fusion form. Both head and stem-specific mAb binding affinities were determined by ELISA, with the Kd (the antibody concentration at which 50% of the binding response was observed) used to compare relative affinities. The affinities of each mAb tested for the three recombinant HAs are shown in Table 1, while the binding curves and antigen binding sites shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. For H1, H3 and H5 HAs, all proteins, were bound with high apparent affinity by the head-specific mAbs 5J8, C05 and 100F4, respectively (Kd values from 0.04–1 nM), irrespective of the presence or absence of any stabilisation motif. In contrast, stem-specific mAbs CR6261, CR8043 and FI6v3 showed consistently better recognition of clamp (H1, H3 and H5) and foldon (H1 and H3) constrained HA proteins compared to their HA Sol counterparts, with no detectable binding of either FI6v3 or CR8043 to H3 Sol. While the stem-specific mAbs bound the H1 and H5 Sol proteins, they did so with an apparent affinity 2–8 times lower than for their respective clamp constrained proteins. For the H3 constrained proteins, comparable binding was seen by all mAbs tested except for CR8043, with the H3 clamp showing a ~10 fold increase in binding compared to H3 foldon (Kd 0.19 nM compared to 2 nM). The H7 and H9 clamp proteins were bound with high apparent affinity by FI6v3 (Kd 1.8–2.5 nM).Table 1 ELISA Kd values.Full size tableVaccination with HA clamp vaccines elicits potent neutralising antibodies and protection in miceAfter confirming that HA clamp proteins could be detected in their pre-fusion, trimeric conformation, we assessed their effectiveness as vaccine candidates alongside HA Sol and HA foldon proteins. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5/group) were immunised three times, three weeks apart, with 5 µg of H3 sol, H3 foldon or H3 clamp proteins (from the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 virus), or with PBS alone, adjuvanted with the saponin-based adjuvant Quil-A (InvivoGen) (Fig. 2A). A commercial quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV, 2015 southern hemisphere formulation, Sanofi) was included as a positive control and was administered with matched adjuvant. This vaccine contained antigen from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses. Serum was collected three weeks after the final immunisation and analysed for elicited antibodies, via ELISA, against the cognate antigen. Serum obtained from animals immunised with H3 sol, H3 foldon or H3 clamp all contained high levels of serum IgG (Fig. 2B, left panel). Moreover, when tested for neutralising activity against the matched H3N2 strain (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013) (Fig. 2B), QIV and each of the H3 immunogens induced high titres of neutralising antibodies compared to PBS-immunised controls, although these were not statistically different across groups regardless of the absence or type of trimerisation domain.Fig. 2: Vaccination with HA clamp induces a neutralising and protective immune response in mice.A Schematic of vaccination groups, as well as the bleed and immunisation schedule for the H3 HA vaccination study.

Mice (n = 15/group) were immunised three times, three weeks apart, with H1 sol, foldon or clamp proteins, or with QIV as a positive control, adjuvanted with Quil-A as before. Three weeks after the third dose, mice were bled, then separated into groups of 5 and two groups were challenged intranasally with 102 PFU and one group with 5.5 × 103 PFU of A/Auckland/1/2009(H1N1pdm09) virus. Of the three groups, mice were culled at either day 6 post infection for analysis of the lung viral titre and histopathology of the tissue (one of the 102 PFU groups), or day 10 or 12 post infection (the remaining 102 PFU group and the 5.5 × 103 PFU group) for analysis of recovery from infection. The vaccination and infection regime is outlined in Fig. 2C.Serum from 5 randomly selected animals, collected prior to infection, was tested for antibody levels and virus neutralisation (Fig. 2D). Again, HA sol, HA foldon and HA clamp were similarly immunogenic and induced neutralising serum antibodies. However, while all three H1 immunogens induced similar levels of HA-specific serum IgG, the neutralising titres induced by H1 foldon immunisation were significantly lower compared to H1 sol and H1 clamp (p = 0.0027 and p = 0.0494, respectively). A similar trend was noted for the H3 foldon immunogen, although this was not significant (Fig. 2B). All mice immunised with H1 sol, H1 foldon, H1 clamp and QIV were completely protected from both 102 and 5.5 × 103 PFU virus challenge, with no weight loss or mortality observed in any vaccinated groups (Fig. 2E, F). All mice immunised with PBS alone were euthanised due to weight loss following challenge with 102 PFU, and all but 1 mouse was euthanised due to weight loss following challenge with 5.5 × 103 PFU of virus.To further investigate this protection, lung tissue collected from mice 6 days after infection with 102 PFU of A/Auckland/1/2009(H1N1pdm09) was homogenised and analysed for viral load via immunoplaque assay (Fig. 2G). Infectious virus was not detected in lung homogenates from any of the HA vaccinated groups or from mice vaccinated with QIV whereas high titres of virus were detected in lungs from all PBS-vaccinated animals. Lung histopathology was also assessed at day 6 and 10 (102) or at day 12 (5.5 × 103 PFU) (Fig. 2H, Supplementary Fig 2). At day 6 post infection, H1 clamp-vaccinated mice showed no evidence of histopathological damage to the lungs, whereas H1 sol- and H1 foldon-vaccinated animals showed evidence of tissue damage in some (H1 sol) or all (H1 foldon) animals. All animals vaccinated with recombinant H1 proteins showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) histopathological scores compared to PBS-vaccinated mice, while no significant difference was noted between PBS- and QIV-vaccinated mice at this time. Similar trends were observed at day 10 post infection, with H1 clamp-immunised animals showing lower histopathology scores compared to their sol and foldon counterparts, although all groups showed scores that were significantly reduced compared to PBS-vaccinated mice. At day 12 post infection, all groups showed some level of histopathological damage to the lungs, although none were significantly different compared to PBS-vaccinated mice. Representative histopathology images are shown in Supplenentary Fig. 3.Fig. 3: HA clamp provides protection from influenza A virus infection in ferrets.A Schematic outlining the vaccination and dose schedule for the H1 ferret study.

Ferrets are widely regarded as the gold-standard small animal model to study aspects of pathogenesis, transmission and immunity to human influenza virus infections as they can be infected with different human viruses without prior adaptation and they develop clinical signs similar to those in humans58,59. To more directly compare HA clamp-stabilised and egg-derived vaccines, we used a monovalent inactivated zonal pool (IZP) rather than the quadrivalent vaccine formulation which could skew results due to inclusion of other virus types/subtypes. In this study, the research-grade squalene oil-in-water emulsion AddaVax was used, as an adjuvant. AddaVax is similar in composition to MF59®, an adjuvant used in licenced influenza vaccines60.Ferrets were vaccinated with H1 clamp or IZP vaccines before challenge with A/California/7/2009(H1N1pdm09) as per the schematic in Fig. 3A and monitored daily for weight loss and viral load in nasal washes. Ferrets vaccinated with H1 clamp displayed modest weight loss compared to PBS or H1 IZP-vaccinated ferrets, which showed significantly more weight loss at various days post infection (Fig. 3B). The virus titres detected in nasal wash samples from days 2–5 post infection were significantly reduced in H1 clamp and H1 IZP vaccinated animals (p < 0.005) compared to animals vaccinated with PBS and the number of days at which virus shedding could be detected was also reduced (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the peak viral titres recorded throughout the experiment were significantly lower (p = 0.0472) in H1 clamp-vaccinated animals compared to the PBS-immunised but not the IZP immunised ferrets (Fig. 3D). There was a trend for increased titres of neutralising antibody titres in serum collected from H1 clamp-immunised animals prior to infection relative to the H1 IZP-vaccinated group although this was not significant (p = 0.0527) (Fig. 3E).A similar study was performed in ferrets immunised with H3 HA vaccines (Fig. 3F). Ferrets were vaccinated with H3 clamp or H3 IZP vaccines prior to challenge with A/Kansas/14/2017(H3N2). In contrast to H1N1pdm09 challenge, no significant weight loss was observed in any groups following infection with the H3N2 virus (Fig. 3G). Virus was detected in the nasal wash samples from PBS- and H3 IZP-vaccinated animals but no virus was detected in any sample from H3 clamp-vaccinated ferrets (Fig. 3H). The peak virus titre observed across the challenge period was equivalent for PBS- and IZP-vaccinated animals but was below detection for the H3 clamp-vaccinated group (p = 0.01 compared to PBS-vaccinated animals) (Fig. 3I). The difference in virus titre between H3 clamp and IZP vaccinated animals was unexpected considering that titres of neutralising serum antibody were not significantly different between these groups prior to virus challenge (Fig. 3J).Adjuvanted H1 clamp vaccination induces stem-mediated cross-protection in ferretsTo examine the potential for HA clamp vaccines to elicit heterologous protection, we tested the ability of H1 clamp immunisation to provide protection to ferrets from a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 challenge. Ferrets (n = 12/group) were immunised with H1 clamp or H1 IZP as a control, with either aluminium hydroxide (here refered to as Alum) or SWE adjuvant, a squalene oil-in-water emulsion available at GMP-grade (Sepivac SWE™), as per Fig. 4A. On the day of the challenge, groups were split evenly and challenged with either a matched-strain H1N1pdm09 virus (via intranasal inoculation) or an HPAI H5N1 virus (via intratracheal inoculation). Following challenge with H1N1pdm09 virus, all animals survived the infection (data not shown) and all vaccines showed a modest effect in reducing weight loss although this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4B). Prior to virus challenge, all vaccines induced comparable virus neutralising titres except for H1 clamp + SWE, which induced significantly lower titres compared to H1 IZP + SWE (p = 0.001) (Fig. 4C). No serum from H1-immunised ferrets was able to neutralise the H5N1 challenge virus (data not shown). Following virus challenge, daily nose swabs revealed delayed virus detection in all groups when compared to the PBS group (Fig. 4D). This reached statistical significance relative to the PBS group on day 3 for H1 clamp + Alum (p = 0.034) and days 3 (p = 0.0418) and 4 (p = 0.015) for H1 IZP + SWE. In the lung tissue harvested after culling, H1 clamp + Alum and H1 IZP + SWE groups did not have detectable replicating virus measured by TCID50 (p < 0.0001 compared to the PBS group), and although virus was detected in the H1 clamp + SWE ferrets, it was significantly reduced (p = 0.0001) compared to the PBS group (Fig. 4E). In the nasal turbinates, virus was detected in all groups with a trend towards lower levels in vaccinated groups; however, this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, significantly lower levels (p < 0.0001) of affected lung tissue were observed in all groups compared to the PBS group (Fig. 4G).Fig. 4: H1 clamp vaccination induces cross-protection in ferrets.A Vaccination schedule and dosing outline for the study.

For virus neutralisation and ELISA graphs: ***p < 0.0005, ****p < 0.0001, determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test. For throat and nose swab viral titre graphs: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005 compared to PBS-immunised animals on the corresponding sampling day, as measured by repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s test for multiple comparisons.Full size imageUpon H5N1 challenge, all groups showed similar weight loss (Fig. 4H), with 4/6 PBS vaccinated animals succumbing to infection by day 4 (Fig. 4I). Animals from all other groups had not succumbed to infection at this point, however, were sacrificed at this time for sample collection. Virus was present in daily throat swabs measured via TCID50, albeit at slightly lower levels in vaccinated groups compared to PBS-immunised animals (Fig. 4J). This reached statistical significance on days 1, 2 and 3 for the H1 clamp + SWE group (p values from 0.0014 to 0.0173) and days 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the H1 IZP + SWE group (p values from 0.0038 to 0.0208). Measurement of viral load in nasal turbinates after culling revealed significantly lower viral loads in H1 clamp + SWE and H1 IZP + SWE groups compared to the PBS group (p = 0.029 and p = 0.032, respectively) (Fig. 4K). In the lung tissue, however, only H1 IZP + SWE vaccination resulted in significantly lower viral load relative to PBS (p = 0.004) (Fig. 4L). This difference also reached statistical significance compared to H1 clamp + Alum (p = 0.047) and H1 clamp + SWE (p = 0.004). This viral load also translated to a slightly lower percentage of lung tissue pathology; however, this was not statistically significant (Fig. 4M). Thus, while H1 clamp immunisation appears to have some effect at reducing viral load in the nasal turbinates and prolonging death due to infection, there is no difference in weight loss or viral titre.We hypothesised that any cross-protection from a H1 vaccine against a H5N1 virus challenge would either be due to antibodies against conserved HA stem domain epitopes or antibodies directed against any residual NA present in the IZP vaccine—two phenomena that have been previously observed in the context of influenza A virus cross-protection61,62. To investigate this further, serum collected prior to challenge was assayed for binding to H1N1 or H5N1 NA (Sino Biological), or an in-house expressed H1 stem construct based on previously designed antigens37. Only serum from H1 IZP-vaccinated ferrets contained anti-NA antibodies (Fig. 5A, B) whereas only serum from H1 clamp-vaccinated ferrets contained anti-H1 stem antibodies, with titres being highest when adjuvanted with Alum (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5: Vaccination with H1 IZP or H1 clamp induces NA and stem-specific antibodies, respectively.Serum from ferrets vaccinated with 2 doses of either PBS, H1 clamp adjuvanted with either Alum or SWE, or H1 IZP adjuvanted with SWE was collected 4 weeks after the second dose and assessed for binding to A neuraminidase (NA) from a H1N1pdm09 virus, B NA from a H5N1 virus and C the stem domain of H1 HA. Data is representative of geometric mean with error bars representing the SD. ***p < 0.0005, ****p < 0.0001, determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test.Full size imageDiscussionThe risk of a pandemic influenza virus emerging remains high and, until a truly universal vaccine is available, rapid development of a vaccine targeting an emerging pandemic strain is the only option. Egg-based production of vaccines against pandemic strains has been used successfully in the past, most notably in 200963; however, scale and timelines remain challenging. Platform technologies, such as those utilised to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, offer unique advantages46,47,48. In this study, we demonstrate that the ‘molecular clamp’ constrains the HA proteins from medically relevant influenza A viruses of different subtypes (H1, H3. H5, H7 and H9) to their pre-fusion, trimeric conformation, and induces a potent protective immune response.Compared to non-stabilised or foldon-stabilised counterparts, the molecular clamp was associated with enhanced trimerization of HA, with little dissociation into monomeric HA observed. It has been widely reported that stabilisation of recombinant HA with either foldon or GCN4 trimerisation domains is sufficient for the expression of correctly folded pre-fusion protein33,35. However, here we found that this may not be applicable to every HA strain, given our observation that H1 foldon dissociated into mostly monomeric HA, with only a small amount of trimeric HA present. In contrast, SEC analysis and pre-fusion specific mAb binding showed that all molecular clamp-stabilised HAs were purified as trimeric, pre-fusion HA. This improved trimerisation profile when compared to foldon is likely due to the higher thermal stability of the clamp domain64,65.Improved trimerisation and pre-fusion folding of clamp-stabilised HA correlated with enhanced protection in mouse and ferret models of matched strain infleunza A infection. All vaccine candidates provided protection against homologous virus challenge, with HA clamp providing a trend towards lower virus-induced lung pathology in mice. In ferrets, peak viral loads were reduced in nasal wash samples from HA clamp-immunised animals compared to their IZP counterparts for ferrets challenged with both H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses. Furthermore H1pdm clamp provide significant level of protection against weight loss relative to the matched IZP. Immunising with HA that is correctly folded into the pre-fusion conformation, mimicking that found on the infectious virion, would be expected to induce antibody responses that are better able to recognise epitopes expressed by native HA on infectious virions and mediate protection. Interestingly, our studies demonstrated that titres of neutralising antibodies induced by stabilised and non-stabilised HA were roughly equivalent. This finding is in contrast to studies using respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), where antibodies specific to the pre-fusion confirmation of the viral F glycoprotein were responsible for the majority of neutralisation activity66. However, our results with influenza A virus are perhaps not surprising given that it is well established that the head domain of HA is the primary target of neutralising antibody responses67 and this domain was shown to remain intact in non-stabilised HA. Despite equivalent titres in serum neutralisation responses, constraining HA in its trimeric pre-fusion conformation could also improve protective efficacy by stimulating antibodies to non-neutralising epitopes, particularly those directed towards the stem domain.Vaccination of ferrets with adjuvanted H1 clamp also provided a limited level of protection from a divergent H5N1 virus challenge, demonstrating a level of cross-protective efficacy for clamp-stabilised HA vaccines. While no differences in weight loss were seen between groups, H1 clamp-immunised animals showed delayed time to death and differences in viral load from daily throat swabs. This protection was likely due to induction of stem-specific antibodies in the H1 clamp + Alum group. Such antibodies have previously been shown capable of protecting via Fc-mediated effector functions61,68,69,70. Non-stem specific antibodies and/or cellular immune responses, both of which warrant further investigation, are also likely contributing to this protection.While cross-protection against H5N1 challenge after H1-based vaccination has been observed previously, these are from stem-only HA vaccine candidates34,36,37, which lack the head domain and therefore cannot induce potent neutralising head-specific antibodies27,28,55,56,71,72,73,74. In contrast, the H1 clamp vaccine induces strain-specific neutralising antibodies directed towards the head domain, as well as stem-specific antibodies capable of providing a small level of cross-protection. While stem-only antibodies have been shown to be protective, studies have also shown them to be present at low levels of ~0.1 µg/mL in human serum and are only boosted ~2-fold after vaccination with an inactivated vaccine75. In order to provide protection, it has been suggested that these levels would need to be boosted to ~20 µg/mL, or over 20-fold72. Conversely, head-specific antibodies appear to be induced to much higher levels and can also potently neutralise the virus. Thus, HA clamp immunisation, which elicits both head- and stem-specific antibody responses, could provide an advantage in the context of influenza virus protection by inducing head-specific antibodies at high levels to provide neutralisation, albeit with a lower breadth against heterologous strains, while concurrently inducing stem-specific antibodies capable of providing protection against heterologous strains.Cross-protection against the same H5N1 challenge was also induced after vaccination with H1 IZP, in which no stem-specific antibodies were induced. Instead, the H1 IZP vaccination induced NA-specific antibodies (Fig. 5A, B), which have been shown to be able to provide cross-protection between H1N1 and H5N1 in ferrets62 and mice76. While these distinct mechanisms of cross-protection both proved successful, a combination of the two may prove advantageous against even more divergent viruses in the future. Indeed, efforts are being made to quantify and standardise the NA content of current inactivated vaccines in order to assess the impact of NA-specific antibodies in protection in the human population77. Investigation of pre-fusion HA vaccine inducion of stem-specific HA antibodies and recombinant neuraminidase inducing cross-reactive NA antibodies could lead us one step closer to universal protection.In this work, multiple adjuvants were used, and the HA clamp proteins proved potent and successful as vaccines with each adjuvant. This demonstrates the robustness of the clamp platform for influenza A viruses, however, making comparison of results between experiments more difficult. Therefore, the use of different adjuvants is also worth exploring in more detail. Selecting adjuvants likely to boost IgG responses capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity could improve cross-protection78. Our group has explored the use of different adjuvants79; however, expanding on this study to include a more diverse adjuvant panel with experiments performed in parallel allowing for head-to-head comparisons would prove valuable. This would also allow more in-depth T-cell analysis in the context of live virus protection and cross-protection in mouse and ferret challenge models, providing valuable insight into the best formulations to achieve the best protection from influenza A virus infection.This is the first study to demonstrate the molecular clamp technology for influenza A virus vaccine development, offering a promising alternative to traditional influenza vaccine approaches.MethodsAnimal ethics statementAll animal experiments were approved by the relevant animal ethics committees at either the University of Queensland (AEC number SBMS/071/17 or the University of Melbourne (AEC number 1714278.4). The ferret experiments carried out at Viroclinics Xplore in Schaijk, The Netherlands, were under conditions that meet the standard of Dutch law for animal experimentation. The facility is fully accredited by the Dutch ministry that governs and inspects the animal facilities and oversees, coordinates and inspects activities of the animal ethics committees of Dutch institutions and academic centres. A registered article 9 officer is responsible for the design and management of the experiments, in close consultation with the animal welfare body (IvD) who grated ethical approval for the experiments, registered under Working Protocol number: AVD277002015142-1-WP21.CellsMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco). Chinese hamster ovary cells (ExpiCHO-S, ThermoFisher) were maintained in suspension culture with rotary shaking (125 rpm) in ExpiCHO Expression Medium (ThermoFisher). All mammalian cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5–8% CO2.VirusesVirus stocks were kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne, Australia or ViroClinics Biosciences, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The viruses used in this work were A/Auckland/1/2009 (H1N1pdm09), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2), A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09), A/Netherlands/602/2009(H1N1pdm09) and A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1). Viruses were propagated in the allotonic fluid of embryonated hen’s eggs or in MDCK cells, as previously described80,81.Cloning of HA constructs and antibodiesThe cDNA sequence encoding the ectodomain of desired HAs, or the variable domains from the heavy and light chains of the antibodies, were codon optimised for Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) expression before synthesis as Geneblocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) together with the necessary 5′ and 3′ overlaps for subsequent InFusion cloning (ClonTech) into in-house generated mammalian expression vectors. These vectors contained either no trimerisation domain, the foldon trimerisation domain or the molecular clamp domain (derived from HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 (aa540–576) and HR2 (aa619–656)) for the HA constructs, or the constant regions of human or mouse IgG1 heavy or light chain for the antibodies. The HA stem constructs, which were based on previously designed antigens37 were cloned into a vector containing a monomeric Fc domain82. After successful InFusion cloning, plasmid DNA was prepared by Midi- or Maxi-prep (Promega) and sequence confirmed at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).Expression and purification of antibodies and HA constructsAntibodies and recombinant HA proteins were transiently expressed using the ExpiCHO Expression System (ThermoFisher) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Supernatants were harvested on day 5–7 by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C before filtration using a 0.22 µm filter. Antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins were purified on an AKTApure FPLC via protein A affinity purification using a HiTrap Protein A HP column, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant HA proteins were purified via immunoaffinity columns, which were made in-house by coupling HA-specific antibodies to HiTrap NHS-activated HP columns. HA clamp proteins were purified using the clamp-specific antibody HIV128183,84 as previously described49,79, with those HA proteins not containing the clamp purified in a similar fashion but using HA-specific mAbs (5J855, C0556 or 100F457,85) in place of the clamp-specific mAb. In-house made immunoaffinity columns were equilibrated with phostphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, and elution was done with 100 mM Tris, 400 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM diethylamine, pH 11.5. Proteins were concentrated using Amicon 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter units as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Purity was assessed via SDS-PAGE and oligomeric state assessed via size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column.ELISA of HA constructs with monoclonal antibodies or serumTransiently expressed HA or commercially supplied recombinant NA (Sino Biological) proteins were coated at 2 µg/mL in PBS on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C. The next day, plates were blocked with 5% milk diluent blocking concentrate (Seracare) for 30–60 min at room temperature. Plates were then probed with serial dilutions of primary antibodies (either serum or monoclonal antibodies) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 3x washes with PBS.T. The relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, goat anti-human or goat anti-ferret, all diluted to 1 in 2000) was then added for 1 h at 37 °C before washing as before. TMB substrate (Life Technologies) was added and reactions stopped after 5–10 min with 1 M H2SO4 before absorbance was read at 450 nm using a SpectroMax 190 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).Transmission electron microscopy of HA proteinsTo visualise correct folding of HA proteins, peak fractions from size-exclusion chromatography analysis were diluted to ~10 µg/mL in PBS and applied to glow-discharge carbon films supported by formvar on 400-mesh copper grids (ProSciTech). The samples were blotted for 2 min and washed three times with water prior to staining with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were air dried and then imaged on a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV and 30k magnification corresponding to a nominal pizel size of 4.4 Å. CTF 2D class averaging was performed using Relion 3.0.Adjuvants and vaccine formulationQuil-A, Alum and AddaVax were purchased commercially (InvivoGen), and SWE squalene oil-in-water emulsion was provided by Seppic (France). Vaccines containing these adjuvants were formulated shortly before injection. Quil-A was made as a stock solution to 10 mg/mL in PBS, and the desired amount was added to the formulation before being made up to the final desired volume (20 µL/dose) using PBS. Alum and AddaVax were mixed volume to volume with vaccine antigens to obtain a final antigen concentration of 100 µg/mL.Physiochemical properties of the SWE adjuvant and HA clamp antigen integrity were monitered 24 h after the initial mixing of the vaccine formulation components using a sandwich ELISA including 5J8 and FI6v3 anti-HA mAbs. Osmolarity of the final HA Clamp SWE formulations was in the 200–230 mOsm/kg range.Mouse immunisation studiesNaive 6–8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Animal Resources Centre) were maintained in a pathogen-free environment at the University of Queensland’s Biological Resources animal facility within the Australian Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. Mice were immunised intradermally (i.d.) with 5 µg of vaccine antigen with 3 µg of Quil-A adjuvant, diluted with PBS to a final volume of 20 µL. When Addavax was used as an adjuvant, 25 µL of Addavax was mixed with 25 µL of PBS containing 5 µg of the vaccine antigen. Vaccines were then administered via the intramuscular route. Blood was taken via tail bleed one day before each vaccination and the day before challenge. Three weeks after the final vaccination, mice were anaesthetised using isofluorane and challenged intranasally with virus diluted in 50 µL of PBS. All mice were monitored daily for weight loss, and when necessary, mice were sacrificed via intraperitoneal injection of Lethobarb (100 µL of a 14 mg/mL solution in saline) and blood harvested via cardiac bleed. The commercial quadrivalent inactivated vaccine used contained antigens from A/California/7/2009(H1N1), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses.Histopathology analysis of mouse lung samplesThe left lobe of the mouse lung was placed in 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS. Samples were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 4 µm slices and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Slides were then scored by a sample-blind veterinary pathologist.Determination of viral titres in mouse lungsThe superior, middle and inferior lobes of the right lung of the mice were harvested and placed in 1 mL DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin (Gibco). Tubes containing lungs were weighed before addition of a 4 mm diameter grinding ball. Tissue was homogenised using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) for 4 min at a frequency of 1/25. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g before supernatants harvested and aliquoted for storage at −80 °C. Lung homogenate supernatant was titrated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) before being added to a confluent monolayer of MDCK cells in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Infection was allowed to occur for 1 h at 37 °C before homogenate samples removed and 100 µL/well of overlay medium was added (1.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 2% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin). Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before overlay was removed and cells fixed with 80% acetone in PBS for 20 min at −20 °C. Virus plaques were then detected via immunoplaque assay as previously described86,87 using the HA-specific mAb FI6v3 and a goat anti-human IRDye 800CW secondary antibody (LI-COR). Plates were imaged on an Odyssey infrared imaging and plaques counted by eye to calculate plaque-forming units/mL.Ferret challenge studiesFerrets were randomly assigned into groups of 3–6 and immunised intramuscularly in a dose volume of 0.2 mL under ketamine anaesthesia (20 mg/kg). Two immunisation doses, 2–3 weeks apart were given. Animals were challenged 2–4 weeks after the final immunisation via intranasal or intratracheal inoculation as previously described88. Ferrets were monitored daily for temperature and weight loss, and nasal washes or swabs (nasal and throat) were taken for virological analysis while the animals were under ketamine anaesthesia as before. For the study conducted at Viroclinics Xplore, sixty male ferrets, approximately 9 to 10 months old, were randomly assigned into ten groups with six animals per group. Ferrets were immunised, using a prime boost regimen four weeks apart, with a dose volume of 200 µl via the intramuscular route of administration. Three weeks following the boost immunisation, ferrets were challenged with either 106.0 TCID50/dose A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus (n = 30) or 105.0 TCID50/dose A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus (n = 30). Both challenges were administered via the intracheal route using a total dose volume of 3.0 ml. Following challenge, nose and throat swabs were sampled daily and respiratory tissues were collected on day 4 post challenge following euthanasia by abdominal exsanguination.Virological analysis of ferret samplesSwabs and homogenised tissue samples were used for the detection of replication competent virus in a TCID50 assay. To this end, quadruplicate 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared and incubated on MDCK monolayers. After washing, cell monolayers were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Next, culture supernatants were harvested, turkey erythrocytes added and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. HA patterns were read and titres were calculated using the method of Spearman–Karber.Virus neutralisation assaysVirus neutralisation of serum samples was tested either via plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) as previously described86,87 using the HA-specific mAb FI6v3 to visualise plaques, or via TCID50 as previously described88. Plaques were counted by eye or using the software package Viridot89. The IC50 value was determined using GraphPad Prism 8 software using a inhibitor vs response (three parameters) model. All serum was treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE[II], Denka Seiken Co.) prior to analysis.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Trivalent Influenza Vaccines Trigger Heterotypic Antibodies Against Both Influenza B Viruses Laura Sánchez-de Prada1,2*Silvia Rojo-Rello1,2Marta Domínguez-Gil2,3Eduardo Tamayo-Gómez4Raúl Ortiz de Lejarazu-Leonardo2José María Eiros1,2,3Iván Sanz-Muñoz2 1Department of Microbiology, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain 2National Influenza Center of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain 3Department of Microbiology, Hospital Universitario Río Hortega, Valladolid, Spain 4Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain Influenza B is accountable for an important burden during flu epidemics, causing special impact in children and the elderly. Vaccination is the best approach to address influenza infections. However, one of the main problems of this virus is that two different lineages circulate together, Victoria and Yamagata; and trivalent vaccines, that only contain one of these lineages, are still in use. For that reason, if during an epidemic, the lineage not included in the vaccine predominates, a mismatch would occur, and the vaccine effectiveness will be very poor. In this work, we evaluated the cross-protection given by the trivalent Influenza vaccine and compared serological profiles based on age, sex, and the type of vaccine used. We performed a retrospective analysis of serum samples obtained before and after seasonal influenza vaccination during 20 seasons (1998–2018). The results showed that heterotypic reactivity between both influenza B lineages is common, but always lower than the homologous response. Age is a relevant factor for this cross-reactivity between both lineages, while the sex and the type of vaccine not. Vaccination with trivalent influenza vaccines elicits cross-reactive antibodies against both lineages, however, this response might not be enough to provide an appropriate serological protection in case of mismatch. Introduction Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease caused in humans by Influenza viruses. It is typically characterized by seasonal epidemics that take place annually, but also sporadic and unpredictable global pandemic outbreaks every 10–50 years. Pandemics are caused by the introduction of a new influenza A virus strain antigenically different, usually of zoonotic origin, from the previous circulating. This lack of pre-existing immunity in humans is often associated with a higher severity of the infection and increased mortality (Krammer et al., 2018). Prior to the emergence of two distinct phylogenetic lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata) in the 1980s that currently co-circulate, the influenza B virus circulated as an homogeneous group and was first isolated in 1940 by Francis (1940) and Chen and Holmes (2008). In the 1980s, the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage and its variants spread worldwide. Whereas, B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses remained geographically restricted to Asia during the 1990s, for reasons not entirely understood, to spread to the rest of the world in 2002 (Shaw et al., 2002; Jennings et al., 2018; Caini et al., 2019). In contrast to Influenza A viruses, that have been profoundly studied, influenza B viruses have drawn not as much attention. The lack of a natural animal host (apart from seals), a slower mutation rate and not been responsible for pandemics, make them of less impact compared to influenza A viruses (Glezen et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the continuous co-circulation of influenza B viruses with Influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses during seasonal epidemics, and their contribution to morbidity and mortality have increased the interest on them (Van De Sandt et al., 2015). Although there is general belief that influenza disease due to type B is milder than type A, studies show that both infections are clinically indistinguishable. Individuals of all ages can be affected; however, the incidence of complications is frequently higher in younger children and the elderly. Worthy of remark, higher rates of disease-associated complications and also deaths are seen in the elderly due to the presence of underlying chronic health conditions (Tafalla et al., 2016). Currently, influenza B infections are considered as more severe than A(H1N1) and less than those caused by A(H3N2). Although the disease affects all age groups, the incidence seems to be the highest among older children and young adults. Viruses of the B/Victoria lineage infect subjects at a relatively younger age than those of the B/Yamagata lineage (Van De Sandt et al., 2015). In addition, the incidence of influenza B infections can differ drastically from one influenza season to another (Ambrose and Levin, 2012). For those reasons, influenza B is an important cause of morbidity and mortality during inter-pandemic periods, and its prevention entails a global public health challenge (Jennings et al., 2018; Caini et al., 2019). Several approaches are available to deal with seasonal influenza epidemics. Vaccination is considered the most effective option for preventing influenza disease as well as its complications. As influenza viruses undergo frequent changes in their surface antigens, new influenza vaccines are designed annually to match the circulating lineage expected for the next influenza season. Immunization programs worldwide commonly use the trivalent formulation, that could include an adjuvant or not, which contains viruses that represent 3 influenza strains – 2 influenza A strains [A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) subtypes], and one influenza B lineage (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria) – recommended by the WHO. Epidemiological surveillance data show widespread co-circulation of these 2 B/lineages within the same influenza season since 2000. As one of these lineages is not covered by the annual vaccine, a mismatch with the circulating lineage could result in less effective vaccination campaigns and additional disease-related burden (Tafalla et al., 2016). Noticeably, in the North hemisphere, in the ten seasons between 2001 and 2011, the B lineage included in the vaccine only matched the predominant circulating lineage in half of the seasons. This is also frequent on the South hemisphere. In general, it has proved to be difficult to predict which influenza B virus strain will circulate in the coming season, and the cross-reactivity is limited in the case of a vaccine mismatch (Van De Sandt et al., 2015; Ortiz de Lejarazu et al., 2018). The aim of this study is to evaluate the cross-protection given by the trivalent influenza vaccine and compare the serological effect of age, sex, and the use of adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. Materials and Methods Study Design A retrospective observational study was designed analyzing serum samples from a total of 3,446 healthy individuals recruited from the vaccination programs run by primary healthcare centers during the Influenza Vaccine Campaigns (IVCs) for 20 seasons (1998–2018). Pre-vaccination sera were obtained prior to the administration of the influenza vaccine and post-vaccination samples were obtained 28 days after vaccination to ensure a correct immunization. Serum samples are annually sent by the physicians of the Sentinel Surveillance Network of Castile and Leon (Spain) to the National Influenza Centre of Valladolid for their analysis as a part of the sero-epidemiological surveillance performed as a part of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) regulated through the order SAN/1593/2006 of 13th of October 2006. Samples were stored at −20°C for correct transport and preservation. Informed consent was obtained, and the recruitment of patients was performed following Spanish Organic Law for Data Protection, patient’s rights and obligations for clinical documents (BOE n°298 of 14th December 1999, Law 41/2002). This research was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was yearly approved by the Ethics Committee of East-Valladolid health area under the code PI 21-2314. The administered seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines included the A and B influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the Northern hemisphere for each IVC. There were 11 seasons that included B/Yamagata lineage vaccine (BYv) and 9 seasons included B/Victoria lineage vaccine (BVv). Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay Hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) was performed to detect the presence of anti-hemagglutinant Abs in pre and post- vaccination serum samples. This analysis was conducted following the protocol recommended by WHO and the Influenza Surveillance Network for the surveillance of influenza viruses and vaccine efficacy (WHO, 2011). The serum samples had to be deactivated beforehand HI using RDE (Receptor Destroying Enzyme; Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). This was performed by combining 100 μl of serum with 300 μl of RDE to remove non-specific inhibitors from the sera. This combination was incubated at 37°C in a water bath for 12–18 h and then inactivated for 1 h at 56°C. To perform HI, serial double dilutions of 50 μl of each serum were conducted in 96-V-microwell plates, and then 50 μl of a standard containing 4 hemagglutinin units (4HAU/25 μl) was incorporated to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, 50 μl of hen erythrocytes at 0.75% were added and again incubated at room temperature for another 30 min. The Ab titer was defined as the highest dilution causing complete hemagglutination inhibition. The starting dilution is generally 1:10 and the lower limit of a detectable antibody titer is 10. When the titer of antisera is under a detectable threshold, due to a low or lack of antibodies, this is conventionally expressed as 5, half the lowest detection threshold (Trombetta et al., 2014). Pre and post vaccination titers were included in the database for their study. Statistical Analysis The results were analyzed by using the classical serological parameters of the European Medicament Agency (EMA) for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy (The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products, 1997; Petrie et al., 2015). Those include seroprotection rate (SPR), seroconversion rate (SCR) and geometric mean titer increase (GMTi) between post and pre-vaccination serum samples. Negative results in HI were assumed as half of the detection threshold (1/10). Seroprotection was considered when achieving an HI titer ≥ 1/40 and seroconversion was defined as a titer increase of at least four-fold between pre and post-vaccination sera. In addition, seroconversion was considered to have occurred in cases of negative pre-vaccination sera that achieved 1/40 titers after vaccination (Trombetta et al., 2014; Petrie et al., 2015). Different statistical parametric and non-parametric tests were used, using SPSSV27 (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States), and GraphPad Prism V9 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, United States) and taking statistical significance at the p < 0.05 value. Results Population Characteristics The mean age of all patients was 72.8 (IC95:72.3–73.3). A sum of 1,858 received a vaccine containing BYv and 1,588 received BVv. Mean ages were 73.1 (IC95%: 72.4–73.7) and 72.8 (IC95%: 71.8–73.3), respectively, and no significant differences were found between them (Student T-test, p = 0.291). Population of study was divided then by age and sex (data collected since 2006). In addition, in the elderly, those analyses were performed contrasting by type of vaccine, Adjuvanted (AIV) and Non-Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine (NAIV). The distribution of groups is detailed in Table 1. TABLE 1 Table 1. Description of the distribution of the different groups analyzed. Humoral Status Before Vaccination The serological status before vaccination of males and females who received BYv and BVv was similar against B/Yamagata lineage in terms of GMTs and SPR (Table 2). However, females showed significantly lower GMTs (91.4; IC95%:81.0–103.2) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) as well as SPR (80.5%) (χ2, p < 0.05) against B/Victoria lineage in the cohort vaccinated with BYv. Nor was the case in the cohort vaccinated with BVv where no differences were found. TABLE 2 Table 2. Humoral status before vaccination against B/Yamagata lineage and B/Victoria lineage in all groups. We analyzed differences between both age groups studied, young adults from 15 to 64 years and elderly ≥ 65. The serological status before vaccination against B/Yamagata lineage showed no significant differences in GMTs (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SPR (χ2, p < 0.05) when comparing both age groups, independently of the vaccine lineage received. On the other hand, the serological status against B/Victoria lineage showed significantly higher GMTs (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SPR (χ2, p < 0.05) in the elderly in both groups vaccinated either with BYv or BVv (Table 2). We took into consideration the different vaccines received by population ≥ 65 because after 2005 the AIV was recommended for this age group, but the NAIV was being still used until then. Before vaccination, the serological status against B/Yamagata lineage was significantly higher in the group who received the trivalent BY-NAIV in terms of GMTs (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SPR (χ2, p < 0.05) but no differences were found in the group who received BVv. The serological pre-vaccination status against B/Victoria lineage showed significantly higher GMTs (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SPR (χ2, p < 0.05) in both groups who received trivalent BY-AIV and BV-AIV. Humoral Response to Vaccination Humoral Response by Sex Both BYv and BVv vaccines induced an homologous response against the strain contained in the vaccine as well as an heterologous response against the strain non-included. The homologous response to both vaccines was significantly higher in terms of GMTi (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05), and SCR (χ2, p < 0.05) than the heterotypic response in both sexes (Table 3). The homologous responses triggered by both vaccines showed no differences in terms of post-vaccination GMTs, GMTi (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05), SPR and SCR (χ2, p < 0.05) when comparing by the sex of the receptor. The comparison of the heterologous responses showed similar results and no differences were found in the previously mentioned parameters when comparing by the sex (Table 3). TABLE 3 Table 3. Comparison of the response to vaccination with BYv and BVv between males and females. Humoral Response by Age Group Both BYv and BVv vaccines induced a significant homologous response in HI titers against the matching strain (contained in the vaccine), as well as a significant heterologous response against the strain non-included, regardless the age group of the receptor (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05). The homologous response, against B/Yamagata lineage, to BYv showed no significant differences in post-vaccination GMTs, GMTi (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05), SPR and SCR (χ2, p < 0.05) due to age, but the heterologous response, against B/Victoria lineage, produced significantly higher GMTs (120.3, CI95:112.7–128.4) as well as SPR (86.3%) (χ2, p < 0.05) in the elderly, while no differences were found in GMTi (1.66 vs. 1.65) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SCR (17.6% vs. 15.0%) (χ2, p < 0.05) between both age groups (Figure 1). On the other hand, the homologous response, against B/Victoria lineage, to BVv produced similar results in both age groups in terms of GMTs (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SPR (χ2, p < 0.05), but a significantly higher GMTi (3.20 vs. 2.33) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SCR (41.6% vs. 30.4%) (χ2, p < 0.05) was found in young adults. The heterologous response, against B/Yamagata lineage, to BVv showed significantly higher GMTi (1.69 vs. 1.52) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) and SCR (18.6% vs. 13.9%) (χ2, p < 0.05) in adults (Figure 1).

(B) Response to B/Victoria vaccine in different age groups. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are marked with ∗. Humoral Response by Type of Influenza Vaccine The humoral response comparing by type of vaccine was only evaluated in the elderly. The homologous response, against B/Yamagata lineage, triggered by NAIV-BYv showed significantly higher post-vaccination GMTs (349.4, CI95%: 324.2–376.7) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) than AIV-BYv. Despite this, significantly higher GMTi was observed when using the AIV-BYv (2.39 vs. 2.21) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) (Figure 2). No differences were found between both types of vaccine in terms of SPR and SCR. The heterologous response, against B/Victoria lineage, triggered by AIV-BYv caused significantly higher post GMTs (151.6, CI95%: 134.9–170.4) compared to GMTs achieved with NAIV-BYv (107.4, CI95%: 99.0–116.5) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05). No differences between vaccines in SPR, GMTi and SCR were found (Figure 2). FIGURE 2 Figure 2.

(B) Response to B/Victoria vaccine by type of vaccine. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are marked with ∗. The homologous response, against B/Victoria lineage, triggered by AIV-BVv induced significantly higher GMTS (261.9, CI95%:237.9–288.4) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05) as well as SPR (97%) (χ2, p < 0.05) and SCR (27.9%) (χ2, p < 0.05) than NAIV-BVv. However, the GMTi was significantly higher in those vaccinated with NAIV-BVv (2.55) (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the heterologous response between both types of vaccine (Figure 2). Discussion In contrast to influenza A viruses that can infect a wide range of animal hosts, influenza B infections are almost exclusively restricted to humans with only sporadic infections reported in wildlife (Osterhaus et al., 2000; Bodewes et al., 2013). However, in humans, influenza B accounts for 23% of the global of influenza infections, varying its frequency from season to season and also between different areas around the globe (Heikkinen et al., 2014; Caini et al., 2019). Most children older than eight years old have a basal immunity to influenza A, while comparable immunity against influenza B is only acquired at the age of 18 years old (Sauerbrei et al., 2014). Therefore, influenza B infection poses an important threat to infants presenting a disproportionate number of deaths compared to its circulation rates, reaching up to 52% of all influenza-related deaths (Glezen et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2018). Our global analysis showed that, before vaccination, the humoral protection against the B/Victoria lineage was lower than the B/Yamagata lineage. This lower serological protection could be explained by different factors. First, B/Victoria is the eldest lineage and B/Yamagata lineage did not arise until the 1970s. Secondly, B/Victoria was restricted to Asia from 1992 to 2002 (Shaw et al., 2002), and since then, they have both co-circulated globally and alternating in regional dominance. Finally, B/Victoria lineage viruses appear to undergo more rapid lineage turnover and antigenic drift (Kanegae et al., 1990; Rota et al., 1990; Vijaykrishna et al., 2015; Langat et al., 2017). These three factors could have result in a lower humoral protection before vaccination due to a lesser contact with B/Victoria lineage, besides of a faster divergence that could lead to less presence of specific Abs. As previous studies have shown, the serological response to vaccination lead to significant response toward both lineages, independently of which vaccine was used, BYv or BVv. This remarks the presence of cross-reactive Abs against the mismatched strain (Tricco et al., 2013; Skowronski et al., 2014; Beyer et al., 2017). Despite this, the response was always higher against the homologous strain than the heterologous strain, observing that GMTi is 36% and 26% higher than the heterotypic response triggered by BVv and BYv, respectively, and SCR is at least 2 times higher in response to both vaccines. The comparison of the humoral status before vaccination between males and females showed that both sexes were similarly protected against both lineages, except for females that later received BYv. Females in this group showed slightly less humoral protection than men, but only against the B/Victoria lineage. Our results showed an absence of differences in the response to vaccination between both sexes, neither the against the matching nor the mismatching lineages. These findings are in contrast to influenza A viruses that induce higher responses in females after vaccination, and specifically in those whom are elderly (Couch et al., 2007; Engler et al., 2008; Furman et al., 2014; Sánchez-de-Prada et al., 2021). On the contrary, the age seems to present an interesting and important role in protection against influenza B. Prior to vaccination, adults (15–64 years old) showed a lower humoral protection than the elderly. However, this may be not surprising since the elderly have been more frequently in contact with influenza B viruses due to their age. But this issue is interesting as we did not observe signs of immune senescence in the elderly for this type of virus. More striking is the significantly lower pre-vaccination protection displayed by both adults and elderly against B/Victoria lineage. In the last 20 years, the B/Yamagata has been predominant in 10 seasons, B/Victoria in six seasons and during four seasons they have co-circulated in nearly equal distribution. Also, it is important to recall the regional restriction of B/Victoria lineage to Asia for a decade until 2002 (Shaw et al., 2002). Therefore, the antigenic stimulus of the population seems to have been of a higher extent for B/Yamagata lineage compared to the exposure to B/Victoria lineage (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2021). All these factors, could explain why all patients exhibit such a lower protection against B/Victoria lineage. For Influenza B viruses, the phenomena known as Original Antigenic Sin (OAS) and antigenic seniority have not been described. Different studies have detailed how B/Victoria lineages tend to infect very young children, while B/Yamagata lineage show a bimodal distribution with peaks in both children and adults over 25 years old (Caini et al., 2019; Virk et al., 2020). Original antigenic sin in this case would support a more intense response against B/Victoria if that’s what was first encountered in life. Our results suggest that BVv displays a higher degree of cross-reactivity compared to BYv, especially in adults. This contradicts previous studies that describe how antigenic drift of B/Victoria lineage, similar to that of A(H3N2), induces a limited cross-reactivity between phylogenetic clusters compared to B/Yamagata lineage, which resembles to A(H1N1) subtype, and has multiple variants in circulation, elicits greater levels of cross-reactivity (Vijaykrishna et al., 2015; Caini et al., 2019). Interestingly, our results show how the response of adults to BVv triggers significantly higher homotypic, but also heterotypic responses to B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage, respectively, compared to the elderly. These findings are opposed to those found in a clinical trial conducted in infants under 2 years old, that showed a more intense serological response against B/Yamagata lineage compared to B/Victoria lineage after vaccination (Danuta et al., 2011). However, in our study the use of BYv does not induce different responses between both age groups in any of the lineages. Heterotypic responses have been previously described, but not specifically for one vaccine component and age group (Levandowski et al., 1991; van de Sandt et al., 2015; Sanz Muñoz et al., 2018). Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines (QIV) were introduced into WHO recommendations for yearly vaccine campaigns in 2013–2014 season together with the trivalent influenza vaccine (WHO, 2013). It was in the 2018/19 season, when QIV was recommended as first option for the first time by the WHO (WHO, 2018). Additionally, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) started the recommendation of QIV for influenza prevention from 2017 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and control, 2017). Our results support the use of QIV due to a larger coverage against both lineages, despite the heterotypic humoral responses found in our experiments. This is also supported by studies regarding the effect it would have in reducing the health and economic burden that actually supposes (Cré pey et al., 2020). When we compared the humoral response depending on the type of vaccine (NAIV or AIV), our results showed that, despite the vaccine used, vaccination triggered homologous and heterologous Abs. The response to BYv showed higher homotypic response to AIV-BYv when compared to NAIV-BYv but no differences in the heterotypic response. Nevertheless, the response to BVv showed higher homotypic response with the NAIV-BVv despite higher total values of GMTs and SPR with the AIV-BVv. Despite these findings, we observed that the proportion of vaccines administrated for each lineage was not the same which could result in a bias and not entirely represent the actual differences. For that reason, the data presented in our study is not enough to extract a conclusion on whether adjuvants enhance responses in the case of B viruses. Further studies are needed with more homogeneous populations to determine the influence of adjuvants in B lineages and consider the importance of including them in the formulation of QIV. One of the limitations of our study is that that antibody response was assessed by hemagglutination inhibition assay, which is considered the gold standard method to assess vaccine-induced antibody responses by the WHO (2011). This could result in information forfeited in terms of neutralizing Abs and cellular responses that could be influenced by factors such as age and sex. Another limitation is that we do not know if the participants were repeatedly vaccinated so we cannot determine the influence of this factor or the existence of negative interference for B viruses. On the other hand, as we only have data relative to age, sex and type of vaccine (in the case of the elderly), we could not perform a multivariate analysis. Finally, we have not analyzed in detail each season, which could result in the loss of particularities. However, a wide-ranging analysis of the data let us have a global picture of the humoral response against B viruses after influenza vaccination. Conclusion Our study reflects that sex is not a relevant factor when it comes to humoral responses to influenza B viruses, although it must be taken in account when designing vaccination trials because it can influence the responses in many ways. However, the age is important to determine humoral response and should be acknowledged when designing vaccination strategies to establish whether to use adjuvants or high dose vaccines, as well as which groups to prioritize. When it comes to type of vaccines, the data available is not enough to establish the role of adjuvants in the humoral response to B viruses and should be studied in more detail. Finally, our study portrays that the simple act of vaccination with a trivalent influenza vaccine provides cross-reactive protection against the strain not contained in the vaccine. However, that cross-reactive response produced is not comparable to the protection provided against the matching strain contained in the vaccine which could result in loss of vaccine effectiveness in the case of mismatch. Therefore, Quadrivalent vaccines should be the next step in preventing influenza infection and used when available, especially in population at risk. But, in the case of vaccine shortage when the latter are not available, Trivalent vaccines could be useful to protect the population to a certain extent.

Link: https://health.choc.org/influenza-vs-covid-19-a-pediatrician-explains-the-similarities-and-differences/ With typical influenza (flu) season already beginning and COVID-19 still being spread throughout communities, this is the second year in which many families may be experiencing what was deemed last year as the “twin pandemic” of the flu and COVID-19 in their households. What are the similarities and differences between influenza and COVID-19 and how can they both be prevented? Dr. Reshmi Basu, a pediatrician in the CHOC Primary Care Network, answers parents’ common questions and addresses common myths about flu and COVID-19. What are the similarities and differences between the influenza and COVID-19 viruses? Flu and COVID-19 are both respiratory illnesses that are caused by different viruses. The flu is caused by various types of influenza viruses, while COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus discovered in 2019, says Dr. Basu. Compared to the flu, COVID-19 seems to be more contagious and easily spread. It can also cause more serious illnesses in some cases than the flu. For both COVID-19 and flu, one or more days can pass between when a person becomes infected and when they begin to feel symptoms. However, it may take longer for a person to experience symptoms after being infected with COVID-19 than the flu. Typically, a person experiences flu symptoms one to four days after infection. For COVID-19, it typically takes five days after infection for a person to experience symptoms. In both COVID-19 and flu, it’s possible to spread the virus for at least one day before experiencing symptoms. That’s why it is so important to get tested for COVID-19 and self-quarantine immediately following potential exposure to infection. What are the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and flu symptoms? Both COVID-19 and flu may have symptoms ranging in severity. Kids who have been infected may show some or most of these symptoms, or they may be asymptomatic, where they don’t develop any symptoms at all. Dr. Basu points out the signs and symptoms that flu and COVID-19 have in common: Fever or feeling feverish/having chillsCoughShortness of breath or difficulty breathingFatigue (tiredness)Sore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle pain or body achesHeadacheVomiting and diarrhea The only major symptom that points toward COVID-19 rather than flu is the loss of smell and taste. Print this chart How do you know if your child has COVID-19 or the flu? Since flu and COVID-19 symptoms are so similar, Dr. Basu suggests calling your pediatrician, explaining the symptoms and self-quarantining until your child can get tested for COVID-19. Can kids get the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot at the same time? Yes. Children ages 5 years and older are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine, and they can receive the flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine simultaneously. They can also receive any other necessary vaccines at the same time too. The physician will administer each vaccine in a different injection site, likely in the same arm, so it’s possible that your children will experience some soreness in the injection sites. If in need of relief, give your child ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help with the pain. You can also place a cold, wet washcloth over the tender area. Featured article Acetaminophen vs. ibuprofen and how to administer both safely Is the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot free? The COVID-19 vaccine is free. Appointments can be made by visiting myturn.gov. The flu shot is typically free with insurance at pharmacies or your pediatrician’s office. Without insurance, the flu shot can range in price from $30 to $70. However, some pharmacies and clinics offer discounted or free flu shot promotions. Does getting the flu vaccine give you the flu? No. Since the flu shot is made from a dead virus, kids and adults cannot get the flu from the virus. Some may think they have the flu because they experience some flu-like symptoms like low-grade fever or body aches following receiving the flu vaccine. However, this is actually beneficial because it shows that the body is matching the appropriate immune response to the flu shot. Does getting the COVID-19 vaccine give you COVID-19? No. The Pfizer vaccine, which is currently authorized for children ages 12 years and older, as well as the Moderna vaccine, which is authorized for people ages 18 years and older, is an mRNA vaccine. When the vaccine is injected, mRNA – a strip of genetic material – enters a body’s cell and prompts the cell to build copies of spike proteins. These spike proteins are the bumps that protrude from the surface of coronavirus particles. The body’s immune system then learns to spot these spike proteins and produces antibodies that block the virus from entering healthy cells in the future. Because of this, the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may cause some symptoms like a low-grade fever, body aches and tiredness. Like the flu vaccine, this is good because it shows that the immune system is initiating an appropriate immune response to the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen vaccine is a viral vector, which uses a modified version of a different virus to deliver important instructions to cells. The viral vector is not the COVID-19 virus, but a different, harmless virus that will produce a spike protein that the body will create an immune response to. That immune response will then protect the body if it comes in contact with COVID-19. Learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine and kids. How can you help prevent your kids from getting the flu or COVID-19? Having your children get the flu shot as soon as possible will help avoid serious illness from the flu. Children as young as 6 months of age are recommended to receive the flu shot. For healthy children ages 2 years and older, a nasal spray vaccination is also available. Speak with your pediatrician about whether they recommend the nasal spray vaccination for your child. Since the primary flu season is from October to April, it’s best to get the flu shot before or during October. However, getting the flu shot later in flu season is much better than not getting it at all. For protection against COVID-19, have your eligible children, ages 5 years and older, receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Not only will it significantly decrease the chances of your children contracting the virus, but it will also decrease the chances of them becoming seriously ill with the virus. Additionally, vaccinating as many members of your family as possible will help the community spread and offer your family a much lesser chance of contracting the virus.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) CDC Collaboration Improves Flu Vaccination Efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages November 10, 2021—CDC is working with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to help inform flu vaccination efforts in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Findings from a collaborative effort have shown that flu causes a significant disease burden and associated health care costs in these countries and that flu vaccines can not only prevent flu-related illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, they also can reduce flu-related health care costs. Documenting these benefits can be particularly important in countries with limited resources to support public health, as the data supports efforts to expand flu vaccine programs in these countries. CDC has been supporting this international collaboration since 2013 by providing technical assistance and funding to the PAHO “Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin American and the Caribbean – influenza” or REVELAC-i. REVELAC-i systematically collects flu data via the flu surveillance systems in several countries, and it uses this data to produce flu vaccine effectiveness estimates. The CDC’s Influenza Division (ID) provides technical assistance to REVELAC-i by using this vaccine effectiveness data to evaluate the impact of countries’ existing vaccination programs. REVELAC-i’s members currently work with government health officials from each participating Latin American and Caribbean country to collect and share data and to raise awareness of the burden of flu as well as the benefits of flu vaccination. REVELAC-i has developed dozens of scientific reports and publications to share its work and research findings. Through these efforts, REVELAC-i promotes government investment in flu vaccines and seeks to expand each country’s vaccine recommendations to increase coverage among the general population. Data collection efforts from PAHO and supplemental partners have found that in the Americas influenza-associated respiratory mortality ranges between 41,007 and 71,710 people annually. Several countries in this region also have a high burden of flu-related deaths in children younger than 5 years and adults 65 years and older with pre-existing conditions. REVELAC-i’s publications highlight these burden data and help governments conduct public health interventions, such as targeting and tailoring flu vaccination efforts to groups at higher risk, including children. The publications also help document vaccine effectiveness in these higher risk populations. REVELAC-i’s work has supported development of evidence-based strategies to predict, prevent, detect, and respond to flu outbreaks. These efforts have helped decision makers in government prevents flu related disease and deaths.

Kenny Chmielewski (more)Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc./Kenny Chmielewski This infographic explains what influenza and pandemics are and how the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 spread. That pandemic was the most severe influenza outbreak of the 20th century and, in total number of deaths, among the most devastating pandemics in history. The infographic uses graphs to compare the estimated death toll from that pandemic with death statistics from other historic events. The following text provides a detailed description of the infographic. What is influenza? What is a pandemic? The infographic explains that influenza, or the flu, is a disease caused by a virus transmitted between people by airborne respiratory secretions. It goes on to describe a pandemic as an outbreak of infectious disease that occurs over a wide geographical area and that is of high prevalence, generally affecting a significant proportion of the world’s population, usually over the course of several months. According to the infographic, there is no consensus on the origins of the influenza pandemic of 1918–19. What is known is that the outbreak was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. A diagram shows symptoms of the influenza pandemic of 1918–19, including fever, aches, pneumonia, nausea, and diarrhea. Why was the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 called the Spanish flu? The infographic explains that, during World War I, Spain was neutral, so newspapers could report freely on the outbreak occurring there. In contrast, governments of combatant countries sought to maintain public morale by censoring news of the outbreak occurring among their populations. Consequently, many people came to associate the illness with Spain. How did the disease spread? As the infographic explains, World War I placed large numbers of people close to one another, increasing the risk of disease transmission. This was especially so in the military, to which some 30% of all the physicians in the U.S. were deployed during the war. Also contributing to the spread of the flu was the state of medical knowledge, practice, and technology at the time. Health services were limited, and medical technology and countermeasures were limited or nonexistent. There were no diagnostic tests or vaccines, let alone coordinated pandemic plans. Doctors at the time did not even know that influenza viruses existed. According to the infographic, the pandemic occurred in three waves. The first wave, in March 1918, was comparatively mild and spread through western Europe during World War I. The second wave, in August 1918, was more lethal: pneumonia often developed quickly, and death usually came two days after the first indications of the flu. How fast did the disease spread? Six days after the first case was detected at the U.S. Army’s Camp Devens, in Massachusetts, the site had 6,674 cases. The third wave added to the death toll in the winter and spring of 1919 but subsided that summer. In the two later waves about half of all deaths occurred among previously healthy 20- to 40-year-olds, an unusual mortality age pattern for influenza. How deadly was the pandemic compared with other historic crises? To put the devastation of the 1918–19 influenza pandemic in historical perspective, the infographic presents three bar graphs comparing death statistics of the pandemic with those of other lethal events from ancient times to the present. In the first graph, the number of U.S. citizens who died in the influenza pandemic is compared with the number of U.S. citizens who died in World Wars I and II. Whereas some 675,000 Americans died in the pandemic, 116,516 died in World War I and 292,131 in World War II. The second graph compares the number of people who died in the pandemic worldwide with the total number who died in the world wars. The pandemic is thought to have caused some 25–50 million deaths around the world. By comparison, World War I caused about 8.5 million deaths worldwide, and World War II caused about 19.4 million. Finally, the third bar graph compares the number of deaths in the influenza pandemic worldwide with the number of deaths in other historic pandemics. The death toll of the 1918–19 pandemic may be on par with the 25–50 million deaths from the Black Death, which ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1351. By comparison, the Antonine plague, occurring across the Roman Empire about 165 to 180 CE, probably caused at least 5 million deaths and perhaps as many as 10 million. Since 1981 about 35 million people around the world have died from HIV/AIDS.

News By Nicoletta Lanese published 8 November 2021 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Getty / Geber86) Jump to: Picking the right strains Problems with manufacturing? How to improve the flu shot The effectiveness of the seasonal flu shot pales in comparison to knockout shots like the MMR vaccine, which is about 97% effective at preventing measles, 88% effective at preventing mumps and 97% effective against rubella. By contrast, flu shots typically range from 40% to 60% effective, and sometimes their effectiveness dips as low as 10%. But why are flu shots less effective than other commonly used vaccines? A lot of it comes down to the rapid mutation of influenza viruses and the uncertainty around which strains might be circulating when flu season rolls around, experts told Live Science. And some of the vaccine's flaws may stem from how the shot is manufactured and the specific parts of the influenza virus it targets. But although the flu shot isn't perfect, it still offers enough protection that the shot is worth getting, Live Science previously reported. Related: The flu shot isn't that effective. Here's why you should still get it.Picking the right strains The seasonal flu shot typically trains the body to fight four types of influenza virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): two influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and two influenza B viruses from the so-called Victoria and Yamagata lineages, which refer to branches of the influenza family tree. These influenza viruses mutate rapidly from year to year, meaning their genetic code changes and the proteins that appear on their outer surfaces change rapidly, too. The flu shot works by training the immune system to recognize one of these surface proteins, called hemagglutinin (HA), which juts off the virus "like a lollipop on a stick," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Similar to the novel coronavirus's infamous spike protein, the HA protein enables influenza viruses to bind to and infiltrate cells to infect them. And the HA protein mutates rapidly, essentially doing a costume change every year and thus making it hard for the immune system to recognize it.Another challenge is that flu shots must be manufactured and ready to go before flu season, so scientists use various strategies to predict which flu strains will be circulating in the coming months.

"But we have to project, because it takes time to make the vaccine." And even as the vaccine is being prepped, the circulating viruses can keep on mutating, sometimes to the point that they no longer match the shots well. And by the time flu season begins, the influenza strains scientists thought would be most prevalent can sometimes be overtaken by other versions of the viruses. To predict which flu strains will dominate in the upcoming season, more than 140 national influenza centers in 113 countries collect swab samples from people who get flu-like sicknesses throughout the year, identifying those who actually caught influenza, according to Scientific American. Five World Health Organization-affiliated centers then do gene sequencing of the samples, characterize the proteins that lie on the viral surface, and run laboratory tests to see how well past vaccines neutralize the circulating flu strains, according to the CDC. They also determine which strains appear to be making the most people sick, and how fast the strains are spreading. Related: Are viruses alive?Digital rendering of an influenza virus. (Image credit: Shutterstock)In February, consultants from each center come up with a recommendation for which strains to include for the Northern Hemisphere's flu vaccine for the upcoming winter. In September, they do the same for the Southern Hemisphere."Sometimes, the choice is right on target," Schaffner said. And then "there are other times that the flu manages to evade our predictions." That said, even when there's a "good match" between the vaccine strains and circulating strains, the shots only tend to be about 40% to 60% effective. This modest effectiveness may be related to the fact that the shots target only the HA protein, rather than multiple spots on the influenza virus, and that the human immune system can sometimes be undermined by its previous exposures to the flu, Science magazine reported. The natural immune response to an influenza infection involves generating antibodies against multiple proteins on the viral surface, not just HA, according to a 2013 report in Clinical Microbiology Reviews. The vaccines, by comparison, primarily generate antibodies against the HA protein, and it's unclear if targeting additional surface proteins could boost the shots' effectiveness, Science magazine reported. Our first exposures to the flu in childhood may also bias how the immune system responds to vaccination, sometimes to our detriment, according to Science. After its first flu exposure, the body generates long-lived memory B cells, immune cells that remember the virus and can reactivate to produce more antibodies in the future. Some evidence suggests that later, if one is vaccinated against a similar — but not identical — flu virus to the first one they encountered, the body may reactivate these memory B cells, which crank out antibodies that miss their intended target. Many flu vaccines are tested in ferrets that have never been exposed to flu before, so it's difficult to know whether the shot will work similarly in humans who've likely encountered flu viruses several times before. Problems with manufacturing? The way most flu shots are produced may also undermine their success.Most flu vaccines contain viruses that have been grown in chicken eggs, as part of the manufacturing process. "You have to modify the virus a little bit so it grows abundantly in eggs," Schaffner explained. And there's some evidence that, as the egg-borne virus replicates, it may pick up mutations that cause its genetics to diverge from the circulating flu strains. So when the egg-borne viruses are then killed or weakened for use in flu vaccines, they no longer match flu viruses in the wild. In general, influenza A(H3N2) viruses mutate the fastest out of the flu subtypes included in the vaccines, so influenza A(H3N2) viruses are the most likely to produce "escape mutants" that can evade vaccines. A(H3N2) also appears most prone to so-called egg-adapted changes, the CDC states. These factors may explain why flu shots are typically less protective against H3N2.Although most flu vaccines start out in eggs, not all do, according to the CDC. Some of the viruses used in inactivated flu shots — which contain "dead" flu viruses — are grown in mammalian cells, and so-called recombinant flu vaccines don't require live virus samples at all. For the recombinant vaccines, scientists build a synthetic gene that codes for the HA protein and then produce the protein inside baculoviruses, which naturally infect insects. Some studies hint that genetically engineered HA may provide better protection against influenza than egg-grown viruses, Science magazine reported, but Schaffner said this still needs to be confirmed with further research.How to improve the flu shotMany groups are currently working on new-and-improved flu vaccines that aim to provide more protection, and some may not need to be updated every year.For example, researchers at Stanford University are working to develop a flu vaccine that targets the HA "stem" — the stick portion of the "lollipop" — rather than going after the HA protein itself, according to a statement. (A similar vaccine, called Flu-v, showed promise in an early-stage clinical trial, Live Science previously reported.) Although the HA protein mutates relentlessly, a portion of its stem looks the same in many different influenza strains and doesn't change from year to year. So by targeting the stem rather than the HA protein, flu vaccines could offer protection against multiple strains without needing to be updated, Science magazine reported.Such a vaccine would "cover virtually all influenza strains," Schaffner said. In pursuit of a broad-spectrum flu vaccine, some groups are targeting a different protein on the influenza virus surface, called neuraminidase, according to Science magazine. And still other groups have identified specific bits of the HA "lollipop" that appear consistent among flu subtypes, Nature reported. Adding specific adjuvants, or ingredients that rev up the immune system, to universal flu vaccines could also help them call both trained memory B cells and naive B cells into action, broadening the body's antibody response, according to a 2020 report in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In addition to the groups pursuing "universal" flu vaccines, several vaccine-makers, including COVID-19 vaccine developers Moderna and Pfizer, are currently testing flu vaccines that use a genetic molecule called mRNA as their base. Once inside the body, the mRNA gives cells instructions to build influenza antigens, and thus teaches the immune system how to recognize the viruses. Compared to egg-grown vaccines, which take months to produce, mRNA vaccines can be turned out incredibly quickly and don't require live virus samples. That means that, in theory, strains for the vaccines could be selected closer to the start of flu season, ensuring a closer match to the circulating strains.But for now, despite their flaws, the currently available flu shots are the best option for protecting yourself against the flu. A flu shot in the arm will offer at least partial protection, Schaffner said, but "vaccines in the refrigerator never prevented any disease."Originally published on Live Science.

We conducted a population-based cross-sectional mobile telephone survey in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh to investigate the frequency and patterns of human exposure to live poultry in LPMs and at home. Among 1047 urban residents surveyed, 74.2% (95% CI 70.9–77.2) reported exposure to live poultry in the past year, with the majority of exposure occurring on a weekly basis. While visiting LPMs was less common amongst females (40.3%, 95% CI 35.0–45.8) than males (58.9%, 95% CI 54.0–63.5), females reported greater poultry exposure through food preparation, including defeathering (13.2%, 95% CI 9.5–17.9) and eviscerating (14.8%, 95% CI 11.2–19.4) (p < 0.001). A large proportion of the urban population is frequently exposed to live poultry in a setting where avian influenza viruses are endemic in LPMs. There is thus not only ample opportunity for spillover of avian influenza infections into humans in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but also greater potential for viral reassortment which could generate novel strains with pandemic potential.

A majority of pandemic influenza strains in the past century have had an avian origin, making avian influenza viruses (AIVs) a particular global health concern2,3,4. Currently circulating AIV subtypes, which can be endemic in domestic poultry (e.g., H5N1, H7N9), have shown potential for reassortment with human influenza viruses under laboratory conditions5,6,7, and are a source of sporadic human infections8. The primary route of AIV transmission to humans is through direct or indirect exposure to live poultry, with high-risk practices including touching poultry, having poultry in the house, and preparing live poultry for consumption9. Live poultry markets (LPMs), which are known to play a critical role in maintaining and amplifying viruses, have also been identified as a source of AIV transmission between poultry species and from poultry to humans9,10,11.Poultry production sectors in low- and middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh, are currently transitioning from small-scale backyard holdings to commercial production systems to meet growing consumer demands12,13. There is a growing body of evidence linking intensification practices to zoonotic disease emergence14,15,16. In Bangladesh, a variety of AIV subtypes (e.g., H5, H9, H10) have been isolated in LPMs17,18, and sporadic AIV poultry outbreaks have been reported since 200719. In urban Bangladesh, where greater than 90% of poultry and poultry products are marketed through LPMs and mainly sold in an unprocessed form (i.e., live or freshly slaughtered)19,20, AIV exposure in the general population may be increasing19,21. Appropriate uptake of personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce exposure thereby helping prevent zoonotic AIV transmission and reducing the risk of viral adaption to human hosts in the population9.Although population-based poultry exposure surveys have been conducted in Hong Kong22,23, China24,25,26, Vietnam and Thailand27, such information is of interest in Bangladesh where there are lower resource capacities, different poultry production systems, and growing populations in dense urban areas. The extent of poultry exposure in the general urban population, as opposed to high-risk poultry sector workers in farms or markets11,28,29, has not been studied in Bangladesh. Furthermore, while in rural Bangladesh, females are generally involved in raising backyard poultry30,31, sex-disaggregated poultry exposures have not been explored in urban areas.Here, we report on a population-based survey of live poultry exposure conducted among the general urban adult population of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We investigated the frequency and patterns of human exposure to live poultry in LPMs and at home, examined the uptake and adherence to prevention practices and use of PPE, and compared these patterns between males and females. This information may inform appropriate control strategies that are tailored to local socio-cultural contexts, and hence promote more sustainable mitigation measures to prevent transmission and emergence of influenza viruses at the human-poultry interface.MethodsStudy design and participantsWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey in North and South Dhaka City Corporations (collectively known as DCC; population size: 6.97 million32), Bangladesh from September to November 2019. Details of the study procedures have been described elsewhere33. In brief, we employed a single-stage stratified mobile telephone survey using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) system. We recruited an equal number of male and female participants to allow for robust sex-specific analyses. Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they were at least 18 years of age, current DCC residents, and had been residing in DCC for the previous year. Survey recruitment using the CATI system enabled random selection of mobile telephone numbers from sampling frames provided by each mobile telephone operator in Bangladesh. Telephone numbers were provided with the permission of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission.Each selected mobile telephone number was attempted up to four times, with calls made at different times of day and on different days of the week. At the time of first successful contact, respondents were screened for eligibility and sex before being invited to complete the survey. If the respondent was busy, the call was rescheduled for an alternate time within the next 7 days.Data collectionData regarding live poultry exposures were collected using a questionnaire we developed, building on surveys conducted in urban China24,25; the survey instrument was translated into Bangla and pretested for length, content validity, and comprehension. The main settings for exposure to poultry in urban Bangladesh are LPMs, which are defined as a fixed collection of stalls or vendors where the general public can purchase live chickens, ducks, geese or any by-products of these in an unprocessed form34. In line with previous research, we define live poultry exposure as self-reported direct or indirect contact with live or unprocessed poultry at an LPM or in the home24,25. Information gathered included LPM visit rates in the past year, types of poultry purchased, contact (e.g., touching, proximity to defeathering and slaughtering) at LPMs, food preparation practices at home, prevention practices and PPE usage, recent influenza-like-illness (ILI), as well as individual and household socio-demographic characteristics. ILI was defined as reporting a new fever and cough in the past 10 days35. For participants not reporting visiting LPMs, we asked briefly about other household members’ live poultry exposures to estimate household-level exposure. Interviews were administered in Bangla over the phone by trained research assistants and data were recorded in real-time within the CATI system. The final survey instrument is available in the Supplementary Information.Statistical analysisWe applied post-stratification weights to adjust for differences in the distribution of age, sex, and education between the survey sample and the DCC demographic profile of the 2011 census32. Population demographics were evaluated using descriptive statistics, including proportions for categorical variables, stratified by sex. We estimated prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for live poultry exposures and prevention practices stratified by sex. Differences in poultry exposure prevalence between males and females were examined using chi-square tests. Household-level poultry exposures and ILI were also estimated.We applied a conservatively estimated number of visits to LPMs per response category using previously established methods25,26. Standardized midpoints per response category were assigned to obtain the overall and age/sex stratified mean annual number and standard deviation (SD) of LPM visits: 0 for no reported visits, 1 for 1–2 visits/year, 4 for 3–5 visits/year, 8 for 6–11 visits/year, 24 for 1–3 visits/month, 52 for 1–2 visits/week, 208 for 3–5 visits/week, 365 for daily visits.All analyses were conducted in Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) using complex survey functions to incorporate survey weights.EthicsAll study methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, and this study received ethical approval from the committees of each of the participating research institutions: University of Toronto (Protocol No. 37657), the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IRB/2019/11) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Ref. 17661). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided oral informed consent via telephone.ResultsPopulation characteristicsBetween September and November 2019, we dialled 5486 unique mobile telephone numbers of which 2006 respondents were eligible33. Interviews were completed with 1047 participants, for an overall response rate of 52.2%. Of the 1047 participants, 16 (1.5%) were excluded from analysis due to missing information for survey weighting variables (i.e., age, sex, education). The demographic distribution of the weighted survey sample was generally representative of the DCC adult population33, with about 42% female, the majority aged under 35 years, and most with less than secondary education. Two thirds of females were home makers; about half of males had clerical, sales, and service jobs and another third were in skilled/unskilled labour occupations. Nearly half of participants lived in households of 4–5 members, with over two thirds living with children < 5 years of age. About 10% reported keeping live poultry in the household (Table 1).Table 1 Demographic and household characteristics of participants, by sex, Dhaka City Corporation, Bangladesh.Full size tableLive poultry exposure and poultry purchasing practicesThe overall prevalence of any live poultry exposure, including at LPMs or in the home during food preparation, in the past year was 74.2% (95% CI 70.9–77.2) (Table 2). At the household-level, 89.0% (95% CI 86.5–91.0) of participants reported that someone in their household and/or themselves visited an LPM. Additionally, of the 11.0% (95% CI 9.0–13.5) who did not report any household LPM visits, 32.3% (95% CI 22.6–43.8) purchased live poultry through mobile vendors.Table 2 Exposure to live poultry in markets and during food preparation in the past year, by sex, Dhaka City Corporation, Bangladesh.Full size tableThere were significant differences in poultry exposure between males and females (p < 0.001). Visiting LPMs was less common amongst females (40.3%, 95% CI 35.0–45.8) than males (58.9%, 95% CI 54.0–63.5). However, females had significantly greater poultry exposure through food preparation practices, with about three times as many females reporting defeathering (13.2%, 95% CI 9.5–17.9), eviscerating (14.8%, 95% CI 11.2–19.4), and cutting/washing fresh poultry meat (77.9%, 95% CI 73.2–82.0) as compared to males. Poultry slaughtering, when carried out at home as opposed to at the market, was more commonly reported by males (25.7%, 95% CI 21.7–30.2) than females (8.2%, 95% CI 5.4–12.3) (Table 2). The average number of LPM visits per year was estimated as 30.2 (SD 2.2); however, there was substantial variation by age and sex (Fig. 1). The average number of visits was consistently higher amongst males than females across all age groups, and the greatest number of visits were recorded amongst individuals aged 35–44 years in both sexes.Figure 1Live poultry markets visits reported in the past year, by sex and age group, Dhaka City Corporation, Bangladesh. Annual live poultry market visiting varied by age and sex. The average number of visits was consistently higher amongst males than females across all age groups, and the greatest number of visits were recorded amongst individuals aged 35–44 years in both sexes.Full size imageOf those who reported personally visiting an LPM in the past year, over two thirds (67.3%, 95% CI 62.4–71.9) made at least 1–2 visits per week with no observed difference between males and females (Table 2). About half of participants (48.9%, 95% CI 43.8–54.0) reported touching poultry while purchasing, with a significantly greater proportion of males than females reporting this (p < 0.001); 7.9% (95% CI 5.6–11.0) of participants reported indirectly contacting poultry (i.e., cages, baskets) when purchasing, with no notable difference by sex. Almost all respondents (92.0%, 95% CI 88.2–94.7) reported having their purchased poultry usually slaughtered at the market, and the majority reported standing by the stall during slaughtering, defeathering, and evisceration (Table 2). The most frequently purchased poultry types were broiler and Sonali chickens with the greatest proportion of respondents buying these on a weekly or monthly basis. Ducks and geese were purchased least frequently; types of purchases were similar between males and females (Fig. 2).Figure 2Poultry purchasing practices among those who have visited a live poultry market in the past year, by sex, Dhaka City Corporation, Bangladesh. Purchasing practices varied by poultry type, broiler and Sonali chickens were predominantly purchased on a weekly or monthly basis while ducks and geese were purchased only annually. Purchasing practices were similar between males and females. The denominator is the weighted number of respondents reporting visiting a market in the past year, by sex.Full size imagePrevention practicesAmong those who reported any poultry exposure, the majority (75.6%, 95% CI 71.6–79.2) reported always washing their hands with soap after exposure, with a greater proportion of females reporting this practice than males (Table 3). Use of PPE in the population was generally low, with most participants reporting never wearing facemasks (90.1%, 95% CI 87.4–92.2) when exposed to poultry. Amongst those who reported food preparation practices at home, the majority reported never wearing gloves (96.1%, 95% CI 94.1–97.4) or aprons (98.9%, 95% CI 97.8–99.4). These practices varied slightly by sex, with a significantly greater proportion of females than males reporting never wearing facemasks (p = 0.002). A further breakdown of prevention practices by source and location of exposure is detailed in Supplementary Table 1.Table 3 Uptake of protective practices among those with poultry exposure in the past year, by sex, Dhaka City Corporation, Bangladesh.Full size tableInfluenza like illnessBetween September and November 2019, the cumulative incidence of reported ILI was 3.1% (95% CI 2.0–4.7). ILI varied by age, with those above age 45 years having the highest incidence, and those in age groups 25–34 and 35–44 years with the lowest (Supplementary Fig. 1). Amongst those with ILI symptoms, 32.7% (95% CI 15.5–56.1) reported exposure to live poultry in the 3 days before symptom onset, which might suggest that if epidemic influenza was circulating that co-infections with any AIVs may be possible. Household-level ILI cumulative incidence was 6.7% (95% CI 5.1–8.8).DiscussionThis population-based cross-sectional survey provides empirical estimates of high levels of exposure to live poultry in DCC, Bangladesh, adding to our understanding of the potential risks of avian influenza transmission to humans in an urban low-income setting. Three quarters (74%) of the adult population are exposed to live poultry, with the majority reporting exposure on a weekly basis. Reported exposure practices included both LPM visits and at-home poultry food preparation but the patterns were different between males and females. While hygiene practices such as hand washing after poultry exposure was high, the use of PPE—which has also been recommended by the Government of Bangladesh for those who are in contact with live poultry19—was low, with less than 10% reporting wearing facemasks and less than 5% reporting wearing gloves or aprons. These results suggest that a large proportion of the urban population could easily be exposed to AIVs, which are known to circulate in LPMs in DCC, Bangladesh (H5 market prevalence: 21.6%, H9 market prevalence: 63.2%10)17,18.In our study, 51% of the population reported personally visiting an LPM and 89% reported that at least one member of their household made a visit in the last year. While there are limited data on poultry exposure in other South Asian urban populations to enable comparisons, these estimates are considerably higher than those reported in other urban Asian settings such as in Hanoi, Vietnam where 34% of households reported buying live poultry36. Similarly, our results are higher than those of studies conducted in mainland urban China, which report between 19 and 45% of individuals visiting LPMs annually24,25,26. These differences could be due to greater perceived risks of AIVs in East and Southeast Asia, where there have been more recent and frequent AIV outbreaks24,37, as well as ecosocial and livelihood differences (e.g., less access to other fresh meat or cold chain supported processed meat outlets). Despite the high exposure to live poultry in urban Bangladesh, there have been a low number of reported human AIV cases (eight H5N1 cases to date8). While this could be due to underreporting of human AIV cases as well as moderate improvements in biosecurity practices at high-risk exposure points19, the rate of effective viral transmission of AIVs after close contact with infected poultry remains unclear and is perhaps lower than previously hypothesized.Although contact with live poultry was high across the population, there were substantial variations in exposure practices between sex and age groups. Exposure amongst males was greatest through LPM visits while for females it was through food preparation—including defeathering and eviscerating, which while only reported by about 15% of females are both high-risk practices due to their considerable release of airborne AIV particles38. Our findings are similar to studies conducted in rural Bangladesh, which report that females have higher involvement in poultry evisceration, defeathering, as well as cutting and washing fresh meat30,31. Amongst those visiting LPMs, we found that almost half of respondents reported contact with poultry before slaughter including touching or picking up birds, which is similar to estimates in urban China24,25. The vast majority of LPM-goers also reported standing near stalls during slaughter, evisceration, and defeathering, which may result in exposure to airborne AIV particles38. While various biosecurity interventions such as designated slaughter areas have been implemented in markets to reduce direct contact with viscera19, our results suggest that there continues to be exposure risk within market settings in DCC, Bangladesh. Variations in exposure patterns are associated with differences in AIV risk39, and therefore public AIV awareness programs and interventions focused on structural changes in markets and behavioural risk modifications should be appropriately targeted to local sex-specific exposure patterns. These could include improved slaughter-house services at LPMs and greater uptake of bio-secure defeathering practices, such as buckets with lids, at homes for those reporting home-based poultry processing40.Effective biosecurity measures can limit the risk of AIV transmission due to high-risk or frequent exposure34. We find that the overall uptake and adherence to prevention practices was low amongst those with poultry exposure. Hand hygiene practices were reported most, but adherence was still inadequate with 25% of respondents reporting never or not always washing their hands with soap after poultry exposure; however, this may have changed with the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, reports of handwashing in our study are higher than those reported in previous studies that have used direct participant observation41. Potential interventions to increase handwashing practices could include the implementation of hand washing facilities within LPMs as has been effectively piloted in Indonesia42. Those who reported slaughtering, eviscerating, and/or defeathering poultry at home reported low PPE use, which is similar to uptake of prevention practices amongst LPM workers in Bangladesh28 and Nepal43. This is also in line with findings from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, which found that overall prevalence of wearing gloves, facemasks, aprons, and boots was low within LPMs and even lower within households9. We found that amongst those self-reporting recent ILI symptoms almost a third reported poultry exposure in the three days prior to symptom onset, which would coincide with the influenza latent period44. Such instances of exposure between humans and poultry pose a risk for coinfection and genetic reassortment between influenza strains45, which could lead to the emergence of a novel influenza strain with pandemic potential. Public health programmes that ensure services and interventions are appropriately tailored to populations exposure, and improve the delivery, uptake, and adherence of PPE use and hygiene practices are required to reduce these risks.Our study has some limitations. The survey response rate (52.2%) was slightly lower than previous telephone-based cross-sectional surveys conducted in Bangladesh using mobile phones46,47. We aimed to minimise this bias by using a robust sampling strategy, including multiple call attempts and call-rescheduling. We also weighted the sample by sex, age, and education to be broadly representative of the census urban population. Our population sampling frame also only included those with mobile phones, a source of selection bias if those with and without mobile phones have different poultry exposure practices. However, given that mobile phone ownership is greater than 87% in urban Bangladesh we anticipate this having minimal impact on population estimates48. Research in Afghanistan has found that those in lower socioeconomic quintiles had greater exposure to poultry49, which would in fact suggest our results could be underestimates. Greater understanding on if and how these patterns may have changed since the COVID-19 pandemic would be important and could be further examined in longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional surveys. Finally, this study is based on self-reported exposures and prevention practices, which could be influenced by social desirability bias. This may explain the reason for higher levels of handwashing than reported in previous studies conducted using direct observation41.In conclusion, we find that exposure to live poultry is high and uptake of prevention practices are low among the general adult population in urban Bangladesh. There continue to be high risks for AIV transmission at human-poultry interfaces including at LPMs. Further research examining factors associated with poultry exposure and using this to develop interventions that are appropriately tailored to local socio-cultural contexts are needed to better support human and animal well-being. Strengthening collaborations between the human and animal health sectors is essential to better understand risk of transmission and protect populations from emergence of pandemic threats.

Every fall, any visit to a local doctor or pharmacy will likely prompt the question, “Did you get your flu vaccine yet?” While some get the jab faithfully each flu season, about half of the American population declines, likely over doubts of the vaccine’s effectiveness and necessity. While the childhood MMR vaccine touts real-world effectiveness at 97% for preventing measles, 88% effective against mumps, and 97% against rubella, the annual flu shot pales in comparison, coming in at somewhere around 40-60% effective. And that’s for a “good year,” where the viral strain predictions are closely match circulating strains. So, why can’t we come up with more effective flu vaccines? The heart of the problem is the influenza virus’ rapid mutation. If you’ve ever seen a quick-change artist perform, you’re amazed at how the artist can go from a floor-length ball gown to a short strappy dress in a matter of seconds. The feat seems nearly impossible. Scientists watch the influenza virus in its quick-change performance each year. By examining what strains are actively circulating in February, consultants from WHO-affiliated centers come up with their best guesses as to which strains are likely to be best-fitted for the upcoming winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Vanderbilt University infectious disease specialist Dr. William Shaffner explained, “You try to anticipate which strains are going to be active during your winter, early. But we have to project, because it takes time to make the vaccine.” Most of our current flu vaccines are quadrivalent, meaning, they train the immune system to fight four types of influenza virus: two influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B viruses. The genetic code mutations on these four most common strains change the proteins that appear on the virus’ outer surface. The flu shots train the body to recognize one of those surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA). The coronavirus pandemic has cemented in our minds images of a virus with those spike proteins poking out like little trees on the surface. Likewise, the HA protein head, the canopy section of the tree that the vaccines trigger antibody responses too, enables the flu virus to bind to our cells to infiltrate and cause infection. But when the mutation causes a quick change of the appearance of that protein, the training becomes a moot point. The immune system can no longer recognize the protein and doesn’t mount the correct immune response. Sometimes the predictions from the WHO centers are accurate, resulting in that 40–60% effective shot. Other times the virus has mutated further by the time flu season hits, and the effectiveness drops even more. Research has suggested that the flu vaccine’s effectiveness is also undermined by previous exposures, particularly during childhood. Most flu vaccines are made up of viruses grown in chicken eggs, which could also dampen the shot’s effectiveness. The vaccine virus may pick up its own mutations as it replicates, causing it to resemble the active flu strains less accurately. Multiple pharmaceutical companies are working on what they’re calling universal influenza vaccines. These formulations would provide long-lasting protection against numerous flu virus strains, including existing and emergent ones, thereby increasing effectiveness and hopefully eliminating the need for annual vaccination. The NIH is currently in a first-in-human trial, enrolling 40 healthy adult participants to study its universal vaccine candidate. The study is anticipated to be completed by 2023. Other companies are targeting the HA protein stalk, the trunk of the tree, as they have shown that portion of the protein to be less changing as the virus mutates. A new candidate being studied by a multi-institutional consortium funded by the U.S. National Insititute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases targets that stalk and has passed its first test in a small clinical trial. For the first time, the study proves a vaccine strategy producing stalk-reactive antibodies in humans is possible. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 VIP mRNA is also putting its hand to the plow to create an influenza vaccine. Moderna, Sanofi with Translate Bio, and Pfizer all have mRNA-powered seasonal flu vaccine candidates, which have moved into early-clinical testing with more companies hot on their heels. MRNA vaccines tend to cause more side effects, so safety is likely the biggest stumbling block for these candidates. However, the potential for a much more effective flu vaccine makes the concept worth exploring. Even with its less than stellar effective rates, the flu shot is still worth getting. According to a 2021 review published by vaccine, adults who were vaccinated against the flu and still got sick were 26% less likely to require intensive care. Vaccinated patients who ended up in the hospital were also 31% less likely to die from the flu. Data estimates that the vaccine prevented 7.5 million people from getting sick last flu season and prevented 6,300 flu-related deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the flu kills 290,000 to 650,000 people globally each year. Currently, our best defense is still an annual dose of the updated flu vaccine.

Download PDF Copy By Kirstin Spence, MScReviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc. Zoonosis, the transmission of an infectious disease from animals to humans, represents a major public health issue. This is particularly highlighted by the recent coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and the Ebola virus disease outbreak across Western Africa in 2014 – 2016, both of which are suspected to have originated in animals. Reverse zoonosis, in which a disease transmits from humans to animals, also poses threats to animal health as well as public health, due to the potential for animal disease reservoirs to form. Image Credit: Sohel Parvez Haque/Shutterstock.com Cross-species diseases The animal origins of many infectious diseases are well characterized and can range from bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal in nature. However, for these diseases to cross the species barrier and persist in a new host population, certain conditions must be met. Firstly, the contact between the original host and the potential new host must be sufficient for transmission events to occur (interspecific interactions). Secondly, there must be enough compatibility between the pathogen and recipient host to establish an infection and promote ongoing transmission (host-virus interactions). Finally, the network of the recipient species must be structured in such a way as to allow the infection to spread through the population (host-host interactions). Much of the scientific focus of infectious diseases that cross-species barriers are those that jump from animals to humans. In fact, almost 62% of pathogens affecting humans are estimated to have multi-species infectivity. Because of this, humans also carry the potential to transmit diseases to animals with which they come into close contact. What is zoonosis? A recent example of this is reports of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, being detected in domesticated and farmed animals. From humans to animals Reverse zoonosis can have a severe impact on the health of the animals affected. In 2020, several mink farms in the Netherlands reported cases of severe respiratory disease. Analysis of those minks that had passed away identified SARS-CoV-2 as the causative pathogen, which was likely introduced into the population after contact with infected farmworkers. Related StoriesPaid sick leave is up for a vote in three statesStudy identifies key blood stem cells in immune system agingAntibiotic for liver disease linked to emergence of antimicrobial resistant superbugHumans are also able to pass on diseases to their pets. There have been several documented cases of domesticated dogs, cats, and ferrets displaying flu-like symptoms, which were identified as being caused by an influenza A virus that had likely been transmitted from the pet’s owners. Some of these animals, particularly the cats and ferrets, progressed to severe respiratory distress and even death. The threat that human-derived pathogens pose to endangered species is also an important topic. In Tanzania, an outbreak of human metapneumovirus led to fatalities in a wild chimpanzee population. The virus was believed to have been transmitted by researchers and visitors to the national park where the chimpanzees resided. Another potential human-derived emerging disease in an endangered species is caused by the parasite Giardia duodenalis. This parasite has been found in the stool samples of both wild and captive African painted dogs and is thought to have derived from the open defecation of infected humans contaminating the local area. COVID-19 and the rise of zoonotic infectious diseasesPlay Reverse zoonosis and disease reservoirs A major concern with reverse zoonosis events is the potential for disease reservoirs to form, whereby reintroduction of pathogens into human populations could occur. This can be demonstrated by the incidents at the mink farms in the Netherlands. After the initial reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19, the disease then spread mink-to-mink before spilling back over into the human farmworkers. One of the best-studied reverse zoonoses is that of human-to-pig transmission of influenza A viruses. Farmed pigs are considered an important reservoir and a potential source of an emerging influenza pandemic, due to the fact that they can contract both human and avian influenza viruses. Because of this, there is the possibility for the genetic exchange of viral segments (reassortment) to occur, whereby a new viral strain emerges. In 2009 there was a global outbreak of an H1N1 influenza A virus subtype (pH1N1), dubbed the swine flu pandemic. Although originating in Mexico due to a pig-to-human zoonosis event, a large-scale reverse zoonosis of pH1N1 back into pigs then occurred globally. As well as being a concern for swine herd health, the sustained pig-to-pig transmission of the human-origin pH1N1 created the potential for disease reservoirs or genetic reassortment to occur. This was born out in the United States of America when the reassortment of pH1N1 with a human seasonal H3N2 influenza A virus led to sporadic outbreaks of the novel H3N2v influenza from 2011 onwards. What next? As globalization and industrialization increase, the likelihood of disease crossing species barriers does also. Trade, free movement of people, and agricultural and urban expansion lead to greater human-to-human and human-to-animal contact. There is therefore a greater possibility of zoonosis and reverse zoonosis manifesting and spreading globally. This, in turn, poses public health, conservation, and economic risks. Gaining a better understanding of the risk factors associated with reverse zoonosis can help identify potential pathogens and transmission routes and ultimately prevent such events from occurring.

Study: Measuring Influenza A Virus and Peptide Interaction Using Electrically Controllable DNA Nanolevers. Advanced Materials Technologies.Image Credit: Jarun Ontakrai/Shutterstock.com PeB is conjugated to DNA strands that are bonded to complementary anchors and fixed on the electrode surface of a "switchSENSE" biochip. A fluorophore is attached to the surface-tethered DNA strand, whereas the complementary strand has a multivalent configuration containing up to three PeB peptides. A negative voltage is used to keep the nanolevers erect (static). As the current epidemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated, viral pandemics represent a tremendous threat to humanity. A similar pandemic, known as the Spanish flu, was induced by an influenza A virus and led to millions of fatalities around the world. Annual outbreaks of different intensity are still caused by influenza A viruses. The globe was recently confronted with the swine flu in 2009. Influenza A is an Orthomyxoviridae virus that is encased in a lipid bilayer that contains three cell membranes: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and the M2 proton channels. Neuraminidase is a glycoside cleaver that is essential for the discharge of viral particles from infected cells. Subsequent to viral fusing, hemagglutinin binds to the host cell's sialic acid (SA)-containing cellular receptors. Understanding viral internalization and infection requires kinetic analysis of affinity and fervency coeﬃcients of various receptor binding to hemagglutinin. a) Top view of a switchSENSE microfluidic biochip with four flow channels. Each channel comprises six gold electrodes. The more detailed view shows the six independent measurement electrodes in a row within the microfluidic channel. b) Schematic overview of a single stranded DNA nanolever (NL-B48) immobilized on a gold electrode via thiol coupling. The nanolever carries a fluorophore at the lateral end. c) The DNA monolayer is functionalized with the ligand of interest by hybridization of the complementary DNA strand carrying a receptor molecule at the distal end. d) Dynamic measurement mode: The double stranded DNA nanolever is actuated to a switching motion by applying an alternating potential. The fluorescence signal is gradually quenched by energy transfer upon approaching the gold surface. Read-out of this mode is the switching speed of DNA nanolevers. The switching speed is slowed down upon binding of an analyte to the ligand molecule adding friction to the nanolever. e) Static measurement mode: DNA nanolevers are kept at an upright position. Read-out of this mode is the change in fluorescence intensity upon binding of an analyte due to changes in the local environment of the dye. Drawings are not to scale.

These kinetic metrics are becoming increasingly important in determining the effectiveness of candidates in medication development. Other methods for determining dissociation constants exist, but they lack the capacity to resolve bonding kinetic parameters. Radioligand binding tests, microscale thermophoresis (MST), and isothermal calorimetry are some examples of these. Surface plasmon resonance is one technology that allows for real-time monitoring of kinetic parameters (SPR). SPR measures and switchSENSE technologies are similar in that they both have benefits and drawbacks. As a result, a similar naming system is used. The quantifiable metrics of kinetic parameters in a timely manner, label-free detection, minimal sample expenditure, and high sensitivity of the technology are all benefits of SPR and switchSENSE. The disadvantages of both procedures are that one of the participants must be immobilized, which may have an impact on binding behavior, and that mass transfer is limited. Schematic view of the nanoconstruct ss3PeB (not drawn to scale). The single stranded overhang is complementary to NL-B48 on the electrode surface. Image Credit: Kruse M et al., Advanced Material The changeable receptor surface is a key benefit of switchSENSE technology over SPR. The switchSENSE sensor surfaces allow ligands to be placed at a specific density, eliminating crowding and enabling two distinct ligands to be distributed at a unique ratio to imitate cooperative effects. Furthermore, because it uses a reversible DNA hybridization immobilization approach, the general sensor surface may be employed for a variety of interactions. switchSENSE is particularly useful when the receptors of interest are DNA-based, as in our situation with DNA-peptide nanoconstructs. The resultant double-stranded DNA is negatively charged by nature and may be electrically controlled. When an alternating voltage is provided to the electrode surface, the end-tethered DNA strand oscillates (measuring mode called "dynamic mode"), and when a direct voltage is applied, the DNA nanolever stands erect (quantification mode called "static method"). The fluorophore's emission system provides information about the binding event in both circumstances. After a binding event, the speed of the DNA nanolever's motion is delayed by increasing hydrodynamic friction, causing a delay between the electrical and optical signals in the operating mode. This implies that after imprinting, a DC voltage is applied, resulting in the DNA-peptide constructions being erect and static. Fluorescent proximity detection is then used to examine virus binding. The corresponding second DNA strand has a four-armed shape for this purpose. On the gold electrode, one arm is partly complementary to the NL-B48 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Each of other three arms can be modified to carry the peptide PeB. As confirmed by microscale thermophoresis, the azide-based copper-free click chemical conjugation preserves the peptide's capacity to bind to hemagglutinin. Schematic illustration of one Influenza A virus X31 binding to the peptides attached to DNA nanoconstructs (here shown for ss2PeB). The virus is captured on the sensor surface by specific interaction of hemagglutinin to the presented peptide construct. Schematic is drawn to scale. Image Credit: Kruse M et al., Advanced Material Because all coupled nanoconstructs must dissolve at the same time for total viral dissociation, this greatly helps stabilize virus capture. Because the virus is still linked to the surface, rebinding will happen if only one pair of participants unbinds, enhancing the local concentration of accessible hemagglutinin proteins (avidity effect). Due to the combined effect of oligovalent binding and rebinding, this results in a condition where the virus is mostly attached to the nanoconstructs' peptides. In order to improve repeatability, the impact of chip degradation following tests, which limits the number of accessible nanolevers, must be addressed. Limitations in mass movement can be overcome by lowering the number of receptors and boosting flow rates. References Kruse, M., et al. (2021).

Defra has confirmed the unit contains chickens and turkeys which will be "humanely culled to limit the risk of onward transmission".When avian influenza is confirmed or suspected in poultry or other captive birds, disease control zones are put in place to try to prevent the spread.The zones can see restrictions on the movement of poultry and material associated with their keeping. A UK-wide bird flu prevention zone has also come into force, meaning bird keepers need to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks.Symptoms of the disease in birds include decreased activity or vocalisation, eating and drinking less and producing fewer eggs. Latest news from the West MidlandsElsewhere in the West Midlands region, parts of north Shropshire are also under a control zone, after avian flu was found in a small, backyard flock of chickens over the Welsh border near Chirk, Wrexham.Shropshire Council said anyone who suspected a bird had avian influenza should report it immediately by calling the Defra rural services helpline.Bird flu has also been confirmed at a wild bird rescue centre in Worcestershire.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

As the island nation of Singapore pursues a strategy of "living with COVID" and a gradual relaxation of pandemic restrictions, daily cases are skyrocketing and residents are growing increasingly anxious. (AP Photo/Annabelle Liang) Ang Hwee Min @HweeMinCNA Ang Hwee Min 12 Nov 2021 12:10PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The resumption of international travel and open borders amid loosening COVID-19 restrictions is likely to mark the return of other respiratory infections like influenza, said infectious diseases experts. Most respiratory viruses started to decline when Singapore moved to DORSCON orange in February 2020, and became nearly absent during the “circuit breaker” from Apr 7 to Jun 1 last year, with the strictest pandemic measures in effect, said Dr Matthias Maiwald, a microbiologist with KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH). The Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level guides Singapore's approach to outbreaks like COVID-19. The colour-coded system - which has Green, Yellow, Orange and Red categories - shows the current situation. It also indicates what needs to be done to prevent and reduce the impact of infections. A study conducted by Dr Maiwald and Dr Wan Wei Yee, a microbiologist with the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) showed that in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Singapore’s opening between June and December last year, some viruses “came back”, but influenza remained almost totally absent throughout this year. “Our assessment is that the respiratory infections will return sooner or later when the measures are lifted. They will likely return when wider travel resumes, we don’t quite know when it will return but we predict it will return,” said Dr Maiwald. The National University Hospital (NUH) saw zero cases of influenza this year, said Professor Paul Tambyah, senior consultant with its Division of Infectious Diseases. Quoting Ministry of Health (MOH) reports on influenza surveillance, Prof Tambyah noted that Singapore had one case of influenza B in July 2021, one in April 2020 and zero cases of influenza A since March 2020. “As there were zero cases of influenza, there was zero influenza death,” said Prof Tambyah, who is also a Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. However, the reasons why influenza has disappeared in most of the world while other viruses have reappeared are “unclear”, he added, noting that this was observed in NUH and across other SingHealth hospitals. “No one has a good explanation for this. There are various theories including - cross-protection between influenza and coronaviruses, or possibly different modes of transmission between the different respiratory viruses.” The main reasons for the sharp drop in influenza cases are COVID-19 measures - mask-wearing, increased attention to hand hygiene, social distancing and the shutdown of international travel, said Associate Professor David Lye of Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. The return of influenza depends on these measures moving forward, he added. “It is expected that once most countries open up there will be a resurgence of influenza,” he added. “From our study, we did hypothesise that the … lack of travel was quite strongly associated with the downfall of influenza in the DORSCON orange phase,” said Dr Maiwald. “So the reverse conclusion could be true, that when international travel recurs, influenza will come back. That is a reasonable construction.” A MORE SEVERE FLU SEASON Safe management measures were “really effective” at reducing respiratory infections like influenza, said Professor Teo Yik Ying of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. However, it is “premature” to discuss deaths from influenza after the COVID-19 pandemic since this depends on whether safe management measures will continue, he added. It also depends on whether the deaths that would “normally be attributable” to influenza would be split between COVID-19 and influenza, said Prof Teo. In this scenario, Singapore could see slightly lower numbers of deaths from influenza, but a generally higher number of deaths when considering both diseases, he added. It is also “possible” for Singapore to see a more severe influenza season as the COVID-19 pandemic fades, said Dr Maiwald. “This is possible but strictly speaking, it is not known. We do not have data, but there is such a possibility,” he added. One “nightmare scenario” after the pandemic is over could be the emergence of a new strain of influenza in early-2023, since the world has not seen influenza for “such a long time”, said Prof Tambyah. For example, this may be a new subtype of influenza A, like H2N1, or a re-emergence of H2N2, which disappeared in 1968, he noted. “And we will be back to square one with the next pandemic. We will have to go through the whole process we went through with each pandemic from 1918, 1957, 1968, H1N1 2009 and now the COVID-19 pandemic all over again from epidemic to pandemic to endemic,” said Prof Tambyah. A novel strain or re-emergent strain of influenza will result in more deaths among young people than older folks, like in the 1918 pandemic, he added. This is also similar to what happened with the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, said Prof Tambyah. "The older people who had lived through the 1918 influenza A H1N1 pandemic paradoxically did not have as severe disease as some of the younger people, especially pregnant women. "This applies more to re-emergent strains than a totally new strain, although the experience of countries who have had quite severe disease in children with H5N1 is not reassuring about novel strains of influenza." The resulting outbreak could even be worse than the current pandemic, Prof Tambyah warned, noting that influenza has "some similarities" with COVID-19. "It spreads rapidly, can be infectious before the onset of symptoms and vaccines are not that effective in prevention," he added. People are currently protected from severe seasonal influenza "to a certain extent" because of previous vaccination or exposure to circulating H1N1 and H3N2 strains, he noted. "If there is a new strain or a re-emergence of the 1957 H2N2, there is high risk that there will be a rapidly spreading pandemic that could have a much higher mortality rate than the 2 per cent reported globally for COVID-19," said Prof Tambyah. While there are no overseas studies yet that show that a year with fewer influenza infections would then cause a “rebound”, the concern still remains that the risk is higher if individuals are exposed to the influenza virus and spreads it in the community, said Dr Esther Tan, a respiratory physician with SGH. The experts who conducted the study urged individuals to not only get vaccinated for COVID-19, but also influenza. “For individuals 65 years and older we definitely recommend that you do get vaccinated. However, for the individuals that are younger than 65 years old, it is recommended for those that have specific medical conditions or indications,” Dr Tan noted. This could include those with chronic disorders of the lung or heart, or recurrent hospitalisations due to chronic diseases like diabetes and kidney or kidney problems, she added.

(Provided by the Akita prefectural government) Japan has detected its first outbreak of bird flu for the 2021 winter season, with confirmation of a case of “highly pathogenic avian influenza” at a poultry farm in the northeast of the country, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday. About 143,000 egg-laying chickens are being exterminated at the farm in Yokote city in Akita Prefecture, the ministry said in a statement on its website, adding that restricted zones up to 10 kilometers from the site have been established. “Under the current situation in Japan, we do not believe that there is any possibility of avian influenza being transmitted to humans through the consumption of chicken meat or eggs,” the ministry said. But an increase in the number of people in China getting infected from bird flu this year is turning into a source of concern among epidemiological experts, especially as the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization, compared with only five last year, it said, with six dead and many of the others critically ill. Outbreaks of bird flu have also been reported in recent days and weeks in Europe with farms in Poland the latest locations for infections, totaling 650,000 poultry. Last winter, Japan had its worst season of winter flu on farms yet, with more than 3 million chickens culled and a quarter of the country's prefectures affected. Japan has an egg-laying flock of around 185 million hens and a broiler population of 138 million, according to the ministry of agriculture.

Influenza viruses lacking NS1 (ΔNS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of ΔNS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a ΔNS1 virus results in an antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that ΔNS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on ΔNS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.

The latter process takes place upon the detection of the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) by the host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Secretion of interferons takes place in both paracrine and autocrine signalling mechanisms, mediated by the canonical JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway along with the transcriptional activation of a particular set of host genes as well as their corresponding promotors defined as IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs)1. Subsequent activation of the downstream interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) lead to the transcriptional induction of a plethora of antiviral proteins, including dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) leading to a halt of protein translation, dsRNA-activated oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) which facilitate the degradation of RNA by activating RNAse L and Mx proteins which essentially sequester incoming viral components such as nucleocapsids2,3. Many studies have demonstrated that viruses have evolved to encode numerous mechanisms to prevent the host IFN-mediated antiviral response at different stages4. Viral non-structural proteins such as those of Toscana virus, dengue and HPV can sequester host factors to inhibit type I IFN response5,6,7, while viruses such as vaccinia, adeno and Ebola viruses secrete soluble ligands7,8, or encode miRNAs9,10 and other proteins to confer immune-evasion.The influenza A virus (IAV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates several functions ranging from inhibition of host mRNA polyadenylation and subsequent inhibition of their nuclear export as well as inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing11,12. A growing body of evidence to date has indicated that influenza NS1 protein has IFN antagonistic activity. It was initially shown that a recombinant influenza A virus that lacks the NS1 protein(ΔNS1) grew to a titer similar to that of WT virus in IFN deficient systems, albeit being markedly attenuated in IFN competent hosts13. This attenuated phenotype can be explained by the inability of the virus to prevent NS1 mediated IFN inhibition. The NS1 protein has been shown to bind to TRIM25 whereby the ubiquitination of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I is inhibited, which eventually results in the inhibition of IFN induction14,15. NS1 has also been shown to prevent IFN production by sequestering the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30) in order to halt the processing of host pre-mRNAs, resulting in accumulation of pre-mRNAs in the nucleus as well as the halt of cellular mRNA export to the cytoplasm16. This subsequently results in the inhibition of host protein production, including IFNs and proteins encoded by IFN inducible genes17,18 NS1 has also been shown to inhibit the antiviral activity of several IFN-stimulated genes, such as the 2′–5′- oligo A synthase (OAS)19.Consistent with its function, deletion of NS1 in recombinant IAV results in a live attenuated and highly immunogenic IAV. As a result, IAV with impaired NS1 function are currently used as vaccines against swine influenza in pigs20 and they are under clinical consideration as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines21,22,23.Based on the growing body of evidence showing the IFN antagonistic properties of IAV NS1, we investigated the ability of the ΔNS1 viruses to induce an IFN response in vivo along with the biological antiviral consequences mediated by the type I IFN induction. Our results demonstrate that the ΔNS1 virus is an efficient inducer of IFN with antiviral properties in both mice and embryonated eggs. Our data indicates the suitability of ΔNS1 virus as a prophylactic agent to induce immediate mucosal antiviral responses with the aim of preventing acute respiratory infections caused by IFN sensitive viruses. ΔNS1 influenza viruses can provide first innate antiviral protection, followed by adaptive specific IAV protection.ResultsRecombinant influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene (ΔNS1) induces higher levels of interferon than wild type viruses in embryonated chicken eggsPreviously, we demonstrated that tissue culture-based infections by ΔNS1 viruses induced the transactivation of an ISRE-containing reporter gene13, indicating that infection by ΔNS1 viruses induces higher levels of IFN in comparison to its wild type counterparts. To test whether ΔNS1induces IFN in 10-day old embryonated-chicken eggs, eggs were treated with 103 PFU of ΔNS1 or PR8-WT influenza viruses. Subsequently, the allantoic fluids were harvested 18 h post treatment to measure the levels of IFN by determining the highest dilution that inhibited the cytopathic effect mediated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells24,25. As indicated in the Supplementary Table 1, four hundred Uml−1 of IFN were detected in the allantoic fluid of eggs infected by ΔNS1 virus. However, allantoic fluids derived from WT-PR8 or mock infections indicated undetectable levels of IFN (< 16 Uml−1).Pre-treatment with ΔNS1 influenza virus inhibits wild-type influenza virus replication in embryonated chicken eggsWe speculated that the ability of the ΔNS1 virus on inducing high titers of IFN in eggs facilitates an antiviral state that may prevent the replication of wild-type IAV. To evaluate this, increasing amounts of ΔNS1 virus were inoculated into eggs and 8 h post-treatment, the eggs were challenged with wild-type A/WSN/33 (WSN-WT) virus with a dose of 103 PFU. Two days post incubation extracted allantoic fluids were titrated via plaque assays. WSN viral titers decreased with ΔNS1 in a dose dependent manner. While the untreated allantoic fluids supported the growth of WSN virus to an approximate titer of 108 PFUml−1, administration of a dose as little as 2 × 104 PFUml−1 of ΔNS1 prevented the replication of WSN virus (less than 102 PFUml−1 of WSN were obtained in eggs). The titer of WSN virus was reduced by one log, by pre-treating allantoic fluids with as little as 2 PFU of ΔNS1 (Fig. 1A).Figure 1Pre-incubation with ΔNS1 virus inhibits viral replication in embryonated chicken eggs. (A) 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (n = 2 per group) were inoculated with varying amounts of (PFU) of ΔNS1 virus in the allantoic cavity. Eight hours post infection at 37 °C, eggs were re-infected with 104 PFU of WT A/WSN/33 influenza virus and incubated at 37 °C for 40 h. Allantoic fluids were then titrated by plaque assay MDBK cells. (B) 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (n = 2 per group) were inoculated with 2 × 104 PFU of ΔNS1 virus or PBS (Untreated). 8 h post inoculation at 37 °C, the eggs were re-infected with 103 PFU of A/WSN/33 (WSN/H1N1), A/PR/8 (PR8/H1N1), A/X-31 (X-31/H3N2), B/Lee/40 (B-Lee influenza B) or Sendai Virus (Sendai). B-Lee infected eggs were incubated at 35 °C for additional 40 h. All other eggs were incubated at 37 °C for additional 40 h. Virus present in the allantoic fluid was titrated by hemagglutination assays. Maximum hemagglutination titers (100%) for each individual virus were 2048 (PR8), 1024 (X-31), 256 (B-Lee), 512 (Sendai).Full size imageInterestingly, treatment using ΔNS1 virus further inhibited the replication of other viruses, as depicted in Fig. 1B. Relative HA titers were obtained from eggs treated with 2 × 104 PFUml−1 of ΔNS1 virus followed by subsequent infection with wild-type Influenza A H1N1 strains WSN and PR8, H3N2 strain X-31, influenza B virus or Sendai virus (SeV; a paramyxovirus). In all cases, pre-treatment with ΔNS1 resulted in a two-log reduction of wild-type viral HA titers.Severe disease and death caused by infection with the highly virulent PR8 virus (hvPR8) in A2G mice can be alleviated by ΔNS1 pre-treatmentIn order to assess whether or not the administration of ΔNS1 virus inhibits replication of influenza viruses in mice, an inbred mouse strain that is homozygous for the gene which codes for the IFN induced full-length Mx1 protein, defined as C57BL/6-A2G (abbreviated as A2G) mice were used for this part of the study26,27. Previous studies have concluded that IFN administration was ineffective in preventing IAV replication in laboratory mice lacking a functional Mx1 gene28. In contrast, A2G mice which were administered IFN remained alive upon infection with the highly virulent hvPR8 IAV strain29. The presence of a functional Mx1 gene in A2G mice better mirrors the human situation, as Mx1 gene deficiencies in humans are rare. Here, A2G mice were intranasally infected with a dose of 5 × 105 PFUml−1 of ΔNS1 virus or PBS at − 24, − 8, + 3, + 24 and + 48 h. Mice were challenged at time 0 intranasally with 5 × 106 PFU of hvPR8 virus. Mice treated with ΔNS1 virus were protected from hvPR8 virus as measured by weight loss and death while the PBS treated mice succumbed to death (Fig. 2A).Figure 2A single dose of ΔNS1 virus protects A2G mice against lethal infection by highly virulent hvPR8 influenza virus when given prior to virus challenge. (A) Treatment with ΔNS1 virus protects A2G mice against lethal infection by highly virulent hvPR8 influenza virus. Eight 6-week old A2G mice were intranasally infected with 5 × 106 PFU of highly virulent A/PR/8/34 (hvPR8) influenza virus. Half of the mice received a total of five intranasal treatments with 5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus at the following times with respect to the hvPR8 infection: − 24 h, − 8 h, + 3 h, + 24 h ad 48 h. The remaining four mice were treated with PBS and the bodyweight changes and survival was monitored. (B) A single dose of ΔNS1 virus protects A2G mice against lethal infection by highly virulent hvPR8 influenza virus when given prior to hvPR8 virus challenge. Groups of three A2G mice each were mock-treated or treated intranasally with 5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 at time points − 24 h, − 8 h, + 3 h, + 24 h, + 48 h relative to the intranasal infection by 5 × 106 hvPR8 influenza virus. (C) A single dose of ΔNS1 virus protects A2G mice against lethal infection by highly virulent hvPR8 influenza virus when given 2 and 4 days prior to hvPR8 virus administration Groups of three A2G mice were intranasally treated with 5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus 4 days or 2 days before infection by 5 × 106 hvPR8 influenza virus. Bodyweight changes and survival was monitored. All data points are from individual mice. (D) Determination of the minimal effective therapeutic dose of ΔNS1 to prevent lethal hvPR8 virus infection in A2G mice. Groups of three A2G mice were intranasally infected with 105, 104 or 103 PFU ΔNS1 influenza virus. Additionally, groups of two A2G mice were intranasally challenged with 102 of ΔNS1 virus or PBS. 24 h post inoculation, mice were challenged with by 5 × 106 hvPR8 influenza virus. The percentage of mice surviving the challenge is represented.Full size imageSubsequently, we examined whether all five ΔNS1 treatments were essential for the protective effect against hvPR8 infection in mice. Hence, a single dose of 5 × 106 PFU of ΔNS1 virus was given at various time points relative to the infection with hvPR8. Data indicated (Fig. 2B) that pre-treatment (hours 24 or 8 before hvPR8 challenge) but not post treatment (even 3 h post hvPR8 challenge) of ΔNS1 resulted in the prevention of weight loss disease and subsequent death. Additionally, ΔNS1 virus administered two or four days prior to hvPR8 challenge completely protected mice from disease (Fig. 2C).Next, to obtain the effective dose 50 (ED50) of ΔNS1 virus to mediate protection against disease from hvPR8 infection, 2 × 105, 2 × 104, 2 × 103or 2 × 102 doses of ΔNS1 virus were intranasally administered to A2G mice 24 h prior to hvPR8 challenge. As shown in Fig. 2D, the ED50 of the ΔNS1 virus which conferred protection in A2G mice against hvPR8-induced death was approximately 103 PFU.Induction of Mx1 specific mRNA in mice treated with ΔNS1 virusTo investigate whether ΔNS1 infection in mice resulted in induction of the Mx1 gene, an RT-PCR assay for Mx1 specific mRNA in infected animal lungs was developed. In parallel, infections were performed in BALB/c mice which have a non-functional Mx1 gene due to a large frameshift deletion28. As seen in Fig. 3A, treatment with ΔNS1 resulted in the early induction (24 h post infection) of Mx1 specific mRNA in both A2G and BALB/c mice. In contrast a very faint band was present in A2G mice infected with hvPR8 virus at the same time post infection and no specific mRNA was detected in mock infected mRNA.Figure 3Dose dependent pre-treatment of ΔNS1 protects A2G-Mx1 mice but not wild-type C57BL/6 from a lethal hvPR8 virus challenge. (A) Induction of Mx1 specific mRNA expression in ΔNS1 virus infected mice. Groups of two A2G or BALB/c mice were intranasally treated with PBS or 2.5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 hvPR8 influenza viruses. 24 h post challenge, total RNA present in lung tissues were extracted and were used for RT-PCR reactions using Mx1 specific primers. PCR products were run in an agarose gel; the arrows indicate the predicted size of amplified cDNA from Mx1 genes pf A2G mice (Mx1) and BALB/c mice (Mx1*). (B, C, D, E) Sex matched 6 weeks old groups C57BL/6-A2G-Mx1 mice or C57BL/6-wild-type mice were either intranasally pre-treated with PR8-ΔNS1 (5 × 106 PFU; n = 5 per group), sterile PBS (n = 5) 12 h before a lethal challenge of hvPR8 (5 × 105 PFU; n = 5) or treated with only sterile PBS (n = 2).

Survival of C57Bl/6–6-wild-type mice.Full size imageΔNS1 mediated protection from hvPR8 is Mx1-mediatedAs the Mx1 protein is one of the most potent IFN inducible gene products with anti-influenza virus activity in mice, it is quite possible that the ΔNS1-mediated protection seen in A2G mice is Mx1-mediated. To test this hypothesis, we compared the antiviral activity of ΔNS1 in A2G mice and in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice harbour a non-functional Mx1 gene due to a known deletion28 and were used as a back-cross genetic platform for the original A2G strain to generate the Mx1 positive A2G mice used in our experiments. A dose of PR8-ΔNS1 containing 5 × 106 PFU given 12H before a lethal hvPR8 challenge protected all A2G-Mx1 mice (n = 5) in both morbidity and mortality in comparison to the PBS pre-treated group (n = 5) (Figs. 3B,C). However, all five Mx1-deficient mice in the wild-type C57BL/6 group that were given the same dose of PR8-ΔNS1 succumbed to death by a lethal hvPR8 challenge. The morbidity data for these mice based on body weight was also consistent with lack of protection after ΔNS1 treatment from hvPR8 challenge, indicating that the antiviral effect on IAV induced in mice by ΔNS1 treatment is dependent on the IFN-inducible gene Mx1 w (Fig. 3D,E).ΔNS1 viral treatment inhibits the replication of hvPR8 virus in A2G mice lungsTo better understand the ability of the ΔNS1 virus to inhibit replication of the hvPR8 virus in the lungs, A2G mice were intranasally treated with 2 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus alone, 2 × 104 PFU of hvPR8 alone or treatment of 2 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus 24 h before infecting them with 2 × 104 PFU of hvPR8 virus. Mice were sacrificed at three- and 6-days post infection and the lung homogenates were titrated in MDCK or Vero cells (Supplementary Table 2). A reduction of hvPR8 titers in lungs by fourfold was observed when mice were pre-treated with ΔNS1 virus. Furthermore, mice solely infected with ΔNS1 virus had titers below the detection limit (< 10 PFUml−1), while not showing any significant reduction of bodyweight. It was apparent that infection by hvPR8 virus without ΔNS1 administration resulted in the increase of lung weight by a factor of two or three in comparison to mice that were pre-treated with ΔNS1 virus. In the context of this study, increased lung weights are suggestive of lymphocytic infiltration and pulmonary disease during Influenza virus infection30,31.Attenuated influenza viruses via a mutation in the Neuraminidase (NA) gene does not confer ΔNS1-like antiviral propertiesAntiviral properties observed thus far in this study is from an attenuated influenza virus lacking the NS1 gene (ΔNS1). To confirm that the protective effects observed here are not due to the attenuation caused by the lack of a gene but specifically due to the lack of NS1, the antiviral property of ΔNS1 virus was compared to that of a the recombinant D2 influenza virus. The D2 virus contains a base-pair mutation in the dsRNA region formed by the non-coding sequences of its NA gene. This mutation is responsible for a tenfold reduction in the NA protein levels as well as a one-log reduction in viral titers within a multicycle growth curve32. The latter D2 strain has also been shown to be highly attenuated in mice with a LD50 of more than 106 PFU upon intranasal administration33. Identical doses (2.5 × 105 PFU) of D2 or ΔNS1 viruses were intranasally administered to A2G mice 4 h prior to challenge with 5 × 106 PFU of hvPR8. Although a prolonged survival was seen in one of the animals who received D2, pre-treatment with D2 was ineffective in protecting A2G mice from hvPR98 virus-induced disease and death (Fig. 4).Figure 4Comparison of the antiviral properties in A2G mice of recombinant influenza A viruses ΔNS1 and D2. A2G mice were intranasally treated with PBS or 2.5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 or D2 viruses for 24 h before infection with 5 × 106 PFU of hvPR8 influenza virus. Bodyweight changes and survival were monitored. Data shown are from individual mice.Full size imageΔNS1 viral treatment prevents death by Sendai virus (SeV) in C57BL/6 miceGiven the fact, that the antiviral effects against hvPR8 mediated by ΔNS1 viral are facilitated by an IFN mediated mechanism (Mx1 gene induction), we speculated that ΔNS1 treatment should protect mice from infections by other IFN sensitive viruses. Sendai virus was used in this study due to its pneumotropic nature and sensitivity to IFN in Mx1 deficient mice34,35. As seen in Fig. 1B, treatment with ΔNS1 inhibited Sendai viral replication in embryonated chicken eggs. Moreover, upon two intranasal administrations of 2.5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus to C57BL/6 mice at times − 24 and + 24 h or − 8 and + 72 h, mice infected with 5 × 105 PFU of Sendai virus were protected from death (Fig. 5A). The C57BL/6 mice used here are Mx1−/− and it is indicative that the mouse nuclear Mx1 protein does not have any antiviral activities against cytoplasmic viruses such as Sendai virus36. The efficacy of ΔNS1 treatment was compared against three doses of IFN-β using the Sendai virus challenge model. Treatment with the highest dose of IFN-β (2 × 105 U) protected mice from death induced by Sendai virus comparable to treatment with 2.5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Treatment with ΔNS1 influenza virus protects C57BL/6 mice against lethal infection with Sendai virus. All mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of Sendai virus corresponding to (A) 5 × 105 PFU or (B) 1.5 × 105 PFU. The percentage of mice surviving the challenge is represented. (A) Groups of five mice were treated intranasally with 2.5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus at the indicated times. (B) Groups of five mice were intranasally treated at − 24 h and + 24 h with respect to the infection with Sendai virus with 2.5 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 or with the indicated amounts of IFN-β.Full size imageΔNS1 virus treatment inhibits viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in K18-hACE2-C57Bl/6 murine lungsGiven the emergence of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether prophylactic treatment with ΔNS1 would hinder the replication of SARS-CoV-2. We used the transgenic mouse model that supports the replication of SARS-CoV2. As controls, we used universal IFN, and SeV defective RNA (SDI) which were previously shown to have an IFN inducing effect. Weight determination in all the treated groups showed no major loss in bodyweight, only one mouse each from the SDI treated group (day 8) and the uIFN treated group (day 12) reached below 75% bodyweight (Fig. 6A). Deaths (4 out of 5) in the mock treated group occurred between days 6–8 post infection. The SDI-RNA treated group lost 2 out of 5 animals on day 8 and 9 while the uIFN group lost one animal out of 5 at a later time point (D12; Fig. 6B). While both treatments resulted in reduction of viral titers day 3 and 5 post infection, mice that received ΔNS1 showed significant inhibition of SARS-CoV2 titers in lung homogenates and no detectable infectious viruses at day 5 post infection (Fig. 6C).Figure 6Treatment with ΔNS1 influenza virus inhibits viral replication in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Mice were intranasally treated with 30 ul containing PBS, 2.5 × 106 PFU of ΔNS1, 1 μg defective interfering RNA from Sendai virus (SDI-RNA), 2.5 × 105 U of universal-interferon (uIFN) 24 h before intranasal challenge with 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2/USA/WA1 isolate. (A) Weight-loss was monitored in mice (n = 11 for treated groups and n = 6 naïve) and (B) survival was monitored for 12 days. (C) Lungs were harvested at days three and five post infection (n = 3 per group per day) were homogenized and were titered in Vero-E6 cells using standard plaque assays.Full size imageDiscussionThe NS1 protein of the influenza A virus has been shown to possess IFN antagonist activity whereby it is able to dampen the host innate immune response to provide a favourable environment for the virus to replicate. It has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in the host cytoplasm and nucleus upon viral infection, interacting with a plethora of host factors to inhibit the interferon response37. Data show the ability of NS1 to compete with innate immune sensors such as RLR to bind to dsRNA to avoid innate immune detection38. Additionally, NS1 has been shown to interact with other innate immune signalling components such as PKR39, TRIM2540 and CPSF16, resulting in lowering of the IFN mediated innate immunity41. For these reasons, influenza viruses with impaired NS1 function (and an increased innate immune response) have been under consideration for live attenuated influenza vaccines. There is an existing swine influenza vaccine based on NS1-deficient live attenuated viruses42, and clinical trials in humans using an intranasally administered live attenuated ΔNS1 virus have demonstrated potent immunogenicity and good safety profiles. Experimental evidence in mice indicates that the high IFN-inducing properties of ΔNS1 viruses are responsible for their superior immunogenicity as live vaccines43,44.As ΔNS1 viruses are great IFN inducers, we reasoned that they might provide with innate protection against respiratory virus infection even before the development of an influenza virus specific adaptive immune response. Treatment with ΔNS1 virus inhibited the replication of both homologous and heterologous viruses in eggs (Fig. 1). Using the A2G-Mx1 mouse model, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of the ΔNS1 virus induced an antiviral state, which prevented disease and death by a highly pathogenic influenza A virus (hvPR8) which is otherwise lethal45. Infection with ΔNS1 virus but not WT viruses yielded detectable levels of Mx1-specific mRNA levels in lungs 24 h post infection (Fig. 2). A large body of evidence has indicated that the protective impact of IFN against IAV infection in mice is mainly mediated by the IFN inducible antiviral Mx1 gene46,47,48. Consistently, we found that Mx1 was required for the ΔNS1 mediated protection against lethal hvPR8 challenge by comparing Mx1 competent A2G-C57BL/6 mice with Mx1 deficient WT-C57BL/6 mice.Data depicted in Fig. 2C show that pre-treatment of A2G mice with ΔNS1 virus up to 4 days before the challenge with hvPR8 virus was effective in preventing disease. The Mx1 protein in mice is known to be stable for several days upon its induction and our observations are consistent with the half-life of the Mx1 protein described in mice49,50.Given the inherently attenuated state of the ΔNS1 viruses, it was necessary to confirm that the antiviral state seen here is due to the specific attenuation of the ΔNS1 segment. We used a virus that is known to be attenuated due to its defective neuraminidase segment (D2 virus expressing a full-length NS1)33 to demonstrate that protection is not just mediated by any attenuated IAV (Fig. 4). ΔNS1 treated mice were also protected from lethal infection with an influenza-unrelated pneumotropic Sendai virus, suggesting that the IFN-mediated innate immune response induced by ΔNS1 has broad-antiviral effects, rather than being a pathogen-specific immune response. As anticipated for Sendai virus, the abovementioned protection was not Mx1 mediated and is most likely due to the activation of other ISGs such as OAS or PKR upon the ΔNS1-mediated IFN production51.The feasibility of ΔNS1 virus as a prophylactic treatment to induce a type I interferon response to prevent acute respiratory infections from IFN sensitive viruses was demonstrated in the current study. Type I interferon administration has been used to treat a range of human diseases ranging from infections such as hepatitis B and C52,53 to other non-communicable diseases such as melanomas54 and hairy-cell leukaemia55. Although IFN has been promoted as a therapeutic agent, administration of exogenous interferon comes with a set of undesirable side effects56,57, arguably due to it causing major endocrine and metabolic changes in the host58. Therefore, various groups have attempted alternative ways to induce local type I IFN responses using different strategies. Some of these strategies were topical administration of plasmid DNA coding for IFNα1 in the mouse eye to protect against HSV-1 encephalitis59, liposomic intranasal treatment using dsRNA to induce IFN60 as well as recombinant viral vectors such as adenoviruses61 and hepatitis B viruses to express type I IFN to protect against infection and tumor regression61. Despite these experimental attempts to study the efficacy of IFN, it is still unclear whether virally induced IFN is more or less toxic efficient that IFN itself. This indicates that further work is needed to be done to ascertain the suitability of recombinant viruses as IFN inducers for therapeutic purposes. The physiological half-lives and binding affinities of different types of interferons are well studied and their half-lives can range from minutes to several hours, depending on the type of IFN62. Our data showed antiviral properties of ΔNS1 virus for up to 4 days before the viral challenge. While it is known that therapeutic properties and doses of different types of IFNs are highly variable due to their differential effects contributed by the ISGs, most therapeutic properties of type I interferons are yet to be completely understood63,64. In this instance, comparable prophylactic responses were obtained by the administration of either 2 × 105 U of IFN-β or 2 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus (Fig. 5B). However, it is acknowledged that different subsets of IFN-regulated genes may differ in their relative transcriptional induction between treatments.We also demonstrated that prophylactic treatment using ΔNS1 significantly inhibited viral replication in a relevant mouse model that can be infected with WT SARS-CoV-2 and is known to result in lethal infection65 (Fig. 6). This agrees with reports that state that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN66. Interestingly, a similar level of reduction in viral titers was not seen upon intranasal inoculation of universal-IFN nor defective interfering RNA derived from SeV (SDE-RNA; a RIG-I agonist with known adjuvanting properties)67. While these treatments resulted in a better outcome in comparison to PBS pre-treatment, high amounts of viral titers were still observed day three and five post infection. Although weight loss and survival were best in the ΔNS1 group, the uIFN treated group showed a protective phenotype indicating that uIFN treatment was better than that provided by SDI-RNA. The difference observed here is likely due to the stimulation of multiple innate immune mechanisms by ΔNS1 which potentially primes cells to confer a broad antiviral phenotype. However, analysis of differentially expressed genes (particularly ISGs) via a technique such as bulk RNAseq would provide more insights in explaining the observed protective effects against COVID-19 in the K18 mouse model.In conclusion, we report that prophylactic treatment with an attenuated influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene induces an innate antiviral response which provides protection against IFN-sensitive viruses in both embryonated chicken eggs and mice. These in vivo data further validate previous observations showing the IFN-antagonistic properties of the NS1 protein of influenza A viruses13,68,69,70, while highlighting the role of NS1 in inhibiting IFN induction during influenza A virus infections. We also provide evidence for its potential as a prophylactic to protect against acute respiratory infections caused by IFN-sensitive viruses including the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic. ΔNS1 viruses are being clinically developed as live attenuated influenza virus vaccines and in clinical trials they have shown to induce protective antibodies and no adverse responses in human volunteers21,22,23. Here we show that ΔNS1 viruses have the potential to induce immediate protection against viral infection prior to the induction of specific long-lasting protective adaptive immune responses71,72. Our results should encourage further research on the use of IFN-inducing, live attenuated virus vaccines, to confer innate and adaptive protection against virus pathogens. Further studies looking at the longitudinal changes in ISGs in the respiratory tract upon treatment to correlate with the level of protection from a lethal virus challenge via RNAseq would provide potential mechanistic insights to support the observations in this study and the potential application of this treatment system to prevent the transmission of interferon sensitive viruses.MethodsCells and virusesRecombinant influenza A viruses were generated using reverse genetics as previously described13,32 A derivative of the A/PR/8/34 (PR8) defined as highly virulent PR8 (hvPR8) was kindly provided by O. Haller and J.L. Schulman. This variant of PR8 strain has been adapted to replicate efficiently in Mx1+ murine lungs owing to several mutations in all viral proteins including the HA and NA glycoproteins73. Strain 52 of Sendai virus was obtained from the ATCC. Vero cells, Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells or embryonated chicken eggs were used to propagate the following viruses as per standard protocols; Influenza A ΔNS1, hvPR8, PR8, A/WSN/33, A/X-31/H3N2, Influenza B/Lee/40, Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or Vero cells were plated to obtain confluent monolayers and plaque assays were performed as previously described and an agar overlay in DMEM-F12 including 1 µgml−1 of trypsin was used. MDCK, Vero and BHK cells were cultured in DMEM (Corning 10013CV) in the presence of 10% FBS (PEAK; PS-FB03) and penicillin–streptomycin (Corning 30-0002-CL). The chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) purchased from ATCC was maintained in MEM as suggested by ATCC. Vero-E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™, clone E6) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, HEPES and penicillin–streptomycin. SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI resources; NR-52281) was handled under BSL-3 containment in accordance with the biosafety protocols validated by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Viral stocks were amplified in Vero-E6 cells in the above media containing 2% FBS for 3 days and were validated by whole-genome sequencing using the Oxford-MinION platform.Animal studiesAll animals used in the study were used at 6–10 weeks of age. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) reviewed and approved the in vivo protocols included in this study. The animal work of this study is in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines. A2G mice were kindly provided by Dr. Heinz Arnheiter while the BALB/c and C56BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. Hemizygous female K18-hACE2 mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background (Jax strain 034860), were used to conduct studies with SARS-CoV-2 in BSL3 conditions. Anesthetized animals (Ketamine and Xylazine diluted in PBS administered via intraperitoneal injection) were intranasally infected using 30–50 µl of appropriately diluted viruses or PBS containing the indicated amounts of recombinant murine IFN-β (Calbiochem), universal-IFN (PBL assay science) SDI-RNA67. Afterwards, the animals were monitored daily for changes in body weight. All animal studies were done in accordance with the NIH guidelines as well as the guidelines devised by the Icahn School of Medicine with regards to the care and use of laboratory animals.Measurement of interferonTen day old embryonated eggs were infected with 103 PFU in 100 µl containing either ΔNS1, PR8 viruses or PBS as mock. Next, the eggs were incubated at 37 °C and the allantoic fluids were extracted 18 h post infection. Viral inactivation of the allantoic fluids were conducted by dialysis against 0.1 M KCL–HCL buffer at pH 2 for 2 days at 4 °C. Later, the pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 7 by subsequent dialysis against Hank’s balanced sodium salt solution with 20 mM NA3PO4 for two more days as described previously24. The amount of IFN was titrated according to its ability to inhibit the growth of VSV74. In summary, CEF cells in 96-wells were treated with 100 µl of different dilutions of the respective samples in tissue culture media. Upon incubating for an hour at 37 °C, 200 TCID50 of VSV in 10 µl were added to the wells before incubating at 37 °C until complete lysis of untreated control cells was observed (approximately 2 days). As a standard control, recombinant chicken IFN donated by Drs. Peter Staeheli and Bernd Kaspers was used25.Lung titrationFour A2G mice were intranasally challenged with 2 × 105 PFU of ΔNS1 at day-1. During day 0 mice were intranasally challenged with 2 × 104 PFU of hvPR8 virus. Alternatively, two other groups of four A2G mice were challenged with 2 × 105 PFU ΔNS1 or 2 × 104 PFU of hvPR8. Three days post infection, two animals from each group were humanely sacrificed while the rest of the animals were humanely sacrificed 6 days post infection. Lungs were weighed and homogenized in 2 ml of PBS. Resulting homogenates were clarified via centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and the acquired supernatants were tittered by plaque assays using MDCK or Vero cells. Lung homogenates derived from SARS-CoV-2 infected K18 mice were handled and titered in Vero-E6 cells as described previously75.Detection of MX1 Specific mRNA in infected cellsA2G and BALB/c mice were intranasally challenged with 105 PFU of either ΔNS1 or hvPR8 or PBS. Afterwards, lungs were extracted 24 h post infection, snap frozen, homogenized, total RNA was extracted using TRIreagent (Sigma-Alderich). One microgram of total lung RNA was used to perform a RT reaction in a total volume of 20 µl using Mx1 specific primer. Two µl of the resulting RT product was used for PCR amplification using Mx1 specific primers under the following conditions (20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C for a total of 25 cycles). The sense and antisense primer sequences are as follows; 5′-CAGGACATCCAAGAGCAGCTGAGCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-GCAGTAGACAATCTGTTCCATCTGGAAGTG-3′. The PCR products were analysed using a 1.2% agarose gel. Correct size for the PCR products in A2G mice was 756 bp while it was 333 bp in BALB/c mice due to a deletion in the Mx1 gene between nucleotides 1120–154333. ReferencesTaft, J. & Bogunovic, D.

The TPPA is a game changer Subscribe Home Kōrero Comment & Analysis Reflections Identity Reo Media Arts History Video About Select Page Kōrero Comment & Analysis Reflections Identity Reo History The 1918 pandemic: ‘People were just dying everywhere’ Posted by Michael King | Nov 7, 2021 | 0 | 7 min read Te Puea and Tumokai at Ahipara, from the book Te Puea, by Michael King. The influenza pandemic of 1918 (also commonly but unfairly known as the “Spanish flu”) still looms large in the consciousness of many Māori communities — and with good reason. In those communities, the devastation it left in its wake hasn’t been forgotten even a century later. The first wave of the pandemic appeared in early 1918, and seemed to be waning by around June. But the second wave — between October and December — was far more deadly. It ripped through New Zealand in less than two months. No other event has killed as many New Zealanders in such a short space of time. A deadly combination of vulnerability, medical inaction, and racism decimated Māori communities in particular. In Waikato, the pandemic had a huge influence on Te Puea Hērangi in her fight to establish Tūrangawaewae marae at Ngāruawahia. This extract from Michael King’s biography of Te Puea, first published in 1977, describes the intense three-week period when the virus overwhelmed her community at Mangatāwhiri. It includes a first-hand account from Tumokai Katipa, Te Puea’s future husband, who buried the dead as she tended the sick. Feelings of elation in Waikato at the conclusion of the war were shortlived. As had happened so often in the past, the white man’s peace proved more devastating. An epidemic of influenza that affected 720 million people worldwide and took over 20 million lives reached New Zealand in July 1918. The first wave, although widespread, produced few fatalities. The second, from late October to December, was virulent and killed over 6,700 people (more than a third of the New Zealand casualities in the war). A Royal Commission investigating the outbreak concluded there was a “strong presumption” that the later strain had been introduced by the arrival at Auckland on 12 October of the S.S. Niagara, the same ship that had taken Te Rata to London. On board were Prime Minister William Massey and Finance Minister Joseph Ward. As a result of their presence, the ship was not subjected to quarantine regulations then in force for infected vessels. The stronger strain spread rapidly through the military camps and Armistice celebrations. The experience of earlier epidemics was confirmed when Polynesians displayed far less immunity to the disease than Europeans. In consequence, their population was reduced dramatically. In addition to physical vulnerability, Māori settlements also exhibited the very features that authorities warned were most likely to spread the infection: “overcrowding”, “thronging”, “poor ventilation”, “Inadequate water supplies and sanitary facilities”, “alcoholic excess” and “fright”. The greater Polynesian disposition for respiratory ailments and heart disease intensified the vulnerability since most influenza deaths resulted from an aggravation of such conditions. Māori communities also had few of the supplies recommended for use preventatively and to alleviate distress after the onset of symptoms (“liquid soda chlorinate gargles, face masks, prophylactic vaccination and good nourishing food”). The consquence of all these factors was a devastating Māori death toll and death rate never accurately determined. [Peter] Buck, noting that the estimate of Māori deaths was well below that which actually occurred, called the epidemic “the severest setback the race has received since the fighting days of Hongi Hika. Influenza in three months caused more casualities to the Maoris than the campaigns in Gallipolli, France and Belgium.” For official purposes, the number of Māori deaths registered was estimated at 1,130 or a rate of 226 per 10,000 of population — over four-and-a-half times greater than that of Europeans.* This was bad enough. But the actual total must have been far higher since Māori deaths were still not notified. Many Māori communities never saw a medical officer during the outbreak and were not asked for an estimate of fatalities. Some of them were almost annihilated. A Pākehā visitor to the Ātiawa settlement at the headwaters of the Waitara River in Taranaki counted 140 people there before the epidemic and less than 50 afterwards. The full extent of official negligence in Māori health was concealed. Of 111 witnesses who gave evidence to the subsequent Royal Commission, for example, not one was Māori. There was another factor that intensified the social consequences of the epidemic even further. Previous outbreaks had taken their heaviest toll among the elderly, and, to a lesser extent, the very young. This one, on the figures recorded, was most virulent among young adults and people in their prime. The greatest number of deaths occurred in the 20 to 40 age group, with the 30 to 35-year-old being hit hardest. This meant, in the aftermath, whole communities found themselves without mothers and fathers, primary wage earners and active leaders. A vacuum was created that placed a greater burden on adolescence and middle-age. Mangatāwhiri appears to have been as badly hit as any Māori settlement. The outbreak reached its peak there in the third week of November 1918, a week after the Waikato conscripts had returned from Narrow Neck. Tumokai Katipa estimated that in a community of about 200 people, only three adults in the vulnerable age group remained unaffected, of whom he was one. The infection lasted for about three weeks, and for this time community life came to a halt. Whole families were laid up at the same time; the worst cases lay dying while others struggled from their beds to find water and perform daily necessities. The symptoms were an unpleasantly intensified form of those produced by conventional influenza: high fever, increased pulse, mottling of the skin, headache, pains in the chest and limbs, shortness of breath, often bubbling sounds in the chest caused by a bloody froth, vomiting, diarrhoea, and what was described in official reports as “dirty tongue and foul breath”. This last was remembered unofficially as “a burning of the mouth that left the throat and tongue dry except for a black discharge.” Tumokai Katipa could remember no doctors visiting the settlement with assistance, no one recording the names of the dead, and a great deal of contradictory advice. “The one doctor who was at Mercer couldn’t do much and didn’t even try. Nobody knew what they should be doing. One person told us not to drink water and we believed it for a while. Then one of the ones who was ill went mad and jumped into the river and drank water frantically. He got better. Others, my sister among them, were crying out for water, their mouths all burnt. We just didn’t know what we should have done.” Te Puea, although ill herself, again set about caring for the sick as best she could. There were no open-air shelters at this time, the rate of infection was too high. Most people stayed in their homes. She rose from her sick bed each day and prepared boiled water and food for distribution to those families whose members were all sick. She tried to organise clean water for washing, but this was difficult — almost everybody had become sluggish and unresponsive. “We just lived from day to day in a kind of daze,” said Tumokai. “It didn’t seem real. It got so that people hardly knew what was happening and didn’t care. We just took things as they came, that was all.” Taking things as they came meant coping with death continuously for a fortnight. Of the 200-odd people there, Tumokai estimated about 50 died. One of the unaffected men was busy every day building makeshift coffins. Tumokai’s major job was to ferry corpses upriver in Te Puea’s launch to Taupiri for burial. “I used to leave at about six o’clock in the morning when it was just getting light. We’d load the bodies of people who had died in the night on to the boat, which was about 20 feet long and had an old standard engine. There was no time for relatives to mourn. Most of them couldn’t anyway. Then off we’d go, two of us, chugging up the river through the fog. I tell you, it was eerie. We often thought we saw things and heard things to do with the spirits of those people. “We’d get to Taupiri, unload the bodies, bury them in wide graves and then return to Mangatāwhiri by about four in the afternoon. Sometimes we had to turn around and go straight back with some more. Each time we got there, hello — someone else dead. This went on for two weeks. I lost a lot of my family: one of my sisters and my two brothers-in-law. People were just dying everywhere. In some ways, you know, it was harder to be the ones who went on living.” In the aftermath, Mangatāwhiri was numbed. As people recovered, long tangis were held for the mass dead, without the bodies. Then, in December, Te Puea visited all the settlements between Mangatāwhiri and the Waikato Heads and gathered up children orphaned in the epidemic — just over 100 of them — and elderly people who no longer had relatives to look after them. It was a spectacular extension of the project she had begun six years before of making Mangatāwhiri a home for the homeless, and fulfilment of her mother’s wishes. She could not take all the children into her own home, although she did have two or three there at a time. She made the whole community at Te Paina responsible for them and placed them with the surviving adults. She would make a point of seeing each of them every day, supervising mass sittings in the settlement’s dining hall, and being entirely responsible for their education. It was the same group she was later to take with her to Ngāruawahia. Postscript: Te Puea made her first move early in August 1921. Michael King wrote that she gathered the whole community into the hall and told them that 170 of them were to shift that month and who they were. “I’m taking you away from these wet flats,” she said that night. “I have no idea how we shall survive — much of it depends on how we work and how the Pākehā at Ngāruawahia treat us. We may find it easier to die here than live there. But we have to go. And we are going to build a marae there that will be suitable for everybody throughout the country; a marae, that, one day, people will visit from all over the world. And we’re going to do it for Waikato and for our king.” Te Puea’s intention for the marae at Tūrangawaewae was a papakāinga for the homeless, including those orphaned by the flu epidemic. She also feared a repetition of the smallpox or influenza epidemics would again catch her people unprepared. She now knew about, and encouraged, vaccination, wrote Michael King. She was aware of the principles of preventative medicine. The meeting house Mahinarangi was conceived as a hospital — her dream was a small hospital, open not just to Waikato but to all Māori, where medical care would be provided in a reassuringly Māori environment, where Māori nurses would tend to patients, and where Māori rules of tapu would be observed. *The Māori death rate during the 1918 pandemic has since been estimated to be eight times that of non-Māori.

(Tony Talbot/AP)Social SharingFor the first time, all Alberta seniors are being offered a high-dose flu vaccine but distribution problems are making it tricky for pharmacists to get their hands on it.The Fluzone high-dose vaccine is described by Alberta Health as "the vaccine of choice" for people in that age bracket.The high-dose shot was previously offered only to Albertans 65 years and older living in long-term care facilities. Other seniors who wanted the shot had to pay $75. The shot is now free of charge.This year, pharmacists say the demand is there — but the stock isn't."We ordered 10 boxes, we got one," said pharmacist Zicki Eludin, who owns Crescent IDA Pharmacy in Lac La Biche, Alta. "We're probably getting 10 per cent of what we order." Eludin said his orders for the high-dose vaccine were initially filled, but the number of available doses has recently dwindled. He ordered 50 doses for last week but was only given a single box of five shots.Most of his clients opt for the standard flu shot but he would like to offer them the improved protection of a high-dose vaccine.The high-dose vaccine contains four times the antigen — the part of the vaccine that stimulates the body's immune response — than the standard dose.When Eludin ran an immunization clinic at a local seniors home earlier this month, he didn't have any high-dose shots to administer. "[Alberta Health] are still so focused on the COVID thing that, I don't know, maybe the logistics department didn't do their homework."Doses dispersed in small amounts Alberta Health said the province has ordered more than 400,000 high-dose vaccines this season. The doses are enough to immunize all Albertans 65 and older living in congregate care, and to immunize 68 per cent of the entire population of eligible seniors, Alberta Health said. "The doses are dispersed in small amounts across the province," Alberta Health said in a statement. "This is to ensure access for as many Albertans as possible." Alberta had zero lab-confirmed flu cases last year but experts have warned that the province is unlikely to avoid the flu season twice. Three cases have been confirmed in Alberta so far. Mohamed Elfishawi says he quadrupled his orders for the shot anticipating that demand for the doses would outstrip supply. (David Bajer/CBC)Randy Howden, owner of Crowfoot Medicine Shoppe in Calgary, is frustrated by the ongoing supply issues.He said the vaccine was distributed to the warehouses based on "market share" and then allocated to individual sites.Alberta Health is "micromanaging" the situation to the detriment of some smaller operators, he said. "We didn't get anywhere near what our pre-book was, and we're told now that there's no vaccine remaining for us to order," Howden said. The flu season immunization campaign is especially critical amid the pandemic but distribution issues have caused confusion with the high-dose campaign, he said. "Our seniors are the most avid to get their flu shot," he said. "And we didn't have the vaccines that we needed to support them and serve our clients." Same message, different virus: Starting Monday, influenza vaccinations available in AlbertaAlberta unlikely to avoid flu season twice, infectious disease expert saysAlberta Health says the full order of high-dose vaccines was received and distributed through usual channels to wholesale distributors, AHS and physicians."[Wholesalers] work with pharmacies, consider the pre-order requests and previous influenza season orders and, based on available inventory, distribute the vaccine to the pharmacies," Alberta Health said. 'They don't give us the chance'Mohamed Elfishawi, who owns the Terwillegar and Terra Losa pharmacies in Edmonton, said he was anticipating the shortage. He "quadrupled up" on his early orders and got "just enough."He initially ordered 250 shots from one wholesaler and 200 from another. He received 10 doses.He said the distribution issues hit during the critical early days of the campaign but smaller independent stores like his often struggle with supply shortages."This is a trend," he said. "Even with the COVID vaccine, most of the supply is coming through the big chains and the small pharmacies didn't get enough."We are capable of doing large amounts of immunizations and helping the system but they don't give us the chance." Why is there no flu amid so many COVID cases? Your COVID-19 questions answeredAlberta nears end of 'extraordinary' flu season with zero cases recordedSeniors should aim to get the high-dose shot whenever possible, Alberta Health said. "Delaying your influenza vaccination is not recommended. "Seniors can choose the standard dose if they wish, however, the high dose vaccine is the vaccine of choice for individuals 65 years of age and older."ABOUT THE AUTHORWallis SnowdonReporterWallis Snowdon is a journalist with CBC Edmonton focused on bringing stories to the website and the airwaves.

The medical establishment says the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for children as young as 5 years, but despite approval from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and recommendation from the Center for Disease Control & Prevention, many parents are unsure about the need for this vaccination. They’ve read about cases of heart inflammation and they remember that children were largely spared by the early strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Now, they’re trying to weigh the risks and benefits in an environment of vaccine mandates and misinformation. BioSpace did a deep dive into this subject in search of concrete answers. Here’s what we found. 1. What’s the risk to children today from COVID-19? When the pandemic began, there was little risk to children. That appears to still be the case, despite the emergence of the fast-spreading Delta variant, according to physicians at Boston Children’s Hospital and many other researchers. The fact is that no one knows for sure at this point how or to what extent Delta will affect children. Consider this: between January 4, 2020 and October 30, 2021, COVID-19 accounted for 576 deaths among children 17 and younger, compared to 189 from influenza, according to the CDC. For perspective, the total number of deaths in that group was 60,811. Severity of the disease is, as in adults, exacerbated by underlying medical conditions (including obesity, asthma, cancer and diabetes), researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Center say. Black or Latino children are considered particularly vulnerable, although that is based on the assumption of limited access to healthcare. Long-haul cases are developing. The most recent data from Sermo’s COVID-19 Real Time Barometer survey indicates that 26% of the 1,528 physicians responding to the survey from throughout the world have seen long-haul cases among children. The most common symptoms are fatigue, headaches, cold-like symptoms, respiratory issues and loss of the sense of taste or smell. The instances were less severe than in adults. In 36% of those cases, the symptoms lasted less than four weeks, and 57% were resolved within six weeks. 2. Which vaccines are available for children? Pfizer and BioNTech’s Comirnaty is the only COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. for use in children. Moderna delayed its application for emergency use authorization (EUA) for pediatric application in the U.S. to allow the FDA more time to review its vaccine, but on Tuesday (November 9) the company filed for authorization in Europe with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in children age 6 to 11. That same day, France denied Moderna’s application for use in those under 30, citing a greater risk of myocarditis. 3. How great is the risk of myocarditis? The risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) is rare but possible. According to an August report in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly, of the 8.9 million adolescents aged 12-17 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 9,246 of them reported adverse events. Of those, 9.3% were considered serious and 4.3% included myocarditis. That means that 0.004% of all 12- to 17- year-olds who were vaccinated for COVID-19 developed myocarditis. An earlier study, also reported in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, showed that of 52 million doses of all available COVID-19 vaccines administered to young people between the ages of 12 and 29, there were 1,226 cases of myocarditis. That’s nearly 0.0024%. The median age was 26, and median time of symptom onset was three days after vaccination. In the cases in which gender was known, patients were overwhelmingly male (923 male vs 289 female). A study reported in JAMA of 15 young people between 12 and 18 years of age who developed myocarditis indicated that the most common symptom was late gadolinium enhancement. All the patients recovered, and all but one had a normal echocardiogram 13 days after discharge from the hospital. If either myocarditis or pericarditis occurs, symptoms will be evident a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. Those symptoms are chest pain, shortness of breath, or a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. If they occur, the recommendation is to seek medical treatment immediately. The American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the benefit of the COVID-19 vaccine outweighed the risk from myocarditis. 4. How effective is the Pfizer vaccine in children? The FDA considers the Pfizer vaccine 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children ages 5 and above. 5. Should children who have had COVID-19 be vaccinated? The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vaccinating all children ages 5 and above (unless there are contraindications) even if they have had COVID-19. The rationale is that, as yet, the duration of immunity is unknown. 6. How many children have had this vaccine? In the U.S., the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one currently granted emergency use authorization in children ages 5-to-11. The Pfizer clinical trial that was completed in October included 3,100 children ages 5 through 11 years. In all, approximately 23,000 children ages 12 and older also received at least one dose of this vaccine before it was authorized. As of November 9, the CDC reports that more than 432,565 children age 12 and under have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 7. How have mRNA vaccines been used before? Messenger RNA was discovered in the early 1960s. Since then, it has been the subject of research to make it practical in medical applications. One of the problems was that it degraded before it could deliver its instructions. The development of lipid nanoparticles, which envelop the mRNA until it is delivered, solved that problem. The first mRNA vaccine was developed against Ebola but had minimal commercial implications. When COVID-19 emerged, the technology was ready to be deployed. Now its use is expanding to other indications, including as a therapy for cancer and psoriasis. 8. How does the pediatric vaccine vary from the adult vaccine? The mRNA and lipids are the same, but the dosage and inactive ingredients are different, according to Pfizer. For the youngest group, the dosage is 0.2 mL. (In contrast, the adult dosage is 0.3 mL.) The FDA lists the ingredients as: mRNA, lipids – (4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethyleneglycol)-2000]-N, N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol – and tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, sucrose, and sodium chloride. If your child is allergic to any of these ingredients, talk with your physician. 9. What are other countries doing? The UK recommends – but does not mandate – a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year olds and is ramping up vaccination efforts. Chile, Denmark, Spain, France, and Germany already are vaccinating that group. After the FDA’s authorization for younger children, Israel is commencing vaccination efforts in the 5-to-11 age group. 10. What are the concerns? At this point, physicians are watching carefully to determine how children with other infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and other common viruses are affected by vaccination. There is some concern that a more severe form of the infection may develop, according to an article in Nature. 11. What do doctors advise? According to a global physicians’ survey conducted in September by Sermo, 65% of doctors who responded believe vaccinating children against COVID-19 is essential for the long-term control of the disease. That survey included 1,528 physicians throughout the world. Nearly 75% of them noted, however, that they are seeing an increase in unvaccinated children with COVID-19 infections. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advocates COVID-19 vaccination for all children ages 5 and older who do not have contraindications for the vaccine. This includes children who previously have had COVID-19. Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print Regulatory Academia Healthcare Europe Infectious disease COVID-19 Vaccines Pfizer Moderna, Inc.

By Nabilah Awang By Nabilah Awang Published November 11, 2021 Updated November 11, 2021 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Researchers noted the most substantial dip in flu infections during the circuit breaker period from April to June last year Restrictions such as mask-wearing, social distancing and reduced travel may have reduced people’s exposure to various viruses such as flu Influenza A/B, which causes the seasonal flu, was nearly absent for the second half of 2020 This reduced exposure to flu may mean reduced immunity among the Singapore population, said researchers People are advised to get the flu vaccination in addition to the Covid-19 jab SINGAPORE — A study has found that the Singapore population might be susceptible to getting the seasonal influenza and common colds when Covid-19 restrictions further relax. This is after a year of mask-wearing, physical distancing and travel restrictions, which may have lowered both the incidence of these illnesses and the population’s immunity against them.Researchers said, though, that it is uncertain if the lifting of these restrictions may ignite an outbreak of the flu when these viruses return to the community.Experts are recommending people get the flu vaccination in addition to the Covid-19 vaccines.Dr Matthias G Maiwald, head consultant of microbiology service at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) and one of the study’s authors, said that common cold infections, while unpleasant, are important to retain immunity levels.“They are not all that bad because common cold infections help keep our immunity trained, so to speak,” he said at a media briefing on Thursday (Nov 11).“And if that training of the immunity is absent during 2020 or 2021, there is a chance that our immune system is less prepared for a return infection.”Dr Maiwald is one of the researchers from Singapore General Hospital (SGH), KKH and Genome Institute of Singapore, who examined data of more than 42,000 polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses performed across three public hospitals in 2019 and 2020.They collated weekly numbers of tests and positive results for the various viruses to assess trends in respiratory virus infections during the Covid-19 pandemic in Singapore.The study found that flu activity was at its peak in December 2019 and January 2020, with nearly 30 cases for every 100 samples.They saw a decline in flu infections in February and March last year, after the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level here turned orange, with just about two cases for every 100 samples.In declaring Dorscon orange, the Government introduced various restrictions and recommendations, such as temperature screening, a suspension of external activities by schools and advice to cancel large-scale events.The most substantial dip in flu infections was during the circuit breaker or semi-lockdown in April and May last year, so much so that influenza A/B — the cause of seasonal flu — was nearly absent for the remainder of 2020.The circuit breaker restrictions largely confined most people, aside from essential workers, to their homes.Singapore typically has two flu seasons — from December to February, and May to July — which generally coincide with the school holidays when families travel overseas.The researchers said that although the seasonal flu has remained low, some flu viruses rebound earlier despite continued mask-wearing.This is in the case of the enterovirus and rhinovirus — a major cause of the common cold among children — which re-emerged during the second phase of the reopening of the economy after the circuit breaker, in the second half of 2020.Dr Wan Wei Yee, a senior consultant at SGH’s department of microbiology said that this could be attributed to children being less compliant with health regulations and hygine precautions.“They like to touch everything, every surface, they put things in their mouths, they hug people. This behaviour, as well as the relaxed social measures, probably contributed to (this resurgence),” she added.The researchers thus urged the public, even people who have recovered from Covid-19, to get their flu vaccine before the start of the flu season, in addition to the Covid-19 vaccines.Dr Maiwald said: “If you had Covid-19, it does not confer a known cross-protection towards common cold viruses. The situation with the common cold viruses is specific because there are plenty of them, so you are protected only against the common cold you already had.” Related topics Covid-19 coronavirus influenza cold virus immunity KKH SGH Read more of the latest in Singapore Explore now Advertisement Trending Content is loading...

Outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu have happened near Wrexham in Wales, Droitwich in England and in Scotland, with the same strain found in wild birds from sites across the UK. Bird flu can be passed from bird to bird causing illness and death. The UK Health Security Agency also says that the risk of bird flu to public health is ‘very low’ and that ‘properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat’. Mr Breed has warned poultry owners that outbreaks were ‘unfortunately likely to continue to occur over the winter’. He added: ‘Following the recent outbreaks of avian influenza, also known as bird flu, in the UK, I have written to local poultry keepers to highlight the risk that wild birds pose to poultry. ‘While there are no known cases of bird flu in Jersey, we are advising poultry keepers to take increased measures to help protect their birds from infection. This includes, among other steps, minimising the contact poultry has with wild birds and wild bird droppings, and owners disinfecting footwear before and after being in bird enclosures.’ He added that the situation in the UK was being monitored and that a ban on bringing birds into the Island could be introduced. ‘The UK Health Security Agency has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds, and Public Health England advises that the risk to public health is low,’ he said. ‘The Food Standards Agency says, on the basis of current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food-safety risk for UK consumers. ‘The issuing of all import-poultry and hatching-egg licences for Jersey is under review. If the risk rises to an unacceptable level, then importations will be suspended.’ Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. – Advertisement – Trending Stories Beach café to host farewell fiesta on Saturday Brittany Ferries 'surprised and disappointed' at Jersey government's offer of seven-month contract extension for Condor Hope for improvement after thousands stranded as fog hits Island House prices see biggest annual drop in over 20 years Missing person found "safe and well" following night-time search and rescue – Advertisement – UK News UK News What the papers say – November 11 11 November 2024 UK News Government says it will not allow events to be ‘hijacked’ by antisemitism 11 November 2024 UK News Starmer and Macron to discuss Ukraine ahead of Armistice commemorations 11 November 2024 UK News SFA chief tells of emergency eyecare surgery before key Euros match 11 November 2024 More UK News Read the latest free supplements Read the Town Crier, Le Rocher and a whole host of other subjects like mortgage advice, business, cycling, travel and property.
