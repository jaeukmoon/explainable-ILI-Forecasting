The findings increase our understanding of whether the H5N1 outbreak in cows could lead to a human pandemic. Scientists are studying the H5N1 influenza virus that has been causing an outbreak in U.S. cattle to see how much of a threat it might pose to public health. JackF / Adobe Stock Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses spread mostly among birds, but occasional infections in mammals do occur. The first documented outbreak of H5N1 in cattle occurred in the United States in spring 2024. During this outbreak, the virus has spread within and between cattle herds. In addition to poultry, cats and people have also been infected. If the virus spread through the human population, it could pose a great risk to public health. Yet how the cow H5N1 virus transmits between mammals isn’t well understood. A research team led by Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studied an H5N1 virus isolated from the milk of an infected cow in New Mexico. Using mice and ferrets as models, the researchers examined how the virus spread within the body and between individuals. Results from the study, which was funded in part by NIH, appeared in Nature on July 8, 2024. The team found that mice became infected with the virus after consuming unpasteurized milk from an infected cow. Both mice and ferrets could also be infected through the nose. In both animals, the virus then spread to organs and tissues beyond the respiratory system. These included mammary glands and muscle. A comparison H5N1 virus, typical of those that have infected humans before, spread to the same tissues. Because the team found virus in mammary glands, they tested whether it could spread from mother to offspring via milk. Within a week of infection, the virus was detected in the mammary glands of lactating female mice, and some of their nursing pups became infected. Adult mice housed together with infected females did not get infected, suggesting that the pups were infected via milk. To test whether the virus can transmit through the air in respiratory droplets, the researchers housed uninfected ferrets in cages next to infected ones. For almost two weeks, the exposed ferrets never developed disease symptoms or had virus detected in nasal swabs. But one out of four exposed ferrets did show an immune system response to the virus, suggesting infection. Human influenza viruses bind to a structure on the surfaces of cells in the human upper respiratory tract that allows them to enter the cells. Bird influenza viruses, in contrast, usually bind to a different, related structure. But the team found that the cow H5N1 virus could bind to both. This suggests that the virus could infect cells in the human upper respiratory tract. Taken together, these results suggest that H5N1 in cows can infect other mammals, including humans, via raw milk. But they also suggest that airborne transmission isn’t very efficient. Thus, the virus isn’t likely to spread this way, limiting its potential to cause a human pandemic. Yet the researchers noted the need for continued vigilance, as viruses can mutate. They can also exchange genetic material with other influenza viruses that may help them spread more easily in humans. “The H5N1 virus currently circulating in cattle has limited capacity to transmit in mammals,” Kawaoka says. “But we need to monitor and contain this virus to prevent its evolution to one that transmits well in humans.” —by Brian Doctrow, Ph.D.Related LinksAssessing Avian Influenza in Dairy MilkResearch in Context: Progress toward universal vaccinesUsing mRNA Technology for A Universal Flu VaccineStudy Suggests Way to Improve Flu VaccinesStrategy May Improve Seasonal Flu VaccinesFinding Factors That Protect Against FluIs It Flu, COVID-19, Allergies, or a Cold?InfluenzaPandemic PreparednessAvian Influenza (CDC)References: Pathogenicity and transmissibility of bovine H5N1 influenza virus.

Throughout this outbreak, spillovers to mammals have been frequently documented5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we report spillover of the HPAI H5N1 virus to dairy cattle across several states in the USA. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered faecal consistency, respiratory distress and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and viral RNA were consistently detected in milk from affected cows. Viral distribution in tissues via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Whole viral genome sequences recovered from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats and a raccoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiological and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after apparently healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.

This viral lineage was initially detected only in poultry, with detections in wild birds occurring in 2002 (ref. 13). The virus has frequently reassorted with other influenza viruses, with the haemagglutinin gene remaining as the only gene that defines this genetic lineage of viruses. These frequent reassortments and ongoing antigenic changes led to complex classification of the viruses into multiple clades14. Over the past decade, the H5Nx goose/Guangdong lineage evolved into eight clades (2.3.4.4a–2.3.4.4h) with three main neuraminidase subtypes: N1, N8 and N6. The H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has caused global outbreaks in recent years15,16, infecting various avian species and showing potential to infect humans and other mammals5,6,7,11,12,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 860 human infections since 2003, with a fatality rate of approximately 52.8%24, although serological evidence has suggested less severe more widespread infection25. Risk of human-to-human transmission remains low26. Since 2016, the H5Nx clade 2.3.3.4b has circulated broadly in migratory wild bird populations across Europe, Africa and Asia, being first detected in North America (Canada) in December 2021 (ref. 27). By January 2022, it was found in wild birds in North and South Carolina in the USA1,28, and soon after in commercial poultry2. Since then, H5N1 caused high morbidity and mortality in poultry leading to the loss of over 100 million birds (as of 13 August 2024) in the USA alone29. The continuous and widespread circulation of this high-consequence panzootic pathogen is of major concern and poses a substantial threat to animal and public health.In addition to devastating consequences to domestic and wild avian species, HPAI H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b spillovers have been detected in several mammals9,10,29,30, including domestic and wild carnivorous species such as cats (Felis catus)17, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)6, bears (Ursus americanus)11 and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina)5. The virus has even spread to polar regions, killing a polar bear (Ursus maritimus) in the Arctic, and elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in Antarctica31. In the USA, a human infection in a poultry worker that resulted in mild symptoms and full recovery was reported in April 2022 (ref. 32). During 2023, two major outbreaks of H5N1 in harbour seals resulted in high mortality in Maine and Washington. In January 2023, two indoor–outdoor cats died from HPAI-induced encephalitis12. Acute death of a striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) in Washington has been reported20, along with additional cases in this species in 2023 and 2024 (ref. 33). On 20 March 2024, the Minnesota board of animal health reported that a juvenile goat (Capra hircus) tested positive for HPAI, resulting in the first report of HPAI H5N1 infection in a ruminant species, following positive tests in backyard poultry on the same premises34.Here we report the spillover of the HPAI H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b into dairy cattle and describe the findings of a clinical, pathological and epidemiological investigation in nine affected farms (farms 1–9) across four states in the USA.Clinicoepidemiological investigationFrom late January to mid-March 2024, a morbidity event of unknown aetiology affecting dairy cattle was reported by field veterinarians in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding states (New Mexico and Kansas). The first farm known to be affected by the morbidity event (30 January 2024) was in Texas; however, no clinical samples were collected from affected animals in this farm. The disease was subsequently reported in additional farms in Texas and other states. We conducted a clinicoepidemiological investigation in nine farms located in Texas (farms 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7), New Mexico (farms 4 and 8), Kansas (farm 9) and Ohio (farm 3) that reported the morbidity event between 11 February and 19 March 2024. Farm 3 in Ohio was affected after apparently healthy lactating cattle were transported from farm 1 in Texas to this location (Extended Data Table 1). Affected dairy cattle presented with decreased feed intake, decreased rumination time, mild respiratory signs (clear nasal discharge, increased respiratory rate and laboured breathing), lethargy, dehydration, dryacky faeces or diarrhoea, and milk with abnormal yellowish colostrum-like colour, thick and sometimes curdled consistency. In addition, an abrupt drop in milk production ranging from 20% to 100% in individual affected animals was noted. Upon clinical examination, mammary gland involution was observed in several of the affected cows (Extended Data Fig. 1). The proportion of clinically affected animals ranged between 3% and 20%. Mortality above average (twofold higher) was noted in cows in farms 2 and 3 during the clinical event. Of note, several of the affected farms reported simultaneous mortality events in passerines (great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus)), peridomestic birds (rock pigeons (Columba livia)), and in outdoor domestic (cats) and wild (raccoons (Procyon lotor) mammals; Extended Data Table 1). The clinical disease in dairy cattle lasted 5–14 days, with animals returning to pre-outbreak health status, rumination times and feed intake, but maintaining decreased milk production for at least 4 weeks.Multispecies detection of the H5N1 virusA diagnostic investigation was conducted in samples collected from farms 1 to 9. Initially, nasal swabs, serum and blood buffy coats from ten affected cows from farm 1 were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. IAV sequences were detected in one nasal swab and no other bovine respiratory viruses were detected. Real-time PCR with reverse transcription (rRT–PCR) targeting the IAV matrix and haemagglutinin 5 (H5) genes confirmed the presence of HPAI-H5 in nasal swabs of this cow. Of note, 8 of 10 milk samples collected from the same cows were positive for HPAI-H5 via rRT–PCR (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, oropharyngeal swabs from great-tailed grackles and rock pigeons, and lung and brain tissues from a cat found dead on farm 1 tested positive for HPAI-H5 (Supplementary Table 1). A similar epidemiological scenario involving mortality events in domestic and wild mammals was observed in farms 3–5 and 8. Six domestic cats died in farm 3 after the disease onset in dairy cows. Cats found dead on farms 4 and 5 and cats and a raccoon found dead on farm 8 tested positive for HPAI-H5.Testing of multiple sample types (n = 331) collected from cows from farms 1 to 9 by rRT–PCR showed sporadic viral RNA detection in nasal swabs (10 of 47), whole blood (3 of 25) and serum (1 of 15), and most frequent detection in milk (129 of 192). The milk samples consistently had the highest viral RNA loads of the samples tested (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Results from rRT–PCR on tissues collected from three affected cows revealed the presence of viral RNA in the lungs, small intestines, supramammary lymph nodes and mammary glands. The highest viral RNA loads were detected in the mammary glands (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1), corroborating high viral loads detected in milk. In addition, haemagglutination inhibition antibody testing in paired serum samples collected from animals in farm 2 (n = 19) confirmed H5N1 infection in affected dairy cows (Fig. 1c).Fig. 1: Detection and isolation of HPAI H5N1 from dairy cattle.a, Viral RNA loads in nasal swab (n = 27), whole-blood (n = 25), serum (n = 15), urine (n = 4), faecal (n = 10) and milk (n = 167) samples collected from cattle from farms 1 to 9 quantified by rRT–PCR targeting the IAV matrix gene. b, Viral RNA loads in tissues of dairy cattle quantified by rRT–PCR targeting the IAV matrix gene. c, Serum antibody responses in affected cattle (n = 19) quantified by a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. d, Cytopathic effect of the HPAI H5N1 virus isolated from milk in bovine uterine epithelial cells Cal-1.

The limit of detection for infectious virus titration was 101.05 TCID50 ml−1. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m (a–c,f,g). All graphs and statistical analysis were generated using GraphPad Prism (v10).Source DataFull size imageInfectious virus shedding in dairy cowsVirus isolation and quantification were performed on milk samples from farms 1, 2 and 3. Infectious HPAI H5N1 virus was isolated from the pellet of pooled milk samples from 10 cows from farms 1 and 2 (Fig. 1d,e). Of note, virus titres in milk from affected animals ranged from 104.0 to 108.8 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per millilitre (Fig. 1f), demonstrating high infectious viral loads in milk from infected animals. Consistent with this, high viral loads (107.3–107.8 TCID50 ml−1) were detected in mammary gland tissues (Fig. 1g).Virus shedding was also investigated in samples (milk, nasal swabs, urine and faeces) collected from clinical and non-clinical animals from farm 3. Overall, virus shedding was detected more frequently in milk samples from clinical animals (24 of 25) with higher RNA viral loads than from non-clinical animals (1 of 15; Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 2). Clinical animals shed virus at a low frequency in nasal swabs (6 of 25) and urine (2 of 15), and no viral RNA was detected in faeces (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 2). In non-clinical animals, viral RNA was detected in 6 of 19 nasal swabs and 4 of 8 urine samples (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 2), indicating subclinical infection.Fig. 2: Virus shedding patterns.a, Viral shedding and RNA load in milk (n = 41), nasal secretions (nasal swabs, n = 45), urine (n = 23) and faeces (n = 25) collected from clinical and non-clinical animals from farm 3. b, Viral RNA loads in milk samples collected from cattle from farm 3 on day 3 (n = 15), day 16 (n = 12) and day 31 (n = 9) post-clinical diagnosis quantified by rRT–PCR targeting the IAV matrix gene. c, Infectious HPAI virus in milk (n = 13 on day 3, n = 12 on day 16 and n = 9 on day 31) detected by virus titration.

All graphs and statistical analysis were generated using GraphPad Prism (v10).Source DataFull size imageDuration of H5N1 virus sheddingNasal swabs, whole blood, serum and milk samples were collected at approximately 3 (n = 15), 16 (n = 12) and 31 (n = 9) days post-clinical diagnosis of HPAI to assess the duration of virus shedding. On day 3, viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs from 2 of 15 animals, in whole blood of 1 of 15 animals, in serum of 1 of 15 animals, and in milk of 14 of 15 animals (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). Although no virus RNA was detected in nasal swabs, whole-blood or serum samples collected on days 16 and 31 post-clinical diagnosis, milk from 10 of 12 and 4 of 9 animals tested on days 16 and 31 post-clinical diagnosis, respectively, remained positive (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). Although high infectious viral loads were detected in milk on day 3 post-clinical diagnosis (104.05–108.80 TCID50 ml−1), no infectious virus was recovered from milk from days 16 and 31 post-clinical diagnosis (Fig. 2c).Mammary gland tropism of the H5N1 virusHistological examination of tissues from affected dairy cows revealed marked changes consisting of neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic mastitis with prominent effacement of tubuloacinar gland architecture, which were filled with neutrophils admixed with cellular debris in multiple lobules in the mammary gland (Fig. 3). The most pronounced histological changes in the cat tissues consisted of mild-to-moderate multifocal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with multifocal areas of parenchymal and neuronal necrosis (Extended Data Table 6 and Extended Data Fig. 2).Fig. 3: Detection of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle mammary gland tissue.Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (left panels) showing intraluminal epithelial sloughing and cellular debris in mammary alveoli (Z1 and Z2), and normal mammary alveoli filled with milk and fat globules (Z3). In situ hybridization (ISH; middle panels) targeting the IAV (matrix gene) showing extensive viral RNA in milk-secreting epithelial cells in the alveoli and in intraluminal cellular debris (Z1 and Z2), and normal mammary alveoli showing no viral staining (Z3). Immunohistochemistry (IHC; right panels) targeting the IAV matrix gene showing intracytoplasmic immunolabelling of viral antigen in milk-secreting alveolar epithelial cells (Z1 and Z2), and normal mammary alveoli showing no viral staining (Z3). Scale bars, 500 µm (Z0) and 50 µm (Z1–Z3).Full size imagePronounced viral RNA and antigen were detected via in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the mammary gland of affected cows and in the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem) of affected cats. In mammary glands, viral RNA and antigen were present in the alveolar milk-secreting epithelial cells and interacinar spaces. In the brain of an affected cat, viral RNA and antigen were detected in neuronal soma glial cells, endothelial cells lining the capillaries within the choroid plexus, and the Purkinje cells in the molecular layer of cerebellum (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2). In addition, sparce viral RNA and antigen were detected in the lung, supramammary lymph nodes, spleen, heart, colon and liver from affected cows (Extended Data Table 3 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). Virus-infected cells were detected in peripheral areas of germinal centres of lymph nodes and in cells surrounding blood vessels in the remaining tissues (Extended Data Table 3 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). These results demonstrate a distinct tropism of HPAI H5N1 virus for the mammary tissue of cattle and the central nervous system tissue of cats with sporadic detection of virus-infected cells in other tissues.Spillover of reassortant H5N1 virusAll HPAI H5N1 virus sequences obtained from the farms in our study (n = 91) were classified within a new reassortant B3.13 genotype (Extended Data Fig. 5), which comprises PA, HA, NA and matrix gene segments of an Eurasian wild bird ancestry (ea1), and NS, PB2, PB1, and NP gene segments from American bird lineages (am1.1, am2.2, am4 and am8, respectively; Extended Data Table 4). To identify potential parental genotypes and to define the most recent common ancestors leading to the emergence of genotype B3.13, we performed Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees (BEAST) and TreeSort sorting using influenza A sequences obtained between 2020 and 2024. This analysis suggests that B3.13 genotype viruses acquired the PB2 and NP gene fragments before its initial detections in avian and mammalian species in January 2024 (Extended Data Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 5). The first genome segment derived from the LPAI American bird lineage to be incorporated in HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was the NS gene (am1.1); the earliest evidence of its emergence derived from a reassortant genotype B3.2 virus obtained from chicken in British Columbia, Canada in June 2022 (A/chicken/BC/22-023547-001-original/2022(H5N1)); Extended Data Table 4). Incorporation of the PB1 (am4) and PB2 (am2.2) gene segments into HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was first detected in November 2023, in a genotype B3.9 virus sequence recovered from a tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus) from Minnesota (Aundra_swan/Minnesota/23-037501-001-original/2023(H5N1)). The reassortant genotype B3.13 virus, which incorporated the am2.2 PB2 and am8 NP gene segments, was first detected on 26 November 2023 in Canada goose (Branta canadensis) in Colorado (A/goose/Colorado/23-038138-001/2023), then on 25 January 2024 in a Canada goose (Branta canadensis) in Wyoming (A/Canada_goose/Wyoming/24-003692-001-original/2024(H5N1)), followed by a detection in a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) in California (A/peregrine_falcon/California/24-005915-001-original/2024(H5N1)) on 14 February 2024, and soon after in a skunk in New Mexico on 23 February 2024 (A/skunk/New_Mexico/24-006483-001-original/2024(H5N1); Extended Data Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 5). The host species, in which the reassortment event culminating in the incorporation of the am8 NP segment and emergence of the HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13 virus, remains unknown.Phylogenomics of the H5N1 B3.13 genotypePhylogenetic analysis based on concatenated whole genomes revealed that all sequences from farms 1 to 9, including sequences obtained from wild birds, cows and other mammals, formed a large monophyletic lineage (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6). They were most closely related to a sequence obtained from the Canada Goose in November 2023 in Colorado (A/goose/Colorado/23-038138-001/2023) and a sequence from a skunk in New Mexico on 23 February 2024 (A/skunk/New_Mexico/24-006483-001-original/2024). The sequences obtained from the affected dairy farms characterized in the present study formed two large phylogenetic branches, with the largest one including three subclusters. Of note, these phylogenetic groups of closely related sequences were not always formed by sequences derived from the same farm (Fig. 4b). Phylogenetic branches formed by sequences obtained from cattle from farms 1 and 3, farms 1 and 8, and farms 7 and 9 suggested a close genetic relationship between the viruses in these farms (Fig. 4b), and potential transfer of the virus between farms. Similarly, sequences obtained from cattle from sites 1 and 2 of farm 2 (a multisite dairy operation), formed a monophyletic cluster, indicating co-circulation of the virus in these two sites (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4: Phylogenetic analysis of HPAI H5N1.a, Phylogeny of sequences derived from cattle, cats, raccoon and grackle sampled in the farms described in this study, and other sequences in closer ancestral branches, obtained from the GISAID database. Nodes are coloured by host species. b, Detailed view of the clade containing 91 sequences derived from animals sampled in the farms described in this study. Nodes are coloured by farm. All phylogenomic analyses were conducted with concatenated whole-genome sequences.Full size imageNext, the mutation profile of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was investigated. Initially, we evaluated the occurrence of mutations with known functional relevance to IAV (for example, host adaptation, virulence and host specificity shift, among others) compared with the original H5N1 A/GsGd/1/1996 virus (Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, we performed a detailed comparative genome analysis and mutational profiling using sequences obtained in the USA throughout the 2021–2024 HPAI outbreak (Extended Data Table 5). The first HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b sequence A/chicken/NL/FAV-0033/2021 detected in Canada was used as a reference to identify mutations in different genome segments across affected species. Representative sequences from multiple genotypes (A1, A2, B1.3, B3.2, Minor01, B3.6, B3.9 and B3.13) were selected, including sequences from avian (chicken and great tailed grackle) and mammalian (skunk, red fox, harbour seals, human, goat, cat and cattle) hosts. A total of 132 amino acid substitutions were observed across the 8 genome segments, most of which are low-frequency mutations observed in a small proportion of cattle-derived viral sequences (Extended Data Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6). Fifteen mutations emerged in viruses of genotypes circulating in late 2023 (for example, A2 and B3.6) and were maintained in genotype B3.13 viruses in 2024, including mutations in PB2 (V109I, V139I, V495I and V649I), PB1 (E75D, M171V, R430K and A587P), PA (K113R), HA (T211I), NA (V67I, L269M, V321I and S339P), NP (S482N) and NS1 (C116S) genes. Seven additional mutations were detected exclusively in genotype B3.13 viruses, including five substitutions in PB2 (T58A, E362G, D441N, M631L and T676A), one in PA (L219I) and one in NS1 (S7L). When compared with the first reported B3.13 sequences (A/goose/Colorado/23-038138-001/2023[H5N1]), (A/Canada_goose/Wyoming/24-003692-001-original/2024(H5N1)), A/peregrine_falcon/California/24-005915-001-original/2024(H5N1) and A/skunk/New_Mexico/24-006483-001-original/2024(H5N1)), the cow HPAI H5N1 viral sequences presented five amino acid substitutions, including three in PB2 (E362G, D441N and M631L), one in PA (L219I) and one in NS (S7L; Extended Data Table 5), suggesting that these could have emerged following spillover in cattle.H5N1 virus dispersal between farmsThe HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13 sequences obtained from farms presenting an epidemiological link (farm 2: separate production sites [site 1 and 2]; and farms 1 and 3: animals were transported from farm 1 to 3; Extended Data Table 1) or presenting closely related viral sequences (farms 7 and 9; Fig. 4b) were subjected to phylogeographical dispersal reconstructions (Fig. 5a). Haplotype network analysis of concatenated whole-genome sequences provided support for focusing the dispersal and phylogeographical inferences on farms 1 and 3, farm 2, and farms 7 and 9 (Fig. 5b). The phylogenetic relationship and dispersal pathways were inferred based on concatenated whole-genome sequences, the farm location and date of sample collection to reconstruct hypothetical dispersal trajectories of the HPAI virus between the farms. The viral sequences recovered from farm 2, which were collected from two separated production sites (1 and 2, approximately 50 km apart), formed two phylogenetic clusters, each comprising sequences from both sites, confirming the spread of the virus between these premises. Phylogeographical dispersal analysis of the HPAI H5N1 sequences recovered from farm 2 suggests site 1 as the likely source of the virus (Fig. 5c).Fig. 5: Interstate and local dispersal of the HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13 between farms.a, HPAI H5N1 virus dispersal in North America. Samples described in this study are coloured by farm, whereas locations in grey represent samples from closer ancestral branches obtained from the GISAID database. b, Haplotype network analysis of HPAI H5N1 viral sequences obtained from the farms described in this study. The different colours indicate different farms. The size of each vertex is relative to the number of samples, and the dashes on branches denote the number of mutations between nodes. c–e, Phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis of dispersal between sites 1 and 2 of farm 2 (c), farms 7 and 9 (d), and farms 1 and 3 (e). The directions of dispersal lines are counterclockwise. All phylogenomic and dispersal analyses were conducted with concatenated whole-genome sequences.Full size imageViral sequences obtained from farms 7 and 9 (six sequences from farm 7 and 11 sequences from farm 9), which are approximately 280 km apart from each other, formed a monophyletic cluster, suggesting a link and potential bidirectional virus dispersal between these two farms (Fig. 5d). However, another hypothesis that cannot be formally excluded as it could not be resolved by our analysis is unidirectional dispersal of multiple viral lineages from farms 7 to 9 or vice versa. Given the close genetic relationship between the viruses in these farms, we conducted a broader phylogenetic analysis including other HPAI H5N1 B3.13 sequences available in GISIAD. This analysis revealed two additional H5N1 sequences recovered from blackbirds (unknown species) clustering with viral sequences from farms 7 and 9 (Extended Data Fig. 7). The blackbirds were collected at 8–12 km away from farm 7. Together, these results suggest both long-range and close-range lateral spread and transmission of the HPAI virus between farms.Sequences obtained from farm 1 (Texas) and farm 3 (Ohio) branched interspersedly in two subclusters. Viral sequence recovered from animals from farm 1 were basal to all sequences from farm 3. Phylogeographical dispersal analysis revealed that the HPAI virus most likely spread from farm 1 (Texas) to farm 3 (Ohio; Fig. 5e). This is consistent with the epidemiological information revealing the transportation of 42 apparently healthy dairy cattle from farm 1 to farm 3 on 8 March 2024, 5 days before the first clinical signs were observed in animals in farm 1 and 12 days before the first clinical animal was identified in farm 3 (Extended Data Table 1). These results indicate transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus between subclinically infected cows.Interspecies transmission of the H5N1 virusGiven that five of the nine farms included in our study (farms 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8) reported mortality events in wild (great-tailed grackles) and peri-domestic (pigeons) birds, and in wild (raccoon) and domestic (cats) mammals, we investigated potential HPAI infection in these species. Whole-genome sequencing of the samples from the grackles and a cat from farm 1 and a raccoon from farm 8 confirmed infection of these species with a HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13 virus closely related to the viruses found in dairy cattle in these farms. The basal sequences for the viruses obtained from a cat in farm 1 and the raccoon in farm 8 were derived from dairy cattle, indicating cattle-to-cat and cattle-to-raccoon transmission (Extended Data Fig. 8). This is supported by epidemiological information revealing that feeding raw milk to farm cats was a common practice in these farms.DiscussionHere we described the spillover of a new reassortant HPAI H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13 into dairy cattle and provide evidence of efficient transmission among cattle and between cattle and other species, highlighting the ability of the virus to cross species barriers. The farms that first reported and confirmed the HPAI H5N1 virus genotype B3.13 infection in cattle in Texas, New Mexico and Kansas are on the Central North American migratory bird flyway. The first reported genome sequence of the genotype B3.13 virus was obtained from a sample collected from a Canada goose in Colorado (26 November 2023) and then in a Canada goose in Wyoming (25 January 2024), within the same flyway. This was followed by detection in a peregrine falcon in California (14 February 2024) on the Pacific flyway, and then in a skunk in New Mexico (23 February 2024), again on the Central flyway. The lack of complete epidemiological information regarding the H5N1 genotype B3.13 sequence collected from the skunk in New Mexico precludes definitive conclusions on the link of this animal with affected dairy cattle farms in the region. However, these findings demonstrate the presence of the virus in wildlife in New Mexico around the same time (January–February 2024) that the first cases of sick cows presenting mild respiratory signs, drop in feed intake and milk production (which were later confirmed to be caused by HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13) were reported35. Additional historical and prospective sequence data are needed for more detailed molecular epidemiological inferences.Our results demonstrate a high tropism of HPAI H5N1 for the mammary gland tissue resulting in a viral-induced mastitis, which was confirmed by histological changes and direct viral detection in situ, demonstrating viral replication and defining the virus tropism for milk-secreting mammary epithelial cells lining the alveoli in the mammary gland. The tropism of HPAI H5N1 for milk-secreting epithelial cells is consistent with high expression of sialic acid receptors with an α2,3 (avian-like receptor) and α2,6 (human-like receptor) galactose linkage in these cells36. Although the tissue sample size included in our study was small, isolation of the virus in lung and suprammamary lymph nodes (which were also positive for viral RNA and antigen) suggests that other organs may also have a role in the virus infection dynamics and pathogenesis in dairy cattle. The initial site of virus replication remains unknown; however, it is possible that the virus infects through respiratory and/or oral routes replicating at low levels in the upper respiratory tract (for example, nasal turbinate, trachea and/or pharynx), from where it could disseminate to other organs via a short and low-level viraemia. The collected evidence suggests that the mammary gland is the main site of virus replication, resulting in substantial virus shedding in milk. Another possible transmission route includes direct infection of the mammary gland through the teat orifice and cisternae, which could occur through contaminated floors and bedding where animals lay in the farm or mechanically via the milking equipment during milking. This entry route could also lead to viraemia and subsequent virus disseminationeplication in other distant tissue sites. In the 1950s, several studies have shown that direct inoculation of virus into the udder of dairy cows and goats with the human PR8 strain of IAV led to infection and viral shedding37,38,39,40,41. These results suggest, considering the current outbreak, that mammary epithelial cells, which express α2,3 and α2,6 sialic acid36, may be generally susceptible to IAVs. There are a few studies that have suggested an association between IAV and clinical disease42,43,44,45,46,47, but, to our knowledge, there is no evidence yet of sustained transmission. The only published study of a goose/Guangdong lineage virus being inoculated intranasally into calves has shown limited viral replication with no clinical disease and no evidence of transmission48. Experimental infection studies using different inoculation routes (that is, intranasal versus intramammary) with the HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13 virus and, perhaps, other contemporary viruses of the 2.3.4.4b lineage in dairy cattle with sequential and comprehensive sampling are critical to answer these important questions about the port of entry, infection dynamics and pathogenesis in this new host species.Spillover of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b into mammalian species has been reported throughout the current global outbreak20,49; however, there was no evidence of sustained virus transmission in mammals. Our epidemiological investigation combined with genome sequence and geographical dispersal analysis provides evidence of efficient intraspecies and interspecies transmission of the HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13. Soon after apparently healthy lactating cattle were moved from farm 1 to farm 3, resident animals in farm 3 developed clinical signs compatible with HPAI H5N1, providing evidence suggesting that non-clinical animals can spread the virus. Analysis of the genetic relationship between the viruses detected in farms 1 and 3 combined with phylogeographical modelling indicate that the viruses infecting cattle in these farms are closely related, supporting the direct epidemiological link and indicating long-range viral dispersal and efficient cattle-to-cattle transmission. The results from the phylogenomic and phylogeographical analyses in both sites of farm 2 and on farms 7 and 9 also indicate regional long-range farm-to-farm spread of the virus. In these cases, fomites such as shared farm equipment, vehicles or personnel may have a role in virus spread. The dispersal of virus between farms 7 and 9 could have been vectored by wild birds, as suggested by the fact that blackbirds found dead near farm 7 were infected with a virus closely related to the virus circulating in cattle in these farms. Alternatively, the birds at this premise could have been infected with virus shed by cattle. All affected farms from this study are large farms with cattle maintained in open-air pens, which facilitates access of wild birds or mammals to feed and water that could mediate indirect contact between cattle and potentially infected wild birds or mammals. Our phylogenomic analysis in sequences recovered from affected cats (farms 1, 2, 4 and 5) and a raccoon (farm 8) combined with epidemiological information revealing the practice of feeding raw milk to cats in these farms support cattle-to-cat and cattle-to-raccoon transmission. These observations highlight complex pathways underlying the introduction and spread of HPAI H5N1 in dairy farms (Fig. 6), underscoring the need for efficient biosecurity practices and enhanced surveillance efforts in affected and non-affected farms.Fig. 6: Model of spillover and spread of the HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13 into dairy cattle.A reassortment event in an unknown host species led to the emergence of the H5N1 genotype B3.13, which circulated in wild birds and mammals before infecting dairy cattle. Following spillover of H5N1 into dairy cattle, the virus was able to establish infection and efficiently transmit from cow to cow (intraspecies transmission) and from cow to other species, including wild (great tailed grackles) and peridomestic (pigeons) birds and mammals (cats and raccoons; interspecies transmission). The spread of the virus between farms occurred by the movement of cattle between farms, and probably by movement of wild birds and fomites including personnel, shared farm equipment and trucks (feed, milk and/or animal trucks). The model was created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).Full size imageThe spillover of HPAI H5N1 into dairy cattle and evidence for efficient and sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission are unprecedented. This efficient transmission is concerning as it can lead to the adaptation of the virus, potentially enhancing its infectivity and transmissibility in other species, including humans. Although none of the nine affected farms included in the present study reported cases of human HPAI H5N1 infection, there have been three confirmed human cases resulting in mild conjunctivitis and respiratory infection in other farms in Texas and Michigan50,51,52. These cases highlight the zoonotic potential of the virus, underscoring the need for robust measures to prevent and control the infection and further spread of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle. This would reduce the risk of the virus adapting in this new mammalian host species, thereby decreasing the pandemic risk to humans.MethodsInclusion and ethics statementAll authors of this study were committed to high standards of inclusion and ethics in research. Clinical samples used in the present study were collected as part of routine diagnostic procedures and the data used for research. The findings of this study are reported transparently, with a commitment to accuracy and integrity. All data and results are presented without manipulation, and any limitations of the study are clearly acknowledged.Sample collectionClinical samples used in the present study were collected by field veterinarians from nine clinically affected farms in Texas (farms 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7), New Mexico (farm 8), Kansas (farm 9) or Ohio (farm 3). A total of 332 samples were collected from dairy cattle (n = 323), domestic cats (n = 4), great-tailed grackles (n = 3), a pigeon (n = 1) and a racoon (n = 1) in the affected farms. All samples including milk (n = 211), nasal swabs (n = 46), whole blood (n = 25), serum (n = 15), faeces (n = 10), urine (n = 4) and tissues (mammary gland (n = 4), lung (n = 1), lymph nodes (n = 3), small intestine (n = 3) and large intestine (n = 1)) from dairy cattle were submitted to the Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC), Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) or the Ohio Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (OADDL) for diagnostic investigations. One domestic cat, two grackles and one pigeon (farm 1) were submitted to the AHDC, whereas three cats (farms 4 and 8), a racoon (farm 8) and four cows were submitted to the TVMDL for necropsy and testing (Supplementary Table 1).Sequential samples (milk, nasal swabs and blood) collected from animals (n = 15) from farm 3 were used to investigate the duration of virus shedding (Supplementary Table 2). In addition, paired samples (milk, nasal sabs, urine and faeces) collected from animals presenting respiratory distress, drop in milk production and altered milk characteristics (clinical; n = 25) and from apparently healthy animals (non-clinical; n = 20) from farm 3 were used to compare virus shedding by clinical and non-clinical animals (Extended Data Table 2).Clinical history and epidemiological informationClinical history from all nine farms were obtained from the sample submission forms sent with the samples to the AHDC, TVMDL and OADDL. Additional relevant information from each farm were obtained from attending veterinarians through investigations conducted by laboratory diagnosticians.rRT–PCRViral nucleic acid was extracted from milk, nasal swabs, whole blood, serum, faeces, urine and tissue homogenates. Of milk, nasal swabs, whole blood, serum and urine, 200 µl was used for extraction. Of raw milk samples, 200 µl was used directly or diluted at the ratio of 1:3 milk:PBS with 200 µl of the dilution used for nucleic acid extraction. Tissues and faeces were homogenized in PBS–BSA (1%; 10% w/v), cleared by centrifugation, and 200 µl of the supernatant was used for extraction. All RNA extractions were performed using the MagMAX Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit (Thermo Fisher) and the automated King Fisher Flex nucleic acid extractor (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The presence of IAV RNA was assessed using the VetMax-Gold AIV Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher) and the National Animal Laboratory Network (NAHLN) primers and probe targeting the conserved matrix gene or the H5 haemagglutinin gene53. Amplification and detection were performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast PCR Detection System (Thermo Fisher), under the following conditions: 10 min at 45 °C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95 °C for polymerase activation, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C for denaturation and 30 s at 60 °C for annealing and extension. Relative viral loads were calculated and are expressed as 45 rRT–PCR cycles minus the actual CT value (45-Ct). Positive and negative amplification controls as well as internal inhibition controls were run side by side with test samples. Part of samples was also tested using 200 µl of undiluted milk and serum, and 100 µl of whole blood, targeting the matrix gene. These samples were extracted using the IndiMag Pathogen kit (INDICAL Bioscience) on the KingFisher Flex (Thermo Fisher), and rRT–PCR was performed using the Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher) under the following conditions: 10 min at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 60 s at 60 °C.Haemagglutination inhibitionPaired serum samples collected during the acute and convalescent phase of infection from animals (n = 20) from farm 2 were used to determine seroconversion to HPAI H5N1 virus using the haemagglutination inhibition test. Serum haemagglutination inhibition activity was determined using BPL-inactivated A/Tk/IN/3707/22 antigen (clade 2.3.4.4b), as previously described. Haemagglutination inhibition titres are expressed as log2 values, with 1 log2 being the minimum titre considered positive.Virus isolationVirus isolation was performed in pooled milk samples from farms 1 and 2. Approximately 5 ml of milk from individual animals was pooled, and a total of 50 ml of pooled milk was centrifuged at 1,700g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of sterile PBS–BSA (1%) followed by centrifugation at 1,700g for 10 min at 4 °C. The wash step was repeated one more time and the final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS–BSA (1%). Virus isolation was conducted in bovine uterine epithelial cells (Cal-1; developed in-house at the Virology Laboratory at AHDC) cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM; Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10 U ml–1 and 100 µg ml–1, respectively). Cells were cultured in T25 flasks and inoculated with 1 ml of the milk pellet resuspension from infected cows and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (adsorption). The inoculum was then removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and replenished with 1 ml complete growth media (MEM 10% FBS). Cells were monitored daily for the development of cytopathic effects (CPEs), including cell swelling, rounding and detachment. When the CPE reached 70–80%, infected cells were harvested and cell suspensions were collected after three freeze–thaw cycles. The identity of the isolated virus was confirmed by rRT–PCR, an immunofluorescence assay using anti-nucleoprotein mouse monoclonal antibody (HB65, H16-L10-4R5, ATCC) and whole-genome sequencing. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 62248, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Virus titrationsThe infectious viral loads in milk and tissues of infected animals were quantified by viral titrations. For this, serial tenfold dilutions of rRT–PCR-positive milk samples and tissue homogenates were prepared in MEM and inoculated into Cal-1 cells in 96-well plates. Each dilution was inoculated in quadruplicate wells. At 48 h post-inoculation, culture supernatant was aspirated, and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature and subjected to an immunofluorescence assay using the anti-NP (HB65) mouse monoclonal antibody. Virus titres were determined using end-point dilutions and the Spearman and Karber’s method and expressed as TCID50 ml–1.Microscopic changes, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistryA total of 25 tissue samples from 4 dairy cattle and 12 tissues from 1 domestic cat were collected and fixed in formalin. These formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were sectioned at 3 µm thickness, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and examined for histological changes. To determine the virus tropism and tissue distribution in dairy cattle and cat affected with HPAI H5N1, we performed in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on FFPE tissues as previously described6. In brief, tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, washed with absolute ethanol, and blocked with peroxidase followed by antigen retrieval for 1 h. For the ISH, the V-InfluenzaA-H5N8-M2M1 probe (Advanced Cell Diagnostics), which targets H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, and the RNAScope HD 2.5 assay were used as per the manufacturer’s instructions. ISH signals were amplified with multiple amplifiers conjugated with alkaline phosphatase enzymes, incubated with red substrate at room temperature for 10 min and counterstained with haematoxylin. IHC was performed at the University of Georgia Veterinary Diagnostic laboratory and the USDA-ARS Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory following standard diagnostic IHC procedure. Specifically, tissue sections were treated with proteinase K for 5 min for antigen retrieval and incubated with monoclonal antibody to IAV M-protein (C65331M, Meridian Bioscience) at 1:100 dilution (UGA and VDL) or monoclonal antibody to influenza A NP (clone 4F1; 10780-01, Southern Biotech) at 1:2,000 dilution (SEPRL) for 1 h. After washing the slides, the secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG (1070-04, Southern Biotech) at a 1:5,000 dilution was added and incubated with the slides for 1 h. All the slides were counterstained with haematoxylin, scanned at ×40 resolution and the digital slides were examined for virus tropism and tissue distribution.Viral metagenomic sequencingSample collection and processingWhole-blood nasal swab samples were obtained from ten cows from farm 1 in Texas. Samples were submitted to the AHDC at Cornell University on 16 March 2024. Upon receipt, metagenomic sequencing using the sequence-independent, single-primer amplification (SISPA) procedure, the Oxford Nanopore sequencing chemistry and GridION sequencing platform were performed as described below.Nucleic acid extraction, library preparation and sequencingNucleic acid extraction was performed in 190 µl from each sample using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen). Before nucleic acid extraction, samples were subjected to an enzymatic cocktail treatment composed of 10X DNase 1 buffer, DNAse 1, Turbo DNAse, RNase Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Baseline ZERO DNAse (Lucigen), Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich) and RNase ONE Ribonuclease (Promega) to deplete host and bacterial nucleic acid. Purified nucleic acid was subjected to SISPA, modified from a previously reported protocol54. In brief, 11 μl of nucleic acid was used in a reverse transcription reaction with 100 pmol of primer FR20RV-12N (5′-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNNNNNNNN-3′) using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by second-strand synthesis using the Klenow Fragment of DNA polymerase (NEB) with primer FR20RV-12N at 10 pmol. After purification using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), SISPA PCR amplification was conducted with TaKaRa Taq DNA Polymerase (Takara) using the primer FR20RV (5′-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC-3′) at 10 pmol. SISPA products were converted into sequencing libraries using the ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) and Native Barcoding Kit 96 V1 for multiplex sequencing. Sequencing was performed on the FLO-MIN106 MinION flow cell r9.4.1 using the GridION Sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). A 24-h sequencing run was conducted, with fastq generation performed by the GridION using high-accuracy base calling. Settings were adjusted to accommodate barcodes at both ends and filter mid-strand barcodes. Fastq reads were then filtered by size and quality using Nanofilt55 and classified using Kraken (v2.1.0)56 followed by Bracken57.Targeted influenza A sequencingSamples that tested positive for HPAI H5N1 and had Ct values of less than 30 were subjected to targeted influenza A sequencing at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University (Cornell AHDC) and the OADDL. The set of 107 samples included samples from farm 1 (n = 19), farm 2 (n = 33), farm 3 (n = 54) and farm 7 (n = 1). A complete metadata table with details on this set of samples is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Initial targeted sequencing attempts on milk samples at Cornell AHDC utilizing high-throughput diagnostic extraction methods6 were unsuccessful in obtaining whole influenza A genome sequences despite the utilization of samples with low Ct values. To overcome this limitation, up to 50 ml of each milk sample was pelleted at 1,770g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed two times in PBS as described above and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS–BSA. The resuspended pellet was then diluted 1:5 or 1:10 in PBS, and 200 µl of this dilution was used for extraction with the Indical IndiMag Pathogen kit (INDICAL Bioscience) on the KingFisher Flex extractor (Thermo Fisher). Whole IAV genome sequences were generated using the MBTuni-12 and MBtuni-13 M-RT-PCR methods58. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Native Barcoding Kit EXP-NBD196 and the Ligation Sequencing Kit SQK-SQK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and sequenced on a FLO-MIN106 MinION flow cell r9.4.1 using the GriION platform.In addition, 31 samples from farm 3 were subjected to target influenza A sequencing at the OADDL using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit and the Nextera DNA CD Indexes. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (Illumina) with 2 × 250 base-pair chemistry.Sequence analysis and mutational profilingSequencing data generated by the GridION platform underwent high-accuracy base calling and demultiplexing of barcodes. Settings were configured to require barcodes at both ends and to exclude reads with mid-read barcodes. The Nanofilt software (v2.8.0)55 was used to filter sequences based on quality thresholds. Reads with a quality score below 12 and those shorter than 600 base pairs were removed from further analysis. Filtered reads were aligned to a reference genome download from GenBank (A/Gallus/gallus_domesticus/Sonora/CPA-18486-23/2023/H5N1, NCBI accession numbers OR801090.1–OR801097.1) using Minialign software (v0.4.4; https://github.com/ocxtal/minialign). Consensus sequences were generated using Medaka software (v1.4.3) with medaka_haploid_variant and medaka_consensus programs for polishing (https://github.comanoporetech/medaka). Sequences with a read depth greater than 20 and a quality score exceeding 20 were retained. Analysis of Illumina MiSeq data was performed by trimming the reads with Trimmomatic (v0.39)59, and aligning, calling variants and generating consensus sequences with Snippy (v4.6.0; https://github.comseemann/snippy). Genome sequences were annotated using Prokka software (v1.14.5) to identify genetic features and functional elements60. The GenoFLU tool (v1.03) assessed potential reassortment events within the viral genome (https://github.com/USDA-VS/GenoFLU). Genome alignments, mutations, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and annotation data were visualized using Geneious Prime software (v2024.0). The FluSurver tool, available through GISAID EpiFlu, was utilized to interpret the effects of mutations identified in the sequences, leveraging previously published data (https://flusurver.bii.a-star.edu.sg/). Other mutation data were visualized using protein consensus alignments in Geneious Prime software.Phylogenomic and phylogeographical analysisThe dataset consisted of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genomes from samples collected between January 2023 and March 2024 in the American continent, downloaded from the GISAID Epiflu database33, and 91 complete genomes from the present study that include 50 genomes obtained from raw sequencing data, combined with another 41 complete genomes curated from the GISAID database that were obtained from the farms in our study (farm 1 (n = 11), farm 4 (n = 3), farm 5 (n = 1), farm 6 (n = 4), farm 7 (n = 5), farm 8 (n = 6) and farm 9 (n = 11)). The genomes generated in this study are deposited in the GISAID database (Supplementary Table 5), and raw reads are available in the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession number PRJNA1114404. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using the Augur v21.0.1 tool kit61 procedures implemented in Nextstrain62. In brief, multiple sequence alignments were performed using MAFFT (v7.515)63; maximum likelihood trees were inferred using IQ-TREE (v1.6.12)64, and the initial tree was refined using sequence metadata through the augur refine subcommand. Discrete trait analysis was performed using TreeTime (v0.9.4)65. The resultant dataset was visualized through Auspice. Phylogenomic and phylogeographical analyses were also performed on complete genomes formed by concatenation of all gene segments. Analyses were performed using Nextstrain as described above, with the exception of the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree inferred using IQ-tree with an edge-linked partition model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The potential transmission networks between farms were inferred using the PB2 gene sequences in the PopART package (v1.7.2) using the median joining tree method with an epsilon of zero66.Reassortment and MRCA identificationAll the type A influenza sequences (n = 3,620, North America) from avian, dairy cattle and other mammals between January 2020 and May 2024 were downloaded from the Epiflu database in the GISAID33. Only complete gene fragments were used to infer maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees for each fragment using IQ-TREE with generalized time-reversible nucleotide substitutions model64. The HA phylogeny was used to identify the reassortment events using TreeSort (v0.1.1; maximum molecular clock deviation parameter of 2.5; https://github.com/flu-crew/TreeSort). We implemented the Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling tree (BEAST, v1.10) framework with BEAGLE library (v4.0.1) to estimate the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the individual gene fragments (generalized time-reversible gamma distributed site heterogeneity model, strict clock model, three independent Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling runs with 10 million iterations with sampling every 10,000 iterations)67. Tracer (v1.7.2)68 was used to analyse the results. The maximum clade credibility tree was generated using TreeAnnotator (v1.8.4) using median node heights and 10% burn-in67, and visualized with FigTree (v1.4.4; http:/ree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

For immediate release:July 25, 2024CDC Media Relations(404) 639-3286http://www.cdc.gov/media July 25, 2024 – Three additional human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) (“H5 bird flu”) virus infection have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in association with a second poultry farm in Northeast Colorado/Weld County. Colorado previously announced one of them as a presumptive positive case on Saturday, July 20. The three confirmed cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected poultry at a commercial egg layer operation that had reported an outbreak of H5 bird flu among poultry. All three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, for treatment. State and local officials continue to monitor poultry workers on farms with infected poultry. This is a different farm in Colorado from the one where on Friday, July 19, CDC confirmed two additional human cases of H5 bird flu, which brought the total human cases associated with that first poultry farm to six. With the addition of these three new confirmed human cases, the total number of human cases associated with the current poultry outbreaks in Colorado is nine. A CDC multidisciplinary, bilingual field team is currently deployed to support Colorado’s response to ongoing poultry outbreaks of H5 bird flu in the state. Confirmation of these three additional cases brings the total number of human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States since April 2024 to 13. Prior to 2024, the only previous human case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States was reported among a poultry worker in Colorado in April 2022. Counting that case, there have been 14 total human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States since 2022. Based on available data, CDC’s current assessment is that the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low. As we learn more, we will continue to assess the situation and provide updates. These preliminary results again underscore the risk of exposure to infected animals. There are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado, or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry. Human infections with this novel influenza A virus (and others) are concerning because of the potential to cause severe, widespread disease. To date, we have not seen genetic changes in the virus that would make it more likely to transmit between humans, but we are closely monitoring it. CDC’s recommendations related to H5 virus have not changed at this time. Findings from the investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed. The investigation will include looking into compliance with the recommended use of personal protective equipment. Historically, most human cases of bird flu infection have happened in people who are not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. An analysis of the virus sequences from this outbreak also will be important to determine if a change in the risk assessment is warranted. CDC Recommendations • People should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows). • People should also avoid unprotected exposures to animal feces (poop), bedding (litter), unpasteurized (“raw”) milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed A(H5N1) virus. • CDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of A(H5N1) virus infections in people. CDC also has updated recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Following these recommendations is central to reducing a person’s risk and containing the overall public health risk. ### U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are curable or preventable, chronic or acute, or from human activity or deliberate attack, CDCâs world-leading experts protect lives and livelihoods, national security and the U.S. economy by providing timely, commonsense information, and rapidly identifying and responding to diseases, including outbreaks and illnesses. CDC drives science, public health research, and data innovation in communities across the country by investing in local initiatives to protect everyoneâs health.

D’Alessandro”, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy 2Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Regional Reference Laboratory of Western Sicily for the Emergence of COVID-19, University Hospital “P. Giaccone”, Palermo, Italy Introduction: Seasonal influenza generally represents an underestimated public health problem with significant socioeconomic implications. Monitoring and detecting influenza epidemics are important tasks that require integrated strategies. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an emerging field that uses wastewater data to monitor the spread of disease and assess the health of a community. It can represent an integrative surveillance tool for better understanding the epidemiology of influenza and prevention strategies in public health. Methods: We conducted a study that detected the presence of Influenza virus RNA using a wastewater-based approach. Samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in five different municipalities, serving a cumulative population of 555,673 Sicilian inhabitants in Italy. We used the RT-qPCR test to compare the combined weekly average of Influenza A and B viral RNA in wastewater samples with the average weekly incidence of Influenza-like illness (ILI) obtained from the Italian national Influenza surveillance system. We also compared the number of positive Influenza swabs with the viral RNA loads detected from wastewater. Our study investigated 189 wastewater samples. Results: Cumulative ILI cases substantially overlapped with the Influenza RNA load from wastewater samples. Influenza viral RNA trends in wastewater samples were similar to the rise of ILI cases in the population. Therefore, wastewater surveillance confirmed the co-circulation of Influenza A and B viruses during the season 2022/2023, with a similar trend to that reported for the weekly clinically confirmed cases. Conclusion: Wastewater-based epidemiology does not replace traditional epidemiological surveillance methods, such as laboratory testing of samples from infected individuals. However, it can be a valuable complement to obtaining additional information on the incidence of influenza in the population and preventing its spread. 1 Introduction Influenza is a viral acute respiratory infection with high morbidity and mortality in humans, especially in specific groups such as children and older adults, posing a constant threat to global public health because of recurring seasonal epidemics and irregularly occurring pandemics (1–3). The burden of this disease can vary widely, being determined by several factors, including the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the season, the environmental temperature, how well the available vaccine is working to protect against illness, and how many people got vaccinated (4, 5). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that influenza has resulted in 9 million–41 million illnesses, 140,000–710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020 in the United States (6). Seasonal influenza epidemics have substantially contributed to the worldwide annual mortality rate, particularly among the older adult 65 years and over. In Italy, a mortality rate of 10.7 per 1,000 inhabitants was observed in the winter season of 2014/2015 (more than 375,000 deaths in absolute terms), corresponding to an estimated 54,000 excess deaths (+9.1%), as compared to the previous season (7), representing the highest reported mortality rate since the Second World War in this country (8). Rapid population growth, climate change, natural disasters, immigration, globalization, and the corresponding sanitation and waste management challenges are expected to intensify the problem in the future (9). Worryingly, seasonal influenza generally represents an underappreciated public health problem with significant socio-economic implications (10). Monitoring and detecting influenza outbreaks are important but challenging tasks. To accurately track the spread of influenza, reporting systems for influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza infections (11) can be helpful. These systems are crucial for estimating the number of people experiencing symptoms, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by influenza, addressing vaccination campaigns, and allocating treatment resources. The surveillance of seasonal influenza is possible through data collection and sharing systems, such as FluView in the United States 1and FluNews in Europe,2 which systematically collect data on seasonal influenza and publish periodic reports to inform on epidemiological trends. Influnet is the Italian nationwide sentinel surveillance system for influenza, coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health (NIH), collecting epidemiological and virological data that are published weekly on the integrated surveillance system portal 3according to an operative protocol4 and uploaded into the European database coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (12). Collaborating sentinel doctors from each region of the country report cases of ILI observed among their patients, collecting, at the same time, biological respiratory samples to identify circulating viruses. The European case definition of ILI was adopted to ensure maximum homogeneity of detection. A case of ILI was defined as a person presenting a sudden and rapid onset of at least one of the following systemic symptoms: fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia; and at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath (13). Doctors take throat swabs from ILI patients tested for influenza viruses at regional Influnet laboratories. The experience gained over the last few years indicates that the Influenza virus and Coronaviruses are the two main viruses that pose a high risk to humans. Influenza A viruses can infect various animals and humans, leading to pandemics (14, 15). Although environmental virus monitoring can be helpful, the methods are mainly based on clinical data and not validated for environmental testing (16). Despite this, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a tool for researchers to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 through the design of pilot studies that highlighted the link between environmental and clinical frameworks (17–22). WBE provides quickly anonymous and aggregated data at a low cost and at a potentially large scale through the passive contributions of the community, therefore integrating the conventional surveillance programs and strengthening health emergency response systems, as occurred with the tracking of the poliovirus during the twentieth century (23). Over the past 2 years, the number of studies supporting wastewater surveillance to monitor the circulation of respiratory pathogens and Influenza viruses in communities has been increasing (9, 24–32). As an effective health assessment approach, WBE has great potential in warning of infectious disease outbreaks for public health (20), as recently demonstrated in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic (17, 21, 22). Our study aimed to monitor the presence of the influenza virus in the wastewater of different cities on the island. The objective was to evaluate the circulation of the virus throughout an entire Influenza season and compare the results with the conventional integrated epidemiological and virology surveillance. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and sample collections We conducted an observational study in Sicily (Italy), the largest and most populous island in the Mediterranean Sea, accounting for about 5 million resident inhabitants (33). Five wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) located in five different municipalities, serving a cumulative population of 555,673 inhabitants (ranging from 34,000 to 314,973; 11.1% of total island residents), were included in the study. Raw 24-h composite wastewater samples (n = 188) were collected weekly for 9 months, between August 2022 (week 31/2022) and April 2023 (week 17/2023), by an automatic sampling device. Further information about the location and the characteristics of WTPs is provided in Figure 1. The collected samples were refrigerated, transferred to the laboratory, and tested for influenza viral RNA within 24 h from sampling. The wastewater samples collection period (week 31/2022) started before the national epidemiological/virological surveillance (week 42/2022) to assess the viral RNA early detection in wastewater. This evaluation determines if the WBE methodology can serve as an early warning system for influenza circulation. Figure 1 Figure 1. Location and the characteristics of wastewater treatment plant involved in the study. 2.2 Virus concentration All samples underwent a 30-min treatment at 56°C to minimize the potential impact of bioaerosol on personnel and environmental safety (34–37). Heat-treating samples at 56°C for 30 min should cause a negligible or little effect on the sensitivity of RT-PCR (17, 38, 39). Then, each sample was concentrated using a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based procedure, according to Wu et al. (40) protocol with minor modification. Briefly, wastewater samples (45 mL) were centrifuged at 4,500 x g for 30 min; after centrifugation, 40 mL of sample were mixed with 8% w/v polyethylene glycol 8.000 and 0.3 M NaCl (both supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), spiked with a known amount of Murine Norovirus, used as a process control. After a centrifugation step at 12,000 x g for 2 h, the viral pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of NucliSENS Lysis Buffer reagent (bioMerieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) for sub-sequent RNA extraction. Viral RNA extraction was performed using a semi-automated system based on lysis and magnetic silica beads (supplied by bioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). After an incubation of 20 min at room temperature, 100 μL of magnetic silica beads were added. After further incubation for 10 min, an automated procedure was performed using the nucleic acid purification system (Auto-Pure96, All Sheng Instruments, Zhejiang, China). Before molecular tests, the extracted nucleic acids in an eluent volume of 100 μL, were purified from potential PCR inhibitors using the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). 2.3 RT-qPCR One-step real-time reverse-transcription (RT) quantitative PCR assays were used to detect the presence of Influenza A viral RNA (IAV) and/or Influenza B viral RNA (IBV) according to the CDC protocol with minor modifications.5 A test was considered positive when its cycle threshold (Ct) value was <40. All q-PCR assays were performed with singleplex real-time PCR (rPCR) assays using the TaqMan technology and run on a QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA); primers, probes sets and reagents are described in Tables 1, 2. For the detection of viral RNA, we performed q-PCR as a single step using the Quantinova Pathogen + IC kit Polymerase (Qiagen, CA, USA). The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 50°C for 2 min; 1 cycle at 95°C for 2 min; 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 55°C for 30 s. Table 1 Table 1. Primers and probes for detecting influenza A, influenza B and Murine Norovirus by q-PCR. Table 2 Table 2. The PCR reagents. Viral RNA quantification was performed using 10-fold dilutions, ranging from 1.0 to 1.0 × 105 Genomic Copies (GC)/μL per reaction, of a synthetic double-stranded plasmid construct carrying IAV and IBV nucleotide sequences specific for the real-time assays. qPCR standard curves were generated by linear regression of Ct values versus log10 standard concentration and used to convert Ct values into influenza RNA copies/μL per reaction (Slope = − 3.385; R = 0.999; Efficiency (%) = 97.422; Y-intercept = 21.721). The influenza viral RNA’s GC/L in wastewater was obtained according to the formula: (GC/μL x (100 μL/40 mL)) x 1.000 mL/1 L. The results were also evaluated in GC/day/inhabitant according to the following formula: flow rate of WTP in 24 h (m3) x GC (GC/L)/equivalent number of inhabitants served by the WTP. Verification of PCR inhibition was performed as a quality parameter of the determinations. To verify the inhibition, the PCR Ct value obtained from the sample added with 1 μL of a 1.0 × 103 GC/μL of the synthetic double-stranded plasmid was compared with the PCR Ct value of water for molecular biology added with 1 μL of the same synthetic double-stranded plasmid, according to the following formula: ΔCt = Ct (sample + control plasmid) – Ct (water + control plasmid). The sample was considered acceptable if ΔCt was ≤2. Before performing sample analysis, the limit of detection (LoD) was determined by spiking wastewater extracts with dilutions of the synthetic double-stranded plasmid solutions at concentrations of approximately 1,000, 100, 50, 20, 10, 2, and 1.0 GC/μL. Ten replicates of each dilution were tested. The LoD was the lowest concentration at which all ten replicates were positive. The assay had a LoD of 2.5 GC/μL. The concentration/extraction efficiency of the method was assessed as previously reported (22). The sample was considered acceptable if the concentration/extraction efficiency was ≥1%. 2.4 Clinical and virologic data sources We accessed the Influnet web-based platform data (41) to obtain weekly national and regional epidemiological and virological reports, including the ILI incidence per 1,000 inhabitants for the Sicilian region and the aggregate number of influenza-positive swabs. Specifically, data were retrieved from week 42/2022 (conventionally marked as the starting week for influenza virus circulation and thus established as the onset time for the start of the national influenza circulation surveillance-system data collection) up until week 17/2023 (considered as the ending of influenza season). 2.5 Statistical analyses The national surveillance influenza platform contains regional data regarding influenza virus surveillance. Since data collection was performed weekly, IAV and IBV viral loads (intended as viral RNA copy numbers per day/inhabitants of wastewater) detected from the five Sicilian WTPs were aggregated in weekly means and summed, thus obtaining the total IAV + IBV viral load. Moreover, new time-dependent variables (lag times) were created to assess the wastewater detection method’s early-warning capacity. They were based on a method we already performed in our previous WBE study (42). Specifically, by using “WTPs sampling week” and “regional ILI incidence per 1,000 inhabitants” as key variables, the incidence was set at week 0 (intended as the week of sample collection), week 1 and 2 (respectively, 1 and 2 weeks ahead of the WTPs’ sampling week). As viral concentrations in wastewater are log-normally distributed, a log-10 transformation was applied for all the variables we analysed. Thus, although WBE data were collected from week 31/2022 to assess early virus circulation, national surveillance data were available from week 42/2022. Thus, Person’s correlation test, log-linear regression analyses and significance tests, retrieving R, r2 and p-values, were carried out through RStudio software (version 4.2.2) to compare from week 42/2022 to week 17/2023, at weeks 0, 1 and 2, the following variables: • The mean weekly regional ILI incidence per 1,000 inhabitants with the weekly average of combined IAV and IBV viral loads derived from WTPs. • The weekly regionally combined number of positive IAV and IBV swabs detected, with the combined IAV and IBV Regional viral load detected from WTPs. The Shapiro–Wilk test was carried out to check for the normality of each continuous variable. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3 Results Overall, from 7 September 2022 to 30 April 2023, 189 wastewater samples were investigated every week. In particular, the following samples were collected from five municipalities and tested for IAV and IBV RNA: Agrigento (n = 36), Bagheria (n = 37), Caltanissetta (n = 39), Enna (n = 39), and Palermo (n = 37). Overall, IAV RNA was detected in 123/189 samples (65.1%) and IBV RNA in 37/189 samples (19.5%), while the co-presence of the two viral RNA was recorded in 22/189 (11.6%) of the analyzed samples. The recovery rate of influenza viral RNA has ranged from 1 to 100% (mean 8.72; 95% C.I. = 6.35–11.09), compared to a Murine Norovirus control of known concentration in PCR grade water. Table 3 shows the descriptive analysis of the main clinical and virological surveillance data of the flu season 2022/2023. In the entire study period, the concentration of IAV in wastewater ranged from 0.0 to 9.3 × 105 GC/day/inhabitants, while IBV ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 × 105 GC/day/inhabitants. Figure 2 depicts the weekly trends in the ILI regional incidence, reported by the national surveillance system (primary y-axis) and the influenza RNA load in sewage (secondary y-axis) per week of the year (x-axis). In week 36/2022, the first influenza-positive wastewater samples were recorded, with an average concentration of 4.4 × 104 GC/day/inhabitants. In the following weeks, there was a constantly increasing trend of viral RNA detected in the wastewater until reaching the peak of 9.3 × 105 GC/day/inhabitants in week 50/2022. From then on, the viral RNA concentration in wastewater progressively decreased until week 06/2023, after which a second lower peak occurred at week 10/2023, quantified as 3.9 × 103 GC/day/inhabitants. After that, the viral RNA concentration in wastewater regularly decreased until the absence of detection from week 14/2023. On the other hand, the epidemiological trend of ILI at a regional level showed high values starting from week 42/2022, the first surveillance week of the 2022/2023 season, and peaked in week 49/2022. Excluding small occasional increases in ILIs, the trend has been downward until the end of the surveillance season scheduled for week 17/2023. The number of cumulative ILI cases substantially overlapped with the influenza RNA load from wastewater samples, with an increasing trend of influenza viral RNA in wastewater samples comparable to the rise of ILI cases in the population. Figure 3 shows the trend of IAV and IBV circulating regionally, obtained from the virological surveillance system and the viral RNA load detected from the local wastewater samples. The wastewater analyses allowed us to record the total presence of IAV from week 36/2022 until week 51/2022. From week 52/2022 and up to week 13/2023, there was a co-circulation of the two types of viruses, and the concentration of IBV had an increasing trend until its peak recorded at week 09/2023 with a concentration of 3.5 × 105 GC/day/inhabitants. In confirmation of the co-circulation of viruses from week 52/2022 and of the subsequent predominance of IBV over IAV from week 05/2022, the ratio of IBV over IAV showed values of 0.1 in week 52/2022, of 1.5 in week 05/2023 and 12.8 in week 07/2022 and, in any case, always greater than one up to week 11/2023, the last in which the wastewater samples gave a positive result. A similar trend was shown by the regional virological surveillance of influenza-positive swabs, in which from week 46/2022 to week 50/2022, there was an exclusive circulation of the IAV, a co-circulation of both viruses up to week 17/2023 with a predominance of IBV from week 06/2023 to week 17/2023, with a ratio of type B to type A ranging from 1.2 to 4.8.

Trend of Influenza virus circulating regionally system and viral load detected from the local wastewater samples. As shown in Table 3, the correlation analyses between the Influenza viral RNA load (IAV + IBV RNA concentration) detected in WTPs and the regional incidence of ILI per 1,000 inhabitants displayed a p-value < 0.001 at week 0 and < 0.0001 for weeks 1 and 2, respectively. A moderate-high correlation index (R) was retrieved, ranging from 0.55 at week 0 to 0.78 at week 2. Accordingly, a moderate-correlation index was retrieved when comparing the IAV + IBV viral RNA load detected from WTPs with total number of positive IAV + IBV regionally detected swabs at all times evaluated (Table 4: w0 R = 0.46, p-value < 0.01; w1 R = 0.55, p-value < 0.01; w2 R = 0.63, p-value < 0.001). In Figure 4 are showed the scatterplots describing the correlation between the RNA viral load detected in wastewater (GC/day/inhabitants) and the number of ILI detected per 1,000 inhabitants at week 2.

This resulted in the ample virus circulating in the population when the epidemiological surveillance of the Influnet network began. This trend was also observed in the southern hemisphere, where the Australian data collection systems showed an extremely accelerated and anticipated growth concerning the normal trend (43). In Sicily (Italy), during the first week of surveillance (42/2022, 17–23 October 2022), the incidence of reported ILI, which in principle can be considered a good proxy of the incidence of flu illness (44), was 3.7 cases/1,000 inhabitants, unlike previous influenza seasons which stood at decidedly lower values (41). The anticipated presence of the circulation of influenza viruses was also recorded through the analysis of wastewater, which began in the week of 31/2022 (1–7 August 2022). In week 36/2022 (5–11 September), we simultaneously detected influenza viruses in all municipalities through wastewater analysis. This was 17 days before the start of conventional national surveillance. The values recorded ranged from 6.00 × 102 to 1.24 × 103 GC/L. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the specificity of our method due to the unavailability of sufficient clinical swabs from sentinel doctors for each municipality. Nonetheless, this early detection of pathogen circulation through WBE has the potential to benefit public health greatly. It could aid in differentiated programming of the start of epidemiological/virological surveillance and vaccination campaigns to increase their effectiveness. A sustained co-circulation of type A and B influenza viruses characterized Italy’s 2022/2023 influenza season. Overall, IAV was prevalent (79.5% of the samples tested positive) compared to IBV (20.5%). The epidemiological data of influenza that have emerged in the southern hemisphere have attested that influenza has been spreading significantly, probably due to the reduction of distancing measures and the use of masks (43). In the five municipalities in the study, wastewater analyses showed that the majority of IAV was detected in week 50/2022 (12–18 September 2022) with 9.3 × 105 GC/day/inhabitants, while the majority of IBV was found in week 09/2023 (27 February – 05 March 2023) with 3.5 × 105 GC/day/inhabitants. The same trend, with a time lag of 7–14 days concerning wastewater, was recorded by the virological surveillance, which dated the peak circulation of the IAV in the week 49/2022, therefore 7 days earlier, and that of the IBV in week 12/2023, then 14 days later (41). Our findings confirmed that wastewater surveillance can effectively detect influenza virus circulation and should be considered a valuable supplement to conventional influenza surveillance. More in-depth, it may be used to test influenza virus circulation in the communities for prolonged periods using a single sample approach, like the application of SARS-CoV-2 WBE used to monitor the prevalence of COVID-19. The WBE methodology could be an integrative approach to epidemiological and virological surveillance that introduces some interesting aspects to improve the estimation of influenza incidence. By monitoring various treatment plants in the city, the percentage of subjects tested can be increased compared to the Virological Surveillance Network’s target of 4% of the regional population. Additionally, collecting and transporting wastewater is more straightforward, cheaper, and potentially feasible wherever there is a sewage network, thus increasing the possibility of obtaining information even in smaller municipalities that are typically excluded from traditional surveillance systems. While there are many advantages to infectious disease wastewater monitoring, the WBE approach has some limitations, including aggregated data and the inability to perform epidemiological assessments by age groups, symptoms, or immune status for vaccinated subjects. Wastewater is a complex matrix affected by environmental factors that are not always identified, leading to inherent variability and uncertainties (45, 46). Furthermore, it’s important to address the lack of standardized protocols in the various phases of the analytical process. This includes sample pre-treatment, concentration, and nucleic acid detection (47). We need to establish a testing framework that considers the different analytical sensitivities at each analysis step. For example, in the thermal pretreatment phase, some studies show negligible changes in RNA measurement (34–37), while others do not (48–50). Similarly, in the concentration phase, the PEG-supernatant may have limitations due to the nature of influenza viruses, which have an envelope. This means it may not be suitable as the reference sample for conducting an influenza-WBE study, despite successful use in other studies globally (26, 51). The direct consequence is the difficulty of determining how directly wastewater concentrations reflect the number of infected individuals (28). Wastewater-based methods can provide insight into the circulation of respiratory viruses within a specific community without testing numerous individuals. This is because a single wastewater sample represents the entire community’s contribution. The results from wastewater testing can be obtained within 24 h of sample collection, providing real-time information that can be used to inform public health responses, clinical decision-making, and individual behavior modifications.

This study estimates the risk factors associated with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in TB patients with ILI.MethodsA cohort of tuberculosis (TB) patients who were admitted to and enrolled in a TB Directly Observed Therapy Program (DOTs) in tertiary care hospitals of Lahore (Mayo Hospital and Infectious Disease Hospital) were followed for 12 weeks. At the start of study period, to record influenza-like illness (ILI), a symptom card was provided to all the participants. Every participant was contacted once a week, in person. When the symptoms were reported by the participant, a throat swab was taken for the detection of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. A nested case control study was conducted and TB patients with ILI diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 by conventional RT-PCR were selected as cases, while those who tested negative by conventional RT-PCR were enrolled as controls. All cases and controls in the study were interviewed face-to-face in the local language. Epidemiological data about potential risk factors were collected on a predesigned questionnaire. Logistic analysis was conducted to identify associated risk factors in TB patients with ILI.ResultsFrom the main cohort of TB patients (n = 152) who were followed during the study period, 59 (39%) developed ILI symptoms; of them, 39 tested positive for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, while 20 were detected negative for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. In univariable analysis, four factors were identified as risk factors (p < 0.05). The final multivariable model identified one risk factor (sharing of towels, P = 0.008)) and one protective factor (wearing a face mask, p = < 0.001)) for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection.ConclusionThe current study identified the risk factors of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection among TB patients with ILI. Peer Review reports IntroductionInfluenza and other respiratory viruses pose a threat to the health of the entire world’s population as they are a major cause of disease and mortality each year [1]. The influenza viruses (A and B) are among the major pathogens causing recurrent human epidemics. Influenza A has a greater impact on public health than influenza B due to its rapid evolution and wide range of hosts [2, 3]. According to the data from the Global Burden of Disease study, the mortality rate from lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza in the WHO Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region reached 0.9 per 100,000 population, with hospitalization rates ranging from 100 to 299 per 100,000 population [4].Pakistan is the world’s sixth-most populous country, with 40% of its population living in cities with limited healthcare facilities, making it vulnerable to an influenza outbreak [5].Documented influenza risk factors include (i) individual demographic characteristics such as age (younger people have a higher risk of infection, while older people have a higher risk of complications and mortality), immunodeficiency, pregnancy, respiratory diseases and chronic underlying medical conditions (ii) individual household characteristics such as living with children; and (iii) individual profession such as having contacts with children or infected people [6,7,8]. Co-morbidity with respiratory viruses including influenza A, cause varying degree of morbidity especially in TB patients compared to general population [9]. In particular, influenza can weaken innate immune responses to secondary bacterial infections by impairing the T cell immunity [10]. Increased mortality has been seen in TB patients following influenza infections [11]. Individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are at a higher risk of being infected with the influenza virus which may lead to chronic lung disease, immunosuppression and even death. A better understanding of the co-infection of influenza and TB is crucial for policymakers to prioritize the target population for influenza vaccination [12].Thus, interventional prevention against influenza such as vaccination according to the recommendations by World Health Organization (WHO), could help to reduce influenza incidence, hospitalization and case fatality rates [13]. Personal protective measures, on the other hand, such as wearing a face mask, proper hand washing and cleanliness, and some other physical interventions, have shown to be beneficial in preventing disease transmission [14]. To properly target specific interventions, including PPE and vaccination, this study focused on identifying risk factors in TB patients with ILI. As only influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 was detected among patients with ILI, the necessity to determine the specific type of influenza virus associated with these risk factors before implementing interventions becomes crucial.Our study seeks to bridge a critical gap in existing research by specifically investigating the risk factors associated with influenza among tuberculosis (TB) patients. While numerous studies have extensively explored risk factors for influenza in the general population, there remains an evident absence of comprehensive research focusing on TB patients. The current study aims to provide precise and detailed knowledge designed for TB patients, thereby advancing scientific understanding and informing targeted interventions for this neglected group. Therefore, current study identified the risk factors associated with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in TB patients with ILI who were admitted to and enrolled in a TB Directly Observed Therapy Program (DOTs) in tertiary care hospitals of Lahore.MethodsStudy designA nested case-control study was conducted among Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 positive TB cases with ILI and influenza A negative (H1N1)pdm09 TB controls with ILI.Study populationA cohort of TB patients who were admitted to and enrolled in a TB Directly Observed Therapy Program (DOTs) in (Mayo Hospital and Infectious Disease Hospital) were followed for 12 weeks. TB patients who developed ILI and tested positive for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 by conventional RT-PCR were chosen as cases, while those who tested negative by conventional RT-PCR were chosen as controls. Participants who refused to participate in this study were excluded. Mayo Hospital is one of the oldest and biggest hospitals in Lahore, Punjab. Infectious Disease hospital is specific for infectious diseases in which patients need isolation and specific treatments i.e. Rabies, TB. Mayo Hospital is a general hospital that deals with all kinds of diseases. Mayo and Infectious Disease hospitals were chosen due to their high admission rates for TB patients and accessibility, aiding data collection.Study procedureThe data was gathered using a structured questionnaire. All participants who voluntarily agreed to participate in the nested case-control study were given a consent form in local language (Urdu). The sample size was determined based on a previously conducted cohort study, which initially included 152 TB patients as the main cohort [12]. Among these patients, 59 showed ILI symptoms. From those TB patients with ILI, 39 who tested positive for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were selected as cases, while the remaining 20 TB patients with ILI, but testing negative for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, were chosen as controls. All TB patients were followed for a period of 12 weeks regardless of the influenza season. At the start of study period, to record influenza-like illness (ILI), a symptom card was provided to all the participants. Every participant was contacted once a week, in person. When the ILI symptoms were reported, a throat swab was taken for the detection of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (Fig. 1). All cases and controls in the study were interviewed face-to-face in the local language (Urdu). All information about various risk factors (marital status, education, family type, public transportation use, smoking history, respiratory allergy, ventilation system, etc.) was collected on a predesigned questionnaire [15].Fig. 1Flow chart of enrolled participantsFull size imageLaboratory procedureAn oropharyngeal swab was collected by a trained healthcare professional registered with the Pakistan Nursing Council within three days of the onset of symptoms. The sample was placed in a cryovial tube with 2–3 mL of viral transport media right away. All specimens were transported at 4 °C to the Disease Surveillance Laboratory, Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. All samples were handled in a biosafety level 2 cabinets (BSL-2). The TRIzol Reagent ® was used to extract viral RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions [16]. The RNA was either used immediately or stored at -80 °C for future use. Conventional RT-PCR was carried out on a 96-well (Applied Biosystems™ Veriti™ Thermal Cycler) machine using a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit following WHO instructions [17]. The reverse transcriptase step was performed at 50 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C (for M gene)/57°C (for HA gene) for 30 s, 72 °C for 20 s), 72 °C for 7 min, and held at 4 °C using the specific primers [17, 18] (Table 1). To detect the amplified product of RT-PCR, a 2% agarose gel was prepared. A gel documentation system was used to take a digital image of the gel (Supplementary Fig. 1).Table 1 Primers [for M and (H1N1)pdm09] used in the studyFull size tableStatistical analysisThe datasets were entered into the EpiData software (version 3.1, Odense, Denmark), verified for errors and inconsistencies by randomly comparing digital data to paper files, and then exported to Excel (version 2013, Microsoft Office, USA) for further processing. For all statistical analyses, R software (version 4.2.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used. Frequencies and proportions were used to quantify categorical variables. The symptom severity score was calculated using the subjective self-rating of eight symptoms, including a, cough, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, fever, sneezing, headache, and muscle aches. Each symptom was scored on an ordinal scale, with responses ranging from absent (0) to mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) [19]. The association of independent risk factors with the desired outcome i.e. influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 positive and negative in TB patients with ILI was tested using univariable logistic regression analysis. Variables that fulfilled the selection criteria (i.e., p ≤ 0.25) were eligible for inclusion in multivariable logistic regression analysis [20]. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using epiR package (version 2-0-60). Model fitness was determined using the likelihood ratio test and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).ResultsFrom the main cohort of TB patients (n = 152) who were followed during the study period, 59 (39%) developed ILI symptoms; of them, 39 tested positive for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, while 20 were detected negative for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. Among TB patients with ILI, the ratio of males and females was almost equal. The majority was married and had a nuclear family. Details of demographical characteristics are described in (Table 2).Table 2 Socio-demographic characteristics of TB Patients with ILIFull size tableILI was found in 39% (59/152) of the TB main cohort (95% CI: 31.44–46.75) of all enrolled participants (n = 152). About 66% (39/59) of the TB patients with ILI (95% CI: 53.37–76.86) tested positive for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, while 34% (20/59) of the cases tested negative for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among 59 TB patients with ILIFull size imageMale TB patients with ILI were more likely to be infected with influenza A (H1N1), with ages ranging from 18 to 30 years (43.5%, 10/23) and 31 to 43 years (43.5%, 10/23) respectively (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Distribution of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 positive and Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 negative according to age and gender of TB patients with ILIFull size imageClinical characteristicsAmong 59 TB patients with ILI, fatigue (95%) and sore throat (93%) were reported as the most common symptoms.. Muscle aches or body pain (86%), cough (80%), and fever (76%) were the other most common symptoms reported by the ILI group. Feeling feverish (58%), having a runny nose (58%), having a headache (42%), and sneezing (37%), were less frequently reported symptoms by the TB patients with ILI. shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4Distribution of clinical symptoms in ILI, Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 positive cases and Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 negative control groupFull size imageMost of the Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 negative TB patients with ILI had mild symptoms such as sore throat, coughing, muscle or body aches, fever and fatigue (Table 3).Table 3 Symptoms severity score among TB Patients with ILIFull size tableThe univariable analysis demonstrated three independent risk factors and one protective factor for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 with p value ≤ 0.25 (selection criteria for building a multivariable model). The use of public transport (p = 0.002), sharing towels (p = 0.02), and a history of smoking (p = 0.002) showed strong positive associations with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection. Wearing a face mask (p = < 0.001) was identified as a protective factors that showed a strong positive association with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection prevention. (Table 4).Table 4 Univariable analysis of potential risk factors associated with Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 with p value ≤ 0.25 among TB patients with ILIFull size tableThe final model detected one risk factor (sharing of towels, p = 0.008) and one protective factor (wearing a face mask, p = < 0.001) for Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, that was best fitted to the model (Table 5).Table 5 Multivariable analysis of potential risk factors associated with Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 with p value ≤ 0.05 among TB patients with ILIFull size tableDiscussionIndividuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are at higher risk for severe influenza virus infections and co-morbidity with respiratory viruses including influenza A, cause varying degree of morbidity especially in TB patients compared to general population [9, 21]. The identification and reduction of risk factors is most important in primary interventions for health promotion and maintenance [22]. To properly target specific interventions, including PPE and vaccination, the study focused on identifying risk factors associated with influenza positivity in TB patients with ILI. As only influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 was detected among TB patients with ILI, the necessity to determine the specific type of influenza virus associated with these risk factors before implementing interventions becomes crucial. Therefore, this study estimates the risk factors associated with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection in tuberculosis patients. Univariable analysis indicated that individuals who used public transport had a 16 times higher risk of getting influenza infection compared to those who used their own transport. There is a possibility that transmission occurred among passengers due to their close proximity with an infected individual. The duration and frequency of travel may have increased the chances of flu transmission [23, 24]. Various earlier studies have demonstrated that using public transport increases the risk of viral transmission due to the correlation between recent use of public transport and the onset of influenza symptoms [15, 25]. Smoking was also found to be a risk factor in the current study. The results showed that smokers were 8.55 times more likely to be infected as compared to non-smokers. Previously, it was estimated that smokers werefive times more likely than non-smokers to develop laboratory-confirmed influenza [26]. Smoking increases the risk of respiratory diseases [27, 28]. It is also a well-identified risk factor for the development and progression of infectious diseases like influenza viruses [26, 29]. Smoking has been demonstrated to inhibit the response of lung T cells to influenza viruses, which increases susceptibility to infection [30]. Smoking increases the risk of infection and worsening of the disease (including increased mortality and duration of the disease), which is caused by exacerbating innate and adaptive inflammatory responses [28]. Another significant factor reported in current study was towel sharing (OR = 3.88), which was linked to the development of influenza. When towels and handkerchiefs are used to dry or wipe the face and hands, viruses can be transmitted from contaminated surfaces, increasing the risk of influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. According to previous studies, sharing towels is a risk factor for outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases [31, 32].In this study, wearing a face mask was found to be a significant protective factor against transmission of influenza. The current findings have been supported by various earlier studies [33,34,35]. The use of masks not only protects healthy people, but also decreases the transmission during infectiousness period of asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers, reduction in the number and efficacy of transmission sources within the population. Second, it is expected that wearing a mask will influence behavior. Wearing a mask can increase awareness of the risk of infection as well as the importance of further preventive behaviors such as frequent hand washing, avoiding physical contact, and avoiding crowded public places. Finally, wearing a mask is the most effective way to prevent airborne transmission, which can result in most serious cases of influenza [36]. In this study, fatigue, cough, muscle aches and fever were the most common reported symptoms. Similarly, these symptoms have also reported in earlier studies of laboratory confirmed influenza cases [19, 20]. This study focused solely on influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 risk factors and did not further study any other respiratory pathogens. The identification of risk factors will guide to design interventions to reduce the burden of influenza co-infection among TB patients. Our study findings are also valuable for healthcare officials and policymakers/decision makers who are involved in influenza prevention and control programs. This study was part of a previous cohort study; thus, the sample size was not large enough, and the presence of a zero-cell value in 2 × 2 contingency tables, as a result, many factors were not studied.ConclusionThe current study identified the risk factors of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection among tuberculosis patients. Behavioral factors are associated with influenza transmission as well play a role in influenza prevention. Human behavior may contribute to the breakdown of the chain of infection. Modification of behavioral factors could lower the risk of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection and can prevent the outbreaks among TB patients. Further study should be conducted for the more comprehensive picture.

In part, this apparent increase simply reflects improved diagnostic techniques, but an actual increase appears to have also occurred. Depending on the virulence of the organism, as well as the age and comorbidities of the patient, viral pneumonia can vary from a mild, self-limited illness to a life-threatening disease. Bilateral interstitial infiltrates in a 31-year-old patient with influenza pneumonia. View Media Gallery Signs and symptoms The common constitutional symptoms of viral pneumonia are as follows: Fever Chills Nonproductive cough Rhinitis Myalgias Headaches Fatigue During physical examination, the patient may also display the following: Tachypnea and/or dyspnea Tachycardia or bradycardia Wheezing Rhonchi Rales Sternal or intercostal retractions Dullness to percussion Decreased breath sounds Pleurisy Pleural friction rub Cyanosis Rash Acute respiratory distress Influenza pneumonia The influenza viruses are the most common viral cause of pneumonia. Primary influenza pneumonia manifests with persistent symptoms of cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia, and malaise for more than three to five days. The symptoms may worsen with time, and new respiratory signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and cyanosis, appear. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children and the second most common viral cause of pneumonia in adults. Patients with RSV pneumonia typically present with fever, nonproductive cough, otalgia, anorexia, and dyspnea. Wheezes, rales, and rhonchi are common physical findings. Parainfluenza virus pneumonia Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is second in importance only to RSV as a cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children and pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants younger than 6 months. PIV pneumonia and bronchiolitis are caused primarily by the PIV-3 strain. The signs and symptoms include fever, cough, coryza, dyspnea with rales, and wheezing. Covid-19 pneumonia At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus started as an emerging pathogen for humans and resulted in a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a positive-stranded RNA virus, similar to other coronaviruses. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms typical of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, including cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, and even conjunctivitis, have been reported. Further, gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also common with COVID-19. See Clinical Presentation for more detail. Diagnosis Laboratory studies Cytologic evaluation: Intranuclear inclusions often exist in cells infected with a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus. Cytoplasmic inclusions usually are present in cells infected with a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. Viral culture Rapid antigen detection Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay Serologies: Particularly useful for definitively confirming the diagnosis Radiography Chest radiography usually demonstrates bilateral lung involvement, but none of the viral etiologies of pneumonia result in pathognomonic findings with this modality Lung biopsy and histologic studies Infrequently, lung biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis in very ill patients, who often are immunocompromised. See Workup for more detail. Management All patients with viral pneumonia must receive supportive care with the following: Oxygen Rest Antipyretics Analgesics Nutrition Close observation Intravenous fluids Mechanical ventilation Specific treatments for the various types of viral pneumonia include the following: Influenza pneumonia: Amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride are approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza A virus infection. Their efficacy in patients with influenza viral pneumonia or severe influenza is unknown. RSV pneumonia: Ribavirin is the only effective antiviral agent available for the treatment of RSV pneumonia, [1] but there are conflicting data regarding its efficacy. PIV pneumonia: Treatment is mainly supportive, but aerosolized and oral ribavirin have been associated with reduction in PIV shedding and clinical improvement in immunocompromised patients. COVID-19 pneumonia: Oral antiviral Paxlovid (nirmatrelviritonavir) has been approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. An emergency use authorization remains in effect for use in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. [116, 117] See Treatment and Medication for more detail. For patient education resources, see the Lung Disease & Respiratory Health Center and the Cold and Flu Center. In addition, see the patient education articles Viral Pneumonia and Flu in Adults. Next: Background Viruses account for the largest proportion of childhood pneumonia. Viral pneumonia decreases in frequency in healthy young and middle-aged adults, but it then increases substantially among the elderly. Studies on community-acquired pneumonias consistently demonstrate viruses to be the second most common etiologic cause (behind Streptococcus pneumoniae), ranging from 13-50% of diagnosed cases. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] The reported incidence of viral pneumonia has increased during the past decade. In part, this apparent increase simply reflects improved diagnostic techniques, but an actual increase has also appeared to occur. This observation is explained by the growing population of patients who are immunocompromised. [8] (See Epidemiology.) Depending on the virulence of the organism as well as the age and comorbidities of the patient, viral pneumonia can vary from a mild and self-limited illness to a life-threatening disease. Especially in immunocompromised patients, viral pneumonia may result in respiratory failure, severe hypoxemia, and other pulmonary pathology. (See Prognosis.) The four most frequent etiologies of viral pneumonia in children and immunocompetent adults are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus (PIV). Influenza virus types A and B are responsible for more than half of all community-acquired viral pneumonia cases, particularly during influenza outbreaks. (See Etiology.) The image below depicts right-middle-lobe infiltrate in a two-month-old boy with pneumonia due to RSV Right-middle-lobe infiltrate in a 2-month-old boy with pneumonia due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). View Media Gallery The relative importance of additional viruses (eg, parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus) will likely increase as diagnostic tests such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), become more widely available. [9] (See Workup.) Outbreaks of adenovirus of various serotypes frequently occur in military recruits. Adenovirus type 14 (Ad 14), a new variant in the United States, has been documented to cause severe and sometimes fatal acute respiratory illness in patients of all ages but especially the young, the old, patients with underlying comorbid conditions, and those who are immunocompromised. Viral pneumonia is a subset of the pneumonitides, which were at one time called atypical pneumonias. In the past, all pneumonias were labeled atypical if a bacterial pathogen could not be identified with Gram staining and if the pneumonia did not respond to antibiotics. Many viral pneumonias have overlapping clinical presentations with each other and with bacterial pneumonia—and may occur together with bacterial pneumonia—making diagnosis on purely clinical grounds difficult or impossible. [2] A number of rapid tests to determine viral etiologies have now been developed, and their use in the emergency department (ED) has allowed bedside diagnosis of the etiology of viral pneumonia. An accurate and early etiologic diagnosis is important because specific therapies are used against certain viruses (see Treatment). Even with currently available tests, however, in some series a causative microorganism could not be identified in 50-80% of symptomatic patients. Agents used to treat cases of viral pneumonia include acyclovir, ganciclovir, and immunoglobulin. (See Medication.) For more information, see Medscape’s Pneumonia Resource Center and Influenza Resource Center. Previous Next: Pathophysiology A full understanding of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of viral diseases does not presently exist. After contamination, most respiratory viruses tend to multiply in the epithelium of the upper airway and secondarily infect the lung by means of airway secretions or hematogenous spread. Severe pneumonias may result in extensive consolidation of the lungs with varying degrees of hemorrhage, with some patients developing bloody pleural effusions and diffuse alveolar damage. [10] The mechanism of damage to tissues depends on the virus involved. Some viruses are mainly cytopathic, directly affecting the pneumocytes or the bronchial cells. With others, overexuberant inflammation from the immune response is the mainstay of the pathogenic process. Immune responses can be categorized according to patterns of cytokine production. Type 1 cytokines promote cell-mediated immunity, while type 2 cytokines mediate allergic responses. Children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) who develop acute bronchiolitis, rather than mild upper respiratory infection symptoms, have impaired type 1 immunity or augmented type 2 immunity. [11] In addition to humoral responses, cell-mediated immunity appears to be important for recovery from certain respiratory viral infections. [12] Impaired type 1 response may explain why immunocompromised patients have more severe viral pneumonias. Respiratory viruses damage the respiratory tract and stimulate the host to release multiple humoral factors, including histamine, leukotriene C4, and virus-specific IgE in RSV infection and bradykinin, interleukin (IL)–1, IL-6, and IL-8 in rhinovirus infections. RSV infections can also alter bacterial colonization patterns, increase bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelium, reduce mucociliary clearance, and alter bacterial phagocytosis by host cells. Influenza virus Infection by influenza virus leads to cell death, especially in the upper airway. When direct viral infection of lung parenchyma occurs, hemorrhage is seen along with a relative lack of inflammatory cells. Mucociliary clearance is impaired, and bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelium occurs. Infection with the influenza virus impairs T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophage function, which leads to impairment of host defenses and may foster bacterial infection of normally sterile areas, including the lower respiratory tract. This impairment of host defenses may explain why as many as 53% of outpatients with bacterial pneumonia have a concurrent viral infection. Adenoviruses Little is known regarding mechanisms of pathogenicity of adenoviruses. Studies in children have identified increased production of cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Age, health of the patient, and other unknown host factors are believed to play key roles. COVID-19 The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 specifically recognizes the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It is optimized for binding to the human receptor ACE2. Upon binding, host serine protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the S protein and results in the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. However, the lungs seem to be particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 because of their large surface area and because alveolar epithelial type 2 cells seemingly act as a reservoir for virus replication. Direct injury to the lung tissue from a viral infection–mediated local inflammatory response is one of the proposed mechanisms behind the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. [118] Viral pneumonia in elderly persons Elderly persons are at increased risk of infection and complications in viral pneumonia because of comorbidities. Waning cellular, humoral, and innate immune functioning may impair viral clearance, which allows spread of the virus to the lower respiratory tract resulting in increased inflammation. Elderly persons also have decreased respiratory muscle strength and impaired protection of the respiratory tract from mucus. [13] Viral transmission The mechanism of viral transmission varies with the type of virus. Routes include large-droplet spread over short distances (< 1 m), hand contact with contaminated skin and fomites and subsequent inoculation onto the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva (eg, rhinovirus, RSV), and small-particle aerosol spread (eg, influenza, adenovirus). Some viruses are extremely fastidious, whereas others have the capability of surviving on environmental surfaces for as long as 7 hours, on gloves for 2 hours, and on hands for 30 minutes. Transmission routes for selected viral pneumonias are as follows: Environmental factors (adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus) Direct contact with contaminated objects (VZV) Transplantation of contaminated organs (cytomegalovirus [CMV]) or blood products (CMV) Lower-respiratory aspiration of virus asymptomatically shed in the saliva (CMV, herpes simplex virus [HSV]) Reactivation of a latent infection (HSV, CMV) Hematogenous spread (CMV) Spread by healthcare personnel (SARS, measles, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, RSV). Hantavirus transmission is thought to occur primarily through inhalation of infected excreta from diseased rodents. The virus is also present in rodent saliva, so transmission can also occur from bites. A number of viruses, including adenoviruses, influenza virus, measles virus, PIV, RSV, rhinoviruses, and VZV, are easily transmitted during hospital stays and cause nosocomial pneumonia. Adenoviruses, influenza viruses, PIV, and RSV account for 70% of nosocomial pneumonias due to viruses. Pulmonary host defense The pulmonary host defense is complex and includes the following components: Mechanical barriers Humoral immunity Phagocytic cells Cell-mediated immunity Mechanical barriers are hairs from the nostrils that filter particles larger than 10 microns, mucociliary clearance, and sharp-angle branching of the central airways that helps the 5- to 10-micron particles to become impacted in the mucosa. Humoral immunity is represented by mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA), alveolar immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) present in transudates from the blood. Phagocytic cells consist of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells; alveolar, interstitial, and intravascular macrophages; and respiratory dendritic cells. Alveolar macrophages provide the first defense involved in internalizing and degrading the viral pathogens. They act as antigen-presenting and opsonin-producing cells. Respiratory dendritic cells undergo maturation, activation, and early migration into the regional lymph nodes after the viral exposure. They act as antigen-presenting cells and are involved in the activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells. Cell-mediated immunity is the most important defense mechanism against the intracellular viral pathogens. This immunity is involved in antibody production, cytotoxic activity, and cytokine production. CD8+ memory or effector T cells tend to dominate the lymphocyte component of the virus-induced inflammatory component. Experimental models demonstrated that 30-90% of CD8+ T cells recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are virus specific at the peak of the primary response. Studies in transgenic mice infected with influenza viruses documented that the CD8+ T cells are not recruited in the lung during the viral infection. They are resting memory cells formed after a previous encounter with the antigen, or they are acutely activated T cells after a nonrespiratory infection that undergo early migration in the lung and that are maintained there by specific ligands. A substantial number of peripheral CD8+ memory T cells reside in the lung after a viral infection. A secondary infection induces extensive renewal of CD8+ T cells in both lymphoid nodes and lungs. This replacement takes place in the absence of substantial inflammation or a substantial effector-cell population in the lungs. Respiratory infection allows numerous T cells to enter the airways and may permanently alter the permeability of the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes to lymphocytes. Previous Next: Etiology Both DNA and RNA viruses are involved in the etiology of viral pneumonia. Some are well-known lung pathogens that produce common clinical and radiologic manifestations. Others are rarely involved as lung pathogens. Etiologic viruses include various families, as follows: Adenoviridae ( adenoviruses) Coronaviridae (coronaviruses) - SARS, MERS, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [14] Bunyaviridae (arboviruses) - Hantavirus Orthomyxoviridae (orthomyxoviruses) - Influenza virus Papovaviridae (polyomavirus) - JC virus, BK virus Paramyxoviridae (paramyxoviruses) - Parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), measles virus Picornaviridae (picornaviruses) - Enteroviruses, coxsackievirus, echovirus, enterovirus 71, rhinovirus Reoviridae ( rotavirus) Retroviridae (retroviruses) - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Most of the members of Herpesviridae family are documented lung pathogens in hosts with compromised cell immunity and include the following: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), also called human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) and human herpesvirus 2 (HHV-2), respectively Herpesvirus 6, herpesvirus 7, and herpesvirus 8 Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus may cause community-acquired viral pneumonia. Influenza virus The influenza viruses are enveloped, single-stranded, RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae and are the most common viral cause of pneumonia. Three serotypes of influenza virus exist: A, B, and C. Influenza type A can alter surface antigens and infect livestock. This characteristic may account for its ability to create a reservoir for infection and cause epidemics in humans. The virus is spread by means of small-particle aerosol and targets the columnar epithelial cells along the entire respiratory tract. Influenza type B causes illness that usually is seen in relatively closed populations such as boarding schools. Influenza type C is less common and occurs as sporadic cases. Influenza type A is usually the most virulent pathogen. The influenza virus has two envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), which are important for a number of reasons. The hemagglutinin initiates infectivity by binding to cellular sialic acid residues, whereas the N protein cleaves newly synthesized virus from sialic acid on cell surfaces, thus allowing spread of the virus to other cells. The influenza virus maintains its infectivity by undergoing antigenic drift (small number of amino acid substitutions) and shift (large number of amino acid substitutions) due to changes in the protein structure of the surface protein, hemagglutinin. Epidemics occur when a viral drift occurs, and pandemics are seen with viral shift (two influenza A viruses exchange H or N genes during infection of the same hosts) because most people have no prior immunity to the virus. Two influenza types have emerged of particular importance: H5N1 avian influenza strain and the novel H1N1 swine influenza strain. Respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infection among infants and children and the second most common viral cause of pneumonia in adults. It is a medium-sized virus of the Paramyxoviridae family that consists of only 1 serotype. Structurally, RSV has 10 unique viral polypeptides, 4 of which are associated with virus envelope, and 2 of these (F and G) are important for infectivity and pathogenicity. Classic RSV infection causes syncytia formation in cell culture, giving the virus its name. RSV is highly contagious, spreading via droplet and fomite exposure. Most children are infected before age 5 years—the infection rate during an epidemic approaches 100% in certain settings such as daycare centers—but the resulting immunity is incomplete. Reinfection in older children and young adults is common but mild. However, the likelihood of more severe disease and pneumonia increases with advancing age. Adenoviruses Adenoviruses are enveloped DNA viruses that cause a wide spectrum of clinical illnesses depending on the serotype of the infecting agent. These include asymptomatic illness, conjunctivitis, febrile upper respiratory disease, pneumonia, gastrointestinal illness, hemorrhagic cystitis, rash, and neurologic disease. Pneumonia is less common in adults outside of military recruit camps and similar facilities, but fulminant disease has been described in infants and in the immunocompromised population and can occur in apparently healthy hosts. [15] Although 52 serotypes exist, classified into 7 subgroups or species (A-G), pulmonary disease is predominantly caused by serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, and 21. Type 7 viruses can cause bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Types 4 and 7 viruses are responsible for outbreaks of respiratory disease in military recruits. Adenovirus serotype 14 (subgroup B) is a more virulent strain that has been reported to cause severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. Emergence of this strain was reported in 2005 among civilian and military populations, with outbreaks occurring subsequently at military training centers throughout the United States. In 2007, adenovirus serotype 14 caused a large, sustained outbreak of febrile respiratory illness among military trainees in Texas and, more recently, in a residential care facility in Washington State. [16, 17, 18] In a community outbreak in Oregon, the median age was 52 years, and 76% required hospitalization, 47% required critical care, 24% required vasopressors, and 18% died. The majority of these patients were otherwise immunocompetent adults. [19] Spread of adenovirus is by respiratory secretions, infectious aerosols, feces, and fomites. Neonates may acquire infection from exposure to cervical secretions at birth. Contaminated environmental surfaces can harbor virus capable of causing infection for weeks. The virus is resistant to lipid disinfectants but is inactivated by heat, formaldehyde, and bleach. Adenoviruses are extremely contagious. Studies of new military recruits have shown seroconversion rates of 34-97% over a 6-week period. [16] The majority of children have serologic evidence of prior adenovirus infection by the age of 10. Parainfluenza virus Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common virus that infects most persons during childhood. PIV is second in importance to only RSV in causing lower respiratory tract disease in children and pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants younger than six months. Transmission is through direct person-to-person contact or large-droplet spread. PIV is characterized by nucleocapsids, which develop in the cytoplasm of infected cells, with hemagglutinin present in the virion envelope. There are four subtypes of PIV, based on antigenic characteristics. PIV type 3 is endemic year-round, while types 1 and 2 peak during the fall season. Immunity is short term, and recurrent upper or lower respiratory tract infections occur throughout life. The infections vary from a mild illness to life-threatening croup, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. Infection in immunocompromised hosts can result in life-threatening pneumonia with lung injury and respiratory failure. In one study, 44% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients with PIV progressed to develop pneumonia, of which 37% died. [20] Rhinovirus Some authors report that rhinovirus accounts for up to 30% of cases of all virus-related pneumonia. Clinical studies show that rhinovirus is the second most frequently recognized agent associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children. Rhinovirus infection is linked to asthma hospitalizations in both adults and children. A study of 211 French children with rhinovirus infection revealed bronchiolitis or bronchitis in 25.6% and pneumonia in 6.2%, after cases of dual bacterial or viral infections were eliminated. A study from the Netherlands demonstrated that rhinoviruses cause 32% of all lower respiratory tract infections with an identified pathogen in the elderly (> 60 y) symptomatic population. Rhinoviruses were identified more frequently than coronaviruses (17%) or influenza viruses (7%). Human metapneumovirus Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a relatively newly discovered respiratory pathogen, initially described in the Netherlands in 2001. [21] hMPV is in the Paramyxoviridae family (like RSV and PIV) and is a pleomorphic-shaped virus surrounded by surface protein projections. This virus is a ubiquitous organism, and most surveys indicate that by age five years, almost all children have been exposed to it. However, reinfection occurs throughout life, including in adults. This virus is spread via droplet and fomite exposure. As a human pathogen, hMPV may have been underestimated. In children and infants, hMPV was reported to be a notable cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis (59%), croup (18%), asthma (14%), and pneumonia (8%). As with other viruses, the severity of infection increases with older age and with comorbid (cardiopulmonary disease) or immunosuppressive conditions. The most common diagnoses associated with adult hospitalizations with hMPV infection are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, bronchitis, and pneumonia. [22] In immunocompromised hosts (eg, hematologic malignancies), severe pneumonitis requiring intensive care or resulting in death has been reported. [23, 24] Coronavirus Coronaviruses are from the family Coronaviridae and are single-stranded RNA viruses, the surface of which is covered by crownlike projections, giving the virus its name. This virus is spread via droplet and fomite exposure. Seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have now been identified: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-COV (which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS-COV (Middle East respiratory syndrome), and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Long known to cause upper respiratory infections, coronaviruses were not felt to significantly cause pneumonia until relatively recently. All corona viruses have worldwide distribution, causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children. Typically, HCoV infection follows a seasonal pattern similar to that of influenza, although Hong Kong researchers found that HCoV-NL63 infections mainly occurred in early summer and autumn. [25] Severe acute respiratory syndrome The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003 brought the ability of coronaviruses to cause life-threatening pneumonia to worldwide attention. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was due to a novel coronavirus (CoV) that crossed the species barrier through close contact between humans and infected animals. Viral isolation and genomic sequencing have revealed that the SARS virus originated in the masked palm civet cat (Paguma larvata), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and possibly the Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata), with subsequent interspecies jumping, during which a partial loss of genome probably led to more efficient human-to-human transmission. Horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) have also been found to harbor SARS-like coronaviruses (more distantly related to SARS-CoV than that of the palm civets), raising the possibility of bats being a reservoir for future SARS infections. SARS was a particularly challenging disease because its long incubation period allowed seemingly healthy travelers who were infected with the virus to spread it. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) quickly spread from China to the rest of the world over a period of 1 year, affecting more than 8000 patients in 29 countries and resulting in 774 deaths. Global transmission of SARS was halted in June 2003 after the World Health Organization instituted traditional public health measures, including finding and isolating case-patients, quarantining contacts, and using enhanced infection control. [31] No cases of SARS have been reported since 2004. COVID-19 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified in 2019 amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China has resulted in COVID-19 global pandemic. [14] Although the US COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) ended in 2023, COVID-19 continues to pose a health risk. The CDC continues to monitor COVID-19 emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths. [119] The roots of the current pandemic have been traced back to a wild live animal market in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan. The virus was initially isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage of three patients who were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan. All three patients reported direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood market. The virus showed 85% shared identity with the bat SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV), raising the possibility of animal-to-human transmission. [120] From there, ongoing human-to-human transmission, occurring via respiratory droplets, spread the virus across the globe, with cases being reported from every continent except Antarctica. See Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Varicella-zoster virus Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious herpes virus that is spread by the respiratory route or direct contact with skin lesions. Primary infection manifests as chickenpox. The reactivation results in zoster (shingles). Pneumonia is a significant and life-threatening complication in otherwise healthy adults (including pregnant women) and immunocompromised hosts. This pneumonia is rare in otherwise healthy children but does occur in immunocompromised children. Complications include secondary bacterial infections, encephalitis, hepatitis, and, with concomitant aspirin use, Reye syndrome. VZV pneumonia also tends be more severe in individuals who smoke. Measles virus Measles virus is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and the genus Morbillivirus. It is a single-stranded RNA virus contained within a nucleocapsid and surrounded by an envelope. Measles is a respiratory tract virus that causes a febrile illness with rash in children. Mild pneumonia often occurs but is usually of no consequence in healthy adults. Measles may result in severe lower respiratory tract infection and high morbidity in hosts who are immunocompromised and malnourished. This virus is highly contagious and is transmitted from person to person by droplets. The incubation period is 10-14 days and peaks in late winter and early spring. Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpesvirus that is a common cause of infections, usually asymptomatic, in the general population. In hosts who are immunocompetent, acute CMV infection causes a mononucleosis-like syndrome. Transmission is primarily through body fluid contact. The virus has been found in the cervix and in human milk, semen, and blood products. The prevalence of antibodies to CMV in adults ranges from 40-100%, with higher rates in lower socioeconomic areas. Reactivation of latent infection is almost universal in transplant recipients and individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. CMV pneumonia may occur and is often fatal in immunocompromised individuals, primarily hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The severity of pneumonia is related to the intensity of immunosuppression. Additionally, CMV infection is itself immunosuppressive, causing further immunocompromise in these patients. In cancer patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplants, CMV pneumonia has a prevalence of 15% and a mortality rate of 85%, making it the most common cause of death in this population. Acute graft-versus-host disease is the major risk factor for CMV pneumonia in these patients. Interestingly, although CMV is a well-recognized pathogen in patients with AIDS (manifesting as retinitis, colitis, encephalitis, polyradiculitis, and/or cholangiopathy), clinically relevant pneumonia is very uncommon in this group, even if CMV is cultured from alveolar fluid and/or seen on lung histology. Herpes simplex virus Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare cause of lower respiratory tract infections and is seen primarily in severely immunocompromised patients, primarily HSCT and SOT recipients, patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or are neutropenic, or those who have congenital immunodeficiency. [26] HSV pneumonia develops either secondary to upper airway infection (because of direct extension of the virus from the upper to the lower respiratory tract) or following viremia secondary to dissemination of HSV from genital or oral lesions. Herpes simplex virus is spread by contact with active lesions or viral shed by asymptomatic excreters. While not a classic respiratory virus, herpes simplex virus can cause pneumonia in compromised hosts, with a mortality rate of 80%. Pneumonia may develop from primary infection or reactivation. Zoonotic viral pneumonias Zoonotic viral pneumonias include those caused by the hantavirus, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and H1N1 (swine) influenza. Hantavirus Hantavirus is a genus of enveloped RNA viruses in the family Bunyaviridae. The majority are transmitted by arthropod vectors. Hantaviruses, however, are harbored by rodents, with each viral species having one major rodent host species. Rodents, which are chronically infected, excrete hantaviruses from urine, saliva, and feces. Infection occurs after aerosols of infectious excreta are inhaled. The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is seen in the Americas and is an acute pneumonitis caused by the North American hantavirus, most notably the Sin Nombre Virus. [27, 28] Two other agents, isolated in other parts of North America, can also cause HPS. Hantaviruses originally were recognized in the four-corners region of the southwestern United States (New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado) in May 1993. The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was identified to be the reservoir. Cases of HPS have continued to be reported in the United States. As of July 2010, 545 cases of HPS had been reported in the United States from 32 states. [29] Avian influenza In Hong Kong in 1997, an influenza virus (H5N1 virus) previously known to infect only birds was found to infect humans. Manifestations included pneumonia, which in some cases led to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multisystem organ failure. Prior to the human outbreak, the H5N1 virus caused widespread deaths in chickens on three farms in Hong Kong. Epidemiologic investigations of this outbreak demonstrated that individuals in close contact with the index case or with exposure to poultry were at risk of being infected. Concern is growing that avian influenza, which is a subtype of influenza A, may result in a worldwide pandemic in the near future. The avian influenza virus A/H5N1 has several ominous characteristics, including increased virulence and human-to-human transmission in several cases, rather than bird-to-human transmission, as is usually necessary. The disease causes high mortality as a result of pneumonia and respiratory failure. The 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong was thought to be controlled by depopulating 1.5 million chickens in local farms and markets. However, human infections occurred in 2001 through 2003 in other parts of Asia, and the virus has been found in poultry and birds in Europe. The rising incidence and widespread reporting of disease from H5N1 influenza viruses can probably be attributed to the increasing spread of the virus from existing reservoirs in domestic waterfowl and live bird markets, leading to greater environmental contamination. As of January 2014, 650 cases of H5N1 human infections have been reported from 16 countries since 2003, with 386 deaths (59% mortality). [30] H1N1 (swine) influenza Initially reported as an outbreak in Mexico and subsequently the United States, infection from a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus rapidly spread to become a worldwide pandemic in 2009. The World Health Organization declared an end to the pandemic in August 2010. Virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome may play an important role in development of multiorgan failure and ensuing death in H1N1 infection. [32] For more information on H1N1 influenza, see H1N1 Influenza (Swine Flu). Rare causes of viral pneumonia include Epstein-Barr virus and rotavirus. Epstein-Barr virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is transmitted through infected saliva. Pneumonia as a complication of mononucleosis is very uncommon. The virus can cause pneumonia in the absence of mononucleosis. Lung involvement secondary to EBV infections is more often reported in immunocompromised people than in others. In 25% of pediatric patients with HIV infection, EBV can cause lesions related to lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia. [33] Rotavirus Although upper respiratory tract infection secondary to rotavirus is common, rotavirus pneumonia is rare. Just a few cases have been reported. Previous Next: Epidemiology Traditionally, viruses were felt to cause approximately 8% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia for which patients are hospitalized. More recent investigations have demonstrated viruses to play a larger role, causing 13-50% of pathogen-diagnosed community-acquired pneumonia cases as sole pathogens and 8-27% of cases as mixed bacteria-virus infections. [3, 4, 5, 34] Influenza virus types A and B account for more than 50% of all community-acquired viral pneumonias in adults. Various studies have reported differing frequencies of the other viruses causing community-acquired pneumonias, with RSV ranging from 1-4%, adenovirus 1-4%, PIV 2-3 %, hMPV 0-4%, and coronavirus 1-14% of pathogen-diagnosed pneumonia cases. [3, 4, 5, 34] The impact of influenza is high in elderly persons and greatest for those with chronic illnesses. It has been estimated that at least 63% of the 300,000 influenza-related hospitalizations and 85% of 36,000 influenza-related deaths occur in patients aged 65 years or older, despite the fact that this group accounts for only 10% of the population. [35] RSV is the most common etiology of viral pneumonia in infants and children. [36] In addition, RSV has become an increasingly important pathogen in the elderly population and is now the second most commonly identified cause of pneumonia in elderly persons. According to the CDC each year in the U.S., RSV leads to approximately 60,000-160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000-10,000 deaths among adults 65 years of age and older. In the United States from 1999 to 2018, the highest mean mortality rate per 100,000 population for RSV and influenza was among adults aged 65 years or older at 14.7 (95% CI, 13.8-15.5) for RSV and 20.5 (95% CI, 19.4-21.5) for influenza. [13] Some studies have suggested that RSV-related disease is as frequent as influenza in elderly persons. Approximately 10% of nursing home patients develop RSV infection annually, while 10% of these patients will develop pneumonia. An international study found adults with congestive heart failure (CHF) had 8 times the rate of RSV-associated hospitalization compared with adults without CHF. The adjusted RSV hospitalization rate was 26.7 (95% CI: 22.2, 31.8) per 10,000 population in adults with CHF versus 3.3 (95% CI: 3.3, 3.3) per 10,000 in adults without CHF. [37] For information regarding RSV hospitalizations, see the CDC RSV-NET interactive Dashboard. Parainfluenza infection is the second most common viral illness, after RSV, in infants. Adenovirus accounts for 10% of pneumonias in children. Disease from adenovirus can occur at any time of the year. Various adenovirus serotypes are responsible for essentially continuous epidemics of acute respiratory disease at military recruit training facilities in the United States and worldwide. During the prevaccination era, up to 20% of recruits had to be removed from duty due to illness. [38] Unfortunately, the vaccine against adenovirus is no longer available for administration to military personnel. As of June 30, 2024, confirmed COVID-19 infections numbered over 776 million individuals worldwide since the start of the pandemic in 2019. [121] The basic reproduction number (R0 /R naught) is an epidemiologic entity that helps predict the expected number of cases from exposure to a single case, assuming all the individuals in the given population are susceptible. The R0 of measles is 12-18, by far the highest known to humankind. The R0 of seasonal influenza is around 0.9-2.1. A wide range of R0 values have been calculated for COVID-19 (1.4-6.49) resulting in an average of 2.8-3.3. [122] As of 2023, the highest R0 for each of the five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern at the time of publication were Alpha (1.22), Beta (1.19), Gamma (1.21), Delta (1.38) and Omicron (1.90). [123] Viral pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts Although immunocompromised patients are at higher risk for viral pneumonia from CMV, VZV, HSV, measles, and adenoviruses, seasonal viruses (influenza, RSV, PIV) remain a major cause of pneumonia. HSCT and SOT recipients are particularly at risk for acquiring lower respiratory tract infection due to CMV and RSV. [39, 40] CMV pneumonia has been observed in 10-30% of patients with HSCT and 15-55% of heart-lung transplant recipients, making this virus the most common cause of viral pneumonia in the former patient group. [41] After CMV, the frequency of viruses isolated from HSCT patients vary, with influenza virus ranging from 14-52%, RSV 14-48%, adenovirus 2-21%, and PIV 11-49% of viral isolates. [42] Although HSV has been shown to cause pneumonia in this patient population, it is relatively rare when compared with the other viral pathogens, with one study showing HSV to cause 5% of nonbacterial pneumonias in HSCT recipients, compared with 46% for CMV. [43] Viral pneumonia in pregnancy Acute viral pneumonia is common and often underdiagnosed in pregnancy. Although the severity of bacterial pneumonia does not seem to be increased in pregnancy, viral pneumonia can have a serious clinical evolution. Among the viral pathogens, influenza virus, VZV, and measles virus are reported as etiologic agents in severe lower respiratory tract infection. The infection may result in acute respiratory decompensation, respiratory failure, and/or ARDS, which can lead to maternofetal hypoxia, preterm labor, multisystem organ failure, and even death. Pregnant women seem to be at increased risk for influenza pneumonia. VZV pneumonia is rare but potentially lethal, with mortality rates of 35-40% in pregnant women, compared with 10% in the general population. Measles virus can be a considerable cause of pneumonia in pregnant women. Further bacterial superinfection can complicate the clinical and radiologic picture. Despite reports of a high mortality rate during outbreaks of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, no cases of maternal fatalities secondary to this disorder have been reported to date. Sex differences in viral pneumonia Men who are infected develop viral pneumonia at a slightly higher rate than women. Pregnant women with viral pneumonia have a higher risk for severe disease than other females. Pregnant patients have a disproportionate risk of severe disease with 2009 H1N1 infection. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. [44] Age-related differences in viral pneumonia Most viruses that can cause pneumonia generally infect children and cause a mild illness. Healthy adults also develop mild disease. In contrast, elderly persons and persons who are immunosuppressed develop severe viral pneumonia, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. [13] The main exception to this was seen in the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, in which severe infection was more common in the population aged 5-59 years than in the elderly. This was thought to be from lack of exposure, and thus immunity, to the 1957 (and earlier) H1N1 influenza strain(s). [45] Previous Next: Mortality and Morbidity The US census for 2000-2001 listed pneumonia/influenza as the seventh leading cause of death (down from sixth) despite a 7.2% decrease in the mortality rate for these diseases during this period. Severe influenza seasons can result in more than 40,000 excess deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations. Patients aged 65 years or older are at particular risk for death from viral pneumonia as well as from influenza not complicated by pneumonia. Deaths in these patients account for 89% of all pneumonia and/or influenza deaths. Morbidity, especially in elderly persons, is also high. Up to 10-12% of patients older than 65 years required a higher level of assistance for activities of daily living after hospitalization for acute respiratory illnesses. In one nursing home outbreak, residents with acute influenza illness showed significant functional decline. [46] Pneumonia from adenovirus serotypes other than Ad 14 has a low fatality rate, and most serotypes have a low morbidity rate. COVID-19 As of June 30, 2024, the World Health Organization reported COVID-19 infections have resulted in over 7 million deaths. [121] Additionally, the World Health Organization estimates the full death toll associated directly or indirectly with the pandemic is approximately 15 million. In the United States, more than 1,190,000 deaths have occurred from COVID-19 as of June 30, 2024. [124] The pandemic caused approximately 375,000 deaths in the United States during 2020. The age-adjusted death rate increased by 15.9% in 2020, making it the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer. [125] During 2021, COVID-19 was associated with 416,893 deaths in the United States, and was again the third leading cause of death. [126] Approximately 75% of deaths in the United States from COVID-19 occurred in individuals aged 65 years and older. [124] Influenza virus Influenza virus represents a common cause of pneumonia in the adult population, affecting 4-8% of healthy adults. Rates have been 10-20% during outbreaks and as high as 50% during epidemics. Morbidity and mortality rates related to influenza pneumonia in both the general population and in selected groups (eg, patients with chronic diseases, the elderly) are substantial. The highest rates of hospitalization for influenza occur in preschool-aged children and in the elderly population. During outbreaks, the hospitalization rates are 27.9 cases per 10,000 persons younger than 5 years and 55 cases per 10,000 persons older than 65 years. Between 1972 and 1992, 426,000 deaths related to influenza pneumonia were reported in United States. Individuals 85 years or older were 16 times more likely than those aged 65-69 years to die from influenza. Also in contrast with seasonal influenza, mortality was higher in younger patients with H1N1 influenza, with 87% of deaths and 71% of severe pneumonia in the age group of 5-51 years. [45] The higher mortality in patients younger than 60 years may reflect this cohort’s lack of exposure to the 1957 (and earlier) H1N1 influenza strains. Exposure to those early strains may have conferred some immunity in the older population. Also of interest is a report that identified obesity as a possible risk factor for more severe disease/mortality. [47] As of February 2010, the CDC had estimated that 8,330 to 17,160 H1N1-related deaths occurred between April 2009 and January 16, 2010 in the United States, [48] and the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that, worldwide, at least 16,226 deaths have been directly attributable to H1N1. [49] The H5N1 avian influenza seems to be more virulent than seasonal influenza, with a 59% mortality rate in cases reported thus far. [30] The median time from disease onset to death is nine days. The majority of these patients had no underlying medical problems. Respiratory syncytial virus RSV pneumonia is responsible for an average of 80,000 pediatric hospitalizations and 500 deaths every year. The mortality rate depends on the patient's immunologic status. In healthy children, the reported mortality rate is 0.5-1.7% but is higher in immunosuppressed patients (< 80-100% in untreated HSCT recipients vs 22% in treated control subjects). In adults, RSV pneumonia is associated with a mortality rate ranging from 11-78%, depending on the severity of underlying immune suppression. In long-term care facilities, 5-27% of respiratory tract infections have been estimated to be caused by RSV, 10% of which will develop into pneumonia and 1-5% of which will be fatal. [50] In immunocompromised patients, particularly HSCT recipients, the mortality rate for RSV pneumonia is high, at 41%. [42] Adenovirus Adenovirus infection has been associated with low mortality in healthy adults, but death from a 2009 community outbreak of serotype 14 pneumonia was 18%. [19] In immunocompromised patients, adenovirus can be acquired not only by person-to-person transmission but also from reactivation, to produce a wide variety of syndromes, including gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis (in addition to pneumonia), with mortality rates ranging from 38-100% and with a cumulative mortality rate of 56% in HSCT patients. [42] Parainfluenza virus PIV pneumonia causes 250,000 emergency visits annually, resulting in 70,000 admissions. Fully 18% of hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections in the United States have this disease. Rates of PIV pneumonia are increased in immunocompromised pediatric groups, such as recipients of BMT, HSCT, lung transplantation, and solid-organ transplantation. PIV has been associated with 10% of acute respiratory illnesses in healthy adults and 10-50% in transplant recipients. In the latter group, the mortality rates range from 15-73%. [42] One study documented that 56% of PIV isolates were associated with upper respiratory symptoms in HSCT recipients but that 44% developed pneumonia, of whom 37% died. [20] Human metapneumovirus HMPV accounts for up to 10% of unexplained respiratory infections in children. Some authors report that HMPV can account for 30% of unidentified, suspected cases of viral pneumonia in transplant patients. The relatively recent recognition of hMPV in causing pneumonia and the difficulty in its diagnosis has precluded accurate estimates of mortality rates, but case reports of deaths exist, primarily in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or HSCT. [24, 51] Mortality rates in transplant recipients have ranged from 50% in lung transplant patients to 80% in HSCT recipients. [52] A 2009 hMPV outbreak at a psychiatric ward in Taiwan, all in immunocompetent patients, resulted in 1 (of 13 diagnosed patients) death from respiratory failure. [53] Varicella-zoster virus In the United States, varicella pneumonia occurs with a frequency of 0.32-1.36 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Among Americans hospitalized because of varicella, 1.0-2.3 in 400 develop pneumonia. Varicella pneumonia complicates approximately 2-10% of the cases of VZV infection in adults. At least 25% of the fatalities from varicella in adults occur in persons who develop varicella pneumonia. The severity of varicella pneumonia is highest in immunosuppressed persons, with mortality rates of 15-18%, and in pregnant women in the secondhird trimesters, with a mortality rate of 41%. The overall mortality in the general population has decreased from 19% (range, 10-30%) in 1960-1970 to 6%. In renal transplant patients, the mortality decreased from 53% in 1981-1990 to 22% in 1991-2000. The mortality rate is around 50% in intubated patients with acute respiratory failure. In HIV-infected patients, a mortality rate of 43% is reported, and in pregnant women, the mortality rate is about 41%. Measles virus In the United States, pneumonia is responsible for 60% of the measles mortality in infants. Although deaths from measles in the United States decreased steadily throughout the 20th century—from approximately 12 per 100,000 population in 1912 to approximately 0.2 per 100,000 population in 1960—mortality rates declined markedly after a measles vaccine was licensed in 1963. [54] Measles is almost eradicated in the Western Hemisphere. Although only 71 cases were confirmed in the United States in 2009, a sharp increase occurred in 2014. Through August 1, 2014, 593 confirmed measles cases were reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). [55] This is the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the US in 2000. Measles-virus pneumonia is still a notable cause of mortality and morbidity in nonvaccinated children and immunocompromised adults. In 1990, 6.5% of Americans with measles developed pneumonia. A study of 3220 US military recruits demonstrated that 3.3% had measles-related pneumonia. Most cases of pneumonia were secondary to bacterial superinfection. No deaths were reported among these otherwise healthy adults. However, in another study using different diagnostic criteria, pneumonia was found in 50% of recruits with measles. A follow-up study of Afghani children hospitalized for measles revealed an 85.4% rate of bronchopneumonia. The CDC reported four cases of measles pneumonia, with two fatalities, among HIV-infected children in 1986-1987. [56] In children, mortality rates due to measles bronchopneumonia are high (28%). The mortality rate due to measles pneumonia is even higher in immunocompromised groups: 70% in those with cancer and 40% in those with AIDS. Investigators reported 10 fatalities secondary to measles pneumonia in 12 children with leukemia. Cytomegalovirus CMV pneumonia is considered the most common life-threatening complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and solid-organ transplantation. The rate of CMV pneumonia in BMT recipients is 10-50%, as reported in different studies. In patients receiving solid-organ transplants, CMV reactivation is reported in as many 70% of patients, but only 20% develop clinically significant infections. Studies of CMV pneumonia in BMT recipients demonstrate a 31% mortality rate in treated patients and a decrease from previously reported rates of 56-100% in untreated patients. The mortality rate is reportedly 75% in untreated immunosuppressed persons. [57] Herpes simplex virus HSV pneumonia develops mainly in immunocompromised patients. The rate of HSV pneumonia can be as high as 70-80% in hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients not receiving prophylaxis, and it can be decreased to 5% with acyclovir prophylaxis. As with CMV, the mortality rate is high if disease remains untreated in immunosuppressed patients (>80% mortality). [58] Hantavirus As of July 2010, 545 cases of HPS had been reported in the United States from 32 states, mostly New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, California, Washington, Texas, and Utah (in decreasing order of prevalence). [29] HPS is also reported in South America and in Canada. The mortality rate for HPS is 35%. Of individuals with HPS, 61% are men and 39% are women, with a mean age of 37 years. Caucasian patients account for 77%, people of Native American descent account for about 20%, and those of Hispanic descent account for 13%. Previous Next: Prognosis The prognosis is good in the vast majority of patients with viral pneumonia. It is guarded in elderly or immunocompromised patients. Some adenovirus serotypes, especially 2, 3, 7, and 21 have been the cause of serious chronic morbidity after acute respiratory illness, including irreversible atelectasis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and unilateral hyperlucent lung. [17] An estimated 14-60% of these children will suffer some degree of permanent lung damage. Many of these patients presented with pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and bronchitis. Adenovirus 14 has a high fatality and morbidity rate in healthy patients. Serious sequelae occurred in those who survived. Viral pneumonia may leave patients with residual disability from interstitial fibrosis. Infants hospitalized with lower lung infection due to RSV are much more likely to later develop asthma.

Diel is co-corresponding author of the study, “Spillover of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Virus to Dairy Cattle,” published July 25 in Nature.Whole genome sequencing of the virus did not reveal any mutations in the virus that would lead to enhanced transmissibility of H5N1 in humans, although the data clearly shows mammal-to-mammal transmission, which is concerning as the virus may adapt in mammals, Diel said.So far, 11 human cases have been reported in the U.S., with the first dating back to April 2022, each with mild symptoms: four were linked to cattle farms and seven have been linked to poultry farms, including an outbreak of four cases reported in the last few weeks in Colorado. These recent patients fell ill with the same strain identified in the study as circulating in dairy cows, leading the researchers to suspect that the virus likely originated from dairy farms in the same county.While the virus does have the ability to infect and replicate in people, the efficiency of those infections is low. “The concern is that potential mutations could arise that could lead adaptation to mammals, spillover into humans and potential efficient transmission in humans in the future,” Diel said.It is therefore critical to continue to monitor the virus in affected animals and also in any potential infected humans, Diel said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has funded programs for H5N1 testing, at no cost to producers. Early testing, enhanced biosecurity and quarantines in the event of positive results, would be necessary to contain any further spread of the virus, according to Diel.Infections from H5N1 were first detected in January 2022, and have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 million domestic birds and thousands of wild birds in the U.S. The Cornell AHDC's and Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory scientists were among the first to report detection of the virus to dairy cattle herds. The cows were likely infected by wild birds, leading to symptoms of reduced appetite, changes in fecal matter consistency, respiratory distress and abnormal milk with pronounced decreased in milk production.The study shows a high tropism of the virus (capability to infect particular cells) for the mammary gland and high infectious viral loads shed in milk from affected animals. The virus is killed by pasteurization, which has insured a safe milk supply. Using whole genome sequencing of characterized viral strains, modeling and epidemiological information the researchers determined cases of cow to cow transmission when infected cows from Texas were moved to a farm with healthy cows in Ohio. Sequencing also showed that the virus was transmitted to cats, a raccoon and wild birds that were found dead on affected farms. The cats and raccoon most likely became ill from drinking raw milk from infected cows. Though it isn’t known how the wild birds became infected, the researchers suspect it may have resulted from environmental contamination or aerosols kicked up during milking or cleaning of the milking parlors.Kiril Dimitrov, assistant agency director for microbiology and research and development at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, is also a co-corresponding author.Co-first authors include Leonardo Caserta, assistant research professor and interim associate director of the Virology Laboratory at AHDC, and Elisha Frye, DVM ‘10, assistant professor of practice, both in the Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences; and Salman Butt, a postdoctoral researcher in Diel’s lab. Cornell co-authors include Melissa Laverack, Mohammed Nooruzzaman, Lina Covaleda, Brittany Cronk, Gavin Hitchener, John Beeby, Manigandan Lejeune and Francois Elvinger. The study was funded by the AHDC, the Ohio Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory, the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and the USDA.

WHO © Credits Avian influenza in the WHO European Region: What do we know and how can we prepare? 22 July 2024 News release Reading time: Avian influenza, or bird flu, is not a new disease, despite recently occupying the spotlight after an outbreak among dairy cattle in the United States of America. In fact, the virus causing the current outbreaks – H5N1 – first emerged in 1996/1997 in Hong Kong and later re-emerged in 2003/2004. Avian influenza has continuously evolved since then, and is commonly found in farmed poultry and wild birds around the world. It can also spill over into mammal populations; in the WHO European Region, it has been detected in farmed mink and foxes.The Region experienced one of its worst spates of avian influenza infections between October 2021 and September 2023, resulting in the deaths of millions of wild birds and causing 2500 outbreaks on farms in 37 countries. Globally, while the H5N1 virus continues to spill over to more mammals, infections in humans happen only very occasionally. As of July 2024, around 10 human cases have been reported from the outbreak among cattle in the United States, although it continues to affect over 100 cattle herds.Recent global reports also detected different subtypes of the virus in the human population, with one fatality from H5N2 in Mexico and a recovered case of less pathogenic H5N1 in Australia – the first ever in the country. Within the Region, Finland just announced that it will start vaccinating its at-risk populations, mainly farm workers and veterinarians, against the disease. WHO/Europe also has a quadripartite agreement with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Organisation for Animal Health to strengthen and optimize the health of humans, animals, plants and the environment in the face of future threats.So, is avian influenza cause for concern? Aisling Vaughan, an epidemiologist at WHO/Europe working specifically on zoonotic influenza, explains what avian influenza means for the Region now and whether it may pose a risk in the future.Questions and answersThis article was amended on 24 July 2024, as the previous version incorrectly mentioned that fewer than 10 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from the USA, when it should have been approximately 10, since 4 were reported following exposure to dairy cows and 7 were reported following exposure to poultry.

Is a universal influenza vaccine on the horizon? 26 Jul 2024 Written by Beatrice Bowlby (Digital Editor) Drug discovery and development Immunology Microbiology News Researchers are developing a ‘one and done’ vaccine that will protect individuals against all influenza variants after only one vaccination. A team led by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU; OR, USA) have developed and tested a vaccine platform against an influenza variant thought most likely to cause the next pandemic. Not only does this platform demonstrate promising results against flu variants, but it also has the potential to apply to other viruses, a breakthrough that could change the infectious disease landscape of the future. Viruses are ever evolving, making them difficult to target and keep up with. Many vaccines are designed to induce an antibody response, targeting the virus specifically depending on the arrangement of viral surface proteins. However, this approach always leaves us on the back foot: “The problem with influenza is that it’s not just one virus,” commented senior author Jonah Sacha (OHSU). “Like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’s always evolving the next variant and we’re always left to chase where the virus was, not where it’s going to be.” The current study investigated how to get ahead of a virus’s variants, focusing on avian H5N1 influenza virus, which is the virus considered most likely to trigger the next pandemic. It is currently considered one of the deadliest viruses in the world and is circulating in US dairy cows. New insights into influenza’s replication mechanism Investigating influenza’s interactions with cellular proteins has led to an improved understanding of how it is able to jump between different types of hosts. In the hopes of combatting avian H5N1 influenza virus and other potential variants, the researchers utilized a vaccine platform previously developed at OHSU to fight HIV and tuberculosis; the vaccine they designed for HIV is currently in clinical trials. The platform involves inserting fragments of target pathogens into cytomegalovirus, the common herpes virus that infects most people and produces mild symptoms. It differs from common vaccine design in that it induces an immune response from one’s own effector memory T cells, which targets the virus’s internal structural proteins, not its evolving membrane proteins. The researchers designed their cytomegalovirus-based vaccine using the 1918 influenza virus as a template before vaccinating 11 nonhuman primates. In a secure biosafety level 3 lab, these primates were then exposed to small particle aerosols containing the avian H5N1 influenza virus. Six unvaccinated primates were similarly exposed as a control. Six of the vaccinated primates survived, while all 6 of the unvaccinated primates perished, indicating that the vaccine – although based on the 1918 virus – was able to mobilize the memory T cells against the internal structural proteins of the deadly H5N1 strain. The core of the 1918 virus was similar enough to the H5N1 virus to encode protection; Sacha remarked, “even after almost 100 years of evolution, the virus can’t change those critically important parts of itself.” Co-senior author Simon Barratt-Boyes (University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA) explained: “Inhalation of aerosolized H5N1 influenza virus causes a cascade of events that can trigger respiratory failure. The immunity induced by the vaccine was sufficient to limit virus infection and lung damage, protecting the monkeys from this very serious infection.” Their findings in primates have led many to wonder about the vaccine platform’s potential in humans. In future, following the synthesis of more recent flu virus templates, the researchers expect a universal influenza vaccine to exist for human vaccination, which could generate an effective, long-lasting T-cell response against a range of unknown variants.

The connection between lung and intestinal damage remains unclear.Methods: Our experiment employs 16S rRNA technology and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect the impact of influenza virus infection on the fecal content and metabolites in mice. Additionally, it investigates the effect of influenza virus infection on intestinal damage and its underlying mechanisms through HE staining, Western blot, Q-PCR, and flow cytometry.Results: Our study found that influenza virus infection caused significant damage to both the lungs and intestines, with the virus detected exclusively in the lungs. Antibiotic treatment worsened the severity of lung and intestinal damage. Moreover, mRNA levels of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and Interferon-b (IFN-b) significantly increased in the lungs post-infection. Analysis of intestinal microbiota revealed notable shifts in composition after influenza infection, including increased Enterobacteriaceae and decreased Lactobacillaceae. Conversely, antibiotic treatment reduced microbial diversity, notably affecting Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Metabolomics showed altered amino acid metabolism pathways due to influenza infection and antibiotics. Abnormal expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the colon disrupted the balance between helper T17 cells (Th17) and regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in the intestine. Mice infected with the influenza virus and supplemented with tryptophan and Lactobacillus showed reduced lung and intestinal damage, decreased Enterobacteriaceae levels in the intestine, and decreased IDO1 activity.Discussion: Overall, influenza infection caused damage to lung and intestinal tissues, disrupted intestinal microbiota and metabolites, and affected Th17/Treg balance. Antibiotic treatment exacerbated these effects. Supplementation with tryptophan and Lactobacillus improved lung and intestinal health, highlighting a new understanding of the lung-intestine connection in influenza-induced intestinal disease.1 IntroductionDue to the high levels of morbidity and mortality caused by the influenza virus worldwide, it is urgent to explore effective means to prevent and treat it. Respiratory symptoms are the major clinical manifestations of influenza infection, usually accompanied by gastrointestinal reactions. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that mediate the interaction between the lung and gastrointestinal tract has become a topic of great interest. Recent studies have clarified the importance of regulating intestinal microorganisms in host immunity (1, 2). The mechanisms by which the influenza virus alters intestinal microbiota are not fully understood, although several potential pathways may be involved. Work in our laboratory and others have demonstrated that genes associated with the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling pathway and the downstream cytokines such as type I interferons (IFN-Is) play a key role in the alteration of intestinal microbiota induced by influenza virus infection. Toll-like receptors are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the innate immune response (3). TLRs can specifically recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and transmit pathogen-related molecular signals into cells (4). Multistep signaling cascades can be initiated and subsequently trigger adaptive immune responses. Toll-like receptor-mediated IFN-I induction plays an important role in facilitating antiviral responses (5). Type I IFNs produced in the lungs, which are central to antiviral defenses, enhanced the inhibitory effect on the intestinal antibacterial and inflammatory responses (6).In the intestine, commensal microbes assist in providing the body with sufficient and essential nutritional products (7). Therefore, the disturbance of microbial balance might have substantial consequences on host health through host microbial metabolism (8) and T cell response (9). Dysbacteria is often characterized by a depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria and an enrichment of Proteobacteria in the gut (9, 10). In our study, when the delicate balance of intestinal microbiota was disrupted by the influenza virus and antibiotics, the number of Enterobacteriaceae increased while Lactobacillaceae decreased. It has become increasingly apparent that the microbiota modulates signaling pathways contributing to mucosal immune homeostasis through metabolites. The effects of several specific microbiota-derived metabolites on the immune system have been identified, including short-chain fatty acids (11, 12), indole (13), and polysaccharide A (14, 15). Among the microbial metabolites in the intestines, we are particularly interested in the tryptophan metabolism pathway. As an essential amino acid in mammals, tryptophan metabolites have been shown to be involved in gut immune homeostasis by regulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) and helper T17 cell (Th17) responses mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) (16, 17). Disruption of the balance between Th17 and Treg can induce immune injury in the intestine, with antibiotic treatment exacerbating such damage.Thus, our study has revealed an interaction between the lungs and intestines mediated by commensal microbiota, which captures signals from microbial metabolites and subsequently alter the gastrointestinal microenvironment, exacerbating or alleviating intestinal injury.2 Materials and methods2.1 Mice and virusFemale BALB/c mice, with an average weight of (20 ± 2) g and 6–7 weeks old, were purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms Center and housed under SPF conditions. All animals were housed for 7 days to adjust to housing conditions under a strict 12-h light/dark cycle. In total, 50 mice were randomly divided into the mock-infected group, the virus-infected group, the antibiotic treatment group, the Lactobacillus treatment group, and the tryptophan treatment group (10 each). A/WSN/33 (H1N1; WSN) influenza virus was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Titers were determined by a standard plaque assay on MDCK cells and viral stock was stored at -80°C. Mice were fully anesthetized by inhalation of diethyl ether and then infected with a sublethal dose (200 PFU) of the mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 (H1N1; WSN) influenza virus strain or Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) by non-surgical intratracheal instillation.2.2 Antibiotics, Lactobacillus, and tryptophan treatmentsFor the antibiotic treatment group, 1 day after infection with the virus, mice were treated with ampicillin (1 g/L), vancomycin (500 mg/L), neomycin sulfate (1 g/L), and metronidazole (1 g/L) by drinking water as previously described (18). For the Lactobacillus and tryptophan treatment groups, 1 week before infection with the virus, mice were treated with Lactobacillus (108 CFU/mL) and tryptophan (100 mg/kg/bw) by intragastric administration. Mice were monitored daily and weighed until day 9, after which all the mice were euthanized. Animal care and experimental procedures were followed in accordance with the experimental animal guidelines at USTC.2.3 Determination of virusInfluenza virus in the lungs, colons, and small intestines was detected by PCR. The primer sequences to detect the gene encoding the matrix protein within the influenza virus were as follows: 5’ -GGACTGCAGCGTAGACGCTT-3’ (forward) and 5’ -CATCCT- GTTGTATATGAGGCCCAT-3’ (reverse).2.4 HistopathologyLung, colon, and small intestine tissues were collected and fixed immediately in 4% neutral-buffered formalin in PBS for>24 h, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5–7µm sections. The sections were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to observe histological changes. Generic grading criteria histopathologic grades of the lungs were assigned as grade 0 (none), grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), and grade 3 (severe) based on an increasing extent and/or complexity of change (Table 1) (19–21). Generic grading criteria histopathologic grades of the intestine were assigned as grade 0 (none), grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), and grade 3 (severe) based on an increasing extent and/or complexity of change (Table 2) (22, 23).Table 1 Table 1 Histopathologic grades of the lung.Table 2 Table 2 Histopathologic grades of the intestine.2.5 Real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from lung, colon, and intestine samples with the RNA isolator (Vazyme). The concentration and quality of the RNA were measured with a Nano Drop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI, USA). Next, 2 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-Free DNase (M6101; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and was reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Vazyme). Two microliters of diluted cDNA (1:20, vol/vol) were used for real-time PCR with Mx3000 P Real-Time PCR System (Stratagene, USA). For analysis, the expression of the target gene was normalized to the housekeeping gene β-actin. Values of gene expression were then calculated using the mean from the control samples as a calibrator. The relative mRNA level of the target gene in each treatment group = the mRNA level of the target gene in the treatment group/mRNA level of the target gene in the control group. Primers were synthesized by Generay Biotech. A list of qPCR primers used in this study is provided in Table 3.Table 3 Table 3 Sequences of primers used for RT-PCR.2.6 Bacteria preparationLactobacillus brevis was provided by Shanghai Fuxiang Biotechnology Co., LTD, incubated in MRS broth (DeMan, Rogosa, Sharpe) under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 48 h. The optical density (OD) was measured at 620 nm to adjust the final concentration of the bacterial suspension, and the exact number of CFU was determined by plating serial dilutions of the inoculum onto MRS.2.7 Analysis of the fecal microbiotaFecal samples were collected from groups at 9 dpi, and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. In total, 40 mg of fecal sample from each mouse was subjected to DNA extraction according to a bead-beating method and followed by phenol-chloroform extraction (24). DNA extracts were diluted in 50 μl ddH2O prior to PCR reactions. Furthermore, 2 μl of extracted fecal bacterial DNA was used as a template for 16S qPCR reaction, operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified and the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSE) analysis was performed by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).2.8 Analysis of the microbial metabolitesFecal samples were first derivatized according to published methods with few modifications and analyzed with Gas Chromatography/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) (25). After a derivative process on a 10 mg fecal sample from each mouse was performed, 1 μL of the derivatized solution was injected into an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph that was coupled with a Pegasus HT time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC/TOFMS, Leco Corp., Joseph, MI) in splitless mode at 260˚C. Chroma TOF software v4.22 (Leco) was used for the multivariate analysis after the data from the GC/TOF-MS mass spectrogram and chromatogram were pretreated. All of the procedures were conducted according to previous publications (26). Metabolite identification was performed with SIMCA-p (13.0) software using PLS-DA and PCA models and metabolic pathways analysis was performed using Metaboanalyst software. The concentration of metabolites in the tryptophan pathway of the Lactobacillus and tryptophan treatment groups was analyzed with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Thus, a 50 mg sample was placed into 2 mL centrifuge tube, 100 mg glass beads was added along with 200 μL 10% methanol formate solution and 200 μL sterile water and ground for 60 s in 40 HZ, and repeated two times. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, 10 μL of the supernatant was diluted at a rate of 50 times as the high-content compound to be tested, and the supernatant was taken as the low-content compound to be tested. This was done using a C18 chromatographic column (2.1×100 mm, 1.7 m, Waters, USA) with an injection volume of 5 μL and a column temperature 40°C. Mobile phase A was 10% methanol (0.1% formic acid) and B was 50% methanol (0.1% formic acid). Gradient elution was performed and the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The mass spectrometer utilizes an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive ion ionization mode to detect intestinal metabolites. The ion source temperature was 500°C, the ion source voltage was 5500 V, the collision gas was 6 psi, the curtain gas was 30 psi, and the atomizing gas and the auxiliary gas were both 50 psi. Scanning was performed using multiple response monitoring (MRM).2.9 Western blotTotal protein was extracted from mouse colon and intestine tissues using RIPA cracking liquid with PMSF inhibitors. In total, 40 μg of total protein was resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat dried milk and incubated at 4°C with primary antibodies. Detection of mouse GAPDH was performed with primary mouse monoclonal antibody (MultiSciences Biotech), while detection of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) was performed with monoclonal mouse antibody (Proteintech). Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) was detected by monoclonal rat antibody (Invitrogen). Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) was detected by polyclonal rabbit antibody (Proteintech). After overnight incubation at 4°C, the blots were washed and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat, and goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugate to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (MultiSciences Biotech and Invitrogen, respectively). Then, the membranes were washed with TBST for 30 min, followed by detection with chemiluminescence and image densitometry analysis with a Tanon-6200 luminescent image analysis system (Tanon-6200, China) with BeyoECL Plus (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). After washing, bands were developed using followed by detection with chemiluminescence and image densitometry analysis with a Tanon-6200 luminescent image analysis system (Tanon-6200, China) with BeyoECL Plus (Beyotime Biotechnology, China).2.10 Flow cytometryThe ileum and colon were longitudinally sliced into sections measuring 0.5 cm and then rinsed in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution containing 2% FCS. The tissues were placed in HBSS with 2 mM EDTA at 37°C for 20 minutes in a shaking incubator, incubated twice. Subsequently, they were digested in complete RPMI with 1 mg/mL Collagenase VIII (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 15 minutes, or until complete digestion of the tissue occurred. Lymphocyte separation was performed by using a Percoll lymphatic separator kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). For surface markers, cells were incubated with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies against surface markers at 4°C for 30 min in the dark. For intracellular markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized with a Cytofix/Cytoperm TM Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences, catalog 554714) or a Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience, catalog 00–5523-00), and then incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies at 4°C for an additional 30 min. Flow cytometric analyses utilized antibodies (Abs) that were acquired from BD Biosciences. Prior to staining, the cells underwent pre-treatment using Mouse BD Fc Block (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Subsequently, they were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD4, PE-conjugated anti-RORγt, and APC-conjugated anti-Foxp3 following the guidelines provided by the manufacturer (Treg cells: CD4+Foxp3+; Th17 cells:CD4+Foxp3-RORγt+). At the same time, cells also made relevant isotype controls. Cell frequencies were calculated by adding Spherotech Accucount blank particles. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Calibur analyzer using the FACS Diva 6.2 software (BD Biosciences). Subsequently, the data was analyzed with FlowJo software.2.11 Statistical analysisThe values of each group were shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Before analyses, we used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to assess whether the data were normally distributed. The variables met the assumptions for normality except for the sequencing data. Then, we used the independent samples T test to evaluate the significant difference between two different treatment groups by using SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Correlation analysis, expressed as Spearman’s correlations (R > 0.5, P < 0.05), was performed to determine the correlations between the abundance of microbiota and intestinal development.3 Results3.1 Crosstalk between lung and intestines after influenza virus infectionIn this study, mice were subjected to the H1N1 influenza virus to establish a mouse model of respiratory influenza infection. To confirm that the animal model was successfully established, we detected the expression of the influenza virus-derived matrix protein gene in the lungs, colon, and ileum at 9 days post infection (Figure 1A). In line with a previous study, we could only detect the presence of the virus in the lungs, revealing that respiratory epithelial is the primary target of influenza virus replication, and no infectious particles were found in the colon and ileum. The mice were then treated with combinatorial antibiotics via drinking water to perturb the intestinal microbiota 1 day after infecting them with H1N1 influenza virus. In addition to respiratory clinical signs, virus-and antibiotic-treated mice displayed gastrointestinal tract symptoms, including decreased food appetite, wet feces, and significant weight loss compared with the mock-infected mice. We observed the histopathology of the lung and intestine tissues at 9 dpi (Figure 1B). As expected, there were varying degrees of damage in the lungs and intestines of mice treated with the virus and antibiotics (Figures 1C–E). Histological analyses showed that inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia were evident in the lungs (Figure 1C) and the intestine tissues (Figures 1D, E) were disrupted in both groups. However, the injury in the intestines of the antibiotic group was more serious than that in the virus-infected group. These data indicated that immune injury in the intestines is indirectly caused by the influenza virus, and there may be underlying mechanisms connecting the lungs with the intestines.Figure 1 Figure 1 Influenza virus infection causes lung and intestinal immune injury. (A) The levels of the influenza virus–derived matrix protein gene in the lungs, colon, and ileum were detected by PCR; (B) Histology analysis including H&E (scale: 100 μm) of the lungs, colon, and ileum was observed at 9 days post infection; (C) Spider web plot displaying histopathological scoring of lung damage; (D) Spider web plot displaying histopathological scoring of colon damage; (E) Spider web plot displaying histopathological scoring of ileum damage. Con: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with PBS; Inf group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with influenza virus infection; Ant group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with a combination of antibiotics.3.2 TLR7 signaling and IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA expression in the lungs and their correlation with viral RNA mRNA expressionTLRs play an important role in host defense against pathogens, and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) can recognize the ssRNA of the influenza virus (27). Furthermore, TLR7 signaling also induces the production of downstream cytokines, such as IFN-α and IFN-β, which play a key role in facilitating antiviral responses (28). Base on the above, we hypothesized that TLR7 signaling may mediate the antiviral effect through the production of IFN-α and IFN-β during the influenza virus infection. To explore this hypothesis, we tested the mRNA levels of virus RNA, TLR7, Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), Interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and Interferon-gamma (IFN-β) in the lungs (Figures 2A–E). Virus RNA, TLR7, MYD88, and IFN-β mRNA levels increased significantly in the lungs of virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice compared with the mock-infected mice. However, there was no significant difference in IFN-α mRNA level in the lungs between the experimental groups and the control group, which suggested that the influenza virus infection did not induce change in IFN-α in the lungs. In addition, we also detected the mRNA levels of TLR7, TLR9, and MYD88 in the colon (Figures 2F–H) and ileum (Figures 2I–K). Q-PCR results showed that there were no significant differences among the three groups in the mRNA levels of TLR7, TLR9, and MYD88 in both the colon and ileum. To assess the relationship between TLR7 and virus, IFN-β mRNA expression in the lungs of virus-infected and antibiotic-treated groups, we investigated the correlation of TLR7 mRNA level with viral RNA and IFN-β mRNA level and found that TLR7 mRNA level directly correlated with viral RNA and IFN-β mRNA level (Figure 2L). These findings collectively suggested that the upregulation of TLR7 in the lungs of virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice is associated with influenza virus replication and IFN-β induction.Figure 2 Figure 2 Increased viral RNA, TLR7 signaling, and IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA expression in the lungs, colon, ileum, and their correlation.

Statistical analysis was performed by independent samples T test. **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001. All replicates are biological.3.3 Antibiotics exacerbate the alteration of the intestinal microbiotaPreviously, it was reported that IFN-α and IFN-β were induced in the lungs during influenza pulmonary infection and this altered the intestinal microbiota. In our research, it was clear that IFN-β might provide important signals critical for shaping the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, we analyzed the microbiota diversity and composition in the fecal contents of each group on the 9th day post infection (Figures 3A, B). Unexpectedly, our data showed that the intestinal microbiota had subtle changes in diversity and composition, but without alteration of bacterial community richness during influenza infection alone. On the contrary, microbial DNA extracted from fecal samples of the antibiotic-treated mice showed that antibiotic treatment could drastically alter the richness and components of the intestinal microbiota. Intuitively, antibiotic treatment has a more robust impact on microbiota composition. Although bacterial species showed some subtle differences between the virus- and mock-infected mice, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes remained the most dominant colonizers, and a low abundance of Proteobacteria in the influenza infected group, which was consistent with the composition of normal intestinal microorganisms as previously reported (29, 30).Figure 3 Figure 3 H1N1 influenza virus-induced IFN-β alters the fecal microbiota diversity and composition; analysis of the fecal microbiota from the control, virus-infected mice, and antibiotic-treated mice during influenza infection. (A) The diversity of fecal microbiota from experimental groups on the 9th day post infection (dpi) was analyzed by sequencing; (B) Graph is the average relative abundance of each bacterial phylum; (C, D) LDA score about control and virus infection group, control, and antibiotic-treated group. Con: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with PBS; Inf group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with influenza virus infection; Ant group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with combination of antibiotics.In contrast to the virus-infected mice, intestinal microbial diversity in the antibiotic-treated mice was significantly decreased compared with the mock-infected mice. Although Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were still the major bacterial phyla in the fecal microbial community of antibiotic-treated mice, a significant blooming of Proteobacteria was noticed. Additionally, the results displayed a significantly lower level of Firmicutes in the stool samples of the antibiotic-treated mice compared with the mock- infected mice, and no statistical differences were found in the level of Bacteroidetes between them. To investigate which bacterial species contributed to the differences in intestinal microbiota in the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice, we performed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSE) analysis (Figures 3C, D). In line with expectations, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae were involved in the bacterial species alterations in antibiotic-treated mice, as Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae are the most relevant species of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The data also showed a change in the Lactobacillaceae of the virus-infected mice. These results indicated that the most striking changes in the fecal microbial community of the antibiotic-treated mice were the increased numbers of Enterobacteriaceae and the decreased numbers of Lactobacillaceae (31).3.4 Tryptophan metabolism destroys the T cell balance in the intestinesGiven that gut bacteria influence host metabolism and immunity through a variety of chemically different metabolites (32), we performed gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) to better understand the detailed metabolic information from the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice. The data, analyzed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), showed significant separation between the virus-infected mice and antibiotic-treated mice, with no obvious differences between virus-infected and mock-infected mice (Figure 4A). To determine the effects of intestine microbiota on metabolic processes during the infection, we utilized the Metaboanalyst software to screen the differentially altered metabolic pathways (Figures 4B, C). As expected, amino acid metabolism pathways were significantly altered in the feces of the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice. Among these pathways, we focused on tryptophan metabolism because correlation analysis revealed a close link with Lactobacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae (Figures 5A, B), as previously reported (33). Almost all dietary tryptophan is metabolized in mammals by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) (34), so we sought to determine if the protein level of IDO1 in the intestines of the virus-infected mice and antibiotic-treated mice was changed. We examined the protein expression of IDO1 in the colon (Figures 6A–C) and ileum (Figures 6D–F). Surprisingly, at both the transcriptional and protein levels, we found the completely opposite trend of IDO1 between the colon (upregulated) and ileum (downregulated) in both groups. The different expressions of IDO1 in different sites of the intestines suggests that the consequences of the microbiome and metabolomics in fecal contents cannot fully represent the immune condition in the small intestine. Although the microbiota composition and metabolic pathways differed between the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice, the trend of IDO1 level was consistent in both groups, indicating that other factors may mediate IDO1 expression, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (35) and IFN-γ (36). The level of IDO1 expression in intestinal mucosa indicates that IDO1 is a critical enzyme regulating the local tryptophan state; both dysregulation and overactivation can lead to alterations in immune activation. Thus, in this study, we investigated the tryptophan-influenced immune balance by exploring the equilibrium of Th17 and Treg cells in the colon and ileum of the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice. As the specific transcription factor for Th17 and Treg cells, the expression of Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) and Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) were detected in tissues (Figures 6G–L). We found that the expressions of Foxp3 increased and the expression of RORγ decreased in the colon of the experimental groups (Figures 6G–I), which contrasts with the findings in the ileum (Figures 6J–L). The expression of Foxp3 in the ileum showed no difference between the virus-infected mice and mock-infected mice, which may explain why intestine destruction was much more serious in the antibiotic-treated mice.Figure 4 Figure 4 Analysis of fecal metabolic characteristics associated with H1N1 influenza virus infection by GC/TOF-MS.

Statistical analysis was performed by independent samples T test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns, no significant difference. All replicates are biological.Additionally, we isolated lymphocytes from the colon and ileum and used flow cytometry to separate T cells in the intestine, further examining the quantities of Treg cells (CD4+Foxp3+) and Th17 cells (CD4+Foxp3-RORγt+). The results are shown in Figure 7. Influenza virus infection significantly increased the number of Treg cells in the colon (Figure 7A) and decreased the number of Th17 cells (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the influenza virus did not significantly affect the number of Treg cells in the ileum (Figure 7C), but there was a significant increase in the number of Th17 cells in the ileum following influenza virus infection (Figure 7D).Figure 7 Figure 7 Effects of influenza virus infection on the quantity of Treg cells and Th17 cells in the colon and ileum of mice.

As shown in Figures 8A, B, lung tissue sections in the control group showed integrity alveolar morphology, no secretions in the cavity, and no inflammatory cell infiltration. While in the virus-infected group, the alveolar structure was disordered and there was a large number of inflammatory cell infiltrations. Alveolar morphology in the tryptophan group and Lactobacillus group was similar, with a small number of inflammatory cell infiltrations. The colon and ileum sections of the control group showed complete epithelial structure and uniform villi length, while the colon and ileum were damaged in the virus-infection group with inflammatory cell infiltration and epithelial damage (Figures 8C, D). However, the tryptophan group and the Lactobacillus supplement group significantly alleviated lung and intestinal damage caused by influenza virus infection. This was evident in reduced peribronchial inflammation, ameliorated crypt damage, crypt atrophy, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the colon and ileum.Figure 8 Figure 8 Effects of the influenza virus, tryptophann and Lactobacillus on lung and intestinal tissue structure.

Con: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with PBS; Inf group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were mice treated with influenza virus infection; Trp group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with exogenous tryptophan supplement; Lac group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with exogenous Lactobacillus supplement.The expression of Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 9A) and Lactobacillus (Figure 9B) in the intestines was detected by qPCR. Compared with the control group, the number of Enterobacteriaceae increased in the infected group with no significant difference. Compared with the infection group, the number of Enterobacteriaceae was significantly reduced in the tryptophan group and Lactobacillus group. Compared with the control group, the number of Lactobacillaceae in the infected group was significantly reduced. Compared with the infection group, there was no significant difference between the tryptophan group and the Lactobacillus group.Figure 9 Figure 9 Effects of influenza virus, tryptophan and Lactobacillus supplement on the expression of (A) Enterobacteriaceae and (B) Lactobacillus in the intestine. Each dot represents data from one animal. Data are mean ± SEM. n = 3. Con: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with PBS; Inf group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were mice treated with influenza virus infection; Trp group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with exogenous tryptophan supplement; Lac group: Female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 7 weeks (20 ± 2 g) were treated with exogenous Lactobacillus supplement. Statistical analysis was performed by independent samples T test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. All replicates are biological.We performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze the concentration of metabolites in the tryptophan metabolic pathway (Figure 10). The concentration of tryptophan was not significantly different between the control and infection groups and the concentration of tryptophan in the tryptophan group and the Lactobacillus group showed no significant difference from the infection group (Figure 10A). The concentration of picolinic acid in the infected group was not significantly different from that in the control group, and the concentration of picolinic acid in the tryptophan group and Lactobacillus group was significantly lower than that in the infected group (Figure 10B). Compared with the control group, the concentration of tryptamine (Figure 10D), kynurenic acid (Figure 10E), and kynurenine (Figure 10F) in the infected group was significantly reduced and remarkably increased in the tryptophan group and the Lactobacillus group. However, there was no significant difference in the Xanthurenic acid concentration of the four groups (Figure 10C).Figure 10 Figure 10 Effects of influenza virus infection and exogenous supplementation of tryptophan and Lactobacillus on the concentration of tryptophan-related metabolites in the intestine of mice.

Statistical analysis was performed by independent samples T test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. All replicates are biological.To further evaluate the alteration of metabolites in the tryptophan metabolic pathway, the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme IDO1 in tryptophan metabolism was detected (Figures 11A, B). Compared with the control group, the expression of IDO1 in the infection group was significantly increased, the expression of IDO1 in the Lactobacillus group was significantly decreased compared with the infection group (P<0.01), and there was no significant change in the tryptophan group.Figure 11 Figure 11 The expression of IDO1 in the intestine.

All replicates are biological.4 DiscussionInfluenza virus infection also causes immune injury in the mucosal tissues, implying that an underlying association existed between respiratory and intestinal tract. Thus far, studies have provided evidences to support the concept of “common mucosal immune system” (37). Soner Yildiz and colleagues observed that influenza virus infection had little effect on lower respiratory tract microbiota abundance and composition (38), which indicated that changes in intestine tract microbiota rather than in respiratory tract microbiota are involved in the connection between the lungs and gut after IAV infection. Multiple studies have identified that germ-free mice exhibit impaired gastrointestinal tract (GI) development (39) and an undeveloped adaptive immune system (40) which highlights the importance of the GI microbiota to host immunity. Alterations to the intestinal microbiota not only affect the host’s susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens but also can have a broad impact on the immune status and function of the host.As a crucial bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, toll-like receptors activate the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway (41), leading to the release of inflammatory mediators such as IFN-β. In our study, we found that the expression of TLR7 signaling and IFN-β were significantly upregulated in lungs attacked by influenza virus alone or with the administration of combinatorial antibiotics. Nevertheless, in the antibiotic-treated mice, the expression of components of the TLR7 signaling pathway was inconsistent with the results reported by others (31). This could be due to the difference in time point for antibiotic administration. In our model, the mice were treated with antibiotics 1 day after infection, while in others, antibiotics were taken at least 1 week before infection with the flu virus (42, 43). We assume that the antibiotic-induced dysbacteriosis in others was worse than that in our model which resulted in the differential expression of TLR7 signaling. Being the downstream signaling-related inflammatory cytokines of TLR7, IFN-β expression was also elevated in the lungs of the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice. It has been confirmed that influenza pulmonary infection can significantly alter the intestinal microbiota profile through a mechanism dependent on type I interferon using Ifnar1–/–mice, but it is not clear whether one or both of them make the major contribution to this mechanism, because the type I interferon family consists of IFN-α and IFN-β. In our study, IFN-α did not react to the influenza infection, therefore IFN-β may be the key factor in the type I interferon family to influence the intestinal microbiota or the high level of IFN-α did not last for a long time. Interestingly, as shown in the present study, microbiota abundance and composition did not significantly change in the fecal contents of the virus-infected mice in spite of significantly increased IFN-β. One explanation may relate to the variation in immune status in the virus-infected mice at 9 dpi. At this time point, the mice may have been at the stage of self-healing, the recovery of intestinal microorganisms prior to virus clearance and mucosal epithelium repair, and then the use of antibiotics disrupted the microbiota homeostasis.It is well known that the dynamic interaction between the host and its microbiota have a profound effect on achieving and maintaining homeostasis (44). Our study, coupled with other recent reports, focused on the bacterial species and specific microbial metabolites to better understand the crosstalk between host immunity and microbial mutualism. Colonization of mice by Clostridium strains in the colon (45) or Segmented filamentous bacterium in the small intestine (46) resulted in resistance to colitis and reduced growth of intestinal pathogens. Treating mice with sensitive drugs for Escherichia coli or supplementing with extrinsic probiotics will help to prevent dysbacteriosis and protect mice against immune injury induced by influenza infection. This research confirmed the importance of the manipulation of commensal bacteria in the intestines. The microbiome results in our study revealed increased Enterobacteriaceae in the antibiotic-treated mice and decreased Lactobacillaceae in both groups. Therefore, the alteration of the opportunistic pathogen—Enterobacteriaceae and probiotic—Lactobacillaceae in the intestine will influence host immunity.There was a significant change in the tryptophan metabolism pathway in the stool samples of the antibiotic-treated mice in our study. Tryptophan metabolism can be divided into endogenous host metabolites and microbiome-modulated metabolites. Since the microbiota can directly and indirectly modulate host endogenous tryptophan metabolism and tryptophan is primarily metabolized through the kynurenine pathway, we detected the expression of IDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme of kynurenine pathway (47), in the colon and small intestine of the virus-infected and antibiotic-treated mice.The IDO1 expression in the colon was totally opposite to its expression in the small intestine of two groups which may have been caused by the different distribution of gut microbes in different sites. The colon is the home to the most dense and metabolically active community (48) whereas the upper two-thirds of the small intestine only contains low numbers of microorganisms, which suggests that the level of IDO1 may be related to the diversity of gut microbes. Increased IDO1 activity shows immunosuppression and decreased IDO1 activity shows weak resistance to pathogens, thus a delicate balance between pathogen defense and host protection is important to keep immune homeostasis in the intestine. This double-edged sword function of IDO1 explains why the different expression of IDO1 in both the colon and small intestine could cause injury.In addition to being a rate-limited enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, IDO1 also plays an essential role in maintaining an immune environment. The depletion of tryptophan and production of associated metabolites leads to cell cycle arrest of immune cells, activates regulatory T-cells and blocks their conversion into Th17-like cells (49). In this study, the expression of Foxp3 and RORγ in the colon and small intestine was basically consistent with the immunoregulatory mechanism of IDO1. Together with the intestinal pathology, it showed that intestinal immune damage was related to Th17/Treg imbalance, and Th17/Treg was a good indicator to evaluate intestinal damage. Combining histology and protein expression, the intestines of the antibiotic group had more serious injuries and an increase of Enterobacteriaceae was only detected in the antibiotic group. These data might confirm our hypothesis that the increase of Enterobacteriaceae might be the main cause of intestinal immune injury during influenza infection which was in accord with an earlier report.Our study showed that Lactobacillus and tryptophan in the intestinal tract were significantly reduced after influenza infection. The changes of microorganisms and metabolites caused serious damage to the respiratory tract and intestinal tract of the hosts. Oral probiotics not only have a direct effect on the intestinal tract, but also have immunomodulatory effects on parenteral tissues, such as the improvement of inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary infection. Tryptophan is not only an essential nutrient for the body, but plays a vital role in the maintenance of intestinal immune tolerance and the balance of intestinal microbiota. To investigate the regulatory effects of Lactobacillus and tryptophan on influenza virus-induced damage, we analyzed the effects of Lactobacillus and tryptophan in the respiratory tract and intestinal tract of influenza infected mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that supplementation with both Lactobacillus and tryptophan had the remission effect on the damage in the lungs and intestines caused by influenza. Lactobacillus can reduce the severity of colitis by improving metabolites in serum and intestinal microbiota, indicating that Lactobacillus can prevent tissue damage caused by colitis (50). The lack of dietary tryptophan would impair the intestinal immunity of mice and change the intestinal microbial community, indicating that tryptophan is an important regulatory factor for maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis (51). These results are consistent with the effects of Lactobacillus and tryptophan on lung and intestinal mucosal injury in this study.In summary, our study suggested that influenza virus infection can affect the homeostasis of the gut microbiota through the lung-gut axis, thereby influencing the levels of tryptophan-related metabolites in the gut microbiota. Additionally, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(IDO1), which acts as a key rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan metabolism is significantly affected by influenza virus infection. Our experimental results indicated that influenza virus infection can significantly increase the expression of IDO1 in the colon. When IDO1 activity is enhanced, tryptophan consumption accelerates, leading to a decrease in tryptophan concentration. This promotes the production of Tregs and inhibits the helper T cell (Th17) response, thereby suppressing intestinal mucosal immune function. Ultimately, influenza virus infection can cause intestinal pathological damage and hinder intestinal health and development (Figure 12). In subsequent experiments, we plan to use IDO1 knockout mice to further investigate the specific mechanisms.Figure 12 Figure 12 Graphical abstract. Infection with H1N1 influenza virus not only damages the lungs of mice but also causes injury to intestinal epithelial cells and crypt atrophy in the intestine. It induces dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, leading to decreased diversity and richness of gut microbiota, reduced abundance of Lactobacillus, and inhibition of metabolic products especially related to tryptophan metabolism pathways. This imbalance results in disrupted proportions of Treg cells and Th17 cells in the intestines, impairing intestinal mucosal immune function. Antibiotic treatment did not significantly improve these effects. However, supplementation with exogenous tryptophan or treatment with Lactobacilli significantly improved pathological damage to the lungs and intestines caused by influenza virus infection, restored the balance of Treg cells and Th17 cells, and recovered intestinal mucosal immune function.Data availability statementThe sequencing data we generated were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession numbers from SRR29780069 to SRR29780089 in PRJNA1134695.Ethics statementAll animal experiments were conducted under anesthesia in accordance with the Animal Ethics Procedures and Guidelines of the People’s Republic of China and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University (SYXK (Su) 2017-0007).

The amendment now applies to pandemic influenza A viruses and others with pandemic potential, such as the current H5N1 strain of bird flu that has infected cattle and subsequently humans in some states. Previously, the declaration specifically covered just the H7N9 strain of bird flu. The declaration would allow the Food and Drug Administration to extend the expiration date of certain medical products and allow HHS to issue an emergency use authorization for unapproved drugs, devices or products, among other actions.

It also has hit dairy cows in the state. What does this mean for the general public? What about all the county and state fairs that show off chicken and cows?What exactly is bird flu?Avian influenza, also called H5 bird flu or H5N1, is a highly pathogenic avian influenza. It’s widespread in wild birds around the globe. It’s responsible for outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows in Colorado and the U.S., with double digit recent human cases in agricultural workers.The virus is found in an infected bird’s poop and fluids from the bird’s mouth, eyes and nose, according to the CDC.It can cause severe respiratory symptoms. What is the risk to people?The viruses don’t usually infect people, according to the CDC, but can happen if you come into contact with an infected bird, dead or alive and touch your eyes, nose or mouth, touch surfaces or handles item contaminated and tough your eyes, nose or mouth, or breath virus-contaminated dust or droplets.If you get sick from it, symptoms range from none to severe illness. Mild symptoms include conjunctivitis (red eye), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and tiredness. Among more serious symptoms are high fever, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Severe illness can result in pneumonia that may require hospitalization and can lead to death, though that’s only to date happened in other countries, not the U.S.Most at risk are people working with infected poultry, waterfowl, including ducks and geese and livestock.More Colorado poultry workers test positive for H5 bird flu, bringing the total human cases to 10 Can I get H5 bird flu from eating dairy, chicken or eggs?It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). The proper handling and cooking of poultry, meat, and eggs kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses.People should separate raw poultry from cooked foods and foods that won't be cooked.“We (the state health department) and CDC believe that the risk continues to be low here for the general public,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist with CDPHE.Many experts and health agencies advise against consuming raw milk. “Always choose pasteurized milk and dairy products to protect your health and the health of your family,” the CDC wrote on its web page regarding raw, or unpasteurized, milk.The CDC suggests health care providers tell patients raw milk and any products made from it, including cheese, ice cream, and yogurt “can be contaminated with germs that can cause serious illness, hospitalization, or death.”Commercial dairy cow farmers in Colorado must now test herds weekly for avian fluThe risk to the general public is low, so should I be worried?The more virus out in farms or the wild, the greater the chance it will infect other animals, including humans. Also, more infections means a greater possibility that virus could mutate into a much more serious threat, one that could cause a pandemic.“H5N1 registers as what we call ‘a virus with pandemic potential,’” according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Unlike other flu viruses, humans have no preexisting immunity to H5 viruses. “Therefore, similar to what we saw with COVID, in the worst case scenario, if this virus enters humans and starts to spread, all of us are susceptible, and we could see massive increases in numbers of cases.”May Chu, an epidemiologist and clinical professor from the Colorado School of Public Health, said that’s one key reason infected poultry are culled: to limit rapid spread through a flock that could then be transmitted to humans. “You can nip it before it gets into the human population widely,” she said. “That is the best public health protection.”But what about people who work on dairy farms or in egg-laying facilities?The state health department cited the CDC and said that people who work on those farms are at higher risk of being exposed to H5 bird flu.And that is showing up in Colorado. As of Thursday, the state health department said it has recorded a total of 10 cases; six at one poultry operation and three at another. That’s in addition to the case of a dairy worker earlier this month, the state’s first case this year.“The risk to the general public is still low. We are only seeing this in workers with direct contact with these animals,” said Scott Bookman, senior director for Public Health Readiness and Response with the CDPHE.People who are in close contact with dairy and egg-laying facility workers who tested positive are being monitored as well, said Herlihy. “We want to know if there is any illness among household contacts,” Herlihy said. “That would obviously be a concerning scenario. So the folks that have closest contact with an ill worker would be our highest priority, and that has not been identified to date.” Herlihy said there has been no sign of the virus spreading via human-to-human transmission.“We've been tracking this virus since 2022, and during that time we have not seen evidence of person-to-person transmission,” she said.“We know that there's going to be increased exposure in certain industries, including the poultry industry and on dairy farms right now.” “We also have had behavioral health services out there, not only working with our teams, but working with the workers out on site to ensure that if folks are struggling, that we've got people out there they can talk with,” said the agency’s Bookman. “We also have our Agricultural Workers service program that has been out the last couple of days as well.” Colorado is providing up to four weeks of free PPE (personal protective equipment) to farmworkers, according to its website. There it also offers updated situation reports, links to a webinar via YouTube. A link for poultry owners, veterinarians and backyard, hobby and commercial products to report, in English or Spanish, information about sick or dead animals.Similar resources are also available on the state’s website for HPAI in dairy cattle. That includes information about the state order regarding licensed dairy cow farms in the state to submit weekly milk samples for testing. Farmworkers can also order free PPE from the site.Workers are also getting information, testing and monitoring from health providers visiting the facilities via mobile clinics. “We outreach to seasonal workers, migrant workers, and other workers that may have a hard time, because of their work schedules, to come in,” said Dr. Mark Wallace of Chief Clinical Officer for Sunrise Community Health.I’m going to my county or the state fair, do I need to be worried?While your risk of coming into contact with a sick animal at the fair is low, there are things you can do to protect yourself.“For the general public, what I would say to anybody at all times is wash your hands. Don't touch your mouth, don't put your hands on your face. Things like that,” Scott Bookman said.For animals, the state veterinarian’s office did put out guidance for poultry and dairy cows that recommended monitoring animals for signs of illness. The office said if you are bringing lactating dairy cattle to a show or event of some kind, that they should be tested within seven days of arrival.“We know that there's no such thing as no risk,” Baldwin said. “What we're trying to get to is low risk. And so testing within that seven day timeframe will help us be assured that at that time of that test, that cow was not shedding virus. So I think we are putting that in place and we're asking show and fair and event organizers to implement that guidance and require testing for those lactating dairy cattle going to fairs.”As for poultry, the state won’t require testing because poultry show obvious signs of illness when infected with H5 bird flu. “All of the animals, when they get to the fairgrounds, are inspected,” said Baldwin, the state veterinarian. “So we've got teams from CSU, the CSU avian health diagnostic team that goes out and they do at a number of the fairs across the state, they'll do inspections at check-in for all of the poultry coming to those events.”Some veterinarians and agricultural experts nationally are recommending farmers not bringing lactating cows to fairs “Given the high risk posed by lactating dairy cattle to other cattle, the rest of the exhibition community, and the public, lactating dairy cattle should not attend exhibitions including county and state fairs, at this time,” according to a paper published by the University of Minnesota Extension and its College of Veterinary Medicine.Can my pets get H5 bird flu?The risk to domestic animals is lower than in birds, but cats or dogs could become infected. That can happen when they go outside and eat or are exposed to sick or dead birds infected with bird flu viruses. That risk extends to an environment contaminated with infected bird feces.People should keep their pets away from wild birds and from areas contaminated with the virus. If you suspect your pet may have been exposed to H5 bird flu, and is showing symptoms of illness, contact your veterinarian and monitor yourself for symptoms. If I work on a farm, how do I protect myself?Farm workers can protect themselves by wearing protective clothing — like coveralls, gloves, face masks or shields, and goggles — when working with sick or dead animals, manure, or milk, according to the state’s website. The state also suggests washing hands with soap and water throughout the day, especially before eating, drinking or smoking, and before going home. They recommend cleaning areas that have come in contact with animals, manure or milk and using chemical disinfectants effective against viruses. If you work animals suspected or confirmed to have H5 bird flu and you start to feel sick, call CDPHE at 303-692-2700 (after normal business hours: 303-370-9395). The Department can help you get a flu test and medicine if you need it.If you have questions about sick or dead animals on the farm, ask your farm manager and veterinarian.The CDC sent a team to Colorado. Are they still here?While most of the original deployment team has left the state as of Tuesday, July 30, Colorado continues to have smaller numbers of CDC staff deployed to assist with the state response, according to the state health department. How did H5 bird flu start?The bird flu has been circulating in the migratory bird populations for the last two and a half years. Colorado State Veterinarian Maggie Baldwin said it has historically impacted the state’s poultry operations.“We have seen peaks and valleys of incursions because the virus has come in with migratory birds and typically leaves with migratory birds,” Baldwin said.How does H5 bird flu affect birds?The mortality rates for birds that are infected are between 90 percent and 100 percent. That’s what highly pathogenic avian influenza means: it kills a lot of birds.“They get sick very quickly and die very quickly,” said Colorado Veterinarian Baldwin. For the last two and a half years, we've had single spillover events from wild birds that have been spilling over this virus into our poultry flocks. And what changed significantly is that jump into dairy cattle earlier this year.”Because the virus spreads so widely in birds and can spread to humans, infected poultry flocks, like those in commercial egg operation, are culled or put down. H5 bird flu was first detected among Colorado cattle in April. Since then, nearly 50 percent of Colorado herds have tested positive for the virus. What is going on?Colorado has what the state vet calls “sustained virus” in dairy herds, meaning it’s continually present. It was actually the dairy cows that infected poultry in the state, Baldwin said.“We've had three spillover events into three large commercial flocks. Two of those are confirmed that they are the dairy strain. We're waiting on whole genome sequencing on the last one, but that has impacted three commercial poultry flocks,” Baldwin said. “And so this virus right now is not only challenging and putting strain on our dairy industry, but this spillover from dairy to our poultry industry is what is posing a really significant risk.”Colorado has begun mandatory testing of all cattle in the state to help control the spread of the virus among herds.What is the mandatory testing the state implemented in herds going to tell us?The Colorado Department of Agriculture and CDPHE announced July 23 that they are now requiring dairy farmers to submit weekly samples for testing. Colorado is the first state in the U.S. to implement a testing requirement.The testing is to get a better handle on how widespread the virus is among cattle.“Our goal in implementing the mandatory testing order for the dairies statewide is really to identify what that reservoir of disease is” Baldwin saidBaldwin said that their current process is to place herds that test positive for the virus in quarantine, then work with cattle owners to “implement really strong biosecurity measures to try and prevent further spillover from that herd.”The state is tracking testing on its website.Cows bred for meat do not need to be tested, as H5 bird flu cases have only been confirmed among dairy cattle.What happens with infected milk that has tested positive? Is it disposed of or pasteurized later? Abnormal milk and milk from sick cows is disposed of onsite, according to a spokesperson with the CDPHE. According to the agency, onsite disposal is the safest and most convenient process to ensure there is no further contamination from the virus. If a dairy has the ability to heat treat discarded milk, CDPHE recommends doing that before disposing of it down the drain. In all cases, discarded milk should be disposed of in the farm's sanitary sewer with other on farm liquid wastes, the agency said. Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. Pasteurization eliminates potentially harmful bacteria and viruses, according to the FDA.Back to the poultry problems, what’s happening there?It all started pretty recently, with three flocks needing to be culled in Welc County — the first one was confirmed positive for the virus on July 8. The second one was confirmed on July 16 and the third on July 19. State Veterinarian Baldwin said about 3 million laying hens were killed (or “depopulated” as Baldwin called it). It was more than half of the state’s total inventory of laying hens, she said. There were 5.2 million egg-producing hens in Colorado two years ago. She said two of the facilities where flocks were culled were egg laying operations.“They were, I believe, our two largest egg laying facilities in the state. And the third one was a commercial pullet facility. Pullets are the baby birds before they become laying hens.” Baldwin said.What happens to the farms and facilities that have to kill their flocks?There is compensation and USDA has a program in place. Gov. Jared Polis declared a disaster emergency after the first outbreak was detected at a large commercial egg operation in Weld County. That freed up state resources to help agriculture officials and farmers respond to the situation.“So they are provided indemnity for the lost birds as well as the lost eggs at that facility. And they're also provided compensation for all of the activities associated with response to the disease,” said Baldwin. What about infected birds? How are they disposed of after culling?The decision for disposal in what the state calls a "mass mortality event" is made jointly between USDA, the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the producer, and CDPHE or other local authorities. It is typically a combination of multiple disposal methods that commonly include burial and composting, which follows a very strict and lengthy process to ensure proper decomposition and virus elimination, according to the agency. We know about virus evolution and mutations from the COVID-19 pandemic — how will this virus mutate over time?No one knows, but if the COVID-19 pandemic has taught anything, it’s that viruses can spread widely, around the world, like wildfire and that protective measures can help greatly avoid the worst.You care.You want to know what is really going on these days, especially in Colorado.

Source: USDA/Wikimedia The most highly-consumed animal protein in the U.S. is poultry, primarily chicken, with a 2021 per-capita consumption of 68 lbs. per person. In 2022, the commercial poultry industry contributed an estimated $77 billion to the U.S. farm economy, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs and comparatively low-cost animal protein to hundreds of millions of Americans. These figures highlight a significant economic incentive for maximizing poultry farm productivity. Almost all poultry in the U.S., and increasingly globally, is produced in concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs, which consist of thousands of birds raised in close proximity to one another. In fact, 99% of broilers (chickens sold for meat) in the U.S. are raised in CAFOs—a practice found in most mid- and high-income countries. With the ever-increasing global demand for animal-based protein leading to greater reliance on CAFOs, and poultry being the most-consumed meat globally, biosecurity of this resource is essential. Yet, several biosecurity risks accompany this massive scale and close proximity of production, many of which happen to be microbial in nature (i.e., antimicrobial resistance and zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks). We now recognize that several of the deadliest human pandemics of the 20th and 21st century were zoonotic in origin, including HIV, SARS-COV-1 and 2 and Influenza A 2009. Today, the global poultry supply is under constant threat from highly pathogenic influenza A or HPAI. In 2024, the spillover of a novel, highly pathogenic influenza A virus (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in cows and humans captured global headlines—begging the question: from a food biosecurity standpoint, what is our current understanding of this threat and what is being done to contain it? Understanding Biosecurity Biosecurity risks necessitate complex national systems to ensure food supply safety (that the food that is produced in CAFOs is both safe to consume and that the people who raise and process the animals will be safe from acquiring zoonotic infections) and security (that the animals will be safe from predation and disease so that this component of the food supply chain will be available at a price that people can afford). In the U.S., the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and their corresponding state entities have an essential role in maintaining food biosecurity. Globally, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays a similar role. Understanding pathogen transmission dynamics is an essential part of risk assessment, and, when it comes to avian influenza, flyways are key. Avian Flu and Flyways Migratory, aquatic birds are the major reservoir and an important vector for influenza A viruses. In the Western Hemisphere, these birds migrate from Northern Canada and Alaska to the Caribbean, Central America and as far south as southern Chile. Migrations occur twice a year, from north to south in late-August to early-November, and from south to north between early-March to mid-June, with birds migrating to breeding grounds and for food. There are 4 major flyways over the U.S., and phylogenetic analysis of avian influenza A viruses in migratory birds traveling on North American flyways shows that viral clades tend to be transmitted along flyways rather than across them, meaning that a particular clade of avian influenza is not likely to cross from 1 flyway to another. Migratory bird flyways in North America. Source: North Dakota Game and Fish Department, Public Domain. It is well established that migrating birds are the key vector for HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. Each year, millions of migrating birds on the Atlantic flyway use North Carolina, which produces, 10% of broilers and 13% of turkeys raised in the U.S., as a waystation. During the 2022 spring migration, when the HPAI H5N1 novel clade was first recognized, there was a death toll of approximately half a million broilers (less than 0.5% of production) and 100,000 turkeys (approximately 3%) in North Carolina. These outbreaks occurred in the North Carolina coastal plain region, which is along the Atlantic flyway. As of this writing, 2 additional outbreaks occurred in this same region with the loss of 50,000 turkeys. Although devastating for the individual farmer, the economic loss was modest compared to the loss along other flyways in the U.S., where total losses to avian flu stand at close to 100 million birds (over 97 million poultry have died or been euthanized as a preventive measure, since H5N1 was identified in 2022). The reason why commercial poultry along Atlantic Skyway are relatively spared while poultry have been lost at higher rates along other flyways is unclear. Biosecurity Mitigation of Avian Flu in CAFOs When considering biosecurity measures, the knowledge that migrating birds are an important source of disease and poultry located along flyways are particularly vulnerable to exposure, along with an understanding of the epidemiology of HPAI is crucial. The interaction of wild birds with commercial poultry, the burden and disposal of animal waste, HPAI persistence in the environment and the potential for transmission to other animals and humans are all important factors in the equation. HPAI is highly virulent, causing disseminated infection in poultry with death within 48 hours. The virus can be found in high concentrations in bird feces and body secretions, with transmission mainly occurring by the fecal-oral route or by direct contact. Given the proximity of poultry in CAFOs, the rapid transmission of HPAI is not surprising, and control of infection becomes difficult, if not impossible once a farm has been affected. Therefore, biosecurity measures are 2-fold and involve preventing disease outbreaks in CAFOS in the first place, as well as mitigating the economic damage and spread to other CAFOs, other species and humans when an outbreak does occur. Understanding the epidemiology of avian flu. Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Prevention Preventing infections with HPAI in a poultry CAFO is complicated by the difficulty of segregating broiler and turkey flocks from migrating wild birds. Although poultry are most often in large enclosures, these pens are open to the air, and migrating birds roosting near local bodies of water increase the risk of HPAI exposure to poultry via contaminated secretions or feces. Poultry are not routinely vaccinated against HPAI strains, likely for economic reasons, but promising studies in China showed that an H5-H7 bivalent vaccine reduces infections of H7N9 virus by 93% in broilers. Whether vaccination to prevent HPAI infections in poultry would be effective and could be economically justified remains an open question. However, vaccination of humans who work in poultry houses, along with controlled access to these facilities, can help prevent spillover events and cross-species transmission. Staff should change clothing, especially footwear, before entering the CAFOs, so they will not bring the virus in on clothing from the local environment. Facilities should require strict handwashing practices on entry and departure of the CAFO and provide workers with N-95 masks to help prevent transmission. Additionally, poultry house workers should be vaccinated against human strains of influenza, so they will not infect the birds with human strains. It is well recognized that pandemic influenza A H1N1 (2009) was a reassortment event with human, porcine and avian RNA sequences all being present in this virus. Mitigation If HPAI is detected within a CAFO—typically by the presence of clinical disease, which is identified through the sudden death of poultry—mitigation steps, need to be taken. The major strategy that CAFOs employ is culling (selective killing) of all animals in the house where the outbreak is occurring. Further all poultry within 3 km of the infected CAFO should be closely monitored for illness and additional culling may be performed as needed. Disposal and burial of culled animals is a tedious process that should be approached carefully to prevent continued viral spread from the infected bodies. Culled animals should be buried in 3-meter-deep pits, the size of which is dependent on the number of animals culled. The carcasses, along with bedding, feed, eggs and protective clothing, should be covered with calcium dioxide (lime) then covered with a foot of soil, another layer of calcium dioxide and finally another foot of soil. Decontamination of infected surfaces is another vital, multi-pronged biosecurity step when HPAI is detected within a CAFO. Studies have shown that avian influenza virus can survive for days to up to 5 weeks in infected poultry houses. The highly pathogenic and resilient nature of this virus necessitates the following disinfection and cleaning steps: Disinfect any surface with which infected animals come in contact, bedding or feed, with USDA approved disinfectant and let stand (untouched) for 1 day. After primary disinfection, clean all surfaces with soapy, hot water or steam and apply another round of disinfectant. Let stand for 1 week. Repeat a second round of cleaning and disinfection and let stand for 3 weeks. Making sure that the people involved in the execution of the above mitigation steps (i.e., culling, burial and disinfection), as well as any equipment they use to carry out these procedures, do not “carry” the virus from the CAFO is critical. Therefore, proper disposal of PPE, handwashing/hygiene and disinfection of equipment are also important steps in mitigation. Mitigation is extremely costly. A 2014 HPAI poultry outbreak in the upper Midwest along the Mississippi flyway resulted in the death of 50 million poultry with a cost of $3.3 billion, due to lost production and mitigation costs. It also resulted in a doubling of egg prices during a 9-month period in 2015. Costs of the current HPAI outbreak, with a loss of 97 million poultry, and its impact on egg production, is currently unknown but likely to be substantially higher to producers, which will ultimately result in increased cost and reduced supplies for consumers. Could Avian Flu Cause the Next Pandemic? The most feared human pathogens are those that are highly virulent and easily spread. A highly virulent and transmissible strain of influenza virus is one that the medical, public health and microbiology communities dread. Between 2020 and June 2024, another highly virulent and transmissible virus, SARS-CoV-2, caused close to 1.2 million deaths in the U.S. Only HIV has caused more pandemic related deaths in the U.S. during the modern medicine era. With avian flu causing untold hundreds of millions of deaths in birds, is this likely to be the next cause of a human pandemic? Three things make this unlikely: Although avian influenza H and N types have caused disease in humans over the past 3 decades with very high mortality rates (often reaching over 50%), almost all cases are in individuals who have had direct contact with sick birds. There is no conclusive evidence of person-to-person transmission. Furthermore, there have been only a few thousand human cases reported in those 3 decades. At this time, it appears avian influenza types that infect birds lack fitness in humans, although the ability of the influenza virus to adapt and become more fit in new hosts is of concern. To date, there are several anti-viral agents available to treat influenza; that was not the case for SARS-CoV-2, HIV or even the influenza virus when they were first detected in humans. This means that, today, we are better prepared to combat HPAI and help prevent it from spreading than we were in the past. The development of mRNA vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2 provides a template for rapidly developing a safe and effective vaccine against avian flu variants. Nevertheless, HPAI strains will continue to be a biosecurity concern for the food industry, particularly poultry, and the cost of existing mitigation strategies, from both an economic standpoint, as well as the loss of animal life, necessitate the development of novel biosecurity approaches to combat disease. Avian-origin influenza A virus (H5N1) has been circulating globally since 2020, but its discovery in dairy cattle in 2024 was a first.

For the 2021–22 and 2022–23 influenza seasons, 26 forecasting teams provided national and jurisdiction-specific probabilistic predictions of weekly confirmed influenza hospital admissions for one-to-four weeks ahead. Forecast skill is evaluated using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), relative WIS, and coverage. Six out of 23 models outperform the baseline model across forecast weeks and locations in 2021–22 and 12 out of 18 models in 2022–23. Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble is the 2nd most accurate model measured by WIS in 2021–22 and the 5th most accurate in the 2022–23 season. Forecast skill and 95% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degrade over longer forecast horizons. In this work we demonstrate that while the FluSight ensemble was a robust predictor, even ensembles face challenges during periods of rapid change.

However, they measure influenza activity after it has occurred, and do not directly anticipate future trends to inform risk assessment and healthcare preparedness. To address these limitations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has supported open influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013–14 season4. This collaborative process (named FluSight) has ensured that forecasting targets are relevant to public health. Additionally, forecast data are openly available, which enables transparent evaluation of forecast performance5,6.Originally the FluSight collaboration focused on short-term forecasts of outpatient influenza-like-illness (ILI) rates from ILINet2 and corresponding results have been summarized previously4,5,6. However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in outpatient care-seeking behavior, and the continued co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has further complicated the interpretation of ILI data. In the 2021–22 influenza season, the FluSight forecast target shifted to the weekly number of hospital patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza from the Health and Human Services (HHS) Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity Data System7. This system was created during the COVID-19 pandemic to gather a complete and unified representation of COVID-19 disease outcomes along with other metrics related to healthcare capacity. Hospitals registered with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are required to report daily COVID-19 and influenza information8. Reporting of the influenza data elements, including the previous day’s number of admissions with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection, became mandatory on February 2, 2022,8. Although influenza activity, has been monitored throughout the US for decades through multiple surveillance systems, this dataset is the first with laboratory-confirmed influenza hospital admissions reported systematically across all 50 states and additional territories1,2,3,8.The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the typical timing, intensity, and duration of seasonal influenza activity in the United States and many parts of the world9,10. Influenza activity was very low during the 2020–21 season in the U.S., but activity increased during the 2021–22 season, with activity peaking later in April, May, and early June 2022 and remaining at higher levels than had been reported during these months in previous seasons10. In the 2022-23 influenza season, activity began increasing nationally in early October, earlier than previous seasons2,3,11, and peaked in early December 2022.In this analysis, we summarize the accuracy and reliability of ensemble and component 1- to 4-week ahead forecasts of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospital admissions submitted in real-time during the 2021–22 and 2022-23 seasons. Our objective was to consider potential changes in performance of these forecasts in post-COVID influenza seasons, especially given atypical timing and intensity. By evaluating forecast performance for a new forecast target with limited calibration data, we identify specific areas for forecast improvement.ResultsThe 2021–22 influenza season was characterized by two distinct waves of activity. The first occurred between November 2021 and January 2022 and the second between February and June 2022, though reporting of influenza hospitalizations was not mandatory in the HHS system until February 2, 2022 (see observed data in Fig. 1a). Reported national weekly influenza hospital admissions exceeded 1000 for 22 out of 25 of the forecast weeks (Fig. 1a). Updates to weekly counts from the forecast evaluation period were generally minimal (Supplementary Figs. 2–4), with 94% of updates during the 2021–22 season resulting in changes of under 10 hospitalizations for subnational jurisdictions. There were infrequent larger updates (10 or greater) to reported admissions.Fig. 1: National incident weekly hospital admissions and select forecasts.National weekly observed hospitalizations (black points) along with FluSight ensemble forecasts for four weeks of submissions in the 2021–22 season (a) and seven weeks of submissions in the 2022-23 season (b).

Colored bands indicate 95% prediction intervals for each model. Team forecasts for additional weeks are available in an interactive dashboard12.Full size imageThe 2022-23 influenza season was characterized by an early start, reaching 1000 hospital admissions nationally before October 2022. A sharp increase nationally through October and November led to a peak of 26,600 hospital admissions in early December. Hospital admissions decreased rapidly after December, with 3000 weekly hospital admissions by the end of January, and eventually dropped below 1000 confirmed weekly admissions nationally by May 2023. Weekly numbers of admissions exceeded 1000 for 27 out of 34 of the forecast weeks (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 4). In the 2022–23 season, 83% of updates for weekly admissions resulted in changes of under 10 hospitalizations for subnational jurisdictions. There were infrequent larger updates to reported admissions and often updates occurred within two weeks of initial publication.Models IncludedFor both the 2021–22 and 2022–23 influenza seasons, 26 modeling teams submitted forecasts, and 21 and 16, respectively, were eligible for end-of-season evaluation, not including the FluSight baseline and ensemble models. The number and types of models included in the primary analysis (based on the inclusion criteria) varied across weeks with a range of methodological approaches (see Supplementary Table 1). For the 2021–22 season, a median of 20 included models was submitted (range: 15–21), with most having a statistical component, three mechanistic, and six ensembles of component models. In 2022–23 there was a median of 15 included models (range: 10–16) submitted each week, with many having a statistical component, three mechanistic, and four ensemble models. Top performing models in the 2021–22 season included statistical, mechanistic and ensemble models. In 2022–23, top performing models included mechanistic, statistical, ensemble, and one machine learning model. There were also statistical, mechanistic, AI or machine learning, and ensemble models among models with lower performance across seasons. Modeling teams varied across seasons, with 13 modeling groups having submitted eligible forecasts for both seasons. When only national forecasting targets were considered, no additional teams were included for the 2021–22 season, but two teams, NIH-Flu_ARIMA and ISU_NiemiLab-Flu, met the inclusion criteria for 2022–23 (Supplementary Analysis 3). Visualizations of all forecasts as of the date they were submitted are included in an interactive dashboard12.Relative WISOver the evaluation period, more models outperformed the FluSight baseline model in 2022–23 (12) than in 2021–22 (6) based on relative WIS (Table 1). Within each season, the models that achieved an overall relative WIS less than or equal to one represent a variety of modeling strategies, including a basic quantile autoregression fit, a mechanistic compartmental model with stochastic simulations, an ensemble of time-series baseline models, a random walk model, a random forest ensemble, and the FluSight ensemble (Supplementary Table 1). Similar results were observed when models were evaluated based on absolute error of the median of probabilistic forecasts (see MAE estimates in Table 1).Table 1 Performance metrics for teams meeting inclusion criteriaFull size tableFew teams outperformed the FluSight Ensemble in relative WIS for both seasons. The CMU-TimeSeries model was the only model that outperformed the ensemble for both the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, while the MOBS-GLEAM_FLUH, PSI-DICE, and MIGHTE-Nsemble models outperformed the ensemble only in the 2022–23 season.For both seasons, forecasts from the FluSight Ensemble were ranked among the top 50% of all model forecasts for the same location, date, and target, more than three-fourths of the time (79.73% in 2021–22 and 78.83% in 2022–23) (Fig. 2). Three models consistently ranked in the top 25% for 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, respectively: CMU-TimeSeries (42.47%, 36.14%), PSI-DICE (39.34%, 39.87%), and MOBS-GLEAM_FLUH (38.97%, 50.33%). Several models, seven in 2021–22 and five in 2022–23, had bimodal rank distributions, with a combined majority of their forecasts falling in either the bottom 25% or top 25% (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Standardized rank by season.Standardized rank of weighted interval score (WIS) over all forecast jurisdictions and horizons (1- to 4-week ahead), for the FluSight ensemble and each team submitting at least 75% of the forecast targets (see Table 1 for qualifying teams and season metrics) for the 2021–22 (a) and 2022–23 (b) seasons.Full size imageLog-transformed analysisFor both seasons, the analysis using log-transformed hospitalization counts resulted in the same top five performing teams in terms of absolute and relative WIS. For the 2021–22 season, all teams were ranked the same for the log-transformed and non-transformed analyses. In 2022–23, MIGHTE-Nsemble and PSI-DICE performed better than CMU-TimeSeries for the log-transformed analysis (Table 1 and Supplementary Analysis 2).Relative WIS and Spatial VariationModel performance varied by spatial jurisdiction. For individual states, relative WIS values varied across models ranging from 0.46 to 12.58 in 2021–22 and 0.32 to 12.35 in 2022–23 (Fig. 3). More models, including the ensemble, performed better at the state-level than the baseline in 2022–23 compared to 2021–22. The relative WIS of the FluSight Ensemble had the smallest range of values across all locations from 0.58 to 1.08 in 2021–22 to 0.63 to 1 in 2022–23 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1). To further examine forecast performance across jurisdictions, we considered the percent of jurisdictions that the relative WIS value for a given model and location pair was less than the baseline (i.e., lower than 1). The FluSight Ensemble performed as well as or better than the baseline for all forecast jurisdictions for 2022–23 and 47 out of 52 forecast jurisdictions for 2021–22, a larger number of jurisdictions than any submitted model (Fig. 3). In 2022–23, 12 models performed better than the baseline at the jurisdiction-level at least 50% of the time, compared to five models in 2021–22. In general, the models with lower (better) relative WIS values were consistent between the analysis with all spatial jurisdictions and the analysis considering only national forecast targets for both seasons (Supplementary Analysis 3).Fig. 3: Relative WIS by state and model. State-level WIS values for each team relative to the FluSight baseline model.The range of Relative WIS values below 1, in blue, indicate better performance than the FluSight baseline (white). Relative WIS values above 1, in red, indicate poor performance relative to the FluSight baseline. Teams are ordered on horizontal axis from lowest to highest Relative WIS values for each season, 2021–22 (a) and 2022–23 (b). Analogous jurisdiction-specific relative WIS scores on log transformed counts are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 7.Full size imageAbsolute WISAcross forecasted weeks, the FluSight Ensemble’s worst performance in terms of absolute WIS (maximum values) for 1-week ahead targets occurred on March 19, 2022 for 2021–22 and on November 26, 2022 for 2022–23 (Fig. 4). For the 4-week ahead horizon, maximum absolute values, indicating the worst performance, for each season occurred on June 04, 2022, and December 03, 2022, respectively (Fig. 4). Minimum, or best, absolute WIS values for each season occurred on July 16, 2022, and May 13, 2023, respectively, both during periods of low flu activity.Fig. 4: WIS by model.Time series of log transformed absolute WIS for state and territory targets. Note that the forecast evaluation period translates to 1-week ahead forecast target end dates from February 26–June 25, 2022 (a), and October 22, 2022, to May 20, 2023 (b), and 4-week ahead forecast target end dates from March 19–July 16, 2022 (c), and November 5, 2022–June 10, 2023 (d). Weekly results for the FluSight baseline and ensemble models are shown in red and blue respectively. Results for individual contributing models are shown in light gray.Full size imageCoverageModel performance for the FluSight Ensemble dropped during periods of relatively rapid change (see Figs. 1 and 3). The lowest 1-week horizon 95% value occurred for forecasts with target end dates of March 14, 2022, for 2021–22 and on November 21, 2022, for 2022–23 (Fig. 5). Across forecasted weeks in the 2021–22 season, the FluSight Ensemble had a minimum 95% coverage value at the 1-week horizon of 75%. Lower 95% coverage for the 1-week horizon was observed in the 2022–23 season with a minimum of 29%. The maximum coverage rate achieved by the FluSight Ensemble in any individual week was 100% in both seasons. Minimum FluSight Ensemble 95% coverage values for forecasts at the 4-week horizon in any individual week were 62% for 2021–22 and 15% for 2022–23.Fig. 5: Coverage by model.1 and 4-week ahead 95% coverage for state and territory targets. Note that the forecast evaluation period translates to 1-week ahead forecast target end dates from February 26–June 25, 2022 (a), and October 22, 2022–May 20, 2023 (b), and 4-week ahead forecast target end dates from March 19–July 16, 2022 (c), and November 5, 2022–June 10, 2023 (d). Weekly results for the FluSight baseline and ensemble models are shown in red and blue, respectively. Results for individual contributing models are shown in light gray.Full size imageModel performance, in terms of coverage, tended to decline at longer time horizons for the FluSight Ensemble, baseline, and individual contributed models (see Table 2). Over the forecast weeks, the 2021–22 FluSight ensemble had slightly higher overall 95% coverage values of 89.32%, 86.11%, 85.15%, and 83.33% for the 1 to 4-week ahead horizons respectively, compared to the 2022–23 season during which the FluSight Ensemble had 95% coverage values of 85.79%, 81.64%, 78.78%, and 77.85% for the 1 to 4-week ahead horizons respectively. A similar proportion of models had higher overall 95% coverage values at the 1-week ahead horizon than at the 4-week ahead horizon for 2022–23 (14 of 18 models) and 2021–22 (18 of 23 models) (Table 2). Out of the forecast targets and across forecast weeks, the FluSight Ensemble’s 95% prediction interval contained at least 90% of the corresponding observed values only 55.56% and 64.52% of the time, for 2021–22 and 2022–23, respectively (Table 2). Ideally 95% prediction intervals are just wide enough to capture 95% of eventually observed values.Table 2 One-to-four-week coverage and one-to-four-week percent of coverage above 90% for teams meeting inclusion criteria. One-to-four-week is abbreviated with each number and “Wk” indicates weekFull size tableDiscussionThe 2021–22 influenza season marked the return of from very low levels of seasonal influenza activity observed in the U.S. following the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many components of the 2021–22 and 2022–23 FluSight Forecasting Challenges were new. One of the most substantial changes was the shift from the original FluSight forecasting targets of weekly influenza-like-illness (ILI) percentages to weekly counts of confirmed influenza hospitalizations. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the availability of a new data source, the unified HHS-Protect dataset, which provided information on laboratory-confirmed daily influenza hospitalizations from all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico7,8. Confirmed influenza hospital admissions may more directly inform influenza preparedness and response efforts. During the time period that these forecasting results cover, data were reported daily, with mandatory reporting for influenza admissions from most hospitals in each state, U.S. territories, and D.C starting February 2, 2022. Despite challenges accompanying the shift to the new target of influenza hospitalizations, such as limited historic data from this system for model training, these forecasts provided substantial utility and reinforced a number of lessons learned over the course of previous forecasting activities, both during the pre-pandemic influenza seasons and the COVID-19 pandemic.Forecast performance–accuracyAs demonstrated in this analysis, collaborative forecasting hub approaches provide opportunities to systematically evaluate performance across multiple modeling strategies and enable the creation of ensemble models. Since a particular model’s performance often varies within and across seasons13, it is helpful to have a unified representation of model inputs that can be used to quickly assess expected upcoming trends. Additionally, this work indicates that ensemble models may also provide more consistently reliable and well-calibrated forecasts across spatial jurisdictions.Evaluated models cover mechanistic, statistical, ensemble, and AI or machine learning models (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for additional information). The diversity of model types among the top-performing models was consistent across seasons. In light of this heterogeneity in top-performing model structures and the many dimensions of differences across forecasting model it has not yet been possible to identify particular characteristics of individual models that are most often associated with high performance. Individual models often vary greatly in their performance within and across seasons (Fig. 1c–e). Across the evaluation period for both seasons and all forecast jurisdictions, the FluSight ensemble was among the top 5 performing models in terms of Absolute WIS and Relative WIS. Additionally, when considering forecast performance by rank (Fig. 2), the FluSight ensemble more accurately predicted weekly influenza hospital admissions than most contributed models with the majority of the FluSight ensemble forecasts falling within the top 50% of submitted forecasts (Table 1, Fig. 2). While the PSI-DICE, CMU-TimeSeries, and MOBS-GLEAM_FLUH models have more forecasts in the top 25%, they exhibit higher spatial heterogeneity than the FluSight ensemble in forecast performance (Fig. 3). The generally high accuracy of the FluSight Ensemble relative to that of individual models is consistent with previous findings that ensemble models, that utilize the outputs from multiple teams, generally outperform individual models on average14,15,16,17. Like most models, ensembles may have decreased performance during periods of rapid change when some individual models may have higher accuracy (Fig. 1c, d); however, identifying these time frames and corresponding high-performing models has been difficult a priori5,6.One option to better evaluate forecast performance during periods of change and across multiple magnitudes is to evaluate transformed counts18. We did not find notable differences in model performance using this approach in either season. We expected that there might be a stronger influence on performance in the 2022–2023 season which saw a sharp increase in hospitalizations in fall 2022, but it is possible that models were not able to capture this initial rise and thus did not accrue additional benefit in the log transform score. The long tail of the season may also have elevated scores across all models.Forecast model performance tended to decline over longer time horizons. For both the 2021–22 and 2022–23 FluSight seasons, accuracy declined across the 1–4 week ahead horizons. This trend has been observed previously in multiple forecast activities. The U.S. COVID-19 Forecast Hub observed declines in accuracy for forecasted deaths over periods of 1–4 weeks ahead, and German and Polish COVID-19 forecast efforts also showed declines in performance at the 3- and 4-week ahead horizons19. Accuracy scores were also shown to decline over longer time horizons for influenza-like-illness forecasts13.Across the forecast weeks, individual models often showed larger increases in absolute WIS, while the FluSight ensemble had the smallest range of absolute WIS for each season, demonstrating one aspect of stability for the FluSight ensemble. In terms of state-level performance, the FluSight ensemble tended to be more robust than individual models, as measured by relative WIS scores (Fig. 3). Similarly, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble performed better across all locations, with the COVID-19 Hub ensemble being the only model to outperform the baseline in each of the forecast locations14.Forecast performance – coverageOur analysis found that, as the forecast horizon moved from 1 to 4-weeks, the FluSight ensemble 95% prediction interval coverage declined from 89.61% to 83.74% in 2021–22 and from 85.69% to 77.85% in 2022–23. These results highlight room for improvement in model calibration, as almost all models (with the exception of the UMass trends ensemble) were overconfident in their predictions (Table 2). The lack of comparable historical data for model fitting may have contributed to poor calibration of 95% prediction intervals.Consistent with past forecasting efforts, forecasting remains difficult in periods of rapid change and epidemic turning points (e.g., during initial increases or periods of peaking activity). This analysis highlights declines in forecast accuracy and coverage during periods of rapid change in influenza hospitalizations during both the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons. For example, the only model that had 95% coverage greater than 80% from October to January 2023 when hospitalizations were rapidly increasing and then peaking was LUCompUncertLab-humanjudgment, which did not end up meeting the inclusion criteria for the full season analysis. Analogous declines were also observed for COVID-19 case forecasts20 and mortality forecasts across different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic14, where forecasts systematically underpredicted during periods of increase and overpredicted during periods of decrease.Times of changing dynamics are the most important periods for public health response and communication. While forecasting the magnitude at these times may be less tractable, it is possible that we may be able to provide more reliable information during these difficult forecasting periods so that forecasts are better able to inform critical planning. In general, most ensembles tend to predict less activity than observed when trends are steeply increasing and predict more activity than observed when trends are steeply decreasing, especially when there is between- or within-model uncertainty in the timing of peaks in cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. Thus, it may be possible that an ensemble of forecasts for categorical increases or decreases in activity21 may have additional utility in terms of preserving valuable information while also maintaining the benefits of the use of ensembles over individual models. As such, the FluSight Forecasting Hub added an experimental target in the 2022–23 season for forecasting categorical rate changes in influenza hospitalizations (e.g., probabilities of increase or decrease)22. Assessing the utility of this additional forecast target will be an important area of investigation moving forward. Aside from soliciting a separate forecasting target, it may be possible to determine which forecasting models perform better during different phases of epidemics and then use this information to weight models accordingly when their forecasts are aggregated into an ensemble23.Influenza forecasting in the COVID-19 era: challenges and opportunitiesSeveral challenges for forecasting existed during the 2021–22 and 2022–23 influenza seasons. First, as noted earlier, the change in the forecasting target from outpatient ILI percentages to counts of influenza-associated hospitalizations from a data collection system established during the COVID-19 pandemic meant that there was little data for forecast calibration and training. This shift also required changes in data processing for teams that had produced ILI forecasts previously. While previous data on influenza-associated hospitalizations was available through the FluSurv-NET system, differences in reporting and the spatial resolution, of the FluSurv-NET system may have complicated the process of utilizing this dataset for the purpose of forecasting model calibration. In addition, reporting within the unified HHS-Protect hospitalization dataset changed throughout this forecasting endeavor. For example, the confirmed influenza hospital admissions field only became mandatory for the 2021–22 season on February 2, 2022, leading to an increase in the number of reported hospitalizations and a change in hospital reporting practices during a period of increasing influenza activity.In addition to changing reporting patterns, the COVID-19 pandemic brought other challenges for forecasting influenza, including changing human behavior. The quantity and types of interactions between people likely changed in tandem with perceptions of the risk of illness with COVID-19. In addition, the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., stay-at-home orders, mask-wearing) reduced transmission of other respiratory pathogens9, including influenza. These changes in behavior may be related to the minimal influenza activity observed in the U.S. in the 2020–21 season and the low severity but atypically late influenza season observed in the 2021–22 season. Population-level behavior is difficult to predict, especially in the context of changing public health recommendations and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, which complicates the process of forecasting. Despite these challenges, FluSight forecasting teams provided forecasts of confirmed influenza hospitalizations throughout each season, which helped public health officials anticipate trends during the unusually prolonged influenza season in 2021–22, with forecasting efforts extending into June, and then again for the atypically early 2022–23 season.While the shift to forecasting for a new target presented a modeling challenge, the utility of the corresponding new data source should be recognized24. The HHS-Protect dataset7provided, in addition to the state-level timeseries, facility-level data, which is at a higher spatial resolution than other indicators of influenza activity. During the forecasting time frame analyzed here, the data were also reported daily with previous-day admission data published as soon as the day after their occurrence, providing a timely source of information. As our data update analysis (Supplementary Figs. 2–4) shows, these data demonstrated remarkably stable reporting behavior, particularly during the 2021–22 season, with 94% of updates resulting in changes of under 10 hospitalizations for subnational jurisdictions. Stability of reporting decreased slightly during the 2022–23 season, with 83% of updates resulting in changes of under 10 hospitalizations for subnational jurisdictions. Degraded forecast performance has been associated with large revisions to initially observed values6, and consistency in reporting is an important component of a reliable forecasting target. Additionally, this dataset provided national and jurisdictional-level data for confirmed influenza hospital admissions. In contrast with ILI, this indicator eliminated the need to model outpatient visits associated with co-circulating non-influenza pathogens that can cause ILI. The continued availability of rapid, disease-specific indicators of hospitalization, such as those provided by these data, will facilitate improved forecasting utility and possibly improvements in accuracy25, particularly when forecasts are informed by mechanistic transmission models.The FluSight forecasting collaboration adapted quickly in 2021 to utilize a novel laboratory-confirmed influenza hospital admission dataset. Even with limited calibration data and atypical influenza seasonality in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, the FluSight ensemble forecast provided more robust forecasts than individual component models across spatial jurisdictions and time horizons. This result mirrors those of other forecasting hubs. Collaborative hubs also offer the ability for frequent feedback and interaction between modeling teams, providing opportunities for rapidly sharing observations about underlying data and insights for forecast development26. We observed poor coverage and general performance, especially at the beginning of the 2022–23 season and during other periods of rapid change. Collective insights from these challenges can also inform when forecasts should be interpreted with extra caution. Ongoing availability of the confirmed influenza hospitalization dataset, which covers all states, could improve model calibration and ultimately contribute to the improvement of influenza forecast performance and utility, as well as continued exploration and improvement of forecasting and ensembling methodologies. These improvements are needed, particularly to more accurately capture trends and appropriate levels of uncertainty during times of rapid change.MethodsForecasts of weekly influenza hospital admissions were openly solicited from existing COVID-19 and influenza forecasting networks every Monday from January 10, 2022, through June 20, 2022, for the 2021–22 season. For the 2022–23 season, forecasts were solicited every Monday from October 17, 2022, through January 9, 2023, and then every Tuesday from January 17, 2023, through May 17, 2023. Weeks were defined in terms of MMWR Epiweeks (EW) spanning Sunday to Saturday27. Forecasted jurisdictions included the U.S. national level, all fifty states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico. Forecasts for the Virgin Islands, while requested, were not included in this evaluation due to low reported hospitalization counts and irregular data submission. Each week, forecasting teams were asked to provide jurisdiction-specific point estimates and probabilistic predictions for 1, 2, 3, and 4-week ahead weekly counts of confirmed influenza hospital admissions. A total of 23 quantiles were requested for the probabilistic forecasts: 0.010, 0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.150, …, 0.950, 0.975, and 0.990. Teams were not required to submit forecasts for all four weeks ahead or for all locations. Additional details of the forecast submission process (e.g., file formatting, submission procedures, and required metadata) are provided in the FluSight-forecast-data GitHub Repository22.The FluSight Ensemble model was generated for all forecasted jurisdictions each week using the unweighted median of each quantile among eligible forecasts. Forecasts were considered eligible for inclusion in the ensemble if they were submitted by 11:59 PM ET on the due date and if all requested quantiles were provided. Modeling teams could further designate whether a particular model’s forecasts should be included in the ensemble. If a forecast was designated as “other”, it was not included in the FluSight ensemble and not evaluated in this manuscript.Baseline forecasts and their prediction intervals were generated each week using the ‘quantile baseline’ method in the simplets R package28 based on the incident hospitalizations reported in the previous week, with underlying methodology described as follows. The median prediction of the baseline forecasts is the corresponding target value observed in the previous week, and noise around the median prediction is generated using positive and negative 1-week differences (i.e., differences between consecutive reports) for all prior observations, separately for each jurisdiction. Sampling distributions were truncated to prevent negative values. The same median prediction is used for the 1-through 4-week ahead forecasts. The baseline model’s prediction intervals are generated from a smoothed version of this distribution of differences14,29.For inclusion in this analysis, forecasting teams must have submitted greater than or equal to 75% of the requested targets, for subnational jurisdictions, between the forecast evaluation period of February 21, 2022, to June 20, 2022 (total of 18 weeks) for 2021–22 or October 17, 2022, to May 15, 2023 (total of 30 weeks) for 2022–23. These periods translate to 4-week ahead forecast target end dates of March 19, 2022–July 16, 2022 for the 2021–22 season and November 11, 2022–June 10, 2023 for the 2022–23 season. The start date of the evaluation period for the 2021–22 season was chosen to be the first forecast date following two weeks of mandatory reporting of confirmed influenza hospitalizations8 to minimize the potential effects of reporting changes on forecasts. For 2021-22 and 2022-23, three and 12 models were excluded from the primary analysis, respectively, for not meeting the inclusion criteria.Forecasts were evaluated against the reported number of the previous day’s laboratory-confirmed influenza admissions (Field #34) from the COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries7,8, with data shifted one day earlier to align with admission date and then aggregated to the weekly scale (from Sunday to Saturday)22, using data as of September 12, 2022, for 2021–22 and June 13, 2023, for 2022–23. This dataset is subject to revision by submitting facilities; therefore, we analyzed backfill and revision for each season (Supplementary Analysis 1). For each of the contributed forecasts included in the analysis, values were rounded to more closely relate the values of prediction intervals of forecasts to the reported numbers of hospital admissions. In particular, forecast values for quantiles less than 0.5 were rounded down, values for quantiles greater than 0.5 were rounded up, and values for the 0.5 quantiles were rounded normally. This rounding procedure ensured that teams were not penalized for missing the prediction interval by less than one hospital admission.To evaluate forecast performance across all states, D.C., and Puerto Rico, we primarily used the Weighted Interval Score (WIS). The WIS is a proper score that generates interval scores for probabilistic forecasts provided in the quantile format14,19. Briefly, interval scores are used to account for dispersion, underprediction, and overprediction. Forecasts with lower absolute WIS values are considered more accurate than forecasts with higher absolute WIS values. The relative WIS computes the ratio of average WIS values for each pair of models on the subset of forecasts that both models provided and then normalizes by the mean pairwise WIS ratio for the baseline model (See “Supplementary Methods”). Relative WIS values were calculated using the scoringutils package30. Simple means were calculated for absolute and relative WIS to get a score for each model, location, and season. Median absolute error (MAE) values are also considered for characterizing differences between forecasted and reported weekly hospitalizations14. Unless otherwise specified, forecasts of national hospitalizations were not included in summary metrics for accuracy (e.g., absolute WIS) since these forecasts can have a disproportionate impact on the overall score. To address concerns related to assessing measures of absolute error on a natural scale when forecasts span multiple orders of magnitude18, we performed an analogous analysis on log-transformed hospitalization counts after adding one to all counts to account for zero counts (Supplementary Analysis 2). We also performed a separate analysis including only national forecasts (Supplementary Analysis 3).In addition, we considered coverage values of the quantile-based prediction intervals to assess each model’s ability to appropriately capture uncertainty in forecasts. Coverage values are defined as the percent of observed values that fall within the 50% or 95% prediction intervals for the corresponding date. Ideally, the percent coverage values will be equal to the corresponding prediction interval, e.g., 95% percent prediction intervals should contain the reported value 95% of the time.Comparing model forecasts is complicated by the fact that not all models submit forecasts for each of the forecast targets and for each forecast week in the evaluation period. To partially account for this, we consider the percentage of forecasts submitted as an indicator of how often and how many different types of forecasts were submitted by each team. Following Cramer et al.14, we also consider a standardized rank score that uses the number of models forecasting a particular location and target and then ranks these forecasts. Ranks were determined by relative WIS performance, with the best-performing model for each observation being assigned a rank of 1 and the worst-performing model receiving a rank equal to the number of models submitting a forecast for the observation. These ranks were standardized by rescaling so that 0 corresponds to the worst rank and 1 corresponds to the best rank.All analyses were conducted using the R language for statistical computing (version 4.0.3)31 with scoringutils (version 1.2.2) to generate scores30.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

NIAID/Flickr cc The group made its initial assessment on the US H5N1 developments in May, when it put the level at three, with a caveat that said it may have risen to four, but with low confidence.In the update, the HSA said, "There is high uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the outbreak and there is no apparent reduction in transmission in response to the biosecurity measures that have been introduced to date."Mild zoonotic cases in humans are likely going undetected and unreported, so there isn't enough data to say if the rate is unusually high. So far, the B3.13 genotype is limited to the United States, and hard to gauge whether other genotypes in Europe could trigger similar outbreaks. "Levels are indicators that a zoonotic influenza virus outbreak may be an increasing human health threat, either because the opportunities for it to evolve are increasing or because there is evidence that it has already begun to evolve," the group said.Colorado testing update, more CDC details on latest casesYesterday when it announced two more H5 avian influenza infections in poultry outbreak cullers, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said it would launch a dashboard on confirmed human cases, presumptive positives, and people tested. The dashboard reflects 10 cases, which include nine related to the poultry culling activities and one worker exposed to poultry. So far, about 118 people have been tested for the virus.In other developments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its latest weekly FluView shared a few more details about Colorado's four most recent cases, all of which were linked to the poultry farms. All of the patients had reported their symptoms to the CDPHE during regular active monitoring. The B3.13 genotype infecting dairy cattle is on both of the large poultry farms, and the CDC said genetic sequencing is underway on specimens from the four latest patients. Quick Takes: Measles in Minnesota, new polio cases, liverwurst recall due to potential Listeria News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Measles Polio Listeria Minnesota's health department has reported three measles cases in unvaccinated kids in the Twin Cities metro area, none of whom have any travel history. They are from different counties and don't appear to have any links to each other, suggesting possible community spread in Anoka, Hennepin, and Ramsey counties. The cases were identified on July 22 and 24 and bring the state’s total number of cases in 2024 to 15. All the cases have occurred among unvaccinated children, according to officials, and over 50% have been hospitalized. Two of the three most recent cases required hospitalization. Five countries reported new polio cases this week according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Pakistan reported a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case. Vaccine-derived cases were detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1), Ethiopia (5), Somalia (1), and Yemen (11). This is the ninth WPV1 case reported in Pakistan this year.Boar's Head is recalling about 207,000 pounds of liverwurst due to potential Listeria contamination, after Maryland testing identified the pathogen in an unopened package as part of an outbreak investigation. The company is also recalling additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst. Recalled products were produced between June 11, 2024, and July 17, 2024. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, as of July 25, 2024, 34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths.

Stephanie Soucheray California, Washington report more suspected H5 avian flu cases In related developments, the USDA reported more dairy cow and poultry outbreaks, as Los Angeles Country announced its first H5 wastewater detection. Lisa Schnirring Scientists track emergence of novel H5N1 flu reassortant in Cambodia Since a spillover in October 2023 the novel reassortment has replaced the older clade in Cambodia's poultry. Lisa Schnirring MIS-C much more common in kids not vaccinated against COVID-19, data reveal Among 12- to 17-year-olds, 90% of those with MIS-C were unvaccinated. Stephanie Soucheray CDC expands avian flu testing for farm workers, notes 7% infection rate in those exposed to infected cows The CDC now recommends testing and prophylactic Tamiflu use in asymptomatic workers exposed to sick animals. Lisa Schnirring Four cases of sexually transmitted fungal infection reported in New York The infections were caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes type VII (TMVII), a sexually transmitted fungus that causes ringworm. Chris Dall Canada probes suspected avian flu infection in hospitalized teen The presumed positive infection comes amid a rise in poultry outbreaks in BC and US western states, likely triggered by wild bird migration. Lisa Schnirring Surveys reveal Americans' persistent mistrust in COVID vaccine science The greatest levels of trust were seen among men, those with university degrees and high median outcomes, and those who had lost someone to COVID-19. Mary Van Beusekom Trial shows safety of getting COVID, flu vaccines at same time Over half of participants (57%) reported a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

HPAIV and LPAIV constitute a major threat to the global poultry industry. Therefore, early detection and well-adapted surveillance strategies are of the utmost importance to control the spread of these viruses. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released from living organisms have been investigated over the last decades as a diagnostic strategy. Mass spectrometry instruments can analyze VOCs emitted upon viral infection. Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) enables direct analysis of cell headspace in less than 20 min. As a proof-of-concept study, we investigated the ability of a SIFT-MS coupled sparse Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis analytical workflow to discriminate IAV-infected cells. Supernatants of HPAIV, LPAIV, and control cells were collected from 1 to 72 h post-infection and analyzed using our analytical workflow. At each collection point, VOCs' signatures were first identified based on four independent experiments and then used to discriminate the infectious status of external samples. Our results indicate that the identified VOCs signatures successfully discriminate, as early as 1-h post-infection, infected cells from the control cells and differentiated the HPAIV from the LPAIV infection. These results suggest a virus-dependent VOCs signature. Overall, the external samples' status was identified with 96.67% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97.78% general accuracy.

They are worldwide present in a large diversity of bird species1,2. IAV are classified into subtypes based on their two surface proteins antigenicity, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). H5 and H7 subtypes can mutate from low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) to high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV)3. During the low to high pathogenicity conversion, the HA cleavage site mutate from dibasic to multi-basic, enabling its cleavage by ubiquitous furin-like proteases present in the entire bird organism instead of respiratory and digestive-restricted trypsin-like proteases4.Contrary to LPAIV, HPAIV infections are systemic and characterized by high mortality and transmission rates between birds and from one farm to another. An HPAIV epizootic can cause millions of birth deaths and induces major losses to the poultry industry. Even if LPAIV have a lesser impact on the poultry industry, their surveillance is also essential to prevent reassortment and emergence of new HPAIV subtypes5,6. Early detection and surveillance strategies must be developed to help control the spread of the viruses. In particular, rapid, simple, non-invasive, real-time, cost-effective, and field-deployable strategies must be investigated.Human exhaled breath Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) analysis have successfully discriminated influenza A virus infections from other respiratory diseases such as human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, or enterovirus in patients with flu-like symptoms7,8,9. VOCs changes were associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, but a specific virus-related VOCs signature was found. VOCs changes in exhaled breath of influenza A vaccinated patients have been established within the first two days following the vaccination7,10,11. Exhaled breath has also been studied in animals, such as swine12. In an experimental setting, H1N1-infected swine showed early VOCs pattern modification during asymptomatic infection. Individual or flock animal VOCs monitoring can also be used to detect infection13,14. All these studies strongly suggest that exhaled breath VOCs analysis upon influenza A infection could be an excellent diagnosis strategy. However, breath, animal, and flock VOCs analysis are complex with high host variability. To overcome these difficulties, studies have investigated tissues such as hair, fur, skin, or easy-to-collect samples like urine or feces15,16,17. In vitro studies with infected cell analysis have been the most used strategy to overcome host complexity and high variability for proof-of-concept studies18,19. Cell analysis allowed for rapid and more straightforward biomarker investigation in controlled experimental settings. In fact, VOCs from cell headspace successfully discriminated H1N1 IAV VOCs signature pattern from SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-NL63, or rhinovirus20,21. Prediction model based on selected VOCs signature can present high specificity and sensitivity for the characterization of new samples but also can predict the infection timeline20,21. Finally, it was shown that viruses present unique time-evolving VOCs signature22.In the last decades, gas analysis of VOCs has been developed as an innovative diagnostic strategy15. VOCs analysis has been based on Mass Spectrometry (MS) methods, which allows for the detection of specific biomarkers or infection signatures. VOCs analysis from infected cells headspace to patient exhaled breath have been largely investigated in the last years, with a focus on the exhaled breath as it presents a non-invasive, easy-to-sample detection matrix of infection and fast detection strategy7,8,12,16,22.Virus detection through VOCs biomarkers or infection signature analysis has been largely investigated using gas chromatography MS (GC–MS) strategies as it possesses high sensitivity biomarker detection. However, GC–MS often rely on solid phase microextraction (SPME), implying VOCs concentration and possible selective sampling depending on SPME characteristics23. Also, it is expensive and requires time-consuming steps from sampling preparation to biomarker quantification and identification24. Selected ion flow tube MS (SIFT-MS) technology enables high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatable large VOCs signature from complex gas mixture with no or limited sampling preparation25,26,27. Full scan mode allows for an untargeted large screen of variables which make this strategy well suited for the detection of unknown biomarkers or signatures on the contrary to the more common SIM mode strategy. In fact, SIM mode targets and quantify known compounds by selecting specific reagent and product ions while in full scan mode all precursor ions are used for the analysis. Over the past years, SIFT-MS has been used for real-time and online gas analysis26,27,28,29,30 and even in field utilization as the instrument is transportable31.SIFT-MS analysis is a high throughput technology that can generate a large number of product ions26 for a limited number of samples. Data analysis strategy must be chosen carefully to avoid ill-posed problem (small number of samples but large number of variables)32 observable when the number of variables is much greater than the number of samples33. In addition, univariate methods analysis, such as ANOVA, which considers each variable individually, can lack precise biological phenomena description by missing out variable relation between each other. Multivariate analysis offers the possibility to obtain a more holistic description of the variable's relationship34,35. Supervised multivariate discriminant analysis such as sparse partial least square discriminate analysis (sPLS-DA) allowed for the investigation of variable signatures that describe the best categorical output of samples and enable categorical prediction of external samples based on selected variables36.This study used a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAIV/LPAIV pair to infect chicken cells for cell supernatant headspace VOCs analysis by SIFT-MS coupled with sPLS-DA analysis. Chicken cells were either mock-infected as a control or infected with the HPAIV or LPAIV virus in a total of five independent experiments (Fig. 1). Cell supernatants were collected at various time points from 1 to 72 h post inoculation (HPI), and VOCs were analyzed by SIFT-MS full scan mode. sPLS-DA, from the mixOmics package, was then applied in the first four experiments for sample discrimination based on their infection status and selected VOCs signature34. Product ion signatures were used for the prediction of the infection status of the fifth experiment samples (Fig. 1).Figure 1Overview of the experimental protocol.Full size imageWe aimed to assess the ability of cell supernatant SIFT-MS coupled with sPLS-DA analysis to (1) discriminate IAV infected cells based on their infection status, (2) investigate the precocity of samples discrimination, and (3) predict the status of external samples based on selected VOCs signature. SIFT-MS could potentially represent a new strategy for real-time monitoring of viral infection.Material and methodsVirusesSegment sequences of the A/mulard duck/France/171201g/2017 (H5N8) HPAIV field isolate were used to produce a reversed genetic virus (H5N8/HP) (PUBMED accession number: MK859904 to MK859911). Based on these sequences information, a LPAIV was engineered using a site-directed mutagenesis (H5N8/LP) (PUBMED accession number: MK859926 to MK859933). Briefly, a 9-nucleotide deletion was performed on the HA cleavage site flanked with two single nucleotide polymorphisms37. Both viruses were propagated on 9–11 day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (INRAE, PFIE, Nouzilly, France) by allantoic sac inoculation.Both viruses were genetically identical, except for the sequence encoding the HA cleavage site, allowing us to compare two pathotypes of the same strain.These viruses were produced and used only in biosafety level 3 laboratories at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse (ENVT) France.Viral infection of chicken cell linesDF-1 cell line of chicken embryo fibroblast were provided by the Friedrich Loeffler Institut. DF-1 were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) high glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin–streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.24H prior to infection, 9T-75 flasks were set with 7.106 cells/flask. On the day of infection, cell confluency and homogeneity between flasks were assessed. Flasks were randomly divided in three groups of three for the H5N8/HP, H5N8/LP, and the control group. Infection media was prepared using Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. Infection media was used to prepare the inoculum and to mock viral infection for the control group. Before inoculation, flasks were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10−5. After 1H, all inoculum were removed, and 25.5 mL of fresh infection media was added to each flask.The experiment was repeated in an independent manner five times. The first four were used as training experiments, and the last was used as a test experiment. The test experiment with new cells was performed two months after the training experiment.Cell supernatant collection5.5 mL of cell supernatant was collected at 1H, 6H, 10H, 24H, 48H and 72H. 5 mL were placed in 20 mL glasses vial (ref 180420, BGB Analytik AG, Rohrmattstrasse, Switzerland) with silicone/PTFE septa (Ref 180301, BGB Analytik AG, Rohrmattstrasse, Switerland) and 0.5 mL in 1.5 mL collection tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).Glasses vial were immerged 10 min at 60 °C in a water bath for viral decontamination before being stored at − 20 °C before being used for VOC’s analysis. Collection tubes were stored at − 80 °C before being used for vRNA detection and quantification.RT-qPCR analysisTotal RNA from all collected samples was extracted using the magnetic bead-based kit ID Gene Mag Fast Extraction (Innovative Diagnostics, Grabel, France) associated with the Ideal 96 automated extraction robot (Innovative Diagnostics, Grabel, France) following manufacturer’s instructions. Detection and quantification of viral RNA (vRNA) were performed in a 10µL final volume using the Itaq SYBR green one-step RT-qPCR kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA, USA) following manufacturer instructions with the 5′-GACCTCTGTTACCCAGGGAGCCT-3′ and 5′-GGACAAGCTGCGCTTACCCCT-3′ forward and reverse primers, respectively, specific to both H5 hemagglutinin37. The absence of viral contamination was assessed by performing Itaq SYBR green one-step RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA, USA) using HPAIV and LPAIV specific primers37.vRNA statistical analysisWelsh-adapted t-test was performed for vRNA data analysis.SIFT-MS analysisSample preparationCell supernatant collected at 1H, 10H, 24H 48H, and 72H were selected for SIFT-MS analysis. Samples from all five experiments were injected in separate days. Each experiment samples were injected within 48H, or 72H. The injection order was randomly selected for each experiment.12H before the start of the injection, samples were stored at 6 °C in a refrigerated room. 1H before their injection, samples were placed 30 min at room temperature to allow the VOCs to equilibrate in the vial headspace. Then, they were heated at 37 °C for 30 min in a dry block heater (Ohaus, Parsippany, USA). SIFT-MS injection was made while samples were still heated at 37 °C.SIFT-MS analysisVOCs measurements were performed using a Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometer (SIFT-MS) voice 200 ultra (SYFT Technologies, Christchurch, New Zealand) equipped with a dual polarity source of positive and negative precursor ions (H3O+, NO+, O2+, O−, OH−, O2−, NO2−, and NO3−) set to full scan mode (from 15 to 250 m/z). Each full scan includes four successive full mass scans for a duration of 18 min. For each full mass scan, precursor ions were successively selected by a first quadrupole mass filter and injected to the flow tube with Nitrogen as carrier gas (Alphagaz, Air liquid, 99.9999%, Paris, France). Nitrogen flow rate was set at 2.0 Torr.L/s. Air samples were introduced in the instrument with a flow rate of 0.3 Torr.L/s. Dwell time limit was set to 5 ms. Precursor ions and air samples analytes reaction happened in a 199 °C flow tube kept at 0.006 kPa. The reaction generated product ions with specific mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), which were detected by a second quadrupole mass spectrometer. SIFT-MS was calibrated daily before sample analysis with a standard gas (Air liquid America, Specialty Gases LLC, Plumsteadville PA, USA). The calibration is validated by the instrument if the standard gas (i.e. 1,2,3,4 tetrafluoro benzene, benzene, ethylene, isobutane, octafluorotoluene, p xylene, perfluorobenzen, and toluene) concentration are detected at 2 ppm. Data acquisition and analysis were performed by the LabSyft 1.6.2 software (Syft Technologies, Christchurch, New Zealand).Headspace from the 20 mL glasses vials containing cell supernatants were injected in the SIFT-MS through a customized injection line connected to a 5 mL sterile syringe with a 20G needle. Each sample was also connected to a Nitrogen filled Tedlar bag (ref 22050, Restek, Centre County PA, USA). Three Tedlar bags were used for H5N8/HP, H5N8/LP, and control cells group samples, respectively. Even though the Tedlar bags were not changed for the training experiment samples, the absence of contamination was assessed before each experiment. New ones were used for the test experiment samples.Each day, after the instrument calibration, three blanks were performed, one for each sample group, using the appropriate Tedlar bags and empty 20 mL glasses vials.VOCs analysisGeneral data pre-processingBefore complete statistical analysis, all samples from the five experiments were pre-processed altogether using R Statistical Software version 4.1.138. As full scan mode was set to four full mass scans, each sample presented four signal intensities for each product ion. To insure correct analysis, the first of the four full scan was removed as significantly different form the others. Then, the mean of the three last mass scans was calculated for each sample and each production. Therefore, we obtained only one signal intensity value for each product ions per sample. Secondly, background noise was removed by subtracting each corresponding blank from the samples. Negative obtained values were set to zero.This resulted in an XY matrix with X being the samples (n = 225) and Y the product ions defined based on their precursor ions and m/z value (n = 1888). On these data, 28 ions were removed due to a significant clustering effect (Supp data Table 1).Timepoint specific analysisFive subset matrices were created based on sampling time (1H, 10H, 24H, 48H, or 72H) for discrimination and prediction analysis. For each subset matrix, all variables with an intensity value of 0 for all samples in at least one experiment were removed. Then, we used the Combat function39 from the sva packages40 to remove batch effect from the five experiments.Finally, for all five subsets matrix, data were divided into a training data set and test data sets. The training data set regrouped samples from the first four experiments (n = 36), while the test data tested the samples from the fifth experiment (n = 9).sPLS-DA analysisDespite data pre-processing steps, the number of variables is largely more than the number of samples, which is unappreciated for standard analysis. Therefore, we decided to apply dimension reduction analytical methods. Additionally, as the aim of the study was to investigate sample discrimination based on categorical group and assess prediction samples based on selected variables, we decided to apply sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) using the user-friendly MixOmics package34,36. sPLS-DA was first used to select the most discriminant variables for group discrimination, and then, selected variables were used to predict the test samples.The sPLS-DA parameters were tuned for each time point analysis. However, as all timepoint group samples are homogeneous in terms of number per group and number of groups, cross-validation parameters were set identically between all timepoint analyses. Folds were set to three, validation method to ‘Mfold’, distance to ‘max.dist’, nrepeat to 50.ResultsHPAIV and LPAI vRNA replication in cellsFor cell supernatant headspace VOCs analysis by SIFT-MS, DF-1 cells were infected using the H5N8/HP and H5N8/LP viruses. A total of five independent experiment were performed. Systematically, each infection was performed in triplicate and a control group (mock cells) was used. The samples from the first four experiments were used as training data, and the fifth experiment as test data.Following infection, viral replication was monitored and quantified by RT-qPCR. To allow correct replication of the H5N8/LP, all infection media were complemented with TPCK to investigate viruses or infection-dependent VOCs, and not the replication difference between viruses. RT-qPCR results show that the training samples share high similarities, and the vRNA kinetic pattern between viruses is identical (Fig. 2). Viral RNA was detectable from 10H; the maximum load was reached at 48H and stayed constant until 72H. Viral RNA load was significantly different (p < 0.05), by Welch’s adapted t-test, only at 24H for both training and test samples (Supp data Table 2). Viral RNA load differences between H5N8/HP training and test samples and H5N8/LP training and test samples were found significant at 24H, 48H, and 72H.Figure 2Virus replication monitoring by RT-qPCR over time. Straight lines represent the training data, and the dotted lines represent the test data. For the training and test data, the color code is identical: grey for the control cells, orange for the H5N8/HP samples, and blue for the H5N8/LP samples. Error bars are SEM.Full size imagesPLS-DA analysisSparse Partial Least Square Discriminate Analysis (sPLS-DA) analysis of VOCs was used to assess the possibility of sample discrimination based on their infection status (H5N8/HP, H5N8/LP or control cells), and study the selected variables as a signature (Supp data Table 3) for external samples prediction infection status. Pre-processed data training was used to select the best VOCs signature at each time point.Training data set analysissPLS-DA results show that correct discrimination between groups was possible as early as 1H post-infection (Fig. 3). At 1H, the sPLS-DA three first components all together successfully separated samples (Fig. 3A,B). The control cells group could be discriminated over the infected cells (H5N8/HP and H5N8/LP) using the second components (Fig. 3A,B). At 10H, 24H, 48H, and 72H, the sPLS-DA first two components successfully discriminate the three groups. Systematically, the first component discriminates the H5N8/LP and control cell samples (Fig. 3C–F). H5N8/HP and H5N8/LP samples were discriminated with the first components at 10H, 48H, and, in theory, at 24H, but one sample was out of the 95% confidence ellipse (Fig. 3D). At 72H, H5N8/HP and H5N8/LP samples were discriminated with the second component, while the combination of all two components enabled the discrimination of all three groups. H5N8/HP and control cell groups were discriminated at 10H, 24H, and 48H based on the second component.Figure 3Sample plots from sPLS-DA analysis performed on collected cell supernatants. (A,B) Cell supernatant samples collected at 1H projected into a 2-dimensional space defined by the first two components and by the first and third components, respectively. (C–F) Cell supernatant samples collected at 10H (C), 24H (D), 48H (E), and 72H (F) respectively. The 2-dimensional space is defined by the first two components of the sPLS-DA analysis. Ellipse represents 95% confidence intervals for each group.Full size imageVariable analysisThe sPLS-DA performed on the training data selected the best components with the more appropriate product ions. Sample and selected product ions are represented in a Clustered Image Map (CIM) that enables the visualization of the sample classification per group as well as samples and variables relationship based on the VOCs signature (Fig. 4).Figure 4Clustered Image Map from the sPLS-DA analysis performed on collected cell supernatants. (A–E) Clustered image map obtained from the sPLS-DA analysis performed on the cell supernatant collected at 1H (A), 10H (B), 24H (C), 48H (D), and 72H (E) respectively. Each row corresponds to one sample, from the training samples. Each column corresponds to one selected variable from the sPLS-DA first two components. Colors are defined by infection status: blue for the control cells, grey for the H5N8/LP samples, and orange for the H5N8/HP samples.Full size imageAt all-time points, except at 24H, all samples were correctly grouped by infection status. At 24H, one H5N8/LP sample was associated with the H5N8/HP samples. This is in agreement with Fig. 3D, which present a sample closely related to the H5N8/HP 95% confidence ellipse.Interestingly, the sample dendrogram on the left on the CIM shows that H5N8/LP and control cells sample are closer than H5N8/HP at 1H, 10H, and 72H. Then H5N8/HP and control cells group are closer than H5N8/LP at 24H. At 48H, H5N8/LP and H5N8/HP are closer than control cells.sPLS-DA theoretical performancesCross-validation performed during the variable selection allows the evaluation of the theoretical performances of the model. Therefore, based on the selected components and variables, at each time point, it is possible to predict the classification error rates for external samples. The results, presented in Supp data Table 4, show that error rates per group are low, mostly below 10%.The theoretical performances do not indicate that one group is easier to predict.Test data predictionVOCs selected signature was used to predict the infection status of the test samples as external samples. These samples (n = 9) shared the same pre-processing steps. The results, presented in Table 1, show that all samples were correctly assigned to the good infection status with the exception of one H5N8/HP infected sample, which was classified as control cells at 72H.Table 1 Test data prediction using the select VOCs by sPLS-DA.Full size tableThese results show that at any timepoint, the selected VOCs signature enabled a sensitivity of 100% and a 100% specificity for the 1H to 48H time points and an 83.3% specificity for 72H. At 72H, the general accuracy of the selected signature was calculated to be 88.8%. General accuracy is defined as the probability for an unknown sample to be correctly classified. Additionally, positive and negative prediction values were calculated to be 100% and 75%, respectively.At any time point, no classification error was made between the two viruses (Table 1). The signature strongly differentiated the pathogenicity of the virus used to infect the cells.Finally, statistical analysis of all data regardless of the sampling timepoint and by dividing data into two groups, infected cells, and control group, present a 96.67% sensitivity, 100% specificity, general accuracy of 97.78%, a predictive positive value of 100%, and 93.75% predictive negative value.Conclusion and discussionIn this study, headspace gas analysis of infected and non-infected cells supernatant was analyzed by SIFT-MS coupled with an sPLS-DA data analysis method. The aim was to investigate the ability of VOCs signature for sample discrimination based on their infectious status, the precocity of the possible discrimination, and external sample prediction. Samples discrimination not only aimed to differentiate infected and uninfected samples but also to assess the ability of VOCs to discriminate closely related viruses infection. Therefore, chicken cells were infected by a LPAIV or a HPAIV H5N8. Cells supernatants were collected at 1H, 10H, 24H, 48H, and 72H for both vRNA detection and quantification and SIFT-MS measures. VOCs signatures for sample discrimination and external sample prediction were selected using a sPLS-DA method34 based on the analysis of four independent experiments called training data. Selected VOCs signature at any time points were ultimately used for the prediction of a fifth independent experiment, called test data.The results show a remarkable ability of sample discrimination as early as 1H post-infection. At any time points, the SIFT-MS VOCs analysis did not only discriminate infected cells from uninfected cells but successfully differentiated the two viruses, suggesting that even closely related viruses could be discriminated in the early phase of the infection. Even though viral entry happened during the first hour, and intracellular signaling pathways have ultimately been altered from the control group, knowing that some of the pathways are associated with specific VOCs10,18,22,41, questions are raised regarding potential contamination and unspecific virus and/or viral infection based VOCs. Notably, HPAIV and LPAIV were amplified on embryonated eggs prior to the cell infection. Even though allantoic fluids were diluted at least 10,000 times and only 50 μL of the diluted solution was used for the inoculation, VOCs associated with allantoic fluids could have been detected at the earliest time points. Feuerherd and colleagues used multi-capillary column ion mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS) to investigate cell headspace discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 infection from H1N1 or hCoV-NL63 infections20. By monitoring headspace changes every 12.5 min for 72H, they came to the conclusion that discrimination was possible starting at three days post-infection. This raises questions regarding technology performances or the validity of our results in the early phases of the infection. In the same study, the authors used a decision tree model to predict sample discrimination.The authors revealed that using all data for sample discrimination decreased the discrimination performances (sensitivity and specificity), probably due to viral, not specific cell apoptosis20. These findings align with our prediction performances that decreased at 72H. In fact, nine external samples per time point were classified based on VOCs signature, and only 1 sample was misclassified at 72H. This could suggest a decrease in virus-based VOCs signature specificity.These results, which highlight 100% sensitivity and a global accuracy of 97.78%, suggest that the selected VOCs signature are strong. The performances of the prediction are high. These results suggest that SIFT-MS headspace analysis, coupled with sPLS-DA methods, has a strong capacity for infection detection.Our data tends to validate the utilization of SIFT-MS coupled sPLS-DA analytical workflow for infected cell headspace discrimination. The workflow successfully identified VOCs signature associated with viral infection and, more importantly, this signature was virus-dependent. SIFT-MS enables fast, direct, simple, and cost-effective headspace analysis, which could be an excellent strategy for in-line analysis of viral infection. However, full scan analysis, as used in this study, does not allow for the specific identification of biomarkers in such complex gas mixture. More investigation should be performed to identify biomarkers. In particular, GC–MS technology, despite being less user-friendly and more expensive, is well dedicated to VOCs biomarker identification. VOCs analysis could also be associated with transcriptomic analysis to link VOCs with cell signaling pathways. MixOmics R package34 is designed for multiOmics data analysis and could associate virus-induced transcript to VOCs compounds and product ions. This strategy could better understand the VOCs used by SIFT-MS discriminant analysis.Already, some investigations showed a relationship between VOCs and the TLR318. VOCs signature of airway cells specifically changed upon infection, and these changes were not observed when cells were treated with heat inactivated virus or TLR3 agonist. These suggest that VOCs changes are not associated with the presence of dsRNA or the specific activation of a cellular pathway.VOCs analysis could be a valuable strategy for infection monitoring, first-in-line, for virus production, and then in field. In fact, viral production in the pharmaceutical world is essential for vaccine production. Early in-line detection of infection and surveillance of the replication is important to reduce production costs and increase effectiveness. Our results suggest that SIFT-MS could be directly implemented on a bioreactor for the detection of infection.This work has successfully demonstrated that our SIFT-MS headspace analysis coupled with sPLS-DA approach could select VOCs signature, enabling cell supernatant discrimination between their infection status. The extreme sensitivity of the SIFT-MS and data analysis allows for the discrimination of cells infected with two closely related viruses in terms of sequences and cell pathogenicity. This suggests that VOCs signature can be specifically associated with a single virus. In addition, discrimination happened in the early phases of the infection, even before vRNA could be detected by gold-standard RT-qPCR.More investigation must be pursued to identify VOCs specific biomarkers, but SIFT-MS headspace analyses offer a simple, fast, reliable VOCs based detection of infected samples. This seems to be first required steps before applying this strategy in field where VOCs contamination is important.

Culling operations are under way at two large layer farms, which together have about 3 million birds.Last week, federal health officials said the culling staff is working in sweltering conditions in the poultry barns, which makes personal protective equipment (PPE) less effective and may further spread environmental contamination. They also described a slow, laborious hands-on process for culling the birds that increases worker exposure to the virus.In a July 19 statement, the CDPHE reported an additional confirmed case from the first of the two layer farms where earlier infections were reported. On the same day, the CDC said in an update that it has confirmed H5N1 in the two most recent infections from the first farm. Similar to the earlier cases, workers had mild infections and were offered the antiviral drug oseltamivir, the CDC added.The CDC also said it has uploaded a genetic sequence of the virus from one of the Colorado cullers to public databases. It is closely related to the B3.13 genotype found in recent poultry outbreaks and infected cattle herds. "This is the only virus that CDC has been able to fully sequence out of the cases in Colorado so far," the group said.The virus primarily has avian genetic characteristics and doesn't have changes that increase its ability to infect or spread among humans. It has the same PB2 M631L mammalian adaptation marker seen in nearly all dairy cow sequences and in Michigan's first human case. It did not have the PB2 E627K mutation—linked in the past to adaptation in mammals—that was seen in an earlier human case from Texas.Early data suggest asymptomatic infections unlikelyIn its update, the CDC also detailed initial findings from a Michigan-led seroprevalence study, which has so far looked at blood samples collected in June from 35 people who work on Michigan farms that had H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows. The participants were from multiple counties and had different roles, though all had worked directly with sick cows. Fewer than half said they wore masks or goggles. Researchers tested the blood samples for antibodies to the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus, which might suggest undetected infections. As a control, they also measured antibodies against seasonal flu viruses. None of the 35 workers had antibodies to H5N1, but many had neutralization antibodies to seasonal flu, suggesting prior infection or vaccination. The CDC said the initial findings align with earlier studies from Asia that suggested low H5N1 seroprevalence, even in workers with known exposure. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is continuing the study and working with the CDC to analyze the data and will submit the findings for peer-review publication. The CDC also said it is working with the American Association of Bovine Practitioners to conduct a seroprevalence study in bovine veterinarians, which will take place in 2 months.The number of affected dairy farms continues to rise, with five more outbreaks confirmed, raising the national total to 168 from 13 states, according to the latest update from the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Four of the latest confirmations are from Colorado, with the fifth from Minnesota.

Officials have said heat wave conditions may be contributing to recent infections in poultry cullers. Poultry depopulation is a laborious process, and sweltering conditions in the barns and air movement from industrial fans are thought to be reducing protection from goggles and masks the workers are wearing.On July 20, the state reported the first illness linked to the second farm, which was classified as a presumptive positive. Colorado has now reported nine cases among workers at the two layer farms. The state had earlier reported another case in a dairy farm worker, bringing its total to 10 in recent outbreaks.CDC confirms cases, patients have mild illnessThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today that it has confirmed three H5 avian influenza infections from the second farm. It added that all of the people had been working directly with infected poultry.Patients have mild illness, and all have been offered the antiviral drug oseltamivir.The CDC said the new cases haven't changed its risk assessment for the general public, which remains low. However, it said the latest infections underscore the risk from exposure from infected animals. State officials to launch human case trackerAlso, the CDPHE today said later today it will launch a data table to track human infections. Colorado is currently grappling with ongoing outbreaks affecting dairy cows, and the B13.3 genotype circulating in cows has been confirmed in at least one recent outbreak at a massive layer farm in Colorado, along with a worker on that farm.The CDPHE said it would update the data table by 4 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays and that it will include presumptive positives, confirmed cases, and the approximate number of people tested.More outbreaks in poultry and dairy cowsEarlier this week, the Colorado Department of Agriculture reported a third recent outbreak, this time at a layer pullet facility in Weld County that houses about 300,000 birds. Officials also reported two more outbreaks on dairy farms, raising its total to 51. The avian flu outbreaks have affected nearly half of the states licensed dairy farms. In response to the ongoing escalation, Colorado's state veterinarian ordered mandatory weekly bulk milk testing.

Both quadrivalent and trivalent formulations are clinically safe, and effective. B/Yamagata lineage viruses have not been detected globally since March 2020. Following this change in epidemiology, expert groups have endorsed the exclusion of the B/Yamagata component from influenza vaccine formulations, in alignment with WHO's recommendations for the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere season. Quadrivalent vaccines were previously preferred for children due to the additional protection conferred by the presence of components from both influenza B lineages. NACI no longer has a preference between quadrivalent and trivalent influenza vaccine formulations for children. This updated recommendation supersedes the information found in the recommendations section (Table 2; Children 6 to 23 months of age; Children 2 to 17 years of age) within the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2024–2025. Please refer to the Addendum to the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2024-2025: Transition from Quadrivalent to Trivalent Influenza Vaccines for more information. The Canadian Immunization Guide chapter on influenza vaccines has been updated with guidance from the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2024-2025 and this addendum. Important notice 2: Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Canada and U.S. As of July 2024, multiple outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) have occurred in poultry and wild birds in Canada and the United States (US), with spillover events in dairy cattle in the US. This virus has also spread to numerous other mammals. In the US, 9 humans have acquired mild influenza A(H5Nx) infections from cows and poultry to date in 2024. For updates on the avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak, response activities and other key information, please refer to the following: Public Health Agency of Canada's avian influenza A(H5N1) content and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's current situation summary. NACI reiterates its recommendation that all individuals 6 months of age and older should receive an authorized, age-appropriate seasonal influenza vaccine. This includes those likely to have significant exposure to influenza A(H5N1) through interactions with birds or mammals (such as poultry, livestock, slaughterhouse and processing plant workers, wildlife officersesearchers, and veterinarians). Seasonal influenza vaccines do not provide protection against infection with influenza A(H5N1) viruses. However, they may reduce the risk of seasonal human and influenza A(H5N1) virus co-infection and possible viral reassortment leading to a human-transmissible virus with pandemic potential. NACI will be conducting an evidence review to determine if there is a need to permanently expand its list of individuals for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important (List 1) beyond the current group to others at high risk of exposure to circulating A(H5N1) viruses. This guidance will be updated accordingly based on expert opinion and the results of the evidence review. In the interim, please refer to the PHAC guidance on human health issues related to avian influenza in Canada for more information on this topic.

In addition to burden of disease and vaccine characteristics, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the systematic consideration of programmatic factors in developing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels. The additional factors to be systematically considered by NACI include: economics, ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability. Not all NACI statements will require in-depth analyses of all programmatic factors. While systematic consideration of programmatic factors will be conducted using evidence-informed tools to identify distinct issues that could impact decision-making for recommendation development, only distinct issues identified as being specific to the vaccine or vaccine-preventable disease will be included. This statement contains NACI's independent advice and recommendations, which are based upon the best current available scientific knowledge. This document is being disseminated for information purposes. People administering the vaccine should also be aware of the contents of the relevant product monograph. Recommendations for use and other information set out herein may differ from that set out in the product monographs of the Canadian manufacturers of the vaccines. Manufacturer(s) have sought approval of the vaccines and provided evidence as to its safety and efficacy only when it is used in accordance with the product monographs. NACI members and liaison members conduct themselves within the context of PHAC's Policy on Conflict of Interest, including yearly declaration of potential conflict of interest. Summary of information contained in the NACI statement The following highlights key information for immunization providers on seasonal influenza vaccine. Several influenza vaccines are authorized in Canada and the evidence on influenza immunization is continually evolving. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence and update its recommendations as needed. Please refer to the remainder of the statement for details. What Influenza in humans is a respiratory infection caused primarily by influenza A and B viruses. Seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually in Canada, generally in the late fall and winter months. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza had an annual attack rate estimated at 5 to 10% in adults and 20 to 30% in children worldwideFootnote 1. Most people will recover from influenza within a week to 10 days, but some are at greater risk of severe complications, such as pneumonia. Influenza infection can also worsen certain chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseaseFootnote 2. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) and inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) (which include standard dose [SD], high dose [HD], cell culture-based [cc] or adjuvanted [Adj] vaccines) are all authorized for use in Canada; See Appendix A for a list of abbreviations used in this document for the different influenza vaccines. Influenza vaccines are the best protection against influenza and their benefits outweigh the potential risks following immunization. The safety profile of influenza vaccines has been well established. Reactions following immunization are generally benign and of short duration. Very rarely, some individuals may have allergic reactions to some components of the vaccines currently in use. Monitoring of safety signals related to influenza vaccines is ongoing. Who NACI makes the following recommendations for individual-level and public health program-level decision making. Individual-level recommendations are intended for people wishing to protect themselves from influenza and for vaccine providers advising individual patients about preventing influenza. Program-level recommendations are intended for provinces and territories responsible for making decisions on publicly funded immunization programs. Individual-level and program-level recommendations may differ, as the important factors to consider when recommending a vaccine for a population (e.g., population demographics, economic considerations) may be different than for an individual. Recommendation for individual-level decision making NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine. Patients and health care providers should also be aware that risks are higher in some settings and for some individuals than others. Immunization is particularly important for the following groups (see List 1): People at high risk of severe disease, influenza-related complications, or hospitalization People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk People who provide essential community services (including health care workers) People in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operationsFootnote 3. In infants less than 6 months of age, evidence is lacking to demonstrate that influenza vaccine would be effectiveFootnote 3. Currently, authorized influenza vaccines are not indicated for use in infants less than 6 months of age. For these reasons, NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should not be offered to these infants. Since infants less than 6 months of age are at high risk of influenza-related illness, the influenza vaccine should be offered to individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, and any household contacts and care providers of young infants. Recommendation for public health program-level decision-making The national goal of the annual influenza immunization programs in Canada is to prevent serious illness caused by influenza and its complications, including death. Programmatic decisions to provide influenza vaccination to target populations as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs depend on many factors, such as cost-effectiveness evaluation and other programmatic and operational factors. NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered as a priority to the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important. How The benefits and risks of influenza vaccination should be discussed prior to vaccination, including the risks of not being immunized. Choice of influenza vaccine A variety of influenza vaccines are authorized for use in Canada, some of which are authorized for use only in specific age groups. Furthermore, not all products will necessarily be made available in all jurisdictions and availability of some products as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs may be limited. Dose and route of administration The dose and route of administration vary by influenza vaccine product. See Appendix B for information on characteristics of all influenza vaccines expected to be available for use in Canada for the 2024–2025 influenza season. Schedule NACI recommends that: Adults and children 9 years of age and older should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine each year; and Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have never received the seasonal influenza vaccine in a previous influenza season should be given 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the current season, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have been vaccinated with 1 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in any previous season should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season thereafter. Contraindications For all influenza vaccines (IIV, RIV and LAIV), NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should not be given to: People who have had an anaphylactic reaction to a specific influenza vaccine, or to any of the components of a specific influenza vaccine, with the exception of egg If an individual is found to have an anaphylactic reaction to a component in 1 influenza vaccine, consideration may be given to offering another influenza vaccine that does not contain the implicated component, in consultation with an allergy specialist. For LAIV, in addition to the above-mentioned contraindications, NACI also recommends that LAIV is contraindicated for: People with severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing) or medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to the proposed date of vaccination, due to increased risk of wheezing following administration of LAIV LAIV is not contraindicated for people with a history of stable asthma or recurrent wheeze which is not active. Children less than 24 months of age, due to increased risk of wheezing following administration of LAIV Children 2 to 17 years of age currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy, because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection Pregnant individuals, because it is a live attenuated vaccine and there is a lack of safety data at this time LAIV is not contraindicated in breastfeeding (lactating) individuals however, there are limited data for the use of LAIV in this population. Refer to the Updated Guidance on Influenza Vaccination During Pregnancy for additional information. People who are immunocompromised due to underlying disease and/or therapy, with the exception of children living with stable HIV infection and adequate immune function receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy [HAART] Refer to the Recommendation on the Use of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) in HIV-Infected Individuals for additional information Precautions Influenza vaccination should usually be postponed in people with serious acute illnesses until their symptoms have abated More information on vaccinating individuals during acute illness can be found in the Canadian Immunization Guide's (CIG) section on Contraindications and precautions associated with specific conditions: Acute Illness. NACI generally recommends people who have developed Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination should not receive influenza vaccine unless another cause was found for the GBS. The potential risk for a recurrent episode of GBS associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the benefits of influenza vaccination. For LAIV, NACI additionally recommends precautions for the following situations: In the presence of significant nasal congestion or discharge that might impede delivery of LAIV to the nasopharyngeal mucosa For close contacts of people with severe immune compromising conditions When there is administration of antivirals active against the influenza virus (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir) Contraindications or precautions related to LAIV administration should not be used as a reason to withhold or delay immunization with an alternate vaccine. In such cases, a parenteral inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine can be offered. More information on contraindications and precautions can be found in the vaccine safety and adverse events section and in the influenza vaccines chapter of the Canadian Immunization Guide's section on contraindications and precautions. Concurrent administration with other vaccines Inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccines may be administered concurrently with (i.e., same day) or at any time before or after other inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. NACI recommends that LAIV can be given together with or at any time before or after the administration of any other live attenuated or inactivated vaccine. For information on specific concurrent administration of vaccines with influenza vaccines, refer to the concurrent administration section of the statement. Different injection sites and separate needles and syringes should always be used for concurrent parenteral injections. If multiple injections in the same limb are required, the injection sites should be separated by at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). Why Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccination can help prevent the spread of influenza from person-to-person. Although most people will recover fully from influenza infection in 7 to 10 days, influenza can lead to severe disease, complications, or both, including hospitalization and death. Influenza is a common vaccine preventable disease leading to hospitalization and death in adults. Annual vaccination is required because the specific strains in the vaccine are reviewed each year by WHO and are often changed to provide a better match against the viruses expected to circulate in that given year, and because the body's immune response to influenza vaccination may be transient and may not persist beyond a year Introduction The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides PHAC with annual recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, which reflect identified changes in influenza epidemiology, immunization practices and influenza vaccine products authorized and available for use in Canada. This document, the "National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2024–2025", updates NACI's recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines. For a summary of clinical information on seasonal influenza vaccine administration for vaccine providers, please refer to the influenza vaccine chapter of the Canadian Immunization Guide. New or updated information for 2024–2025 Updated recommendations on the use of influenza vaccines during pregnancy In November 2023, NACI released Updated Guidance on Influenza Vaccination During Pregnancy. This supplemental statement provides an evidence summary on the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccination in pregnant individuals, their developing fetus, and infants under 6 months of age. Overall, the evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines during pregnancy. NACI continues to strongly recommend that inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccines be offered during pregnancy, at any gestational age. NACI also continues to include pregnant individuals among those for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important. Finally, NACI reaffirms its recommendation that influenza vaccination may be given at the same time as, or at any time before or after administration of another vaccine, including the COVID-19 or pertussis vaccine. The vaccine can be given in any trimester. For additional information on the use of influenza vaccines during pregnancy, please refer to the updated NACI guidance on influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Updated recommendations on the use of influenza vaccines in older adults NACI released supplemental guidance on influenza vaccination in adults 65 years of age and older on May 31, 2024. Adults 65 years of age and older are prioritized to receive influenza vaccines because of the increased risks of severe disease in this population. Therefore, NACI continues to include adults 65 years of age and older among those for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important. This supplemental statement provides an evidence summary on the preferential use of 1 or more of the age-appropriate influenza vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older, over other age-appropriate influenza vaccines. A systematic review of the economic literature was also undertaken to inform public health program decision-making. Overall, the evidence supports high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-HD), adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-Adj) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) as having increased benefits as compared to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-SD), with no difference in safety. NACI strongly recommends that IIV-HD, IIV-Adj or RIV should be offered, when available, over other influenza vaccines for adults 65 years of age and older. If a preferred product is not available, any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccines should be used. For additional information, please refer to the NACI supplemental guidance on influenza vaccination in adults 65 years of age and older. Background The World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines are typically available in February of each year for the upcoming season in the Northern Hemisphere. The WHO recommends that 3 influenza strains be included in the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine: 1 influenza A(H1N1), 1 influenza A(H3N2), and 1 influenza B. Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines should contain the 3 strains recommended for the trivalent vaccine, as well as an influenza B virus from the lineage that is not included in the trivalent vaccine. As of September 2023, due to the absence of confirmed detection of naturally occurring B/Yamagata lineage viruses amongst seasonal strains, the WHO has recommended the removal of B/Yamagata antigen as a component of inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines for the Southern Hemisphere 2024 seasonFootnote 4. NACI will continue to monitor the evolving situation and will review the guidance for quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines as additional information becomes available. Health care providers in Canada should offer the seasonal influenza vaccine as soon as feasible after it becomes available in the fall, since seasonal influenza activity may start as early as October in the Northern Hemisphere. Decisions regarding the precise timing of vaccination in a given setting or geographic area should be made according to local epidemiologic factors (influenza activity, timing, and intensity), opportune moments for vaccination, as well as programmatic considerations. Further advice regarding the timing of influenza vaccination programs may be obtained through consultation with local public health agencies. Although vaccination before the onset of the influenza season is strongly preferred, influenza vaccine may still be administered up until the end of the season. Delayed administration may result in lost opportunities to prevent infection from exposures that occur prior to vaccination; therefore, individuals seeking or considering vaccination should be informed that vaccine administered during an influenza outbreak may not provide optimal protection. Vaccine providers should use every opportunity to administer influenza vaccine to individuals at risk who have not already been vaccinated during the current season, even after influenza activity has been documented in the community. Every year, individuals with influenza and influenza-related complications increase the pressures on the healthcare system in the fall and winter months. Particularly during times when other respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19 and RSV, are co-circulating, effective prevention of influenza by vaccination is a critical tool to mitigate ongoing health system stress. Methods Details regarding NACI's evidence-based process for developing a statement are outlined in Evidence-based Recommendations for Immunization: Methods of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. In brief, the broad stages in the preparation of this NACI advisory committee statement included: Knowledge synthesis Synthesis of the body of evidence of benefits and harms, considering the quality of the synthesized evidence and magnitude and certainty of effects observed across the studies Translation of evidence into recommendations Annual influenza vaccine recommendations are developed by the Influenza Working Group (IWG) for consideration by NACI. Recommendation development includes review of a variety of issues including the burden of influenza illness and the target populations for vaccination; safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and effectiveness of influenza vaccines; and vaccine schedules. In addition, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the consideration of programmatic factors in developing their recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels. These programmatic factors include consideration of ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability (EEFA) and cost-effectiveness. NACI uses a published, peer-reviewed framework and evidence-informed tools to ensure that issues related to EEFA are systematically assessed and integrated into its guidance. The NACI Secretariat applied this framework with accompanying evidence-informed tools (Ethics Integrated Filters, Equity Matrix, Feasibility Matrix, Acceptability Matrix) to systematically consider these programmatic factors for the development of clear, comprehensive, appropriate recommendations for timely, transparent decision-making. For details on the development and application of NACI's EEFA Framework and evidence-informed tools, please see A framework for the systematic consideration of ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability in vaccine program recommendations. For details on when and how NACI incorporates economic evidence for vaccine recommendations, please refer to the NACI process for incorporating economic evidence into federal vaccine recommendations. The annual update of the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine led by the NACI Influenza Working Group (IWG) involves a thorough review and evaluation of the literature as well as discussion at the scientific and clinical practice levels. In the preparation of the 2024–2025 seasonal influenza vaccine recommendations, NACI's IWG identified the need for evidence reviews for new topics, and then reviewed and analyzed the available evidence, and proposed new or updated recommendations according to the NACI evidence-based process for developing recommendations. On September 27, 2023, the available evidence and the new recommendations proposed by the IWG were presented for consideration and approval by NACI. Following a thorough review of the evidence, the committee voted on specific recommendations. The description of relevant considerations, rationale for specific decisions, and identified knowledge gaps are described in this statement. Epidemiology Disease description Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza A and B viruses in humans and can cause mild to severe illness, including hospitalization or death. Certain populations, such as young children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions, are at higher risk for serious influenza complications such as viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, and worsening of underlying medical conditions. Infectious agent There are 2 main types of influenza virus that cause seasonal epidemics in humans: A and B. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on 2 surface proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Three (3) subtypes of HA (H1, H2, and H3) and 2 subtypes of NA (N1 and N2) are recognized among influenza A viruses as having caused widespread human disease over the past decades. Immunity to the HA and NA proteins reduces the likelihood of infection and together with immunity to the internal viral proteins, lessens the severity of disease if infection occurs. Influenza B viruses have evolved into 2 antigenically distinct lineages since the mid-1980s, represented by B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses. Viruses from both the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages have contributed variably to influenza illness in previous years. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a reduction in seasonal influenza virus diversity has been observed globallyFootnote 5Footnote 6. In particular, there have been no confirmed naturally occurring cases of B/Yamagata influenza lineage viruses since March 2020Footnote 5Footnote 7. This absence may impact global vaccination strategies and lead to shifts in vaccine composition from quadrivalent to trivalent formulationsFootnote 6Footnote 8. Over time, antigenic variation (antigenic drift) of strains occurs within an influenza A subtype or a B lineage. The possibility of antigenic drift, which may occur in 1 or more influenza virus strains, requires the formulation of seasonal influenza vaccines be re-evaluated annually, with 1 or more vaccine strains changing in most seasons. Transmission Influenza is primarily transmitted by aerosols and droplets spread through coughing or sneezing, and through direct or indirect contact with respiratory secretions. The incubation period of seasonal influenza is usually about 2 days but can range from 1 to 4 daysFootnote 9. Adults may be able to spread influenza to others from 1 day before symptom onset to approximately 5 days after symptoms start. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be infectious longer. Risk factors The people at greatest risk of influenza-related complications are adults and children with chronic health conditions (see List 1), residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities, adults 65 years of age and older, children 0 to 59 months of age, pregnant individuals, and Indigenous Peoples. Seasonal and temporal patterns Influenza activity in Canada is usually low in the late spring and summer, begins to increase over the fall, and peaks in the winter months. Influenza season in Canada usually begins in December and lasts 12 to 16 weeks but can start as early as October or as late as February, and last for as long as 20 weeks. One (1) of more peaks may occur during a season. Although 1 strain often predominates, more than 1 influenza strain typically circulates each season. Spectrum of clinical illness Classically, symptoms of influenza include the sudden onset of fever, cough, and muscle aches. Other common symptoms include headache, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur, especially in children. However, influenza can cause a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic infection through mild acute respiratory illness (a "cold") to severe influenza pneumonia. Most people will recover within a week or 10 days. More rarely, central nervous system manifestations, acute myositis, myocarditis, or pericarditis have been described. In addition, complications including pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiovascular complications, delirium, or worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions may occur. Influenza is also associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in the 7 to 14 days after infection, and with GBS with onset 1 to 6 weeks after infectionFootnote 10Footnote 11. Disease incidence Global Before the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide annual epidemics resulted in approximately 1 billion cases of influenza, 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. The global annual attack rate is estimated to be 5 to 10% in adults and 20 to 30% in childrenFootnote 12. Global influenza circulation was at a historical low during the 2020-2021 influenza season, when public health measures (e.g., masking, social distancing) effectively suppressed seasonal influenza activityFootnote 13Footnote 14Footnote 15. During the 2021-2022 season, influenza activity returned to varying degrees in different jurisdictions. During the 2022-2023 season, global influenza activity appeared to return to circulation patterns resembling pre-pandemic seasons, except for the absence of confirmed detection of B/Yamagata lineage viruses among seasonal influenza strains. The WHO has indicated there have been no confirmed detections of B/Yamagata lineage viruses after March 2020, and, in their opinion, future epidemics of B/Yamagata lineage viruses are probably unlikelyFootnote 4. However, changes in testing associated with the pandemic make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions at this timeFootnote 16. For current international influenza activity information, refer to WHO's Global Influenza Program website. National Together, influenza and pneumonia are ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in CanadaFootnote 17. Nationally, influenza has been estimated to cause approximately 12,200 hospitalizations and approximately 3,500 deaths annuallyFootnote 18Footnote 19. The FluWatch program is Canada's national surveillance system, which monitors the spread of influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) continually throughout the year. In the 5 seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (2014–2015 to 2018-2019 season), an average of 40,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were reported to FluWatch each year. Most influenza infections are not laboratory-confirmed since the illness may be confused with other viral illnesses and many people with ILI do not seek medical care or have viral diagnostic testing done; therefore, the number of cases reported to FluWatch is a significant underestimate of the true number of infections. The burden of influenza-associated illness and death varies every year, depending on various factors such as the type of circulating viruses in the season and the populations affectedFootnote 20. Notably, Canada did not experience a seasonal epidemic in 2020-2021 due to the public health measures that were implemented to reduce COVID-19 transmissionFootnote 13Footnote 14Footnote 15. During the 2021-2022 season, Canada experienced a short influenza epidemic that started in April 2022, which is an unusually late start to the influenza seasonFootnote 21. In the 2022-2023 season, Canada experienced an early, short, and intense influenza epidemic that had a significant impact on infants, children, and adolescentsFootnote 22. Although the potential impact of upcoming influenza seasons in the context of COVID-19 is unknown, future influenza outbreaks may be characterized by higher infection rates and severityFootnote 14Footnote 15. Influenza infection susceptibility may have increased due to lower immunity in the population given the extended periods of decreased influenza exposure and infection caused by the implementation of COVID-19-related public health measuresFootnote 13Footnote 23Footnote 24Footnote 25. Additionally, the resurgence of seasonal influenza may not follow usual seasonal patternsFootnote 26Footnote 27. These 2 occurrences were evident in both the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seasonsFootnote 21Footnote 22. Moreover, in times of co-circulation of COVID-19 and influenza viruses, disease severity in individuals simultaneously infected with both may be exacerbatedFootnote 28. Information about current influenza activity can be found on the FluWatch website. Seasonal influenza vaccines Vaccine products authorized for use in Canada The following sections describe the influenza vaccine products that are authorized for use in Canada for the 2024–2025 season. All influenza vaccines available in Canada have been authorized by Health Canada. However, not all products authorized for use are available in the marketplace. The vaccine manufacturers determine whether they will make any or all of their products available in each market. Provincial and territorial health authorities then determine which of the products available for purchase will be used in their respective publicly funded influenza immunization programs and for which population groups. Not all products will be made available in all jurisdictions and availability of some products may be limited. Officials in individual provinces and territories should be consulted regarding the products available in individual jurisdictions. The antigenic characteristics of circulating influenza virus strains provide the basis for selecting the strains included in each year's vaccine. Vaccine selection by the WHO generally occurs in February for the fall's Northern Hemisphere influenza season to allow time for the vaccine manufacturers to produce the required quantity of vaccine. All manufacturers that distribute influenza vaccine products in Canada confirm to Health Canada that the vaccines to be marketed in Canada for the upcoming influenza season contain the WHO's recommended antigenic strains for the Northern Hemisphere. Vaccine producers may use antigenically equivalent strains because of their growth properties. The strains recommended for egg-based products may differ somewhat from the strains chosen for cell-culture based products to account for differences in the production platforms. As of September 2023, the WHO has recommended the removal of B/Yamagata antigen as a component of inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines for the Southern Hemisphere 2024 season and consequent transition from quadrivalent to trivalent influenza vaccine formulations as soon as possible. The main impetus for this change is the absence of confirmed detection of naturally occurring B/Yamagata lineage viruses among seasonal influenza strains and concerns regarding the theoretical risk of reintroducing the potentially extinct virus lineage into the population through reassortment of vaccine virus with wild-type circulating virusesFootnote 4. NACI will continue to monitor the evolving situation and is planning to review the guidance for quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines next year, as additional information becomes available regarding potential changes to influenza vaccine formulations for the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere season. There are 3 categories of influenza vaccine authorized for use in Canada: IIV, RIV, and LAIV. Trivalent (3-strain) vaccines contain 1 A(H1N1) strain, 1 A(H3N2) strain, and 1 influenza B strain from 1 of the 2 lineages. Quadrivalent (4-strain) vaccines contain the strains in the trivalent vaccine plus an influenza B strain from the other lineage. Most influenza vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada are made from influenza viruses grown in chicken eggs. However, there are 2 exceptions. The influenza viruses used to produce Flucelvax Quad are propagated in a mammalian cell line (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney [MDCK] cells), while the Supemtek vaccine technology uses recombinant HA produced in a proprietary insect cell line using a baculovirus vector for protein expression. A summary of the characteristics of influenza vaccines available in Canada during the 2024–2025 influenza season can be found in Appendix B. For complete prescribing information, readers should consult the product monographs available through Health Canada's Drug Product Database. Should additional vaccine preparations become available for use in Canada after the release of this statement and prior to the 2024-2025 influenza vaccine season, NACI will communicate relevant information regarding the new vaccine preparations if required. Refer to Contents of immunizing agents available for use in Canada in Part 1 of the CIG for a list of all vaccines authorized for use in Canada. Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) IIVs contain standardized amounts of the HA protein from representative seed strains of the 2 human influenza A subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1) and either 1 (for trivalent vaccines) or both (for quadrivalent vaccines) of the 2 influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata). IIVs currently authorized for use in Canada are a mix of split virus and subunit vaccines, both consisting of disrupted virus particles. In split virus vaccines, the virus has been disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components. The amount of neuraminidase (NA) in the vaccines is not standardized and not reported. HA-based serum antibody produced to 1 influenza A subtype provides no protection against strains belonging to another subtype. The potential for trivalent vaccine to stimulate antibody protection across B lineages requires further evaluation and may be dependent upon factors such as age and prior antigenic experience with the 2 B lineagesFootnote 29Footnote 30Footnote 31Footnote 32Footnote 33Footnote 34. All IIVs currently available in Canada are produced in eggs, except for Flucelvax Quad (IIV4-cc), which is a mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent inactivated, subunit influenza vaccine that is prepared from viruses propagated in mammalian cell lines [proprietary 33016-PF Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell lines] adapted to grow freely in suspension in culture medium. The production of IIV4-cc does not depend on egg supply as it does not require egg-grown candidate vaccine viruses. The IIVs available in Canada are in a standard dose formulation or in a formulation designed to enhance the immune response in specific age groups, using a higher dose of HA antigen or the inclusion of an adjuvant. Refer to Basic immunology and vaccinology in Part 1 of the CIG for more information about inactivated vaccines. Standard-dose IIVs currently available in Canada are quadrivalent formulations (IIV4-SD: Afluria® Tetra, Flulaval® Tetra, Fluzone Quadrivalent, and Influvac Tetra; IIV4-cc: Flucelvax Quad). These vaccines are un-adjuvanted, contain a standard dose of antigen (15 µg HA per strain), and are administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection. Influvac Tetra may be administered by IM or deep subcutaneous injection. The adjuvanted IIV currently authorized for use in Canada is a trivalent subunit vaccine (IIV3-Adj) that contains the adjuvant MF59, which is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene as the oil phase that is stabilized with the surfactants polysorbate 80 and sorbitan triolate in citrate buffer. IIV3-Adj contains 7.5 µg HA per strain administered as a 0.25 mL dose by IM injection for children 6 to 23 months of age (Fluad Pediatric) or 15 µg HA per strain administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection for adults 65 years of age and older (Fluad). Other IIVs do not contain an adjuvant. There is 1 high-dose IIV (IIV-HD) currently authorized for use in Canada/: Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD), a quadrivalent unadjuvanted, split virus seasonal influenza vaccine containing 60 µg HA per strain and administered as a 0.7 mL dose by IM injection for adults 65 years and older. Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) There is currently 1 RIV authorized for use in Canada/: Supemtek (RIV4), a quadrivalent adjuvanted, baculovirus-expressed seasonal influenza vaccine that contains 45 µg HA per strain and is administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection for adults 18 years of age and older. RIV contains recombinant HAs produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses. The production of RIV does not depend on egg supply as it does not require egg-grown candidate vaccine viruses. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) LAIV contains standardized quantities of fluorescent focus units (FFU) of live attenuated influenza virus reassortants. As a live replicating whole virus formulation administered intranasally by spray, it elicits mucosal immunity, which may more closely mimic natural infection. The virus strains in LAIV are cold-adapted and temperature sensitive, so they replicate in the nasal mucosa rather than the lower respiratory tract, and they are attenuated, so they do not produce ILI. There have been no reported or documented cases, and no theoretical or scientific basis to suggest transmission of vaccine virus would occur to the individual administering LAIV. In rare instances, shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated persons. There is currently 1 LAIV authorized for use in Canada for children 2 to 17 years of age and adults 18 to 59 years of age: FluMist® Quadrivalent (LAIV4), a quadrivalent nasal spray influenza vaccine given as a 0.2 mL dose (0.1 mL in each nostril). Efficacy, effectiveness, and immunogenicity Efficacy and effectiveness Influenza vaccine has been shown in randomized controlled clinical trials to be efficacious in providing protection against influenza infection and illness. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine—that is, how it performs in settings that are more reflective of usual health care practice—can vary from season to season and by influenza vaccine strain type and subtype. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) depends on how well the vaccine strains match with circulating influenza viruses, the type and subtype of the circulating virus, as well as the health and age of the individual receiving the vaccine. Even when there is a less-than-ideal match or lower VE against 1 strain, the possibility of lower VE should not preclude vaccination, particularly for people at high risk of influenza-related complications and hospitalization, since vaccinated individuals are still more likely to be protected compared to those who are unvaccinated. Influenza infection has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke, especially among individuals with pre-existing cardiac disordersFootnote 35Footnote 36Footnote 37Footnote 38. In addition to the prevention of influenza infection, influenza vaccination may also have a secondary protective effect against the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in those who are at high risk of CVDFootnote 39Footnote 40Footnote 41Footnote 42Footnote 43. Research is ongoing in this area. Immunogenicity Antibody response after vaccination depends on several factors, including the age of the recipient, prior and subsequent exposure to antigens, and the presence of immune compromising conditions. Protective levels of humoral antibodies, which correlate with protection against influenza infection, are generally achieved by 2 weeks after vaccination; however, there may be some protection afforded before that time. Additional information Refer to Appendix C for further information on the efficacy and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccines that are authorized for use in Canada by type: IIV, RIV and LAIV. Because of potential changes in the circulating influenza virus from year to year and waning immunity in vaccine recipients, annual influenza vaccination is recommended. Although some studies suggest vaccine induced protection may be greater in individuals who have no recent vaccine history, overall, the evidence shows no difference in the VE of repeated influenza vaccination compared to vaccination in the current season only. Importantly, optimal protection against influenza is best achieved through annual influenza vaccination, as repeated vaccination including the current season is consistently more effective than no vaccination in the current seasonFootnote 44Footnote 45. Additional information regarding the effects of repeated influenza vaccination on vaccine effectiveness, efficacy, and immunogenicity can be found in the NACI Recommendation on Repeated Seasonal Influenza Vaccination. NACI will continue to monitor this issue. NACI acknowledges that evidence related to influenza vaccine performance, particularly with respect to vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, is constantly evolving with advances in research methodology and accumulation of data over many influenza seasons. Therefore, the evidence summarized in Appendix C may not include the latest studies. However, NACI continues to closely monitor the emerging evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccines to update and make recommendations when warranted. Vaccine administration Dose, route of administration, and schedule With the variety of influenza vaccines available for use in Canada, it is important for vaccine providers to note the specific differences in age indication, route of administration, dosage, and schedule for the products that they will be using (see Table 1). Key relevant details and differences between vaccine products are also highlighted in Appendix B. For influenza vaccines given by the IM route, the anterolateral thigh muscle is the recommended site in infants 6 to 12 months of age. The anterolateral thigh or the deltoid muscle can be used for toddlers and older children. The deltoid muscle of the arm is the preferred injection site in adolescents and adults. For more information on vaccine administration, please refer to Vaccine administration practices in Part 1 of the CIG. The first time that children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receive seasonal influenza vaccination, a 2-dose schedule is required to achieve protectionFootnote 46Footnote 47Footnote 48. Several studies have looked at whether these 2 initial doses need to be given in the same seasonFootnote 31Footnote 32Footnote 49. Englund et al. reported similar immunogenicity in children 6 to 23 months of age whether 2 doses were given in the same or separate seasons when there was no change, or only minor vaccine strain change, in vaccine formulation between seasonsFootnote 31Footnote 32. However, seroprotection rates to the B component were considerably reduced in the group that received only 1 dose in the subsequent season when there was a major B lineage change, suggesting that the major change in B virus lineage reduced the priming benefit of previous vaccinationFootnote 30Footnote 32. Issues related to effective prime-boost when there is a major change in influenza B lineage across sequential seasons require further evaluationFootnote 50. Because children 6 to 23 months of age are less likely to have had prior priming exposure to an influenza virus, special effort is warranted to ensure that a 2-dose schedule is followed for previously unvaccinated children in this age group.

For more information, refer to Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012. Return to Table 1 Footnote h referrer Table 1 - Footnote i Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receiving seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time in their life should be given 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have been properly vaccinated with 1 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in the past should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season thereafter. Return to Table 1 Footnote i referrer Booster doses and revaccination Booster doses are not required within the same influenza season. However, children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have not previously received the seasonal influenza vaccine require 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum of 4 weeks between doses. Only 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season is recommended for everyone else. Two (2) doses of influenza vaccine in the same season do not appear to improve the immune response to the vaccine compared to 1 dose in older adultsFootnote 51. Serological testing Serologic testing is not necessary or recommended before or after receiving seasonal influenza vaccine. Storage requirements Influenza vaccine should be stored at +2°C to +8°C and should not be frozen. Refer to the individual product monographs for further details. Refer to Storage and handling of immunizing agents in Part 1 of the CIG for additional information. Concurrent administration with other vaccines All seasonal influenza vaccines, including LAIV, may be given at the same time as, or at any time before or after administration of other vaccines (either live or inactivated), including COVID-19 vaccines for those aged 6 months of age and older. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence base, including ongoing and anticipated trials investigating influenza vaccines administered at the same time as, or any time before or after, COVID-19 vaccines and update its recommendations as needed. Refer to the COVID-19 vaccine: CIG chapter and latest NACI COVID-19 vaccine guidance for any additional emerging guidance on concurrent administration with COVID-19 vaccines as new products are authorized or there are COVID-19 age eligibility expansions. No studies were found on potential immune interference between LAIV and other live attenuated vaccines (oral or parenteral) administered within 4 weeks. Studies on concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV); or live oral polio vaccines did not find evidence of clinically significant immune interferenceFootnote 52Footnote 53Footnote 54. One (1) study reported a statistically significant but not clinically meaningful decrease in seroresponse rates to rubella antigen when administered concomitantly with LAIV. In theory, the administration of 2 live vaccines sequentially within less than 4 weeks could reduce the efficacy of the second vaccine. Possible immune mechanisms include: the inhibitory and immunomodulatory effects of systemic and locally produced cytokines on B- and T-cell response and viral replication; immunosuppression induced by certain viruses (such as measles); and direct viral interference as a result of competition for a common niche. Mucosal vaccines may have less impact on a parenteral vaccine and vice versa. The immune response with a mucosal vaccine may be compartmentalized to the mucosa while that to a parenteral vaccine is systemic. It is likely that there is some interaction between the systemic and mucosal compartments; however, the extent to which this interaction occurs is not known. Given the lack of data for immune interference, and based on expert opinion, NACI recommends that LAIV can be given together with or at any time before or after the administration of any other live attenuated or inactivated vaccine. While some vaccine providers have given LAIV and other live vaccines separated by at least 4 weeks based on the theoretical possibility of immune interference, NACI does not believe that this precaution is necessary for LAIV. The use of a parenteral inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine would avoid this theoretical concern. Note that the timing rules related to 2 parenteral live vaccines (e.g., MMR and varicella vaccines) still apply. For more information regarding vaccination administration timing rules, please refer to Timing of vaccine administration in Part 1 of the CIG. The target groups for influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines overlap considerably. A recent study showed that compared to administration alone, concurrent administration of IIV4 with Pneu-C-15 in adults demonstrated non-inferiority of pneumococcal- and influenza-specific antibody responsesFootnote 55. The immune response to many pneumococcal vaccine components was decreased, but not influenza virus components. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known precisely. Vaccine providers should take the opportunity to vaccinate eligible people against pneumococcal disease when influenza vaccine is given. NACI guidance as of December 2022 outlines that administration of COVID-19 vaccines may occur at the same time as, or at any time before or after influenza immunization (including all parenteral or intranasal seasonal influenza vaccines) for those aged 6 months of age and older. Readers should consult the COVID-19 vaccine: CIG chapter for updated NACI guidance and further information on concurrent administration of COVID-19 vaccines with influenza vaccines and across all eligible age groups. When more than 1 injection is given at a single clinic visit, it is preferable to administer them in different limbs. If it is not possible to do so, injections given in 1 limb should be separated by a distance of at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). A separate needle and syringe should always be used for each injection. Concurrent administration with other adjuvanted vaccines Data are limited regarding concurrent administration of newer adjuvanted influenza vaccines with other adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccines. RZV is an example of a recombinant adjuvanted subunit herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix®, GlaxoSmithKline) that is authorized for use in Canada in adults 50 years of age and older, and adults 18 years of age or older who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy; therefore, the target age group for herpes zoster vaccine and influenza vaccine overlap. RZV has been shown to be safe and effective when given concurrently with unadjuvanted, standard dose influenza vaccinesFootnote 56. However, no studies have been conducted that have assessed the concurrent administration of RZV with adjuvanted or high dose influenza vaccineFootnote 57. It should be noted that RZV and IIV-Adj currently authorized for use in Canada contain the adjuvants AS01B and MF59, respectively. How these adjuvants may interact when RZV and IIV-Adj are administered concurrently is not known. NACI will continue to review the evidence and update guidance accordingly. Vaccine safety and adverse events Post-marketing surveillance of influenza vaccines in Canada has shown that seasonal influenza vaccines have a safe and stable profile. In addition to routine surveillance, every year during the seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns, PHAC and the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Vaccine Vigilance Working Group (VVWG) of the Canadian Immunization Committee conduct weekly expedited surveillance of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for current influenza vaccines to identify vaccine safety signals in a timely manner. Refer to the section Guidance on reporting adverse events following immunization below for more information on mandatory reporting of AEFIs. Refer to the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) web page for more information on post-marketing surveillance and AEFIs in Canada. In addition, the Canadian National Vaccine Safety (CANVAS) Network, a national network of sites across Canada for active vaccine safety surveillance, collects and analyzes information on AEFIs after influenza vaccination to provide influenza vaccine safety information to public health authorities during the core weeks of the annual influenza vaccination campaign. All influenza vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada are considered safe for use in people with latex allergies. The multi-dose vial formulations of inactivated influenza vaccine that are authorized for use in Canada contain minute quantities of thimerosal, which is used as a preservativeFootnote 58Footnote 59 to keep the product sterile. Large cohort studies of administrative health databases have found no association between childhood vaccination with thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autistic-spectrum disordersFootnote 60. All single dose formulations of IIV, RIV and LAIV are thimerosal-free. Refer to Vaccine safety and pharmacovigilance in Part 2 of the CIG for additional information. Common adverse events With IM administered influenza vaccines, injection site reactions are common but are generally classified as mild and transient. IIV-Adj tends to produce more extensive injection site reactions than un-adjuvanted IIV, but these reactions are also generally mild and resolve spontaneously within a few days. IIV-HD tends to induce higher rates of systemic reactions compared to IIV-SD, but most of these reactions are mild and short-lived. Recombinant vaccines appear to have a similar safety profile to IIVs. The most common adverse events (AE) experienced by recipients of LAIV are nasal congestion and runny nose. Less common and serious or severe adverse events Serious adverse events (SAEs) are rare following influenza vaccination, and in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association. Allergic responses to influenza vaccine are a rare consequence of hypersensitivity to some components of the vaccine or its container. Other reported adverse events and conditions Egg-allergic individuals After careful review of clinical and post-licensure safety data, NACI has concluded that egg-allergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using any influenza vaccine, including egg-based vaccines and LAIV, without prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg and without any particular consideration, including vaccination setting. The amount of trace ovalbumin allowed in influenza vaccines that are authorized for use in Canada is associated with a low risk of AE, and in addition, 2 of the authorized products (i.e., IIV-cc and RIV) do not contain any ovalbumin. For more guidance on vaccinating egg-allergic individuals, refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 and the egg allergy LAIV addendum for safety data supporting this recommendation for IIV and LAIV.The observation period post-vaccination is as recommended in Vaccine safety and pharmacovigilance in Part 2 of the CIG. As with all vaccine administration, vaccine providers should be prepared with the necessary equipment, knowledge, and skills to respond to allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, at all times. Guillain-Barré syndrome In a review of studies conducted between 1976 and 2005, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that the 1976 "swine flu" vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of GBS. However, evidence was inadequate to accept or to reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccinationFootnote 61. The attributable risk of GBS in the period following seasonal and monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza vaccination is about 1 excess case per million vaccinationsFootnote 62Footnote 63. In a self-controlled study that explored the risk of GBS after seasonal influenza vaccination and after influenza health care encounters (a proxy for influenza illness), the attributable risks were 1.03 GBS admissions per million vaccinations compared with 17.2 GBS admissions per million influenza-coded health care encountersFootnote 47Footnote 63. These findings suggest that both influenza vaccination and influenza illness are associated with small attributable risks of GBS, but the risk of GBS associated with influenza illness is notably higher than with influenza vaccination. The self-controlled study also found that the risk of GBS after vaccination was highest during weeks 2 to 4, whereas for influenza illness, the risk was greatest within the first week after a health care encounter and decreased thereafter but remained significantly elevated for up to 4 weeks. Although the evidence considering influenza vaccination and GBS is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccination, avoiding subsequent influenza vaccination of individuals known to have had GBS without other known etiology within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination appears prudent at this time. However, the potential risk of GBS recurrence associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the other benefits of influenza vaccinationFootnote 48Footnote 49Footnote 50Footnote 51Footnote 64Footnote 65Footnote 66Footnote 67. Oculorespiratory syndrome Oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS), the presence of bilateral red eyes and 1 or more associated respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or sore throat) that starts within 24 hours of vaccination, with or without facial oedema, was identified during the 2000–2001 influenza seasonFootnote 68. Since then, there have been far fewer cases per year reported to CAEFISSFootnote 69. ORS is not an allergic response. People who have an occurrence or recurrence of ORS upon vaccination do not necessarily experience further episodes with future vaccinations. Individuals who have experienced ORS without lower respiratory tract symptoms may be safely revaccinated with influenza vaccine. Individuals who experienced ORS with lower respiratory tract symptoms should have an expert review. Health care providers who are unsure whether an individual previously experienced ORS versus an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity immune response should seek advice. Data on clinically significant AEs do not support the preference of 1 vaccine product over another when revaccinating those who have previously experienced ORS. Allergic reactions to previous vaccine doses Expert review of the benefits and risks of vaccination should be sought for those who have previously experienced severe lower respiratory symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) within 24 hours of influenza vaccination, an apparent significant allergic reaction to the vaccine, or any other symptoms that could indicate a significant allergic reaction (e.g., throat constriction, difficulty swallowing) that raise concern regarding the safety of revaccination. This advice may be obtained from experts in infectious disease, allergy, and immunology, or public health that can be found in various health settings, including the Special Immunization Clinic (SIC) network. In view of the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and rarity of true vaccine allergy, a diagnosis of allergy to an influenza vaccine should not be made without confirmation, which may involve consultation with an allergy or immunology expert. Drug interactions Although influenza vaccine can inhibit the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, clinical studies have not shown any adverse effects attributable to these drugs in people receiving influenza vaccine. Statins have effects on the immune system in addition to their therapeutic cholesterol-lowering actions. Two (2) published studies have found that adults who are regular statin users (at least 65 years of ageFootnote 70 in 1 study and 45 years and older in the otherFootnote 71) had a decreased response to influenza vaccination as measured by reduced geometric mean titres (GMT)Footnote 70 or reduced VE against medically attended acute respiratory illnessFootnote 71. Statins are widely used in the same adult populations who are also at-risk for influenza-related complications and hospitalizations. Therefore, if these preliminary findings are confirmed in future studies, concurrent statin use in adult populations could have implications for influenza VE and how this use is assessed in the measurement of VE. NACI will continue to monitor the literature related to this issue. Antiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir) may inactivate the replicating vaccine virus contained in LAIV. Administration of LAIV should be postponed until 48 hours after the last dose of an antiviral. If these antiviral agents are required for clinical management of an infection within 2 weeks after receiving a dose of LAIV vaccine, re-vaccination should take place either at least 48 hours after the antivirals are stopped or another influenza vaccine (inactivated or recombinant) can be administrated at any time. Guidance on reporting adverse events following immunization To ensure the ongoing safety of influenza vaccines in Canada, reporting of AEFIs by vaccine providers and other clinicians is critical, and in most jurisdictions, reporting is mandatory under the law. An AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that follows vaccination whether or not there is a causal relationship with the usage of a vaccine. The AEFI may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease. Any AEFI temporally related to vaccination and for which there is no other clear cause at the time of reporting should be reported. Vaccine providers are asked to report AEFIs through local public health officials and to check for specific AEFI reporting requirements in their province or territory. If there is any doubt as to whether or not an event should be reported, a conservative approach should be taken, and the event should be reported. For influenza vaccines, the following AEFIs are of particular interest: ORS; and GBS within 6 weeks following vaccination Refer to Reporting AEFI in Canada for additional information about AEFI reporting and to Vaccine safety and pharmacovigilance in Part 2 of the CIG for general vaccine safety information, including information on the management of AEs. Recommendations NACI makes the following recommendations for individual-level and public health program-level decision making. Individual-level recommendations are intended for people wishing to protect themselves from influenza or for vaccine providers wishing to advise individual patients about preventing influenza. Program-level recommendations are intended for provinces and territories responsible for making decisions on publicly funded immunization programs. Individual-level and program-level recommendations may differ, as the important factors to consider when recommending a vaccine for a population (e.g., population demographics, economic considerations) may be different than for an individual. Recommendation for individual-level decision making NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine. Influenza vaccination is particularly important for the groups indicated in List 1. Recommendations for public health program-level decision making The national goal of the annual influenza immunization programs in Canada is to prevent serious illness caused by influenza and its complications, including death. Programmatic decisions to provide influenza vaccination to target populations as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs depend on many factors, such as cost-effectiveness evaluation and other programmatic and operational factors, such as implementation strategies. NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be prioritized for the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important (see List 1 in the section below). List 1. Groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization All children 6 to 59 months of age Adults and children with the following chronic health conditionsList 1 Footnote a: Cardiac or pulmonary disorders (including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, and asthma); Diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases; Cancer, immune compromising conditions (due to underlying disease, therapy, or both, such as solid organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients); Renal disease; Anemia or hemoglobinopathy; Neurologic or neurodevelopmental conditions (includes neuromuscular, neurovascular, neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental conditions, and seizure disorders [and, for children, includes febrile seizures and isolated developmental delay], but excludes migraines and psychiatric conditions without neurological conditions)List 1 Footnote b Morbid obesity (defined as BMI of 40 kg/m² and over); and Children 6 months to 18 years of age undergoing treatment for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid, because of the potential increase of Reye's syndrome associated with influenza All individuals who are pregnant; All individuals of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities; Adults 65 years of age and older; and Indigenous Peoples. People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk Health care and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk Household contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated: household contacts of individuals at high risk household contacts of infants less than 6 months of age, as these infants are at high risk but cannot receive influenza vaccine members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season; Those providing regular childcare to children 0 to 59 months of age, whether in or out of the home; and Those who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to people at high risk (e.g., crew on a cruise ship). Others People who provide essential community services; and People who are in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations List 1 - Footnote a Refer to Immunization of persons with chronic diseases and Immunization of immunocompromised persons in Part 3 of the CIG for additional information about vaccination of people with chronic diseases.

Return to List 1 Footnote b referrer Choice of seasonal influenza vaccine With the recent availability of a number of new influenza vaccines, some of which are designed to enhance immunogenicity in specific age groups, the choice of product is now more complex. Table 2 provides age group-specific recommendations for the age-appropriate influenza vaccine types authorized and available for use in Canada for individual and public health program-level decision making. Additional information for these recommendations are provided in the section below.

Currently, there is insufficient evidence for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, a trivalent vaccine licensed for this age group should be used. 2 to 17 yearsTable 2 Footnote a IIV-SD IIV-cc LAIV An age-appropriate quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD, LAIV4, or IIV4-cc) should be used in children without contraindications or precautions (see text below applicable to LAIV), including those with chronic health conditions, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, a trivalent vaccine licensed for this age group should be used. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. LAIV4 may be given to children with: stable, non-severe asthma; cystic fibrosis who are not being treated with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., prolonged systemic corticosteroids); and stable HIV infection, i.e., if the child is currently being treated with ART (i.e., HAART) for at least 4 months and has adequate immune function. LAIV should not be used in children or adolescents for whom it is contraindicated or for whom there are warnings and precautions such as those with: severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing); medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination; current receipt of aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy; immune compromising conditions, with the exception of stable HIV infection, i.e., if the child is currently being treated with HAART for at least 4 months and has adequate immune function; pregnancy in pregnancy, IIV4-SD or IIV4-cc should be used instead. 18 to 59 years IIV-SD IIV-cc RIV LAIV Any of the available influenza vaccines authorized for this age group should be used in adults 18-59 years without contraindications or precautions, noting the following consideration and exceptions: There is some evidence that IIV may provide better efficacy than LAIV in healthy adults; and LAIV is not recommended for: Pregnant individuals in pregnancy, IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc or RIV4 should be used instead. adults with any of the chronic health conditions identified in List 1, including immune compromising conditions; and health care workers 60 to 64 years IIV-SD IIV-cc RIV Any of the available influenza vaccines authorized for this age group should be used in adults 60 to 64 years without contraindications. 65 years and olderTable 2 Footnote bTable 2 Footnote c IIV-Adj IIV-SD IIV-HD IIV-cc RIV IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, or RIV should preferentially be offered, when available, over other influenza vaccines for adults 65 years of age and older.

Return to Table 2 Footnote c referrer Children Burden of disease in children Children experience a higher burden of disease due to influenza B infection compared to other age groups. Although children less than 24 months of age comprise approximately 2% of the Canadian populationFootnote 72, children 0 to 23 months of age averaged 10.8% of reported influenza B cases (range: 8.3 to 13.7%), using case-based laboratory data from 2001–2012 (excluding 2009). With respect to severe outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death), influenza B was confirmed in 15.5 to 58.3% (median: 38.4%) of pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations (children 16 years of age and younger) reported by the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT) surveillance network between 2004–2005 and 2012–2013 (excluding the 2009–2010 pandemic season)Footnote 73. From 2010-2011 to 2020-2021, inclusively, 32% of IMPACT influenza admissions were for influenza BFootnote 74. The IMPACT study also found that the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza (any strain) was significantly greater for children admitted to hospital with influenza B (1.1%) than for those admitted with influenza A (0.4%). The proportion of hospitalizations due to influenza B relative to all influenza hospitalizations has been generally similar to the proportion of influenza B detections relative to all influenza infections in the general population during the same time period. Additional information can be found in the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2014–2015. In the NACI Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines, a review of B lineage antigens included in the Canadian influenza vaccines and the circulating strains each season indicates a match in 5 of the 12 seasons from 2001–2002 through to 2012–2013, a moderate match (about 50% from each lineage) in 1 season, and a mismatch in remaining 6 influenza seasons (i.e., 70% or more of the characterized B strains were of the opposite lineage to the antigen in that season's vaccine). Children 6 to 23 months of age Three (3) types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in children 6 to 23 months of age: IIV-Adj, IIV-SD, and IIV-cc. Given the burden of influenza B disease in children and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine, NACI recommends that a quadrivalent influenza vaccine should be used. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, an available age-appropriate trivalent vaccine should be used. The current evidence is insufficient for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. Children 2 to 17 years of age Three (3) types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in children 2 to 17 years of age: IIV-SD, IIV-cc, and LAIV. The current evidence does not support a recommendation for the preferential use of LAIV in children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age. Refer to the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for information supporting this recommendation. The current evidence is insufficient for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. Children 2 to 17 years of age with chronic health conditions NACI recommends that any age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) may be considered for children 2 to 17 years of age with chronic health conditions; however, LAIV should not be used for children with severe asthma (as defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or with active wheezing), those with medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination, those currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy, and those with immune compromising conditions, excluding those with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. LAIV is also contraindicated in adolescents who are pregnant. Children and adolescents for whom LAIV is contraindicated should receive IIV. If IIV is used, NACI recommends that a quadrivalent vaccine should be used. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, an age-appropriate trivalent vaccine should be used. NACI recommends that LAIV may be given to children with stable, non-severe asthma, children with cystic fibrosis who are not treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as prolonged systemic corticosteroids, and children with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for additional information supporting these recommendations. Summary of vaccine characteristics for decision making IIV-SD, IIV-cc, and LAIV are authorized for use in Canada for children 2 to 17 years of age. The comparison of the vaccine characteristics of IIV and LAIV, in Table 3 below, may be considered in deciding on the preferred vaccine option(s) for use by an individual or a public health program. Note that although data comparing LAIV to IIV-cc are not available, IIV-cc is comparable to egg-based IIV. Table 3: Vaccine characteristics of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) compared with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 2 to 17 years of age ConsiderationsTable 3 Footnote a LAIVTable 3 Footnote b compared with IIVTable 3 Footnote c Efficacy and effectiveness There was early evidence of superior efficacy of LAIV3 compared with IIV3-SD in children less than 6 years of age from randomized controlled trials, with weaker evidence of superior efficacy in older children. However, later post-marketing and surveillance studies across multiple influenza seasons found comparable protection against influenza for LAIV and IIV, with findings of reduced effectiveness for LAIV against A(H1N1) in some studies. Immunogenicity LAIV has been shown to be as immunogenic as IIV-SD, depending on age. Safety Rhinitis (runny nose) and nasal congestion are more common with LAIV. Clinical studies and post-marketing studies showed a similar safety profile to IIV. Contraindications There are vaccine contraindications specific to LAIV. LAIV is contraindicated for children with severe asthma, medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination, and immune compromising conditions (with the exception of children with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function), as well as those currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy. LAIV is also contraindicated for pregnant adolescents. Acceptability Delivery of LAIV as a nasal spray may be preferable for children who are averse to receiving the vaccine by needle injection. Abbreviations: HAART: highly active antiretroviral therapy; IIV: inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV-SD: standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV-SD: standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine; LAIV: live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV: live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV4: quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine. Footnotes: Table 3 - Footnote a NACI has not assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness of authorized influenza vaccine types for children 2 to 17 years of age. Return to Table 3 Footnote a referrer Table 3 - Footnote b The trivalent formulation of LAIV (LAIV3) received a Notice of Compliance from Health Canada in June 2010 and was first used in publicly funded immunization programs in Canada for the 2012–2013 influenza season. The quadrivalent formulation (LAIV4) was approved for use in Canada for the 2014–2015 season and has been in use since that time. Return to Table 3 Footnote b referrer Table 3 - Footnote c Data comparing LAIV to IIV-cc are not available, however IIV-cc is comparable to egg-based IIV. Return to Table 3 Footnote c referrer Adults Burden of disease in adults A study focusing on estimates of deaths associated with influenza in the United States has established that the average annual rate of influenza-associated deaths for adults aged 65 years of age and older was 17.0 deaths per 100,000 (range: 2.4 to 36.7)Footnote 75. The study also states that of deaths coded as being influenza- or pneumonia-related, persons 65 years of age and older accounted for 87.9% of the overall estimated annual average number of deaths. When influenza-related deaths among adults 65 years of age and older were estimated using codes for underlying respiratory and circulatory causes of death, these estimates increased to 66.1 deaths per 100,000 (range: 8.0 to 121.1) and 89.4%, respectively. This study described a wide variation in the estimated number of deaths from season to season, which was closely related to the influenza virus types and subtypes in circulation. Estimates presented in the study of yearly influenza-associated deaths with underlying pneumonia and influenza causes (1976 to 2007) reveal a large difference between influenza type A and B with a calculated median of greater than 6,000 deaths associated with influenza type A and half of that number for influenza type B (approximately 3,360) for persons 65 years of age and older. During the 22 seasons in which influenza A(H3N2) was the prominent strain, the average influenza-associated mortality rates were 2.7 times higher than for the 9 seasons that it was not (all age groups combined), and on average, there were about 37% more annual influenza-associated deaths, regardless of the primary medical cause of death. A higher risk of hospitalization and death was also reported by Cromer et al. in adults 65 years of age and older, compared to younger adults in their assessment of the burden of influenza in England by age and clinical risk groupFootnote 76. Canadian surveillance data show that hospitalization rates among adults 65 years of age and older were higher during the A(H3N2)-predominant 2014–2015 season compared to the previous 5 influenza seasons and also compared to the 2012–2013 season when A(H3N2) also predominated; 2014–2015 was a season in which there was a vaccine mismatch with the circulating A(H3N2) strain. Similar to the hospitalization rates, death rates among older adults were highest in the 2014–2015 season compared to the previous 5 seasons and compared to the previous A(H3N2) season in 2012–2013. Mortality rates among other age groups were similar to or lower than the previous 5 influenza seasons. Laboratory detections over this same time period showed that influenza seasons in which influenza subtype A(H3N2) predominated, disproportionally affected adults 65 years of age and older, while seasons with greater A(H1N1) detections resulted in a higher proportion of positive cases in younger age groups. Adults 18 to 59 years of age Four (4) types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in adults 18 to 59 years of age: IIV-SD, IIV-cc, RIV, and LAIV. NACI recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines should be used in adults without contraindications to the vaccine. NACI previously found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of LAIV in adults with chronic health conditions due to the potentially better immune response following IIV compared to LAIV in healthy adults in some studies. As such, IIV or RIV should be used for adults with chronic health conditions identified in List 1, HCWs or individuals who are pregnant (noting that limited published clinical data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy is currently available to inform vaccine-associated risks for this population). For further information, refer to Recommendations on the use of live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011-2012. Adults 60 to 64 years of age Three (3) types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in adults 60 to 64 years of age: IIV-SD, IIV-cc, and RIV. NACI recommends that any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccines should be used. Adults 65 years of age and older Five (5) types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in adults 65 years of age and older: IIV-Adj, IIV-SD, IIV-cc, IIV-HD, and RIV. Recommendation for individual-level and public health program-level decision making NACI recommends that IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, or RIV should be offered, when available, over other influenza vaccine for adults 65 years of age and older. If a preferred product is not available, any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used (Strong NACI recommendation). Where supply of IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, or RIV is limited, consideration can be given to prioritizing groups at highest risk of severe outcomes from influenza among adults 65 years of age and older, such as advanced-age older adults (e.g., 75 years of age and older), those with 1 or more comorbidities, older frail adults, and residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities. Based on a review of the evidence to determine whether any age-appropriate influenza vaccines should be preferentially used in adults 65 years of age and older, the evidence supports IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV as having increased benefit as compared to IIV-SD, with no difference in safety. No study included in the review of the evidence compared IIV-cc to other influenza vaccines against critical outcomes for decision-making. Consequently, it was not possible to make a recommendation on the preferential use of IIV-cc in adults 65 years of age and older. Refer to the NACI Supplemental Statement on Influenza Vaccination in Adults 65 Years of Age and Older for additional information supporting these recommendations. Summary of vaccine characteristics for decision making There are 4 types of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV-Adj, IIV-SD, IIV-cc, and IIV-HD) and 1 type of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) authorized for use in Canada for adults 65 years of age and older. The comparison of vaccine characteristics of IIV-HD, IIV-Adj and RIV compared to IIV-SD in adults 65 years of age and older, in Table 4 below, may be considered when deciding on the preferred vaccine option(s) for use by an individual or a public health program. Data directly comparing IIV-cc and IIV4-HD to IIV-SD are not available. Table 4. Comparison of the vaccine characteristics of influenza vaccine types available for use in adults 65 years of age and older ConsiderationsTable 4 Footnote a IIV-HD, IIV-Adj and RIV compared to IIV-SD Efficacy and effectiveness IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV appear to have increased vaccine efficacy and effectiveness as compared to IIV-SD. Notably, IIV-HD has the most substantial body of supporting evidence, followed by IIV-Adj, and then RIV. The magnitude of relative benefit varied and was not seen in all studies and all seasons. There are few RCTs comparing IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV to IIV-SD and to 1 another. No RCT compared IIV-Adj with IIV-SD for the outcome of LCI. No definitive conclusion can be reached regarding the superiority of any of these vaccines over 1 another as there is limited evidence directly comparing IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV against each other. There is limited evidence on newer vaccine technologies (e.g., IIV-cc and RIV). Further evidence is needed on the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines in subpopulations of adults 65 years of age and older at higher risk of severe influenza-related outcomes and complications, such as advanced-age older adults, individuals living with 1 or more chronic medical conditions, and frail individuals. Safety IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV appear to be well-tolerated and safe alternatives to IIV-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. Evidence suggests that there is no difference in safety between IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV based on direct evidence among adults 65 years of age and older. Only a few studies reported data for certain vaccine comparisons (e.g., IIV-Adj vs RIV4). Limited data were available for Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Economics IIV-HD and IIV-Adj may be considered cost-effective when compared to IIV-SD under commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholdsFootnote 77. There is no economic evidence directly comparing IIV-HD, IIV-Adj, and RIV against each otherFootnote 78. EEFA Equity could potentially be increased for older adults at greater risk of severe illness and influenza-related complications if they are given vaccines with higher efficacy. Feasibility from a provider and policymaker perspective may be decreased as enhanced vaccines have higher costs and the level of increased efficacy is uncertain. Acceptability may be increased for high-risk groups due to increased perceived benefits of preferred vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older. Reducing the burden of disease may increase acceptability from the providers' and policymakers' perspectives. However, due to a lack of data supporting higher efficacy and potential increased costs, the use of a preferred vaccine may not be as acceptable.

Footnote: Table 4 - Footnote a For additional information, please refer to the NACI supplemental guidance on influenza vaccination in adults 65 years of age and older. Return to Table 4 Footnote a referrer Adults with chronic health conditions NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV or RIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to adults with chronic health conditions identified in List 1, including those with immune compromising conditions. Pregnant individuals NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV or RIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to pregnant individuals (noting that limited published clinical data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy is currently available to inform vaccine-associated risks). Due to a lack of safety data at this time, LAIV should not be administered to pregnant individuals due to the theoretical risk to the fetus from administering a live virus vaccine. LAIV can be administered to breastfeeding individuals. Health care workers NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV or RIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to HCWs. Comparative studies in healthy adults have found IIV to be similarly or more efficacious or effective compared with LAIVFootnote 79. In addition, as a precautionary measure, LAIV recipients should avoid close association with people with severe immune compromising conditions (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for at least 2 weeks following vaccination, because of the theoretical risk for transmitting a vaccine virus and causing infection. Travellers Influenza occurs year-round in the tropics. In temperate northern and southern countries, influenza activity generally peaks during the winter season (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere and April to October in the Southern Hemisphere). NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older, including travellers, who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine, with focus on the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important (see List 1). Vaccines prepared specifically for use in the Southern Hemisphere are not available in Canada, and the extent to which recommended vaccine components for the Southern Hemisphere may overlap with those in available Canadian formulations will vary. A decision for or against revaccination (i.e., boosting) of travellers to the Southern Hemisphere between April and October, if they had already been vaccinated in the preceding fall or winter with the Northern Hemisphere's vaccine, depends on individual risk assessment, the similarity between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere vaccines, the similarity between the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strains and currently circulating strains in the Southern Hemisphere, and the availability of a reliable and safe vaccine at the traveller's destination. Refer to Immunization of travellers in Part 3 of the CIG for additional general information. Particularly important vaccine recipients The groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important are presented in List 1. Additional information regarding recipients for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important is provided below. All children 6 to 59 months of age On the basis of existing data, NACI recommends the inclusion of all children 6 to 59 months of age among those for whom influenza vaccine is particularly important. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for additional details on children 6 to 23 months of age and to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2012–2013 for children 24 to 59 months of age. Adults and children with chronic health conditions As noted in List 1, a number of chronic health conditions are associated with increased risk of influenza-related complications and can be exacerbated by a flu infection. Influenza vaccination can induce protective antibody levels in a substantial proportion of adults and children with immune-compromising conditions, including transplant recipients, those with proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems, and HIV-infected people. Vaccine effectiveness may be lower in people with immune compromising conditions than in healthy adults. All individuals who are pregnant Pregnant individuals along with infants under 6 months of age are particularly at risk of severe illness from influenza infectionFootnote 12Footnote 80Footnote 81. A significant number of studies have been published on influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Overall, the evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines during pregnancyFootnote 82. Vaccination reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection in pregnant personsFootnote 83. Since influenza-related outcomes experienced during pregnancy can negatively impact the development of the fetus, vaccination of the pregnant person also helps protect the fetusFootnote 83. Furthermore, passive transfer of antibodies from vaccination during pregnancy protects newborns during their first months of life when they are at high risk of complications from influenza infection, and too young to be immunized. NACI continues to strongly recommend that inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccines be offered during pregnancy, at any gestational age. NACI also continues to include pregnant individuals among those for whom influenza vaccination is particularly important. Finally, NACI reaffirms its recommendation that influenza vaccination may be given at the same time as, or at any time before or after administration of another vaccine, including the COVID-19 or pertussis vaccine. For further details, refer to the supplemental statement on updated guidance on influenza vaccination during pregnancy. People of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities Residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities often have 1 or more chronic health condition and live in institutional environments that may facilitate the spread of influenza. Adults 65 years of age and older Hospitalization attributable to influenza in this age group is estimated at 125 to 228 per 100,000 healthy peopleFootnote 84, and influenza-attributed mortality rates increase with increased ageFootnote 85. Indigenous Peoples Based on a body of evidence indicating a higher rate of influenza-associated hospitalization and death among Indigenous peoplesFootnote 86, NACI recommends the inclusion of this population among those for whom the influenza vaccine is particularly important. It has been proposed that the increased risk of severe influenza outcomes in the Indigenous populations is a consequence of many factors, including high prevalence of chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, chronic lung disease, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity)Footnote 87, delayed access to health care, and increased susceptibility to disease because of poor housing and overcrowdingFootnote 88Footnote 89Footnote 90. A review of the available evidence and update to the recommendations for Indigenous peoples as a group at high-risk of influenza-related complications is planned, with inclusion and consideration of key stakeholder engagement. People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization People who are potentially capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk should receive annual vaccination, regardless of whether the high-risk individual has been vaccinated. Vaccination of Health Care Workers (HCWs) decreases their own risk of illnessFootnote 91Footnote 92, as well as the risk of death and other serious outcomes among the individuals for whom they provide careFootnote 93Footnote 94Footnote 95Footnote 96. Vaccination of HCWs and residents of nursing homes is associated with decreased risk of ILI outbreaksFootnote 97. People who are more likely to transmit influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization include: HCWs and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk; and Contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated Health care workers and other care providers in facilities and community settings Vaccination of health care workers and other care providers For the purposes of this statement, HCWs and other care providers in facilities and community settings refers to HCWs, essential care providers, emergency response workers, those who work in continuing care or long-term care facilities or residences, those who provide home care for people at high risk, and students of related health care services. HCWs include any person, paid or unpaid, who provides services, works, volunteers, or trains in a hospital, clinic, or other health care facility. Transmission of influenza to patients at high risk of influenza-associated complications results in significant morbidity and mortality. Four (4) cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in geriatric long-term care settings have demonstrated that vaccination of HCWs is associated with substantial decreases in influenza-like illnessFootnote 94Footnote 95Footnote 96 and all-cause mortalityFootnote 93Footnote 94Footnote 95Footnote 96 in the residents. In addition, due to their occupation and close contact with people who may be infected with influenza, HCWs are themselves at increased risk of infectionFootnote 98. As previously stated, children 0 to 59 months of age, adults and children with chronic health conditions, pregnant individuals, people of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities, and adults 65 years of age and older are at greater risk of more severe complications from influenza or worsening of their underlying condition. Given the potential for HCWs and other care providers to transmit influenza to individuals at high risk and knowing that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza, NACI recommends that, in the absence of contraindications, HCWs and other care providers in facilities and community settings should be vaccinated against influenza annually. NACI considers the receipt of influenza vaccination to be an essential component of the standard of care for all HCWs and other care providers for their own protection and that of their patients. This group should consider annual influenza vaccination as part of their responsibilities to provide the highest standard of care. Although the current influenza vaccine coverage rate for HCWs is higher than for the general publicFootnote 99Footnote 100, it remains below the national goal of 80% coverage for HCWs in CanadaFootnote 101. Comprehensive vaccination programs should be adopted that address HCWs' acceptance of the vaccine and facilitate the process of vaccinating HCWs to improve uptake of the influenza vaccine beyond the current level. HCW influenza vaccination programs that have successfully increased vaccine coverage of HCWs have included a combination of education, increased awareness, accessible on-site vaccination delivery options for all HCWs, visible support from senior staff and other leaders, and regular review and improvement of vaccination strategiesFootnote 102Footnote 103Footnote 104Footnote 105Footnote 106Footnote 107. Outbreak management in health care facilities As noted in PHAC's Guidance: Infection Prevention and Control Measures for Healthcare Workers in Acute Care and Long-term Care Settings for seasonal influenza, all health care organizations should have a written plan for managing an influenza outbreak in their facilities. Inherent in such plans should be policies and programs to optimize HCW's influenza vaccinationFootnote 108. As part of outbreak management, the above-mentioned PHAC guidance suggests consideration of chemoprophylaxis for all unvaccinated HCWs, unless contraindications exist. Refer to the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada (AMMI Canada) website for guidelines regarding the use of antiviral medications for prophylaxis. Contacts of individuals at high risk of influenza complications Vaccination is recommended for contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization (see List 1), whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated. These contacts include: household contacts and care providers of individuals at high risk, household contacts and care providers of infants less than 6 months of age (as these infants are at high risk of complications from influenza but cannot receive influenza vaccine), members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season, household contacts and care providers (whether in or out of the home) of children 0 to 59 months of age, and providers of services within closed or relatively closed settings with people at high risk of influenza-related complications (e.g., crew on a passenger or cruise ship). Others People who provide essential community services Vaccination for these individuals should be encouraged to minimize the disruption of services and routine activities during annual influenza epidemics. People who provide essential community services, including healthy working adults, should consider annual influenza vaccination, as this intervention has been shown to decrease work absenteeism due to respiratory and related illnessesFootnote 91Footnote 92Footnote 109Footnote 110Footnote 111. People in direct contact with farm animals Poultry handlers Although seasonal influenza vaccination will not prevent avian influenza infection, some countriesFootnote 112 and provinces have recommended influenza vaccination on a yearly basis for those working with poultry, based on the rationale that preventing infection with human influenza strains may reduce the theoretical potential for human-avian reassortment of genes, should such workers become co-infected with human and avian influenza virusesFootnote 113. NACI recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for people who may be in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations, as these individuals may be at increased risk of avian influenza infection because of exposure during the culling operationFootnote 114Footnote 115Footnote 116Footnote 117. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2013–2014 for further information supporting this recommendation. Direct contact may be defined as sufficient contact with infected poultry to allow transmission of an avian virus to the exposed person. The relevant individuals include those performing the cull, as well as others who may be directly exposed to the avian virus, such as supervising veterinarians and inspectors. It is recommended that biosecurity measures such as personal protective equipment and antivirals be used. Refer to Human health issues related to avian influenza in Canada for PHAC recommendations on the management of domestic avian influenza outbreaks. Swine workers NACI has concluded that there is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend routine influenza vaccination specifically for swine workers; however, NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should be offered to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2013–2014 for further information supporting this recommendation.

Return to Appendix B Footnote b referrer Appendix C: Additional information on vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) Immunological considerations related to children Young children have a high burden of illness, and their vaccine-induced immune response is not as robust as older children. However, some studies suggest moderate improvement in antibody response in young children, without an increase in reactogenicity, with the use of a full vaccine dose (0.5 mL) for IIV-SDsFootnote 118Footnote 119Footnote 120. Based on this moderate improvement in antibody response without an increase in reactogenicity, NACI recommends the use of a 0.5 mL dose for all recipients of IIV-SDs, including young children. Immunological considerations related to older adults and those with immune compromising conditions Although the initial antibody response in older adults is lower to some influenza vaccine components [particularly A(H3N2) antigens] when compared to those in other age groups, influenza vaccination still induces protective antibody levels in a significant proportion of this age group. A literature review identified no evidence for a subsequent antibody decline that was any more rapid in older adults than in younger age groupsFootnote 121. Influenza vaccination can induce protective antibody levels in a substantial proportion of adults and children with immune compromising conditions, including transplant recipients, those with proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems, and HIV-infected patientsFootnote 122Footnote 123Footnote 124Footnote 125. Most studies have shown that administration of a second dose of influenza vaccine in the same season to older adults or other individuals who may have an altered immune response does not result in a clinically significant antibody boostFootnote 52Footnote 126Footnote 127Footnote 128. Standard-dose, egg-based, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD) The following trivalent formulations of standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines have recently been discontinued and are no longer authorized or available for use in Canada: Agriflu® (Seqirus) Influvac® (BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan, doing business as (d.b.a.) Viatris Canada) Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022-2023 for more detailed information on the use of IIV3-SD and a summary of efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety evidence across eligible age groups. Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-Adj) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Fluad® (Seqirus) Fluad Pediatric® (Seqirus) Fluad® (adults 65 years of age and older) Efficacy and effectiveness There is fair evidence that the MF59-adjuvanted Fluad (IIV3-Adj) may be effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in older adults compared to unvaccinated individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence that IIV3-Adj is more effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in older adults compared to those who received un-adjuvanted subunit IIV3-SD. Refer to the NACI literature review update on the efficacy and effectiveness of high-dose and MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. For more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. Immunogenicity The mechanism of action of MF59 is not fully determined and has primarily been studied using in vitro and mouse models. From these studies, it appears that MF59 may act differently from aluminum-based adjuvants. These studies show that MF59 acts in the muscle fibres to create a local immune-stimulatory environment at the injection siteFootnote 129. MF59 allows for an increased influx of phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, monocytes) to the site of injection. The recruited phagocytes are further stimulated by MF59, thereby increasing the production of chemokines to attract more innate immune cells and inducing differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cellsFootnote 130Footnote 131. MF59 further facilitates the internalization of antigen by these dendritic cellsFootnote 129Footnote 131. The overall higher number of cells available locally increases the likelihood of interaction between an antigen presenting cell and the antigen, leading to more efficient transport of antigen to the lymph nodes, with resulting improved T cell primingFootnote 130. There is evidence from RCTs that IIV3-Adj elicits non-inferior immune responses compared to the un-adjuvanted subunit and split virus IIV3-SDs; however, superiority of IIV3-Adj to these vaccines by pre-defined criteria has not been consistently demonstrated. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. Safety IIV3-Adj produces injection site reactions (pain, erythema, and induration) significantly more frequently than IIV3-SD, but they are classified as mild and transient. Systemic reactions (myalgia, headache, fatigue, and malaise) are comparable or more frequent with IIV3-Adj compared to IIV3-SD and are rated as mild to moderate and transient. SAEs were uncommon and were comparable to IIV3-SD. Refer to the Recommendations on the use of MF59-adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (Fluad®): Supplemental Statement of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. Fluad Pediatric® (children 6 to 23 months of age) Efficacy and effectiveness A pre-licensure efficacy trial in children 6 to 71 months of age found a higher relative efficacy for IIV-Adj than the un-adjuvanted IIV3-SDFootnote 133. However, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. The comparator un-adjuvanted IIV3 used in this trial was shown, in an unrelated study, to induce a lower immune response compared to another un-adjuvanted IIV3-SD. There were concerns raised by a European Medicines Agency inspection about the quality of diagnostic laboratory testing and validity of ascertainment of influenza cases. The study administered 0.25 mL doses of the comparator un-Adj IIV3-SD for children less than 36 months of age, which is lower than the dose of 0.5 mL of un-Adj IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD that is recommended for this age group in Canada. Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6 to 72 Months of Age for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in children. for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in children. Immunogenicity In children, there is limited but consistent evidence that IIV3-Adj is more immunogenic than IIV3-SD against both influenza A and BFootnote 133Footnote 134Footnote 135Footnote 136Footnote 137Footnote 138. In particular, a single dose of IIV3-Adj is more immunogenic than a single dose of IIV3-SD and has been shown in 1 study to produce greater GMTs than 2 doses of IIV3-SD against influenza AFootnote 138. However, similar to IIV3-SD, IIV3-Adj generally induced a weaker hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response against B strains compared to A strains and therefore 2 doses of IIV3-Adj are still necessary for first-time recipients to achieve a satisfactory immune response against influenza B. Almost all of the pre-licensure pediatric studies used vaccine formulations of 0.25 mL in children 6 to 35 months of age, both for IIV3-Adj and the comparator un-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (NACI recommends 0.5 mL dosage of IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD for all age groups). There is limited immunogenicity evidence comparing IIV3-Adj at 0.25 mL dose to IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD at 0.5 mL dose in the 6 to 23 month age group. Refer to the NACI literature review on pediatric Fluad influenza vaccine use in children 6 to 72 months of age for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in children. for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in children. Safety The safety data in children are consistent with what is known about IIV3-Adj's safety profile in adults. In pediatric trials, IIV3-Adj was more reactogenic than IIV3-SD, with recipients experiencing 10 to 15% more solicited local and systemic reactions. However, most reactions were mild and resolved quickly. A dose-ranging study of MF59-Adj and un-Adj IIV3 and IIV4 did not find an increased risk of AEs associated with increased MF59 dose, antigen dose, or the addition of a second B strain; however, the reactogenicity of 15 µg formulations were slightly higher for both Adj and un-Adj vaccines compared to the corresponding 7.5 µg formulationsFootnote 136. There are currently no data on the effects of long-term or repeated administration of Adj influenza vaccines in children. The most significant experience with an Adj influenza vaccine in children was the AS03-Adj A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine that has been associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy. A study comparing 2 AS03-Adj A(H1N1) vaccine products (Pandemrix and Arepanrix) has suggested that the underlying immune mediated mechanism associated with the increased narcolepsy risk may not be initiated by the adjuvant, but by the A(H1N1) nucleoprotein viral antigen, given that the study found significant antigenic differences between the 2 A(H1N1) pandemic vaccinesFootnote 139. However, the pandemic vaccine was a single strain Adj vaccine administered only during 1 season, and it is unknown what effects a multi-strain Adj vaccine or an Adj vaccine administered for more than 1 season may have in young children. Refer to the NACI literature review on pediatric Fluad influenza vaccine use in children 6-72 months of age for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in children. Standard-dose, egg-based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Afluria® Tetra (Seqirus) Flulaval® Tetra (GlaxoSmithKline) Fluzone® Quadrivalent (Sanofi) Influvac® Tetra (BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan, d.b.a. Viatris Canada) Literature review on quadrivalent influenza vaccines (IIV4) In July 2014, NACI published a systematic literature review of the efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of IIV4 to inform recommendations on immunization against influenza in adults and children 6 months of age and older using quadrivalent influenza vaccines. Refer to the Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines for additional details. Efficacy and effectiveness One (1) study assessed the efficacy of IIV4-SD in children 3 to 8 years of age. In this study, efficacy was estimated to be 59%, in comparison to children who received hepatitis A vaccineFootnote 140. Immunogenicity The results of phase II and III trials that compared trivalent formulations to quadrivalent formulations generally showed non-inferiority of the quadrivalent products for the A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B strain contained in the trivalent formulations. As expected, these studies showed that the immune response to the B strain that was not in the trivalent formulation was better in subjects who received the quadrivalent vaccine, which contained the additional B strain. Safety Pre-licensure clinical trials (refer to Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines) and post-marketing surveillance showed that IIV4-SD had a similar safety profile to IIV3-SDFootnote 141. Influvac® Tetra (BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan, d.b.a. Viatris Canada) Following the vaccination recommendations on the use of standard-dose, egg based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) published in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023, an expanded age indication for the use Influvac Tetra was authorized. Influvac Tetra was first authorized by Health Canada for use in adults 18 years of age and older on March 1, 2019. Subsequently, an expanded age indication down to children 3 years to 17 years of age was authorized on February 20, 2020, based on a review of the Health Canada assessment of data from phase 3 RCTs conducted in several European countries. One (1) RCT was conducted in adults 18 years of age and older (n= 1,980), and 1 RCT was conducted in children 3 to 17 years of age (n=1,200). Both RCTs compared Influvac Tetra to its trivalent formulation (Influvac; IIV3-SD), which had previously been authorized for use in persons 18 years of age and older. Recommendations on the use of Influvac Tetra in adults and children 3 years of age and older can be found in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022. A second age indication extension to children 6 to 35 months was authorized on November 30, 2021. NACI reviewed the Health Canada assessment of the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of Influvac Tetra compared to non-influenza vaccines (NIVs) in children 6 to 35 months of age (n= 2,007). The RCT was conducted across Europe and Asia over 3 influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2019 and the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons). Refer to the product monograph for further details and supporting evidence on the use of Influvac Tetra in the various age groups mentioned above. Efficacy and effectiveness The absolute vaccine efficacy of Influvac Tetra compared with NIV against any seasonal strain in children 6 to 35 months was 54% (VE: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.66%). The estimated vaccine efficacy was higher for antigenically matching strains (VE: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81%). Vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 21% in children 6 to 11 months of age (VE: 0.21; 95 % CI: -0.70 to 0.64%); however, the study was not powered for subgroup analyses by age groupFootnote 142. Immunogenicity Results from the 2 pivotal trials conducted in adults and children 3 years of age and older demonstrated that Influvac Tetra met the non-inferiority criteria for the adjusted GMT ratio for all tested influenza strains when compared to the trivalent formulation. Recipients of the trivalent formulations showed, to a lesser degree, some immune response to the B strain not contained in the trivalent formulation. In the RCT conducted in adults, seroconversion and seroprotection rates for all 4 strains in the Influvac Tetra group were higher than the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria for influenza vaccines. In the RCT conducted in children 3 to 17 years of age, seroconversion rates were over 60% across all vaccination groups for all 4 strains. A review of clinical data submitted to Health Canada by the manufacturer was conducted to examine the use of Influvac Tetra in children 6 months to less than 3 years (i.e., 35 months) of age. Specifically, the immunogenicity of Influvac Tetra was assessed in a phase 3 RCT conducted in children 6 to 35 months of age. Participants experienced a substantial increase in hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres in response to vaccination against influenza type A [A(H1N1) and A(H3N2)], based on GMTs, geometric mean fold increase (GMFI), seroconversion rates and seroprotection rates. However, immunogenicity results for influenza type B (B/Yamagata lineage and B/Victoria lineage) were noted to be low for the 4 immunogenicity outcomes included in the study. Refer to the product monograph for additional details. Safety The analysis of vaccine safety across all 3 phase 3 clinical trials including adults and children 6 months of age and older demonstrated that Influvac Tetra was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed. The incidence of solicited (local and systemic), unsolicited AEs and SAEs were generally comparable between the 2 intervention groups. AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Notably, no deaths were reported across the 3 clinical trials. Standard dose mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-cc) Vaccine currently authorized for use: Flucelvax® Quad (Seqirus) Methods Following the IIV4-cc vaccination recommendations published in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023, an expanded age indication for the use of IIV4-cc in children 6 months to 47 months was authorized. Flucelvax Quad was first authorized for use in adults and children 9 years of age and older on November 22, 2019. In support of this, NACI conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety data for children in this age group. Refer to the NACI Supplemental Statement on Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza Vaccines and to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023 for further details. An age indication extension for the use of Flucelvax Quad in adults and children 2 years and older was authorized on March 8, 2021.Recommendations were developed based on a review of the Health Canada assessment of a multi-country phase 3/4 RCT on the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Flucelvax Quad in children 2 years to less than18 years of age conducted over 3 influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 influenza season and the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons). Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023 for further details. A second age indication extension to children 6 months to 47 months was authorized on March 8, 2022. To support this age indication extension, NACI reviewed the Health Canada assessment of a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial of the immunogenicity and safety of IIV4-cc compared to Afluria Tetra (IIV4-SD) in healthy children (N=2402) 6 to 47 months of age submitted by the manufacturer. The clinical trial was conducted in 47 sites across the United States during the 2019-2020 influenza season. The analysis of vaccine immunogenicity and safety in children 6 months to 47 months were consistent with the findings of the previous NACI systematic literature review and the Health Canada clinical assessment. Efficacy and effectiveness Evidence for the effectiveness of IIV4-cc is based on the studies included in the systematic review presented in the NACI Supplemental Statement on Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza Vaccines and the Health Canada assessment of clinical trial evidence supporting the extended age indication for the use of the vaccine in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Evidence related to the efficacy of the trivalent formulation, IIV3-cc, was used to supplement existing evidence for the efficacy of IIV4-cc. For further details refer to the NACI Influenza and Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023. Immunogenicity In support of extended age indication for the use of the vaccine in adults and children 6 months of age and older, immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of the phase 3/4 RCT study participants 6 months to 47 months of age during the Northern Hemisphere 2019-2020 influenza season. Non-inferiority criteria were met for all tested influenza strains [A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Yamagata lineage, B/Victoria lineage], based on GMT ratios and seroconversion rates. Overall, there is fair evidence that IIV4-cc has non-inferior immunogenicity to IIV4-SD. Safety The analysis of vaccine safety in a clinical trial in children 6 to 47 months of age demonstrated that IIV4-cc is well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed. The majority of solicited (local and systemic) were short in duration. There were no observable differences in the occurrence of AEs between participants who received Flucelvax Quad and versus those who received the comparator vaccine. A small proportion of participants experienced at least 1 SAE in each study arm. No SAE were determined to be related to receipt of the study vaccines. Overall, there is fair evidence that IIV4-cc is a safe and well-tolerated alternative to conventional egg-based influenza vaccines for children and adults. High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-HD) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Sanofi) The trivalent formulations of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccines have been discontinued and are no longer authorized or available for use in Canada. Methods In 2018, NACI published a literature review on the efficacy and effectiveness of high dose trivalent inactivated vaccines (IIV3-HD) in older adults. Refer to NACI's Literature review update on the efficacy and effectiveness of high-dose (Fluzone® High-Dose) and MF59-adjuvanted (Fluad®) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older for further details. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) builds on the clinical development of its trivalent predecessor Fluzone High-Dose (IIV3-HD) since both vaccines have the same manufacturing process and overlapping compositions. Therefore, data on the efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of IIV3-HD are relevant and inferred to IIV4-HD. Efficacy and effectiveness There is good evidence that Fluzone High-Dose (IIV3-HD) provides better protection compared with IIV3-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. Two (2) studies found that IIV3-HD may provide greater benefit in adults 75 years of age and older compared to adults 65 to 74 years of ageFootnote 143Footnote 144. The efficacy results for IIV3-HD are inferred to IIV4-HD based on the non-inferior immunogenicity, described in the next section. Immunogenicity There is evidence that immunization with IIV3-HD elicits a higher immune response compared to immunization with IIV3-SD in older adultsFootnote 145Footnote 146Footnote 147Footnote 148Footnote 149Footnote 150Footnote 151Footnote 152. Across all 3 influenza vaccine strains, rates of seroconversion were found to be about 19% higher (ranging from 8 to 39% higher) for the IIV3-HD group. The post-vaccination GMT ratios (GMTR) of participants' responses to IIV3-HD was about 1.5 to 1.8 times higher than those receiving IIV3-SD. There is good evidence that the immunogenicity for Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) is non-inferior to IIV3-HDFootnote 153Footnote 154. In a pivotal RCT, IIV4-HD met all non-inferiority criteria set by the US Food and Drug Administration, based on GMTR and seroconversion rates when compared to IIV3-HDFootnote 154. Immunogenicity for IIV4-HD was superior for the influenza B strain not contained within the trivalent high dose vaccineFootnote 154. Safety IIV3-HD has been observed to produce a higher rate of some systemic and local reactions than IIV3-SD. Studies have reported higher rates of malaise, myalgia, and moderate to severe fever. Most systemic reactions were mild and resolved within 3 days. SAEs were rare and similar in frequency between standard-dose and high-dose vaccines. When comparing the 2 high dose vaccine products, IIV4-HD has been shown to produce a comparable rate of systemic and local reactions compared to IIV3-HD. A comparable proportion of study participants also experienced unsolicited and serious AEsFootnote 154. Recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Supemtek™ (Sanofi) Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted on the vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of RIV4 in adults 18 years of age and older. NACI used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to review the evidence and develop relevant recommendations on the use of RIV4. Further information on this framework can be found in the GRADE Handbook. The complete details of this review, rationale, relevant considerations and additional information supporting this recommendation can be found in the NACI Supplemental Statement: Recombinant Influenza Vaccines and the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022-2023. Efficacy and effectiveness One (1) RCT that evaluated the efficacy of RIV4 demonstrated that Supemtek was statistically significantly more efficacious than egg-based IIV4-SD in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza illness in adults 50 years of age and olderFootnote 155. Non-inferiority assessments suggested that RIV4 may be more effective than IIV4-SD influenza vaccines against laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection, but not laboratory-confirmed influenza B virus infection in older adults. Overall, there is fair evidence (of low certainty) that the efficacy of RIV4 is non-inferior to traditional egg-based comparators, based on data in adults aged 50 years and older. Immunogenicity Eight (8) RCTsFootnote 155Footnote 156Footnote 157Footnote 158Footnote 159Footnote 160Footnote 161Footnote 162 assessed the immunogenicity of RIV4. The immunogenicity outcomes reported included seroconversion ratesFootnote 155Footnote 156Footnote 157Footnote 158Footnote 159Footnote 160Footnote 161Footnote 162, seroprotection ratesFootnote 155Footnote 156Footnote 157Footnote 162, and GMTRFootnote 155Footnote 158Footnote 162Footnote 163. Across the 8 studies, Supemtek demonstrated non-inferiority compared to previously authorized IIVs (IIV3-HD, IIV3-Adj, IIV4-SD, and IIV4-cc) against A(H1N1), most strains of A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage. In some studies, RIV4 did not meet non-inferiority criteria against B/Victoria lineage compared to previously authorized IIVs based on seroconversionFootnote 155Footnote 158, seroprotectionFootnote 155, and GMTRFootnote 164. Pooled seroconversion data from 3Footnote 155Footnote 157Footnote 160 of the 8 RCTs conducted in adult participants 50 years of age and older identified that RIV4 induced similar antibody responses compared to IIV4-SD, IIV3-HD, and IIV3-Adj. Overall, there is fair evidence (of moderate certainty) that the immunogenicity for RIV4 is non-inferior to traditional egg-based comparators, based on data in adults aged 18 years and older. Safety Six (6) studiesFootnote 155Footnote 157Footnote 158Footnote 160Footnote 165Footnote 166 assessed the safety of RIV4 in adults, including 5 RCTs and 1 post-marketing surveillance study using data from the United States Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)Footnote 165. The 5 RCTs found RIV4 to be safe and well-tolerated compared to conventional egg-based IIVs (noting that no published clinical data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy were available at the time of the review). Most AE reported to VAERS following RIV4 administration were non-serious. When data from 2 RCTsFootnote 155Footnote 157 conducted among adult participants 50 years of age and older were pooled, no difference in the odds of experiencing a SAE following administration of RIV4 and traditional egg-based IIV3-HD and IIV4-SD vaccine comparators was detected. Overall, there is evidence of moderate certainty that RIV4 is a safe and well-tolerated alternative to conventional egg-based influenza vaccines for adults. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) Vaccine currently authorized for use: FluMist® Quadrivalent (AstraZeneca) Efficacy and effectiveness After careful review of the available Canadian and international LAIV VE data over many influenza seasons, NACI concluded that the current evidence is consistent with LAIV providing comparable protection against influenza to that afforded by IIV and does not support a recommendation for the preferential use of LAIV in children 2 to 17 years of age. Additionally, NACI concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the immunogenicity and safety supporting the use of LAIV in adults with immunocompromised conditions and does not support the use of LAIV in this group. Observational studies from the United States found low effectiveness of LAIV against circulating post-2009 pandemic A(H1N1) [A(H1N1)pdm09], in 2013–2014 and 2015–2016; however, reduced LAIV effectiveness was not observed in Canada or any other countries that have investigated the issue. Manufacturer investigation identified potential reduced replicative fitness of the A(H1N1)pdm09-like LAIV viruses in the nasal mucosa from the 2 affected A(H1N1)-dominant seasons compared to pre-2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) LAIV viruses as contributing to the poor LAIV effectiveness against circulating A(H1N1)Footnote 79. This finding led to the manufacturer replacing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of LAIV with new strains, with the A/Slovenia/2903/2015 being the strain that has been used since the 2017–2018 season. In adults, studies have found IIV-SD to be similarly or more efficacious or effective compared with LAIV. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis found that LAIV was more efficacious against laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) in adults and older adults compared to placebo or no vaccination. As with other studies, LAIV showed similar efficacy against LCI compared to other influenza vaccines in adults and older adultsFootnote 167. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for detailed information supporting this recommendation. Immunogenicity LAIV, which is administered by the intranasal route, is thought to result in an immune response that mimics that induced by natural infection with wild-type viruses, with the development of both mucosal and systemic immunity. Local mucosal antibodies protect the upper respiratory tract and may be more important for protection than serum antibody. Studies have demonstrated that the presence of a hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response after the administration of LAIV3 is predictive of protection. However, efficacy studies have shown protection in the absence of a significant antibody response as wellFootnote 168. In these studies, LAIV3 has generally been shown to be equally, if not more, immunogenic compared to IIV3-SD for all 3 strains in children, whereas IIV3-SD was typically more immunogenic in adults than LAIV3. Greater rates of seroconversion to LAIV3 occurred in baseline seronegative individuals compared to baseline seropositive individuals in both pediatric and adult populations, because pre-existing immunity may interfere with response to a live vaccine. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for further details regarding the immunogenicity of LAIV3. LAIV4 has shown non-inferiority based on immunogenicity compared to LAIV3 in both children and adults. The immune response to the B strain found only in the quadrivalent formulation was better in children who received the quadrivalent vaccineFootnote 169Footnote 170Footnote 171. Safety The most common AEs experienced by recipients of LAIV3 are nasal congestion and runny nose, which are also reported for LAIV4. In a large efficacy trial, rates of wheezing were statistically higher among children 6 to 23 months of age for LAIV3 compared to IIV3-SDFootnote 167. This finding is expected to be the same for recipients of LAIV4; however, pre-licensure clinical studies for LAIV4 were conducted only in adults and children 2 years of age and older. LAIV4 is not authorized in children less than 2 years of age. Studies on LAIV3 have shown that vaccine virus can be recovered by nasal swab in children and adults following vaccination (i.e., "shedding"). The frequency of shedding decreases with increasing age and time since vaccination. Shedding is generally below the levels needed to transmit infection, although in rare instances, shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated people. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for more information on LAIV and viral shedding. Considerations related to children living with HIV infection Following a review of the literature regarding the use of LAIV in individuals living with HIV, NACI concluded that LAIV is immunogenic in children with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. In addition, NACI concluded that LAIV appears to have a similar safety profile as IIV in children on HAART and with stable HIV infection with regard to frequency and severity of AEsFootnote 172. As expected, injection site reactions were seen only with IIV and nasal symptoms were more common with LAIV. However, the evidence base is too small to effectively detect uncommon, rare, and very rare AEs related to the use of LAIV in in this population. Nasal spray may be preferable to IM injection for some individuals who are averse to receiving the vaccine by injection. Therefore, NACI recommends that LAIV may be considered as an option for children 2 to 17 years of age with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. LAIV should be considered only in children with HIV who meet all of the following criteria: Receiving HAART for 4 months or longer CD4 count equal to or greater than 500/µL if 2 to 5 years of age, or ≥200/µL if 6 to 17 years of age (measured within 100 days before administration of LAIV) HIV plasma RNA less than 10,000 copies/mL (measured within 100 days before administration of LAIV) IM influenza vaccination is still considered the standard for children living with HIV by NACI and the Canadian Pediatric and Perinatal HIV/AIDS Research Group, particularly for those without HIV viral load suppression (i.e., plasma HIV RNA >40 copies/mL). However, if IM vaccination is not accepted by the individual or substitute decision maker, LAIV would be a reasonable option for children meeting the criteria listed above. Refer to the NACI Statement on the Use of LAIV in HIV-Infected Individuals for more information on the use of LAIV in this population. References Footnote 1 World Health Organization.

All Rights Reserved.July 25, 2024HERSHEY, Pa. — Several people started to develop concerning symptoms after working with dairy cows, adding to headlines that had already become worrisome. Bird flu, they said. For decades, medical scientists have warned of the potentially cataclysmic dangers of variants of so-called avian flu. From antiquity to as recently as 15 years ago, outbreaks of bird flu have wreaked havoc on a global scale. The pandemic of 1918, which killed more than 50 million people and sickened 500 million others worldwide, was caused by a virus that began with infected birds directly sickening humans. So, are three people with conjunctivitis the opening salvo of a new pandemic? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the threat so far is minimal. But there are worrying signs when it comes to H5N1. Catharine Paules, an infectious diseases physician at Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, discusses why bird flu isn’t something to be taken lightly, why experts are watching H5N1 so closely and what you can do to help stop its spread. Q: What exactly is bird flu? Paules: Influenza A viruses, which cause the flu, have many different subtypes and can infect multiple species, including humans. A natural reservoir, though, is wild aquatic birds. Since 1900, influenza A viruses have caused four pandemics. Each of them was caused by an animal virus that changed (mutated) and started infecting people. That can happen directly from a bird ― like in the pandemic of 1918, which, prior to COVID, caused the most deaths of any infectious disease pandemic in history. Or it can happen with a mammalian intermediate host that transmits it to humans. The 2009 influenza pandemic, for example, was transmitted to humans by pigs. The remarkable capacity of influenza viruses to mutate and jump species leaves us vulnerable to future pandemics. Experts watch influenza viruses in other species, including birds, and assess the likelihood that they may cause a future pandemic. Q: According to the CDC’s website, there have been very few human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. Why is it even being discussed right now? Paules: While H5N1 primarily infects birds, various strains have caused nearly 900 human infections, approximately half of which have been fatal. So far, these infections are largely isolated, meaning a person gets sick from contact with the bird or an infected mammal but is then unable to easily spread the infection to other people. To cause a pandemic, H5N1 would need to develop changes in the virus that would allow it to spread easily among people. In 2022, a new strain of H5N1 began to circulate among wild birds in the U.S. with lethal spillover infections in poultry flocks and adaptations allowing infections in mammals such as mink, foxes, ferrets and seals. In March, a substrain was reported among dairy cattle in the U.S. and appears to be spreading efficiently among herds. As of July 12, 151 herds in the U.S. have been infected. Widespread transmission of H5N1 in cows gives the virus opportunities to develop mutations that may make it easier to infect and then spread efficiently between humans. At this point several human infections have occurred in people exposed to infected dairy cattle. While no person-to-person transmission has occurred, we are watching this virus carefully and need to prepare for that possibility. Q: How does it spread among cows? What about to humans? Paules: At this point, we don’t know how the virus is spreading between cows or from cows to people. Close contact with infected cows, contaminated objects or unpasteurized milk may be contributing to spread. Q: Speaking of milk is there any risk to drinking it or eating other dairy products? Paules: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has done extensive testing to ensure the safety of the milk supply. So far, no live virus — only dead parts of the virus — has been found in pasteurized dairy products. Unpasteurized milk from infected cows, however, does contain live virus and it is possible that you could get sick from drinking it. There is never a good time to drink unpasteurized dairy, but now it is especially dangerous. Q: What are the symptoms of H5N1? Paules: Other strains of H5N1 that have infected people have caused fevers, respiratory symptoms including cough and shortness of breath, body aches and gastrointestinal symptoms or neurologic symptoms like seizures. We are still learning about human H5N1 infections after contact with cows but several people have had eye redness and one had respiratory symptoms. Q: How do you determine someone has it? Paules: Health care providers work with public health officials to identify the virus. Respiratory samples are tested similarly to when someone is tested for seasonal flu. In some cases, an eye swab may also be checked. Q: What, if anything, can you do to protect yourself and your family? Paules: For most people right now, the risk of getting H5N1 is low and to make that risk even lower you can avoid exposure to poultry and cows, especially those that appear ill. You should also avoid unpasteurized dairy products. It is important to be aware of the situation in case the risk increases and further preventative actions need to be taken. The risk is higher for farmers and others who have frequent contact with birds and cows. The CDC has developed guidance for personal protective equipment that can be worn. There also are medicines that can be prescribed if you have an exposure, before you get sick. Vaccines may eventually be available. Q: What should I do if I think I’m sick? Paules: It is important to contact a health care provider as soon as symptoms start. It is best to call ahead before coming to a health care facility so that appropriate precautions can be taken to protect other patients and staff. Your health care provider will be able to arrange testing and can prescribe medications that may help your illness. Q: Do you think H5N1 will cause a pandemic? Paules: I don’t know whether this particular strain of H5N1 will cause a pandemic, but in some respects, it’s only a matter of time until we are confronted with another influenza pandemic. The time to prepare is now — before it happens. Q: Has the COVID-19 pandemic prepared us for this? Paules: COVID-19 has taught us the scale of impact that a respiratory virus pandemic can cause in terms of deaths, hospitalizations and economic losses. It's also shown us that we are not as prepared as we should be for the next one. Preparing for a pandemic can only benefit us, and we still have a lot of work to do.

Here's what scientists fear could happen next in the evolution of the virus. Shots Health News From NPR Your Health Treatments & Tests Health Inc. Policy-ish Public Health Twitter Shots - Health News With the U.S. bird flu outbreak uncontained, scientists see growing risks July 24, 20246:00 AM ET By Will Stone Chickens stand in their cages at a farm in 2009, near Stuart, Iowa. Millions of chickens have been culled in Iowa, Colorado and other states since 2022 in response to the current H5N1 bird flu outbreak. Charlie Neibergall/AP hide caption toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP For nearly four months, the spread of bird flu in the nation’s dairy cattle has stoked fears that, if left unchecked, the virus could eventually unleash a pandemic. The recent cluster of human cases connected to poultry farms in Colorado only underscores that the threat remains real. Genetic sequencing of the virus collected from the sickened poultry workers closely resembles what’s circulating in dairy herds, suggesting that cattle somehow introduced the virus into the poultry flock. At one massive poultry facility, workers culled the birds under particularly dangerous circumstances. Sponsor Message Shots - Health News U.S. is 'flying blind' with bird flu, repeating mistakes of COVID, health experts say As health officials describe it, they struggled to properly wear protective equipment over their mouth, nose and eyes as they handled thousands of sick birds in a sweltering barn, with industrial fans blowing feathers and other potentially virus-laden material into the air. Given these conditions, it’s far from surprising that people would catch the virus themselves, says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown University. “It’s gambling with people’s lives,” she says. “There’s no other way to describe it.” State and federal health officials are still investigating the scope of the outbreak, although so far all of those who’ve tested positive have only had mild, flu-like symptoms. Nuzzo says the spillover at the poultry farms drives home the risks of having a viral reservoir in dairy herds that offers the virus ample opportunities to jump between species and potentially adapt to mammals. “Every time you give an avian virus a chance to infect a human, it’s like buying a ticket for a lottery you don't want to win,” says Troy Sutton, a virologist at Penn State University who studies transmission of bird flu. Based on the newest research, here’s what scientists are learning — and concerned about — as they study the virus. Shots - Health News Launching an effective bird flu vaccine quickly could be tough, scientists warn Certain mutations could make the virus more dangerous Luckily, there’s no indication that we have drawn the dreaded “winning ticket.” At least not yet. The virus working its way through dairy cattle is still fundamentally well-suited to infect birds, not people; however, there are clearly some mutations helping it maintain a foothold in mammals, says Thomas Peacock, a virologist at the Pirbright Institute in the U.K. who studies avian influenza. “I wouldn't be surprised if it's quite a lot more infectious at the same doses, than a purely avian virus that would have been seen last year in poultry,” says Peacock, adding that this may give it a leg up when it comes to infecting humans, too. Sponsor Message Scientists are still trying to get a better sense of what exactly these changes in the dairy cattle version of H5N1 are doing, but he says there are certainly some mutations that are already enhancing its ability to replicate in mammalian cells. Of most concern would be the virus evolving to get better at using the type of receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans. Such a change could let bird flu spread easily via the airborne route between people similar to the seasonal influenza viruses that typically infect humans. Peacock and other scientists are closely watching for changes in hemagglutinin proteins on the surface of the virus which would be ground zero for this development. New study suggest virus may be better at infecting mammals than other types of bird flu There are still many outstanding questions about how exactly humans are catching the virus. One possibility, raised by federal health officials, is that a splash of milk, say, in the eyes or elsewhere could explain some of the infections in dairy workers, particularly those whose only symptoms were conjunctivitis. There’s also speculation that aerosolized milk could be another source of infection. While the virus still doesn’t do well in the upper respiratory tract of humans, Peacock says, evidently there's a degree of replication because nasal swabs are testing positive for low amounts of viral genetic material, at least in some of the human infections. Research on avian influenza predating the dairy cattle outbreak has shown that, with only a few mutations artificially inserted, airborne transmission can take place between ferrets, which are used as a model of human infection. Since the dairy cattle outbreak began, scientists have begun to analyze how this version of the virus spreads, in hopes of understanding the threat it poses to humans. Sponsor Message The latest research, which comes from a team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows the virus can be transmitted by respiratory droplets in ferrets, but inefficiently. Amie Eisfeld, an author of the study, says their lab has not seen this kind of transmission event with any other version of highly pathogenic avian influenza that they’ve isolated from the natural world and tested in ferrets. “There are features present in this virus that are concerning,” says Eisfeld, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It’s important to be monitoring what is happening here, and to limit infections in cows and exposure in humans.” In the experiment, only one of the four exposed ferrets caught bird flu from respiratory droplets. That animal didn't have any virus in the nasal swabs, but there were antibodies in the blood showing it had been exposed. Sutton notes that just because a ferret in the lab caught the virus in this way doesn't necessarily mean humans will. In another troubling finding from the study, the team discovered that the virus can bind to the type of receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans, suggesting it does possess “features that may facilitate infection and transmission in mammals,” the authors write. To figure this out, Eisfeld says they artificially generated these receptors and attached them to a piece of plastic and then added the virus to see if it would stick. Because this wasn’t done in actual people, she says the results need to be interpreted with caution: “I wouldn’t want to sound the alarm bells and [suggest] this is transmissible between humans.” Peacock, who was not involved in the work, says the results do suggest this virus is “more infectious” in mammals than previous avian viruses. And while it doesn’t appear to be spreading between humans yet, he worries that could change. “It’s an influenza virus, if there's pressure for it to do something, it will learn to do it.” Sponsor Message While this kind of finding is unnerving, Troy Sutton says it needs to be put in context -- lab experiments are essentially creating a “pro-infection environment” that may not reflect what happens outside of the lab. “This isn't exactly what a human nose is like out in the real world,” he says. “There’s snot and bacteria and there's all these other things that get in the way.” The virus may be able to spread among cattle through respiratory transmission It’s well-established that infected cattle are shedding high levels of virus in the milk for days or even weeks, before eventually recovering. This has supported the hypothesis that the virus is primarily spreading from cow-to-cow during the milking process and through other shared equipment in the dairy barns rather than via the respiratory route. However, some research hints that respiratory transmission can’t be ruled out. In one recent study, a small number of non-lactating cows were purposefully infected with aerosols containing bird flu, which was collected from cow milk. Only one of the four animals consistently had viral genetic material in nasal swabs, whereas the rest only had positive results some days. Autopsies showed evidence of viral replication in their lungs, although none of the cattle had serious symptoms. In contrast, the lactating cattle that were deliberately infected on their teats quickly showed signs of disease and increasing viral loads. Taken together, those findings bolster the hypothesis that contact with infected milk is a key source of infection, but they also suggest the respiratory route may still have a role to play, says Dr. Amy Baker, the lead author of the pre-print study and a research veterinary medical officer at the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa. “This doesn't really tell us whether or not this is a main way that it's transmitting in these dairy farms, but it points to the fact that we need to at least keep an open mind that respiratory infection and transmission could occur,” she says. Sponsor Message The risks of a hands-off approach to stopping the outbreak To be clear: There’s no evidence yet that humans who’ve caught the virus have spread it to others, which is why the CDC still deems the risk to the general public low. What’s more, a recent study of Michigan dairy workers at two farms with outbreaks analyzed blood samples and found no antibodies suggesting past infections that went undetected. The human infections that have cropped up all seem to have occurred in “heavily virus contaminated, high virus dose environments,” which is reassuring because it means that steps can be taken to minimize the spread, says Sutton. “If you started to see people getting infected, with low-virus doses, that would be alarming,” he says. Federal health officials maintain it’s still possible to quash the outbreak in dairy cattle. Nuzzo is skeptical. She’s yet to see a clearly articulated, viable strategy for ending the spread. New cases are still popping up in dairy herds every week. As a scientist tracking the situation from outside the U.S., Peacock struggles to make sense of how the government hasn’t curtailed the spread of a virus that has true pandemic potential, even after months of mobilizing a response. “My feeling is that if there were even just moderate efforts to stop this, it would have been stopped already,” he says. bird flu avian flu Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorWhy CDC Estimates the Burden of Seasonal Flu in the US | Flu Burden | CDC Skip directly to site content Skip directly to search An official website of the United States government Here's how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.

CDC uses the estimates of the burden of flu in the population and the impact of flu vaccination to inform policy and communications related to flu. Overview Seasonal flu is a serious disease that causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths every year in the United States. CDC tracks flu activity in the United States using multiple surveillance systems. Together, these surveillance systems are designed to provide a national picture of flu activity, including how many flu-like-illnesses, flu-related hospitalizations and flu-related deaths. For a number of reasons, however, these surveillance systems do not capture every flu-related illness, medical visit, hospitalization or even death in the United States. CDC feels it is important to convey the full burden of seasonal flu, and thus, uses well-established scientific methods that have been reviewed by scientists outside of CDC to make comprehensive estimates of the total numbers of annual flu illnesses, flu-related hospitalizations, and flu-related deaths that occur each year. CDC does not know the exact number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur annually CDC does not know the exact number of flu illnesses, flu-associated hospitalizations, or flu-associated deaths that occur each year in U.S. adults for several reasons: First, many people who become sick with flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks and may not seek medical care. For people who do seek medical care, most are not tested because the test results usually do not change how you are treated. Second, people may seek medical care later in their illness when seasonal flu can no longer be detected from respiratory samples. Sensitive flu tests are only likely to detect flu if performed within a week after onset of illness. In addition, some commonly used tests to diagnose flu in clinical settings are not highly sensitive and can provide false negative results (i.e. they miss true flu infections.) Third, states are not required to report to CDC individual seasonal flu cases or hospitalizations for people of any age. States are only required to report deaths only for children younger than 18 years. Additionally many seasonal flu-related deaths occur one or two weeks after a person's initial infection, either because the person may develop a secondary bacterial co-infection (such as bacterial pneumonia) or because seasonal flu can aggravate an existing chronic illness (such as congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Therefore, seasonal flu is infrequently listed on death certificates of people who die from flu-related complications. For these reasons, surveillance data may drastically underrepresent the true burden of flu in the United States. To gain a better understanding of the true burden of flu, CDC and other public health agencies in the United States and other countries use statistical or mathematical models to estimate the annual number of seasonal flu-related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Learnings from seasonal estimates of flu burden in the US Estimates of the burden of flu in the United States help to demonstrate the true burden of disease in the country. Burden estimates also provide an idea of how the burden of flu varies from season to season, which can be based on a number of factors, including: the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the season, how well the vaccine is working to protect against illness, and how many people have been vaccinated. Additionally, burden estimates provide insight into the populations most impacted by flu illness, which can inform important guidance and communication efforts to help ensure those at highest risk for flu illness and severe flu outcomes are protected. There are several different methods that have been used to estimate burden. The exact estimates may differ with different methods; however, they all give similar conclusions. There are tens of thousands of flu-related deaths and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations every year, and there can be large year-to-year variations.

The appeal follows a consultation of regional experts in Bangkok, supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Recent developments are alarming. After a prolonged period of minimal human infection, 13 new human cases have been reported in Cambodia, with additional cases in China and Viet Nam since late 2023. The situation is further complicated by the emergence of a new variant of avian influenza, presenting new challenges for scientists, public health authorities, clinicians and communities alike.Globally, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has spread more widely geographically than ever before, reaching as far as South America and Antarctica. It has also begun infecting new wild and domestic animals, including scavenger species, marine mammals, carnivorous domestic pets, mammals farmed for fur and recently, farmed ruminants such as dairy cattle.While the Greater Mekong Subregion, Indonesia and the Philippines are facing heightened scrutiny due to their diverse ecological landscapes and limited biosecurity measures, other regions also remain at risk. Notably, Thailand and Myanmar have not reported outbreaks in years. India, Nepal and Bangladesh are currently battling avian influenza outbreaks.“The recent surge in avian influenza outbreaks is deeply concerning,” stated Kachen Wongsathapornchai, Regional Manager of FAO Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD). “Since late 2023, we have observed a rise in human cases and the virus spreading to new animal species. The emergence of novel A/H5N1 strains, which are more easily transmissible, increases the pandemic threat. Immediate, coordinated preventive measures are essential.”Critical actions for Member NationsFAO emphasizes the urgency of a unified response. Member Nations must work together to implement comprehensive surveillance systems, including full genome sequencing, to track the novel virus's spread and evolution. Building capacity for rapid diagnostics and bioinformatics is crucial for analyzing virus data. Enhanced cross-sectoral data sharing is vital for a holistic approach to disease management.Governments, international organizations and the private sector must collaborate and share information transparently and in a timely manner to devise effective containment strategies. Strengthening biosafety and biosecurity measures in the poultry industry is imperative, including vaccination strategies and promoting good farming practices. Creating awareness in health providers and the public is essential to reducing the risk of transmission from sick or dead poultry to humans and ensuring that people with symptoms receive timely treatment.With USAID’s dedication and support to building and strengthening resilient health systems and communities, FAO is working with 13 Member Nations and partners in Asia and the Pacific to strengthen animal health and One Health capacities, aiming to enhance prevention, detection and response to health threats at the human-animal-environmental interface.

Researchers at Princeton University in New Jersey, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Broad Institute, and Harvard University have developed an at-home paper-strip test that can not only identify the presence of influenza, but it can also differentiate between different strains of the flu bug.According to UPI, the test can “distinguish between influenza A and influenza B—the two main types of seasonal flu—as well as identifying more virulent strains like H1N1 and H3N2.”Many research teams are working to develop paper-based diagnostic screening tests because of their lower cost to produce and usefulness in remote locations. Should this near-patient point-of-care test become clinically viable, it could mean shorter times to answer, enabling speedier diagnoses and earlier start of treatment.It also means patient specimens do not have to be transported to a clinical laboratory for testing. And reduced cost per test makes it possible to test more people. This serves the public health aspect of monitoring outbreaks of influenza and other diseases and gives hope for improved treatment outcomes.“Being able to tease apart what strain or subtype of influenza is infecting a patient has repercussions both for treating them and public health interventions, said Jon Arizti Sanz, PhD, co-lead study author and postdoctoral researcher at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, in a Broad Institute news release.The researchers published their findings in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics titled, “CRISPR-Based Assays for Point-of-Need Detection and Subtyping of Influenza.”“Ultimately, we hope these tests will be as simple as rapid antigen tests, and they’ll still have the specificity and performance of a nucleic acid test that would normally be done in a laboratory setting,” Cameron A. Myhrvold, PhD (above), Assistant Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton University in New Jersey, told CIDRAP. Influenza tests that can be performed at the point of care and in remote locations may reduce the number of screening tests performed by clinical laboratories. (Photo copyright: Michael James Butts/Hertz Foundation.)Inspiration from Prior COVID-19 TestAccording to an article published by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy Research and Innovation Office (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, the original test was developed in 2020 in a Harvard laboratory led by computational geneticist Pardis Christine Sabeti, MD, PhD, professor, Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and co-senior author of the study.Her team developed their tests using Streamlined Highlighting of Infections to Navigate Epidemics (SHINE), “a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based RNA detection platform,” the researchers wrote in their Journal of Molecular Diagnostics paper.“SHINE has a runtime of 90 minutes, can be used at room temperature and only requires an inexpensive heat block to heat the reaction. The SHINE technology has previously been used to identify SARS-CoV-2 and later to distinguish between the Delta and Omicron variants,” Bioanalysis Zone reported.“The test uses genetically engineered enzymes to identify specific sequences of viral RNA in samples,” the researchers told UPI. Originally designed to detect COVID-19, the team adapted the technology to detect influenza in 2022 “with the aim of creating a screening tool that could be used in the field or in clinics rather than hospitals or high-tech diagnostic labs,” they said.Influenza A and B as well as H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes were the targets of the four SHINE assays. “When tested on clinical samples, these optimized assays achieved 100% concordance with quantitative RT-PCR. Duplex Cas12a/Cas13a SHINE assays were also developed to detect two targets simultaneously,” the researchers wrote in their paper.The team used “20 nasal swabs from people with flu-like symptoms during the 2020-2021 flu season, nasal fluid from healthy people as the control, and 2016-2021 influenza sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Influenza (NICB) database. They compared the results with those from quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests,” CIDRAP reported.The original 2020 test (shown above) takes 90 minutes to develop at room temperature. The test developers aim to drop this down to 15 minutes. In comparison, typical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing requires medical laboratories to have specialized equipment, trained staff, and prolonged processing times, the Broad Institute news release notes. (Photo copyright: Broad Institute.)Implications of the New TestsThe ease of the new tests is an important development since approximately only 1% of individuals who come down with the flu see doctors for testing, according to the news release. And researchers had this in mind, looking at speed, accuracy, and affordability as a means to “improve outbreak response and infection care around the world,” UPI reported.There are great benefits to strain differentiation that be achieved with the new test. Doctors are hopeful the test will help dial in the best treatment plans for patients since some strains are resistant to the antiviral medication oseltamivir (Tamiflu), UPI noted. This is significant since Tamiflu “is a common antiviral,” said Sanz in the Broad Institute news release.“These assays have the potential to expand influenza detection outside of clinical laboratories for enhanced influenza diagnosis and surveillance,” the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics paper noted. This allows for more strategic treatment planning.“Using a paper strip readout instead of expensive fluorescence machinery is a big advancement, not only in terms of clinical care but also for epidemiological surveillance purposes,” said Ben Zhang, an MD candidate in the Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and co-first author of the study, in the Broad Institute news release.Future Plans for Tests“With further development, the test strip could be reprogrammed to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and flu and recognize swine flu and avian flu, including the H5N1 subtype currently causing an outbreak in US dairy cattle,” the study authors told CIDRAP.The team is also looking at ways to help prevent H5N1 from crossing into human contamination, Sanz told UPI.The new Princeton/MIT/Harvard tests echo the trend to bring in affordability and ease-of-use with accurate results as an end goal. Faster results mean the best treatments for each person can start sooner and may render the transport of specimens to a clinical laboratory as a second step unnecessary.As research teams work to develop paper-based viral tests for their plethora of benefits, clinical laboratories will want to pay close attention to this development as it can have a big implication on assisting with future outbreaks.Additional research is needed before these tests are going to be commonplace in homes worldwide, but this first step brings inspiration and hope of what’s to come. —Kristin Althea O’ConnorRelated Information:Simple Test for Flu Could Improve Diagnosis and SurveillanceSimple Paper-Strip Test Might Spot Flu, Identify StrainCRISPR-Based Assays for Point-of-Need Detection and Subtyping of InfluenzaPaper Strip Test Can Identify Flu Subtypes, May Have Other Applications, Scientists SayStreamlined Inactivation, Amplification, and Cas13-based Detection of SARS-Cov-2Paper Strip Test Using CRISPR and SHINE Technology Has Been Developed for Rapid Influenza Diagnosis E-Briefings CategoriesCoding, Billing, and Collections Compliance, Legal, and Malpractice Digital Pathology Instruments & Equipment Laboratory Hiring & Human Resources Laboratory Instruments & Laboratory Equipment Laboratory Management and Operations Laboratory News Laboratory Operations Laboratory Pathology Laboratory Sales and Marketing Laboratory Testing Managed Care Contracts & Payer Reimbursement Management & Operations News From Dark Daily The Dark Intelligence Group 21806 Briarcliff Dr. Spicewood, TX 78669 Email: info@darkreport.com Phone: 512-264-7103 Fax: 512-264-0969 PRODUCTSWEBINARS E-BRIEFINGS WHITE PAPERS SPECIAL REPORTS RESOURCESABOUT US PRIVACY POLICY LAB RESOURCES LEAD GENERATION PRESS RELEASE EmailFacebookLinkedInTwitterTHE DARK REPORT EXECUTIVE WAR COLLEGE PRECISION MEDICINE INSTITUTE SIGN IN © 2022 · The Dark Intelligence Group, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.ExpandJuly 22, 2024By Chuck GillUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Animal health experts in Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences have announced that — out of an abundance of caution — they will test the University’s dairy herd for highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, under a voluntary state testing program. The announcement comes amidst an outbreak of bird flu that has affected dairy cattle in more than a dozen states since March. As of July 19, the virus had not been found in Pennsylvania dairy herds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and state animal health authorities. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has encouraged all dairy farms in the state to enroll in its Lactating Dairy Cow Health Monitoring Program. The voluntary program is aimed at providing critical data on the status of dairy herds in Pennsylvania and detecting HPAI as quickly as possible should it arrive in the commonwealth. “The state herd monitoring program calls for conducting a weekly test of milk from a farm for three weeks,” said extension veterinarian Ernest Hovingh, who is also a clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences and director of Penn State’s Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. “If all tests are negative and no clinical signs of the disease are observed, the herd is considered ‘unaffected.’ At that point, weekly testing would continue, to ensure that the herd remains free of the virus.” He noted that unaffected herds are cleared for interstate transport of animals without any additional testing. For herds that do not participate in the monitoring program, Department of Agriculture regulations require testing of animals prior to movement across state lines. “Because Penn State does not move dairy cows across state lines, our herd has not been subjected to testing so far,” Hovingh said. “But participating in this program will allow us to determine if our herd is in fact HPAI-free, as strongly expected, and also will provide additional data to inform state and national surveillance efforts.” The chances of getting a positive test result are very remote, he added, but if that happens, Penn State and state officials will immediately investigate further. Penn State attending veterinarian Jacob Werner, who oversees the health and well-being of all University livestock, said he and managers at the Penn State dairy barns have seen no signs to suggest that the virus is present in the herd, but it will be good to have testing data to confirm those observations. “We have a biosecurity plan in place to minimize the chances of bringing any diseases, including HPAI, into our herd, and we screen for sick cows regularly and consistently,” Werner said. “Drops in feed intake and milk production are two hallmark signs of most affected herds, and we monitor closely for those symptoms. We also don’t import any animals into our herd, which appears to be the biggest risk factor for introducing HPAI infection to dairy herds.” Even in the unlikely event that the testing of Penn State’s herd brings back a positive result, Hovingh pointed out that in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, milk from sick cows does not leave the dairy and, therefore, does not enter the food supply. “In addition, all milk from Penn State cows is pasteurized before being sold for human consumption,” he said. “Numerous studies have shown that pasteurization inactivates pathogens such as avian flu viruses, and the Food and Drug Administration has confirmed that pasteurized milk and milk products are safe for human consumption.” Penn State will release the HPAI status of its dairy herd after the initial series of three weekly tests is completed, Hovingh said.

Share this item with your network: By Jacqueline LaPointe, Director of Editorial Published: 22 Jul 2024 The American Medical Association (AMA) recently announced an update to its Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set to account for the development and administration of avian influenza vaccines. A recent outbreak of the avian influenza, or bird flu, through the strain H5N1 has spread globally in wild birds, infecting poultry, dairy cows and other mammals, including humans. According to the CDC, there have been 11 cases reported in humans in the US. Of these cases, five have been confirmed as the latest strain H5N1. In response, the AMA has provided a provisional CPT code to document H5N8 influenza virus vaccine candidates that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA. The new product code (quick description) assigned to the vaccines is: 90695: Influenza virus vaccine, H5N8, derived from cell cultures, adjuvanted for intramuscular use AMA said on its website the CPT code should be used with an administration code to report the work counseling patients or caregivers, administering the vaccine and updating the medical record. Those codes from the website include, but may not be limited to: For children (through 18 years of age) 90460: Immunization administration through 18 years of age via any route of administration, with counseling by physician or other qualified health care professional; first or only component of each vaccine or toxoid administered 90461: Immunization administration through 18 years of age via any route of administration, with counseling by physician or other qualified health care professional; each additional vaccine or toxoid component administered For adults 90471: Immunization administration (includes percutaneous, intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections); 1 vaccine (single or combination vaccineoxoid) 90472: Immunization administration (includes percutaneous, intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections); each additional vaccine (single or combination vaccineoxoid) The update to the CPT code set has been updated to prepare EHR systems in the US for the potential FDA authorization of bird flu vaccines, according to the AMA. The US government has already ordered over 4.8 million doses of a pre-pandemic cell-based vaccine from CSL Seqirus that is well matched to the current strain circulating globally. Additionally, HHS, through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, recently provided $176 million to Moderna to develop an mRNA-based vaccine to counter this outbreak of the bird flu. “The new CPT code is a vital preparatory step in response to the potential danger to humans from a highly infectious avian influenza disease,” AMA President Bruce A. Scott, MD, said in an announcement. “A CPT code that clinically distinguishes the avian influenza vaccine allows for data-driven tracking, reporting and analysis that supports planning, preparedness, and allocation of vaccines in case a public health response is needed for avian flu prevention.” For guidance on new CPT codes and how to use them, please refer to the AMA. Per the trade group, questions on CPT coding and content should be directed to the CPT Network, its authoritative source for CPT coding answers. This article was published on July 22, 2024. Additional CPT codes and guidance on bird flu vaccine documentation may be published following publication of this article.

The free canine influenza vaccines are made possible through local support from longtime supporters of BVSPCA and animal welfare advocates Tatiana and Gerret Copeland through Reggie’s Fund, according to the organization. “While this action goes above our usual intake protocols, and has meant a significant financial investment in the dogs who come into our care, we felt this was a necessary step to protect them and the community from further spread,” BVSPCA CEO Adam Lamb said in a news release. “We are grateful, now with the support of Tatiana Copeland, to be able to provide even further protection to the pet community with these free vaccines for owned dogs.” If you are interested in vaccinating your pup, you can register for a appointment at one of the three locations through Friday, August 9 at BVSPCA.org/flu. Each person can register up to two dogs per appointment, according to the organization. "Participants will bring their dogs to the Animal Health Center for the free vaccines. They will be scheduled at the time of the first vaccine for the required second booster canine influenza vaccine appointment at the same location," the shelter said in a statement.

The mechanisms responsible for the most severe forms of the disease are not yet well understood. The objective is to assess the initial immune response upon admission and its potential impact on infection progression.Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of patients with influenza virus infection who required admission to a tertiary hospital in the 2017/18 and 2018/19 flu seasons. Immune markers, surrogate markers of neutrophil activation, and blood levels of DNase I and Apolipoprotein-H (ApoH) were determined in the first serum sample available during hospital care. Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death. Initially, 792 patients were included. From this group, 107 patients with poor evolution were selected, and a random control group was matched by day of admission.Results: Patients with poor outcomes had significantly reduced ApoH levels, a soluble protein that regulate both complement and coagulation pathways. In multivariate analysis, low plasma levels of ApoH (OR:5.43; 2.21-13.4), high levels of C- reactive protein (OR:2.73: 1.28-5.4), hyperferritinemia (OR:2.83; 1.28-5.4) and smoking (OR:3.41; 1.04-11.16), were significantly associated with a worse prognosis. RF was independently associated with low levels of ApoH (OR: 5.12; 2.02-1.94), while high levels of IL15 behaved as a protective factor (OR:0.30; 0.12-0.71).Discussion: Therefore, in hospitalized influenza patients, a dysregulated early immune response is associated with a worse outcome. Adequate plasma levels of ApoH are protective against severe influenza and RF and High levels of IL15 protect against RF.1 IntroductionInfluenza is a contagious disease due to influenza viruses characterized by involvement of the respiratory tract that appears in seasonal epidemics and annually affect between 8 and 10% of the population (1, 2). Clinical manifestations present a wide spectrum of clinical profiles, from a self-limited mild infection to complications such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure (RF), multiple organ failure or even death, reported in 20% of serious infections (3, 4). The mechanisms and factors associated with poor outcomes are not yet well understood.Variables associated with complications have been identified that could serve as possible prognostic factors, including age, delay in the administration of antiviral treatment, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and PaO2/FiO2<200 mmHg (5–8).As has already been reported in other infections, the evolution of the pathology based on the immune response established around the infection by influenza virus could be a determining factor in the evolution of patients (9–11). The secretion of cytokines by respiratory epithelial cells during infection is a determining factor in the disease's prognosis. An imbalance of cytokines can lead to ineffective and exaggerated adaptive immune responses (12–14), which could result in multi-organ failure and lung tissue damage (15).Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a form of immediate response against any type of infection that consists of the release of DNA and molecules from the neutrophil cytoplasm, mainly antimicrobial peptides and proteases, which are organized in a network where pathogens are trapped and destroyed (16). Although NETs can prevent the spread of the infectious disease, their release and degradation by DNases after infection must be tightly regulated to effectively control the infection but avoiding excessive inflammatory reactions (17, 18). High levels of NETs causes tissue damage due to the activity of enzymes associated with NETs, such as mieloperoxidase (MPO) and elastases and correlates with poor prognosis of severe Influenza A infection (19). Dysregulation of the NETs formation process has been associated with the initiation and progression of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (20). Various soluble proteins of the innate immune system such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, DNase-I and apolipoprotein H (ApoH) could play an important role, both systemically and locally, in the early stages of infection, to contain it, until a specific response is developed (21–23). During this early immune response, there is an increase in hepatic synthesis and in the plasmatic concentration of a group of proteins, which are involved in the inflammatory process as immune regulators (24, 25).ApoH, also known as Beta 2 Glycoprotein 1 (β2GPI), is a soluble protein that regulates both complement and coagulation (26–28). ApoH also plays an important role as an opsonin: it can bind to microvesicles containing phosphatidylserine, such as microorganisms, viruses, vesicles or apoptotic bodies with proinflammatory activity (29). ApoH mediates virus and debris clearance (30) and is especially known to be the main antigenic target of antiphospholipid antibodies, present in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (28).The activity of the molecules involved in early immune responses must be strictly regulated to guarantee infection control and avoid triggering excessive inflammatory reactions that can lead to multiple organ failure or favour the appearance of numerous pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (17, 31, 32). In the present work we study the presence of the main plasma markers related to the innate immune response in the first moments of influenza infection and their relationship with patient's evolution.2 Materials and methods2.1 Study designA prospective observational study enrolled adults (>18 years) with confirmed influenza at Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) during 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons (December to March in both periods). For inclusion, it was mandatory that a serum sample drawn within 24 hours of admission was available. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death. Demographic and clinical data were collected from electronic records. Collection of demographic and clinical laboratory data was obtained from the electronic medical record. Laboratory parameters included the absolute number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin. Admission occurred with a median of 2 days after symptom manifestation.2.2 PatientsFrom a total of 792 patients that were recruited, 107 had a poor evolution (see definition below) and the rest had an uneventful evolution until discharge.Due to the impossibility of evaluating the early immune response in all patients, a two-cohort study was carried out. In this way, it was possible to study all the patients with poor evolution and compare them with a similar number of patients with good evolution.In the first cohort, all patients with severe complications were incorporated. The second cohort was formed by a control group built with 107 patients with good evolution. For each patient with severe flu, a control was randomly selected from among the mild patients with sample availability who were admitted on the same day as the severe patient. In 8 of the 107 patients with poor evolution the serum sample was insufficient to be able to carry out an adequate immunological study, so they were discarded although their corresponding control remained in the study. Finally, 206 patients with influenza were part of the study, 99 with poor evolution and 107 with good evolution. See arrangement and algorithm in Figure 1.Figure 1 Figure 1. Algorithm of the distribution of patients. From the total group of 792 patients, 107 presented poor evolution. For each patient with severe influenza, a control was randomly selected from among the mild patients group.In addition, a reference group made up of 41 anonymous blood donors was created to compare the profile of cytokines and other factors of innate immunity between healthy people and patients. This control group included healthy people who went to our hospital to donate blood. All of them tested negative for influenza virus and signed a questionnaire declaring that they did not suffer from any disease.2.3 Study definitionsSevere Influenza (bad evolution) included RF, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, or death during hospitalization. Good evolution was defined as the absence of any of these complications.Respiratory failure (RF) was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200 mmHg or the need for mechanical ventilation, including those patients who had a clinical indication for ventilatory support but for any reason were finally not ventilated. If PaO2 was unavailable, estimated PaO2/FiO2 ratio was calculated using SpO2/FiO2 ratio (33).The cut-off points used for the haematological abnormalities were as follows:Leukocytosis (leukocytes >11,000/µL), leukopenia (leukocytes <4,000/µL), lymphopenia (lymphocytes <1,000/µL), severe lymphopenia (<500/µL), and thrombocytopenia (platelet <140,000/µL).Obesity was defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) >30.2.4 SamplesSerum samples were collected and processed during the first 24 hours after admission to the emergency department. Admission occurred with a median of 2 days after the manifestation of clinical symptoms, without significant differences between patients with good or poor evolution (p=0.803).2.5 Immune parametersCytokine determination assays Serum cytokine profile, including IFNα, IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15, was determined by the Human Cytokine Magnetic Beads Panel Kit (EMD Millipore Corporation, St. Charles, MO, 63304, USA) using a LABScan ™ 100 Luminex. The results were analyzed with the Luminex xPONENT42 v3.1 software. In addition, serum IL-8 was assessed by Flex ELISA: Human IL-8 CXCL8 (Mabtech AB, Nacka Strand, Sweden). The experimental procedure was carried out following the manufacturer's recommendations and automated in a Triturus® Analyzer (Diagnostics Grifols SA, Barcelona, Spain).Consideration of elevated or decreased immune-markers levels (cytokines, DNase, ApoH and MPO) for dichotomization and use as potential biomarkers was performed using the mean ± 2 standard deviation (STD) of each marker in a group of 41 healthy blood donors as the cutoff. The cutoff points for cytokines are described in Supplementary Table S1).ApoH determination assay Serum β2GPI levels were quantified using ELISA Pro Human ApoH (Mabtech AB, following the manufacturer's instructions. The ELISA procedures were carried out in a Triturus® Analyzer (Diagnostics Grifols SA). Low levels of β2GPI were considered to be values ≤86 mg/l, corresponding to the mean levels previously described in healthy people (178 ± 46 mg/l) minus twice the STD (34).2.6 DNase activity assaySerum DNase activity was measured with a functional technique that assesses DNA hydrolysis in a semisolid medium. The plates were prepared with PBS Buffer (with Ca and Mg, pH 7.4) to which 10 mg/mL of agarose, 0.13 mg/mL of DNA and 0.2 mg/mL Syber Green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) were added. Small cylindrical holes (2 mm diameter) were created in which 10uL of the serum sample were placed and incubated for 16h at 37°C. The halos resulting from DNA hydrolysis were evaluated in a Syngene™ LED Blue Light transilluminator (Syngene, Bangalore, India). DNase levels were calculated by relating them to the activity of pure DNase (Manufacturer Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) diluted to known concentrations. Serum DNase activity levels ≤ 12 ng/ml were considered low.2.7 MPO determination assayHuman myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the main biocidal protein in NETs (35). For this reason, we determined levels of MPO in serum as an indirect measurement of NETosis activity using Human MPO Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The procedure was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, samples were diluted 50-fold in assay diluent and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were then washed, the conjugate was added to the plate and incubated for 2 hours. After new washes, substrate solution was added and incubated for 30 minutes. Samples were read at 450 nm. Elevated levels of MPO in the blood were considered to be values > 1783 ng/mL (mean value + 2 STD observed in a sample of 41 blood donors).2.8 Microbiological methodsFor influenza molecular diagnosis, the Allplex™ respiratory Panel 1 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) was utilized. This panel enables the simultaneous detection of Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, RSV B and Flu A subtypes H1, H1pdm09 and H3. Nucleic acid extraction (200 μl assay volume) was carried out using the MicrolabStarlet IVD with the STARMag 96 x 4 Universal Cartridge Kit (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). The rRT-PCR, was performed on the CFX96™ system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Analysis of the results was done using Seegene viewer software.2.9 Ethics statementThis study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre (reference numbers 20/117, 18/182 and 18/009). The patients signed informed consent.2.10 Statistical analysisThe results of the scaled variables were expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR) in brackets. For comparisons between two groups, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used. To compare the variability in the continuous variables between cohorts, the Hodges-Lehmann median difference and the relative difference of the Hodges Lehman medians (RMD) were used. The RMD was calculated by dividing the Hodges Lehman median difference by the highest value of the cohort medians. This index varies between 0 and 1, with the values closest to zero indicating very small (irrelevant) differences. When more than two groups were compared, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used.The results of the qualitative variables were expressed in absolute frequency and percentage. The association between variables was determined using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, when appropriate. The relative size of an effect is expressed as an odds ratio (OR). Multivariate analyzes were performed using a logistic regression model. Data were analyzed with MedCalc for Windows version 20.1 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium), Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA), and GraphPad Prism version 9 (GraphPad Software,Boston, MA, USA). Probabilities less than 0.05 were considered significant.3 Results3.1 Characteristics of the patients and controlsAnalysing the whole group of influenza patients, the median age was 75.5 (IQR: 62-85) years with a balanced distribution by gender (women 54.4%). The most prevalent comorbidities were ex-smoking habit (25.2%), Diabetes Mellitus (23.8%) and obesity (22.3%) (Supplementary Table S2). In 94% of cases, the infection was caused by influenza A, while influenza B accounted for the remaining 6%. Among cases of influenza A, the most common subtype was H3N2 (79%), with the remaining 21% caused by subtype H1N1pmd09.Comparing all influenza patients with healthy population (Supplementary Table S3), influenza patients presented a lower concentration of alpha and gamma interferons (IFN α: 1.3 vs 7.0 pg/mL p<0.001; IFNγ: 0.5 vs 4.8 pg/mL, p=0.002) and a higher concentration of IL-10 (10.8 vs 0.9 pg/mL, p<0.001) and IL-15 (2.3 vs 0.2 pg/mL, p<0.001). MPO levels were higher in patients with influenza: 1154 (486-2379) vs 396 (266-708) ng/ml, p<0.001.Influenza patients presented a decreased DNase activity compared to healthy controls: 8 (4-8) vs 108 (77-138) ng/mL, p<0.001 and a slightly lower ApoH concentration although the differences were not significant: 177 (103-281) vs 209 (168-256) ug/mL, p=0.079 (Supplementary Table S3).3.2 Patients with influenza according to the severity of the diseaseThe comparison of the demographic data of patients with severe influenza with those who had a favourable evolution showed that patients with severe influenza were younger: 71 (57-83) vs 80 (68-86) years old (p=0.004) having also a higher smoking prevalence (16.2% vs 4.7%. p=0.007) and a lower obesity proportion, (15.2% vs 28.9%. p=0.017). Additionally, severe patients showed a higher number of leukocytes per µL: 9500 (6900-13100) vs 7700 (5825-10900; p=0.012), CRP: 13 (5.3-26.25) vs 7 (3-13) µg/mL (p<0.001), ferritin: 452 (186-959) vs 235 (149-428), ng/mL (p<0.001), MPO: 1571 (673-2884) vs. 1038 (473-1733) ng/ml (p=0.017) and IL-8: 22 (3.5-61.5) vs 3.5 (3.5-24.4), pg/mL, (p= 0.001) (Table 1).Table 1 Table 1. Comparison of the input parameters of patients with influenza who had a poor outcome versus those who had a course without serious complications.Comparing the cytokine profile between patients with severe form and those with good evolution, it was detected that those with severe form presented an altered immune serum-proteins profile (Table 1).Severe patients showed a marked reduction of ApoH levels compared to those with good evolution: 144 (82-230) vs 205 (130-338) µg/mL (p<0.01) and compared with healthy controls: 209 (168-256) µg/mL (p=0.001) (Figure 2). The proportion of patients with low ApoH levels was higher in patients with severe form than in those with good evolution (30.3% vs 8.4%, p <0.001, Table 1). No significant differences were observed in the levels of DNase activity and in the proportion of patients with low DNase between patients with severe or mild forms of the disease.Figure 2 Figure 2. Blood levels of Apolipoprotein H in the blood (mg/L) of healthy people, mild and severe patients. **: p-value ≤ 0.01; ***:p-value ≤ 0.001; ns: not significant. p-value > 0.05.A first multivariate analysis was performed with those variables associated with poor outcome that had shown a p value < 0.05 in the previous univariate analysis (Table 2A), in which, elevated levels of IL8, MPO and ferritin did not behave as independent variables. Since these three variables are associated with the formation of NETs and increase together in its formation (would be interdependent), it was performed a new multivariate analysis in which only one of the variables associated with NETs was assessed: ferritin levels (see discussion below). In this second multivariate analysis, smoking habit (OR 3.41), low levels of ApoH (OR 5.43) and high levels of Ferritin (OR 2.63) and CRP (OR 2.73) behaved as independent risk factors associated with poor outcome (Table 2B).Table 2 Table 2. Multivariate analysis of the markers that were associated with poor flu outcomes detected in a first univariate analysis of influenza patients.Besides, although not significant in the multivariate study, there was a higher incidence of the H1N1pmd09 subtype in patients with a worse prognosis (27% vs 13%, p<0.001) (Supplementary Table S4).3.3 Patients with respiratory failureSixty-one patients suffered RF. Patients with RF were younger than the rest: 70 (57-80) vs 79 (66-86) years, (p<0.001) and had higher rates of smoking (23% vs 4.8%, p<0.001) and COPD (32.8% vs 15.9%, p=0.006). Also had a higher prevalence of high levels of CRP, IL8, IL10 and MPO than in those with normal ventilatory function (OR 2.42, 2.69, 2.36 and 2.33 respectively). Patients with RF presented higher proportion of patients with low ApoH levels (OR: 4.25, p <0.001) (Table 3).Table 3 Table 3. Characteristics of influenza patients with respiratory failure versus those who did not have respiratory complications.A first multivariate analysis was performed including the variables that in a previous univariate analysis were significant. Four variables were identified as independent, all with statistical significance: smoking, COPD and low ApoH, behaved as independent risk factors and high levels of IL15 behaved as a protective factor (Supplementary Table S5). As eight variables were analysed over 61 events, with a ratio of only 7.6 events per variable (in the literature 10 are recommended) (36), a second analysis was carried out, restricting to six variables. The variables smoking, low levels of ApoH, high levels of CRP and high levels of IL10 behaved as independent and significant risk factors (OR: 5.25, 5.12, 2.97 and 3.12, p<0.01) while high levels of IL15 behaved as an independent protective factor (OR: 0.30, p<0.01) (area under the ROC curve 0.788, 95%CI: 0.725-0.842) (Table 4).Table 4 Table 4. Multivariate analysis of the markers associated with respiratory failure in the 61 influenza patients who had this evolution.4 DiscussionOur work would suggest that the initial state of innate immunity during influenza infection may have a significant impact on clinical progression. It is noteworthy that in our study, patients with severe forms were younger and less obese than those who suffered a less severe disease. These results contrast with those who reported that age could be related to disease severity (37, 38). This discrepancy may arise from potential biases in the hospital admission of older or fatter people, who are admitted even if they suffer from very mild forms because they have a greater risk of suffering complications, in order to be able to act quickly if problems arise. These results could suggest that elderly, who are supposed to present more complications, are well monitored and controlled seasonally. In this study, the decision on the need for hospital admission was made by the Emergency Department physicians before the patient was assessed and included by the research team.CRP stands out as independent risk factor for disease severity aligning with previous findings in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (34, 39, 40). In the same way high levels of ferritin have been identified as an independent risk factor for disease severity, as previously reported. The identification of high ferritin levels as an independent risk factor for severe influenza is consistent with previous studies (41). Ferritin is a key regulator in iron homeostasis and it is considered an acute inflammatory reactant. Nowadays it is suggested that ferritin is an important modulator of the innate and adaptive immune system (42–44).Severe patients presented significantly higher levels of IL-8 as previously reported (15). The measurement of IL-8 during the acute phase proves crucial, as it correlates strongly with clinical complications. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant and activator for myeloid leukocytes and neutrophils which acts through CXCR1, CXCR2 and NF-κB (15, 45). IL-8 is implicated in neutrophils' recruitment to infectious or tumorigenic areas, promoting either protective or harmful immune responses (45). During respiratory viral infections, epithelial respiratory cells secrete a vast number of cytokines including IL-8 (46).One of the main causes of NETosis is the potent activation of neutrophils via IL-8. Inside their granules exists a weaponry of antimicrobial molecules. Bacterial, viral or fungal infection are able to activate neutrophils, favouring the secretion of NETs (16). Although NETs are beneficial for the clearance of infections, they have been related to pathological conditions like pulmonary diseases, immunothrombosis or autoimmunity (47).Recently it has been described that ferritin induces the formation of NETs in a way mediated by Macrophage Scavenger Receptor 1 (Msr1). Ferritin acts as a MSr1 ligand and trigger the NET formation pathway (48). This mechanism explains why in our study the biomarkers associated with NET activation (MPO or IL8) do not behave as independent variables when the hyperferritinemia variable is also present in the analysis. For this reason, in the definitive multivariate analysis, NET markers were excluded and represented with ferritin levels.One of the major important regulators of NETosis is the DNase I activity, which elicits the crumbling of the traps to recover homeostasis (49). In influenza patients its activity is deficient suggesting that it is a defense mechanism to increase the persistence of NETs and, therefore, their microbicidal activity.High IL-8 levels and low DNase I activity would facilitate a substantial influx of neutrophils to the lungs, forming long-stable NETs that contribute to infection clearance but also collateral damage to host cells due to the production of toxic molecules for own cells like reactive oxygen species (15). This provokes the destruction of alveolar epithelium and contributes to the development of cytokine storm. In that tendency, the administration of recombinant DNase or biological treatments against the IL-8 axis have reported important benefits in the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and cystic fibrosis (50, 51).The analysis of blood levels of ApoH in influenza patients showed that low levels were associated with severe forms, indicating that this molecule behaves as a protective factor for the development of severe forms of the disease, especially those related to RF and hospitalization to ICU. Furthermore, ApoH levels in the entire cohort of influenza patients were significantly lower than those observed in healthy controls. These results are in line with previous publications from our group, where a significant reduction in ApoH levels was observed in COVID-19 and also demonstrated the role of this protein as a protective factor for RF (34). The association of low ApoH levels with severity in infectious disease has been previously described in patients with COVID-19 (34) and sepsis (52). In the same way the presence of ApoH has been identified as a protective factor for organ dysfunction and mortality in sepsis (53). The causes of the reduction of ApoH levels in infections are not well established yet. Among the known facts it stands out that ApoH expression is downregulated both in patients with severe influenza and COVID-19 (54).ApoH is a key factor in the clearance of apoptoticecrotic cells avoiding the inherent proinflammatory activity (55). Thus, the consumption of ApoH in the elimination of cellular debris would be added to the effect of the Virus-induced ApoH deregulation causing a situation of partial ApoH deficiency, especially at the local level, which could be related to poor control of proinflammatory cytokines.The enhancement of the debris removal process has been proposed as a possible therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases (56). ApoH replacement therapy in patients with severe influenza and very low levels of the protein may be a suitable alternative. There is currently no possibility of administering recombinant ApoH although fresh plasma (not convalescent) can be used as an indirect way to replenish ApoH with good results in COVID-19 (57, 58). Low levels of ApoH behaved as the independent variable with the greatest statistical strength associated with RF. High levels of IL15 behaved as an independent protective variable. This finding is in contrast to the observation in COVID-19, where elevated levels of IL15 are associated with poor outcome (10), suggesting that the deregulation of the immune response in COVID 19 is different to influenza. Functionally, IL-15 is similar to IL-2 favouring the activation and proliferation of cell-mediated immunity. It may also play a role in the innate immune response to influenza infection (59). If its expression is excessive or chronically deregulated contribute to tissue damage and can be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease (60).This work presents several limitations. The number of patients recruited is not large enough to confirm in a multivariate analysis subtype-related prognosis differences. Elderly people were considered at risk from a clinical point of view to consider admission to the ICU, although they did not have objective risk criteria. This bias was partially neutralized thanks to the multivariate analysis that allowed the role of each variable to be assessed independently of the age of the individual. The method used for DNase I activity detection exhibits low sensitivity, potentially explaining the lack of differences between severe and non-severe patients. The mRNA expression of ApoH should be assessed in parallel with the quantification of circulating molecule to figure out the reason of the deficiency.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementThe studies involving humans were approved by Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre.

The free canine influenza vaccines are made possible through local support from longtime supporters of BVSPCA and animal welfare advocates Tatiana and Gerret Copeland through Reggie’s Fund, according to the organization. “While this action goes above our usual intake protocols, and has meant a significant financial investment in the dogs who come into our care, we felt this was a necessary step to protect them and the community from further spread,” BVSPCA CEO Adam Lamb said in a news release. “We are grateful, now with the support of Tatiana Copeland, to be able to provide even further protection to the pet community with these free vaccines for owned dogs.” If you are interested in vaccinating your pup, you can register for a appointment at one of the three locations through Friday, August 9 at BVSPCA.org/flu. Each person can register up to two dogs per appointment, according to the organization. "Participants will bring their dogs to the Animal Health Center for the free vaccines. They will be scheduled at the time of the first vaccine for the required second booster canine influenza vaccine appointment at the same location," the shelter said in a statement.

Sandra Levy 7/23/2024 facebooktwitterlinkedInemail Several companies, including GSK, Sanofi and CSL Seqirus are beginning to ship influenza vaccine for the upcoming season 2024/25 flu season. GSK has started shipping doses of its trivalent influenza vaccines to U.S. healthcare providers and pharmacies. This immediately follows a licensing and lot-release approval from the Food and Drug Administration.The company noted that In February 2024, the World Health Organization recommended the removal of B/Yamagata strains from seasonal influenza vaccines. The WHO recommends that egg-based trivalent vaccines for the 2024-2025 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:`A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virusA/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virusB/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virusGSK said it expects to distribute over 36 million doses of its trivalent influenza vaccines in the United States this season. Both Flulaval and Fluarix will be available in a 0.5ml, single-dose, pre-filled syringe and are indicated for people six months of age and older.GSK noted that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, annual influenza vaccination is the best way to help protect against the flu. Ideally, vaccination should occur by the end of October, but people should continue to get vaccinated as long as the flu poses a threat. CDC recommends an annual flu vaccination for anyone aged six months or older who does not have contraindications, GSK said.[Reed more: Retailers begin providing flu shots]The CDC estimates that from Oct. 1, 2023, through June 15, 2024, there have been 35 to 65 million flu illnesses, 390,000 to 830,000 flu hospitalizations and 25,000 to 72,000 flu deaths, GSK noted.Sanofi also started shipping its first flu vaccines across the United States. Following this first shipment, additional shipments of the full Sanofi flu vaccine portfolio will continue through October to support fall immunization campaigns. Thomas Grenier, head of vaccines, North America at Sanofi said, "Today, we began shipping flu vaccines for the upcoming season, a moment that underscores our long-standing commitment to providing global protection against disease. Getting a flu shot is imperative to not only help protect against flu infection but also to help reduce the risks of its potentially severe complications, which can lead to hospitalizations, especially in those most vulnerable."The company explained that Fluzone, Flublok, and Fluzone High-Dose are vaccines indicated for the prevention of disease caused by influenza A and B strains contained in the vaccine. Fluzone is given to people six months of age and older. Flublok is given to people 18 years of age and older. Fluzone High-Dose is given to people 65 years of age and older.CSL Seqirus, a business of CSL, also has commenced shipping its differentiated portfolio of influenza vaccines. This year, the company's influenza vaccines are being produced as trivalent influenza vaccine formulations, in compliance with the FDAâs directive to remove the B/Yamagata strain, the company said.[Read more: CSL Seqirus prepared to deliver 2024/25 U.S. season influenza vaccine portfolio]"We are proud to support healthcare providers in their efforts to vaccinate their patients and communities to help turn around concerning declines in seasonal influenza vaccination rates," said Stefan Merlo, vice president of commercial operations, North America, CSL Seqirus. "We are a committed partner in public health and are doing our part to educate, inform, and meet the evolving needs of the public, ensure customers are prepared for the upcoming flu season, and help reverse this downward trend to restore vaccination rates."CSL Seqirus said it is the only manufacturer to offer a differentiated influenza vaccine option approved for use in people aged six months and older. Its portfolio includes:Flucelvax (Influenza Vaccine), the first and only cell-based influenza vaccine indicated for use in people six months and older.Fluad (Influenza Vaccine, Adjuvanted), the only adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine for adults 65 and older, is preferentially recommended by the CDCâs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices over standard-dose influenza vaccines.Fluad contains an MF59 adjuvant that is designed to strengthen, broaden and lengthen the immune response when added to an influenza vaccine.Afluria (Influenza Vaccine), an egg-based, influenza vaccine approved for use in eligible people six months of age and older."Influenza continues to pose a significant threat, as evidenced by recent flu seasons," said Gregg Sylvester, chief health officer at CSL Seqirus. "As we begin distributing influenza vaccines to healthcare providers throughout the U.S., it is imperative that we work to maintain high vaccination rates this season to help reduce the burden of influenza-related illnesses and the risk of severe outcomes."

Well, thanks to groundbreaking research led by the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), we’re witnessing the dawn of a “one and done” vaccine promising lifetime protection against the ever-evolving influenza virus.Dr. Jonah Sacha, a senior co-author of the study and head of the Division of Pathobiology at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC), is the brain behind this research.“It’s exciting because in most cases, this kind of basic science research advances the science very gradually; in 20 years, it might become something,” said Dr. Sacha. “This could actually become a vaccine in five years or less.”What sets this research apart?“The problem with influenza is that it’s not just one virus,” said Dr. Sacha. “Like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’s always evolving the next variant and we’re always left to chase where the virus was, not where it’s going to be.”Study co-senior author Dr. Simon Barratt-Boyes, professor of infectious diseases, microbiology and immunology at Pitt, noted that the inhalation of aerosolized H5N1 influenza virus causes a cascade of events that can trigger respiratory failure.“The immunity induced by the vaccine was sufficient to limit virus infection and lung damage, protecting the monkeys from this very serious infection,” said Dr. Barratt-Boyes.Creating the influenza vaccineThe novelty lies in the unconventional approach used for the research. Instead of fighting the contemporary H5N1 virus, the experts immunized primates against the infamous influenza virus of 1918, the one that brought the world to its knees.What did the researchers find? A robust immune response.The experiment involved inoculating 11 nonhuman primates against the century-old nemesis, and exposing them to the deadly H5N1. Six of them lived, while the control group of six unvaccinated primates did not survive.“It worked because the interior protein of the virus was so well preserved,” explained Dr. Sacha. “So much so, that even after almost 100 years of evolution, the virus can’t change those critically important parts of itself.”Universal influenza vaccineTraditional vaccines focus on the exterior surface proteins of viruses, which mutate faster than Usain Bolt runs. This often leaves us trying to hit a moving target. The wizards at OHSU took a different route. They focused on the internal structural proteins, which remain relatively stable over time.This translates into a stationary target for our body’s T cells to destroy, regardless of whether the virus is an old nemesis or a new variant. Using a century-old template for their experiment and achieving success is a testament to this novel approach.Real-life applicationsDr. Sacha believes that the platform could be effective against other mutating viruses including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The same vaccine platform is currently being used in a clinical trial against HIV, another formidable virus. Moreover, a recent publication by the same scientists suggests possible applications in targeting specific cancer cells.As this research progresses, there are numerous implications for public health and disease management. A universal influenza vaccine could significantly reduce the global burden of seasonal flu epidemics and pandemic outbreaks.When can we get the influenza vaccine?According to Dr. Sacha, a one-shot solution for influenza could be a reality in five to 10 years. We might be on the brink of a revolution in how we address infectious diseases.The research was made possible thanks to support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges grant awards and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, among other contributors.Toward a healthier future“It’s a massive sea change within our lifetimes,” said Dr. Sacha. “There is no question we are on the cusp of the next generation of how we address infectious disease.”This research isn’t just about fighting influenza – it’s about our journey toward a healthier future. It’s about the evolution of medical science and our relentless pursuit of solutions.And above all, it’s about hope for a world where one shot is all we need to stay safe from the ceaseless mutations of deadly viruses. Could the era of “one and done” vaccines be just around the corner? Only time will tell.The study is published in the journal Nature Communications.—–Like what you read?

Cows are spreading bird flu in the U.S., researchers found. Getty Images Key Facts Using genomic data, computer modeling and data about the virus’ spread, researchers from Cornell University have shown how infected cows from Texas spread H5N1 avian influenza to a farm with healthy cows in Ohio, as well as to cats, a racoon and wild birds in the area. It is one of the first times scientists have seen “evidence of efficient and sustained mammalian-to-mammalian transmission” of the H5N1 bird flu strain, said Diego Diel, an associate professor of virology at Cornell and one of the study’s authors. While it primarily infects birds, the so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza strain is capable of infecting mammals—including humans—and Diel said repeated spillovers into mammals from birds or transmission between mammals raises the risk of the virus mutating in a way that “could lead adaptation to mammals, spillover into humans and potential efficient transmission in humans in the future.” This H5N1 strain is particularly capable of targeting and infecting cells for the mammary gland, a specialized gland that produces milk and is unique to humans and other mammals, the researchers found, and milk from infected animals contained high quantities of the virus. Genetic data showed the infected cows transmitted the virus to cats and a racoon found dead at affected farms, likely through drinking raw milk from infected cows, as well as wild birds, which the researchers suspect were infected from environmental contamination or aerosols kicked up during milking or cleaning. While the data clearly showed evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission, genetic analysis did not reveal signs that would lead to enhanced transmissibility in humans, Diel said, though he said it is crucial to keep monitoring the outbreak for signs the virus is adapting to mammals. How Worried Should We Be About A Human Bird Flu Pandemic? Before COVID-19, experts widely believed an influenza virus would be responsible for the next human pandemic. There have been four influenza pandemics since1900, including the 1918 Spanish Flu, and seasonal variations of the virus still sicken and kill millions of people every year. Influenza viruses are expert shapeshifters, mutating constantly in a way that helps them skirt our body’s defenses and survive the drugs we may have developed to fight them. It can also help them acquire different ways to infect existing hosts, as well as to find new hosts. This is why we need seasonal shots to protect against new circulating variants and why experts are worried about more major shifts that can trigger a pandemic. H5N1 has long been a concern to health officials and agencies like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have designated it a pathogen of pandemic potential. Though it has only sporadically infected humans, usually after close contact with infected animals, it has still infected more than 800 people since 1996. How Bad Is The Bird Flu Outbreak In The U.s.? While it has torn through wild and domestic bird populations for years, experts consider increasing spillovers into mammals in recent years to be of “enormous concern.” Scientists worried about outbreaks in marine animals like seals and sea lions, and the virus has been found in a wide array of mammals including dolphins, mink, dogs, goats, squirrels and polar bears. Outbreaks among cattle in the U.S. marked a particularly worrying turning point and have intensified concerns. The type of virus had not been documented in cows before and it shocked many scientists who did not think the animals were susceptible to it. A good deal about the outbreak is still unknown, however—experts have criticized officials’ failure to share crucial information and lax testing requirements, which they claim risks outbreaks growing unnoticed—and genetic data has divided scientists as to whether H5N1 is adapting to better infect humans. The intensive nature of cattle farming raises fears the virus could gain a foothold in mammals outside of bird populations, as well as spread the virus to humans working with them and consuming products like milk and beef. Officials stress the risk to humans from bird flu is low and monitoring for the virus on farms and in milk has been stepped up to look for signs it may be adapting to mammals like humans as hosts. What To Watch For The federal government has a stockpile of potentially effective vaccines to stave off pandemic bird flu but is tapping industry to develop more shots targeted towards the H5N1 circulating. Moderna in July received $176 million in federal funding to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine in preparation for a human pandemic. GSK is also developing a bird flu mRNA vaccine after it acquired the product from German biotech CureVac. Big Number 11. That’s how many human cases of H5 bird flu have been reported in humans in the U.S. during the current outbreak that began in 2022, according to the CDC. H5 is a broader category of virus and these infections are all believed to be the kind of H5N1 circulating in animals, though only five have been confirmed as such. All infections follow close interactions with presumably infected animals, the CDC said, four after exposures to dairy cows and seven to poultry. In that time, more than 100 million domestic birds have been affected, at least 9,555 wild birds and 168 dairy herds. Hawaii is the only U.S. state without confirmed H5N1 infection in wild birds, poultry or animals. Tangent A man in Mexico died after contracting another strain of avian influenza, H5N2, in June. It was the first time the virus, separate from the H5N1 spreading among cattle, had been seen in humans and raised more questions over bird flu’s ability to reach humans. The WHO said the man had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals and it is not clear where the man may have been exposed to the virus. The agency said the risk posed by H5N2 is low and there have been no further cases reported following an investigation.

Home Patients & Visitors Healthy You Blogs Should I Time My Flu Shot Around the COVID-19 Vaccine Icon Label Icon Label Twitter Icon Label Icon Label Should I Time My Flu Shot Around the COVID-19 Vaccine? July 24, 2024 Primary Care Wellness During COVID-19 Wellness Flu season is upon us again, and the good news is flu vaccines are already available to help protect you from influenza. Because COVID-19 cases continue to rise, many people are getting a COVID-19 vaccine, too. Here is what you should know about the flu vaccine and when you should get one. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), flu vaccination prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related doctor’s visits each year. In fact, during 2019-2020, flu vaccination prevented: An estimated 7 million influenza (flu) illnesses 3 million flu-related medical visits 100,000 flu-related hospitalizations 7,000 flu-related deaths “Several studies have shown that flu vaccines reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick,” says Rebekah Sensenig, D.O., Infectious Disease Specialist for Riverside Health. When Should I Get the Flu Vaccine? The flu shot is effective for about six months, so October is a good time to get the flu vaccine. CDC offers the following guidance on when certain groups of people should get their flu shot: Adults, especially those 65 years and older, should not get vaccinated early (in July or August), because protection may decrease over time. Children can get vaccinated as soon as vaccine becomes available, even if this is in July or August. Some children need two doses of flu vaccine. For those children, CDC recommends getting the first dose as soon as vaccine is available, because the second dose needs to be given at least 4 weeks after the first. Early vaccination can also be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy, because this can help protect their infants during the first months of life (when they are too young to be vaccinated). Can I Get the Flu Vaccine and COVID-19 Vaccine at the Same Time? Yes. According to CDC, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit. You don’t need to wait 14 days between vaccinations. However, if you’ve ever had an allergic reaction to a flu shot or COVID-19 vaccine, be sure to talk with your healthcare provider before you get vaccinated. Experience with other vaccines has shown that the way our bodies develop protection, (also called an immune response) after getting vaccinated, and possible side effects of vaccines are generally the same when given alone or with other vaccines. Most people choose to receive their flu and COVID-19 vaccine in different arms, to reduce pain at the injection site. Can My Child Get a Flu Shot? Except in rare instances, children can get a flu vaccine. Flu shots can save the lives of children, and studies suggest that flu vaccination can greatly reduce a child’s risk of dying from flu. Check with your child’s pediatrician about whether your child should get a flu shot. The CDC also has a helpful resource on who cannot get a flu vaccine and who should talk to their doctor before getting a flu vaccine: Who Should & Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated. Why Is Getting a Flu Shot So Important? “There are so many reasons to get a flu vaccine this year, especially especially as COVID-19 cases are currently increasing,” says Dr. Sensenig. Do you need more reasons to get your flu shot? The CDC states that flu vaccines: Can Lower the Risk of Flu-Related Hospitalization According to CDC, flu vaccination prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year. For example, during 2019-2020 flu vaccination prevented approximately 105,000 flu-related hospitalizations. Are Important for People with Chronic Health Conditions CDC states that flu shots are associated with lower rates of cardiac problems among people with heart disease, especially for those who have had a cardiac event within the past year. Flu shots can lower the risk of flu-related complications of chronic lung disease (such as COPD) which could require hospitalization. Help Protect Pregnant Women During and After Pregnancy Flu shots reduce the risk of flu-related acute respiratory infection in pregnant women by approximately one half. Several studies suggest that in addition to helping protect pregnant people from flu, a flu vaccine given during pregnancy helps protect the baby from flu for several months after birth. Help Protect the People Around You This includes people who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like babies and young children, older people, and people with serious health conditions. Planning Your Flu Shot As part of our commitment to your good health, Riverside is offering free drive-thru or walk-up Flu and COVID-19 vaccine clinics on a first-come basis, while vaccine supplies last.

While human-to-human risk remains low, it's a worrying step towards the virus honing its transmission ability. “This is one of the first times that we are seeing evidence of efficient and sustained mammalian-to-mammalian transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1,” said corresponding author of the study Diego Diel, director of the Virology Laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell University.Cornell scientists have uncovered more about the 'spillover' of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPIA) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus, which is characterized as a "significant increase in the intensity, frequency and geographic range" of the zoonotic disease and has killed hundreds of millions of wild and farmed birds since it took hold in 2021. It's now reported in every state in the US, and every continent, except Australia and the rest of Oceania, has had outbreaks.While it's been observed that there has been likely transmission between mammals, the Cornell scientists have delivered evidence of this, with whole genomic sequencing clearly showing that the virus has passed between mammals, and not just in one direction as with many animal pathogens and hosts. On the plus side, the lab work did not turn up any evidence of any clade 2.3.4.4b mutations that would indicate it had worked out an easy path to jump to humans. On that note, it can and has infected humans – HPAI, since it was first recorded in China in 1996, has infected just 889 people, however, it proved fatal in 463 of those cases. Yet infection so far is limited to contact with contaminated waste or cow milk, and despite it targeting the human respiratory system, there's no evidence of airborne transmission yet.“The concern is that potential mutations could arise that could lead adaptation to mammals, spillover into humans and potential efficient transmission in humans in the future,” said Diel.The team analyzed viral nucleic acid taken from milk, nasal swabs, whole blood, serum, feces, urine and 608 tissue homogenate from dairy cows across nine farms in the US. What was particularly alarming in the findings was that seemingly healthy animals moved interstate were able to then pass the virus onto cattle at their new farm, indicating that containing the spread may be more difficult than previously thought."Our epidemiological investigation combined with genome sequence and geographical dispersal analysis provides evidence of efficient intra- and inter-species transmission of HPAI H5N1 genotype B3.13," the researchers noted. "Soon after apparently healthy lactating cattle were moved from Farm 1 to Farm 3, resident animals in Farm 3 developed clinical signs compatible with HPAI H5N1 providing evidence to suggest that non-clinical animals can spread the virus."This is concerning, given there is no way to 'rapid test' for the virus like there is for COVID-19; like for much of the pandemic, right now the go-to method is costly and time-consuming quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing."The bad news is that at present, there are currently no commercially available diagnostic tests to detect H5N1 specifically," Ayoade Alakija, Special Envoy for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, told Al Jazeera in June. "Nucleic acid-based (molecular) tests are the current gold standard for the detection of influenza viruses, but they generally require lab infrastructure to support their use. And even when such infrastructure is available, it may not function fast enough."In this latest study, the team looked at the whole viral genome sequence in cows, birds, domestic cats and a raccoon, and the findings suggest H5N1 can spillover in more than just one direction (say, bird to mammal). The scientists believe that the birds infected – great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) and rock pigeons (Columbia livia) – most likely became infected not from other avian species but through environmental contamination or aerosols in the atmosphere through milking or cleaning on the dairy farms.The data also revealed "high tropism" of the virus – or, its ability to infect particular cells – such as the way it targets the mammary gland in dairy cows, resulting in high viral loads being shed into milk from the sick animals. (It's worth noting, though, that the pasteurization process kills 100% of the virus.)“It is a highly pathogenic strain,” explained Erin M. Sorrell, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland. “It has the ability to replicate outside the traditional locations where low-pathogenic influenza does: the intestinal tract for poultry; the upper and lower respiratory tracts in humans. The virus becomes systemic in its infection.”The Cornell team noted that it's critical to have ongoing monitoring of farmed animals, and the US Department of Agriculture has in place testing programs that are free to access. However, scientists across the world remain vigilant, closely monitoring for 'surprises' that have the blueprint of virus mutation."This remains I think an enormous concern," said Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, in April.In recent years the virus has spilled over into red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), bears (Ursus americanus), and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). It has reached polar regions to infect and kill a polar bear (Ursus maritimus) in the Arctic and elephant (Mirounga leonine) and Antarctic fur (Arctocephalus gazella) seals, plus gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in Antarctica. In the US last year, two outbreaks resulted in the high mortality of harbor seals in Maine and Washington, as well as infecting numerous domestic cats and a goat (Capra hircus)."Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after apparently healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state," the Cornell team noted. "These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers."In another new study, scientists from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Charlotte and the Center for Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks (CIPHER) have discovered that this virulent strain of H5N1 appears to be much better at circumventing antibodies in its hosts – including those of humans.Using advanced AI and physics-based modeling techniques to assess transmission and predict future outcomes, the team found that, "the virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses." And because of the nature of how H5N1 has spread, with no central reservoir in a species or location, it does establish it as a real threat to evolve from epidemic to pandemic. "H5-related avian influenza A is an emerging pathogen in humans while being an ongoing pandemic in wildlife for over two years," said White, assistant professor of Bioinformatics at UNC. "Our predictive study provides a window to the future of using AI in the arms race against emerging pathogens."This type of research, which combines existing modeling and historic data using AI tools, is likely to be critical in keeping one step ahead of H5N1. Understanding virus protein-antibody interactions will also be crucial to developing effective vaccines if the worst case scenario emerges.An unedited version of Cornell University research has been published in Nature, while the UNC study has been published on the bioRxiv preprint server.

Alcane presented the latest on HPAI and dairy at a “Hot Topics” session at the American Cheese Society Conference that wrapped on July 13. Avian influenza outbreaks have been detected in 13 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). “And the outbreak is probably more widespread,” Alcane said, citing a lack of on-farm testing. To get a more complete analysis, the USDA is providing incentives for farmers to test herds, including veterinary fees and reimbursement for infected milk. There are more than 27,000 dairy herds in the U.S. One key bird flu concern: the virus settles in the mammary glands and is shed in milk, according to studies in mice. In late April, FDA collected and tested 275 bulk samples of raw milk collected from farms in four states where herds had tested positive. Half of those samples were positive for traces of influenza. One-quarter of those aforementioned positive samples also proved to be infectious, meaning the avian influenza grew when it was inoculated into fertilized chicken eggs. All beef in infected cows has tested negative. Four dairy farm workers have contracted the virus; all had mild flu-like systems. Retail testing of 297 samples of pasteurized milk and other pasteurized products showed no evidence of the virus, supporting FDA’s contention that pasteurization kills the virus and that all pasteurized products are safe. FDA is currently sampling 155 additional products gathered at retail. The agency continues to strongly advise against consumption of raw milk products. “We do not know if time and temperature deactivate the virus in raw milk products,” said Alcane.

The review session was scheduled over 90 minutes with the participation from 3-4 countries each day. PIP focal points and relevant technical officers from WHO Headquarters, SEARO and WHO country offices in the region attended the sessions. The main objective of the review was to assess the implementation status of HLIP III (Outputs 1 and 2) in the countries, identify key issues/challenges and discuss the way forward. Additionally, updates from the PIP Secretariat and the regional office regarding HLIP III implementation, change requests and compliance issues over the first six months of the current biennium 2024-25 were also discussed.In SEARO, the PIP PC funds allocated for the 2024-25 biennium are distributed across eight country-level work plans and one regional work plan (including the Maldives and Sri Lanka). As of 30 June 2024, the overall implementation rate of the disbursed funds in this region for the 2024-25 biennium was 26%. It was noted that most countries in the region are making good progress in implementing the PIP PC funds according to their work plans. For countries with lower implementation rates, key issues and challenges were discussed along with suggested solutions to accelerate implementation as planned. Additionally, guidance was provided by the PIP secretariat and the regional office regarding queries related to change request and compliance issues.The review concluded with congratulations to countries on their current implementation progress and further updates and discussions regarding the PIP annual review meeting scheduled for October 2024. PIP focal points from the WHO Country Offices (WCOs) were also requested to plan and share impact stories, web stories, box stories for the regional and global newsletters and annual reports to showcase the high-quality work carried out by countries and document best practices and lessons learned from using PIP PC funds.

In our study, we isolated four H3N2 CIVs from 3,758 dog nasal swabs in China between 2018 and 2020, followed by genetic and biological analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 15 genotypes among all available H3N2 CIVs, with genotype 15 prevailing among dogs since around 2017, indicating the establishment of a stable virus lineage in dogs. Molecular characterization identified many mammalian adaptive substitutions, including HA-G146S, HA-N188D, PB2-I292T, PB2-G590S, PB2-S714I, PB1-D154G, and NP-R293K, present across the four isolates. Notably, analysis of HA sequences uncovered a newly emerged adaptive mutation, HA-V223I, which is predominantly found in human and swine H3N2 viruses, suggesting its role in mammalian adaptation. Receptor-binding analysis revealed that the four H3N2 viruses bind both avian and human-type receptors. However, HA-V223I decreases the H3N2 virus’s affinity for human-type receptors but enhances its thermal stability. Furthermore, attachment analysis confirmed the H3N2 virus binding to human tracheal tissues, albeit with reduced affinity when the virus carries HA-V223I. Antigenic analysis indicated that the current human H3N2 vaccines do not confer protection against H3N2 CIVs. Collectively, these findings underscore that the potential threat posed by H3N2 CIVs to human health still exists, emphasizing the necessity of close surveillance and monitoring of H3N2 CIVs in dogs. 1 Introduction Influenza A viruses pose a significant threat to both avian species and certain mammals, including humans. These viruses are subtyped according to the genetic and antigenic characteristics of two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Wild birds, particularly waterfowl, serve as the primary natural reservoirs for influenza A viruses, harboring 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes (Dowdle et al., 1975; Wille and Holmes, 2020). Recent discoveries have expanded our understanding with the detection of novel subtypes, such as H17N10 and H18N11, in bats (Tong et al., 2012, 2013). In history, four pandemics have been caused by influenza A viruses, resulting in millions of human deaths, including the 1918 Pandemic (H1N1 virus), the 1957–1958 Pandemic (H2N2 virus), the 1968 Pandemic (H3N2 virus), and the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic (H1N1 pdm09 virus) (Subbarao and Katz, 2000). Most recently, the emergence of H7N9 viruses led to an endemic in 2013, with over 1,500 human infections and 600 fatalities (Gao et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013b; Shi et al., 2023). Thus, the ongoing risk of cross-species transmission of influenza A viruses from animal reservoirs to humans remains a significant public health concern. Among influenza A virus subtypes, H3N2 variants have been documented to infect various mammalian species alongside waterfowl. In the last century, a recombinant form of H3N2 viruses containing two genes from a duck virus (H3 and PB1) in a background of the human H2N2 strain was found to infect humans in 1968, and a recombinant form of H3N2 strains from avian and humans sources was first found in in the United States swine population in 1998 (Zhou et al., 1999; Jester et al., 2020). However, at the beginning of 21st century, avian-origin H3N2 viruses were reported to infect canines, mink, and feline, with a stable lineage established only in canines (Gagnon et al., 2009; Jeoung et al., 2013; Wasik et al., 2021). The first H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV), genetically closest to the H3N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) circulating in aquatic ducks in South Korea, was isolated in 2006 in Guangdong, China (Li et al., 2010). Since 2008, H3N2 CIVs have been frequently isolated in South Korea, Thailand, and China (Song et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Bunpapong et al., 2014). In 2015, a golden retriever in Chicago was infected with an H3N2 CIV genetically similar to those circulating in Asia (Voorhees et al., 2017), leading to the virus spreading to other states across the United States, causing respiratory disease in thousands of dogs. According to released sequence data, H3N2 CIVs are now predominantly circulating among dogs in China and the United States (Oduoye et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024), where they are considered endemic. Dogs, as one of the closest companion animals to humans, may easily transmit CIVs to humans through direct contact or aerosol transmission. Generally, CIVs are considered to pose a low threat to human beings. Notably, Chen et al. demonstrated that recent H3N2 CIVs have become capable of recognizing α2,6-linked sialic acids (human-type receptors) and transmitting efficiently via respiratory droplets in the ferret model (Chen et al., 2023), highlighting their potential cross-species transmission threat. Additionally, dogs may serve as mixing vessels for the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans. Reassortment ranks among the top factors in generating a virus with pandemic potential, as evidenced by four historical human pandemics and the emergence of H7N9 viruses in 2013. Serological data have revealed that canines can be infected with human influenza viruses, such as the human H1N1pdm09 virus and seasonal H3N3 virus (Sun et al., 2014), which may facilitate reassortment between H3N2 CIVs and human viruses. Moreover, evidence has shown that dogs are also susceptible to avian H9N2 viruses (Zhang K. et al., 2013), which provide internal gene cassettes as donors for human-infecting avian influenza viruses, such as H7N9 (Zhang Q. et al., 2013), H10N8 (Deng et al., 2015), and H3N8 viruses (Cui et al., 2023). Notably, an H3N1 CIV emerged via reassortment between a human H1N1 and a canine H3N2 virus in 2012 (Song et al., 2012), and an H3N2 CIV acquired the polymerase acidic (PA) gene from an H9N2 virus in 2015 (Lee et al., 2016). Thus, controlling H3N2 CIVs in dogs is critical to prevent the emergence of CIVs with human-infecting potential. The increasing isolation rate of H3N2 CIVs in recent years highlights the persistent threat of cross-species transmission (Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Ou et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023, 2024). To deepen our understanding of the potential risks associated with H3N2 CIVs, we isolated four strains from 3,758 canine nasal swabs collected between 2018 and 2020 in multiple provinces of China. Subsequently, we conducted comprehensive investigations into the genetic characteristics, receptor-binding properties, and antigenicity of these H3N2 CIV strains. Our findings provide crucial insights for assessing the zoonotic transmission potential of H3N2 CIVs. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Virus isolation Between 2018 and 2020, a total of 3,758 nasal swabs were collected from dogs in pet shelters and hospitals across five provinces and one autonomous region in China, including Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Yunnan Province, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The nasal swabs were preserved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with penicillin (2,000 U/mL) and streptomycin (2,000 μg/mL). Virus isolation was conducted by centrifuging the samples at 6,000 r/min for 3 min to remove impurities, followed by inoculation of the supernatant into 9- to 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h, allantoic fluid from positive samples underwent hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay using homemade H3 subtype-specific antisera to confirm the H3 subtype, while the NA subtype was determined through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using the Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems™, United States). All isolated viruses underwent biological cloning three times via limiting dilution in embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs before being collected and stored at −80°C for further analysis. 2.2 Phylogenetic analysis The genomes of four CIVs, which were deposited in the GISAID database,1 were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. To sequence the gene segments, viral RNA was extracted using the TIANamp Virus RNA Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China), and was reverse transcribed with a mixture of universal 12 bp primers (AGCRAAAGCAGG). Subsequently, PCR amplification was performed with indicated primers. The raw data generated by the genetic analyzer were assembled using the DNASTAR package (DNAstar v7.0). The primer sequences used are available upon request. To construct the phylogenetic tree of each gene segment, sequences were downloaded from databases such as GenBank2 or GISAID,3 aligned using the MAFFT algorithm, and cleaned with the trimAI module in the PhyloSuite (PhyloSuite v1.2.3) software package. The phylogenetic trees of the genes were analyzed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method with a bootstrap value of 20,000. A ≥ 98% cutoff was applied to categorize the gene segments into different groups. The tree was edited and presented using FigTree (FigTree v1.4.4). 2.3 Receptor-binding preference analysis The receptor-binding properties of H3N2 CIVs were assessed using a solid-phase binding assay with two synthesized glycopolymers: α2,3-sialylglycopolymer (Neu5Aca2–3Galb1-4GlcNAcb1-pAP-alpha-polyglutamic acid (α-PGA)) and α2,6-sialylglycopolymer (Neu5Aca2–6Galb1-4GlcNAcb1-pAP-alpha-polyglutamic acid (α-PGA)), which mimic avian- and human-type receptors, respectively (Neumann et al., 2014). To purify the virus, the allantoic fluid was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm/min for 2 h on a 30% sucrose layer. For the analysis, purified viruses with a series of twofold dilutions were incubated on a plate coated with the indicated glycopolymers at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, the washed plate was fixed with 4% formalin and washed again five times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). After incubation with the primary antibody (lab-made chicken antiserum) and matched secondary antibody (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) alternately, the plate was subjected to color development with O-phenylenediamine (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Absorbance was measured at 490 nm. 2.4 Reverse genetics To rescue a virus, we used a method previously developed in our laboratory (Kong et al., 2019). First, 293 T cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Following the manufacturer’s protocol, these cells were transfected with 4 μg of a mixture comprising the surface genes of the H3N2 virus and the backbone genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1, PR8) using the transfection agent Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States). Six hours post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.125 μg/mL of TPCK-trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States). The cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 h. After this incubation period, the supernatant from the transfected cells was collected and used to inoculate ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. 2.5 Biolayer interferometry The receptor-binding specificity of influenza A virus was evaluated by using the Octet Red 96 system (FortéBio, United States). Two types of biotinylated glycans, Neu5Ac(α2-3)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc (3SLN, avian-type receptor) and Neu5Ac(α2-6)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc (6SLN, human-type receptor), were used in this study as previously described (Kong et al., 2019). Briefly, the glycans were immobilized on the streptavidin (SA) biosensors and then incubated with 128 HA units of the indicated viruses in HBS-EP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) containing 10 mM oseltamivir. Binding was performed at 30°C for 1, 500 s. 2.6 Viral affinity to tissues The binding properties of viruses to normal human tracheal tissues, purchased from Zhongke Guanghua Intelligent Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,4 were assessed using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, following established protocols (Zhang et al., 2012; Czudai-Matwich et al.). Tissue sections were prepared in-house and subjected to deparaffinization, rehydration, and incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBST, the sections were exposed to viral suspensions (64 HA units in PBS) at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, the sections were treated with primary antibodies and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies alternately. Following staining with DAPI, the sections were examined under a microscope for analysis. 2.7 Hemagglutinin inhibition assay To evaluate the antigenicity of H3N2 CIVs, we generated chicken antiserum and ferret antisera with the indicated H3N2 CIVs and human viruses. The protocols to generate antiserum were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, with approval numbers 2020–01-01JiPi for th ferret experiment and 220,518-02-GR for the chicken experiment, respectively. For HI assay, a two-fold serial dilution of serum is prepared across the rows in a V-bottom-shaped 96-well microtiter plate. Subsequently, the sera were carefully combined with 25 μL of virus solution containing 4 HA Units, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 30 min at ambient temperature. Following this incubation period, 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells (CRBC) suspension was added to the serum-virus mixtures, and the mixtures were further incubated for an additional 45 min at room temperature. The HI titer was determined as the highest serum dilution that effectively inhibits CRBC agglutination. 3 Results 3.1 Phylogenetic analysis Between 2018 and 2020, a total of 3,758 nasal swabs from dogs were collected at pet shelters and hospitals across China, leading to the successful isolation of four H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) strains: A/canine/Heilongjiang/1/2018 (CN/HLJ/1/18), A/canine/Heilongjiang/1/2019 (CN/HLJ/1/19), A/canine/Heilongjiang/2/2019 (CN/HLJ/2/19), and A/canine/Heilongjiang/3/2019 (CN/HLJ/3/19). The eight gene segments of each isolated CIV were subjected to genetic analysis. Analysis of nucleotide sequence identities between each pair of H3N2 CIVs isolated in this study revealed remarkable similarity, with identities exceeding 99.0% across all eight genes: HA (99.0–100.0%), NA (99.6–100.0%), Polymerase Basic Protein 2 (PB2) (99.6–100.0%), Polymerase Basic Protein 1 (PB1) (99.5–100.0%), Polymerase Acidic Protein (PA) (99.3–100.0%), Nucleoprotein (NP) (99.5–100.0%), Matrix (M) (99.5–100.0%), and Non-structural Protein (NS) (99.5–100.0%). These findings indicate that the four CIVs share high genetic similarity and likely originated from the same ancestor. To understand the evolutionary patterns of H3N2 canine influenza viruses (CIVs), the genomes of four isolated H3N2 CIVs were subjected to phylogenetic analysis alongside all available H3N2 CIVs downloaded from databases. The evolutionary relationships of the H3N2 CIVs were presented in a tree constructed using Maximum Likelihood methods (Figure 1A). Based on nucleotide similarities among genes, distinct groupings were observed: HA (96.1–100%), NA (94.6–100%), PB2 (82.4–100%), PB1 (95.4–100%), PA (87.4–100%), NP (96.3–100%), M (96.9–100%), and NS (95.2–100%) formed 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, and 4 groups, respectively. Notably, the NA gene exhibited the highest diversity with 5 distinct groups, while the PB2, PA, and NS genes demonstrated moderate diversity with 4 groups each. Conversely, the HA, PB1, NP, and M genes showed the lowest diversity, with 3 groups each (Supplementary Figure S1). Based on this nucleotide diversity, the H3N2 CIVs were categorized into 15 genotypes (Figure 1B; Supplementary Table S1). As illustrated in Figure 1, H3N2 CIVs have diversified into 15 genotypes since 2006 (Supplementary Table S1). All four H3N2 CIVs isolated in this study were classified under Genotype (G) 15, which has emerged as the predominant genotype since approximately 2017 (Figure 1; Supplementary Table S1). Notably, H3N2 CIVs in China and the United States exhibited similar evolutionary patterns, with viruses from both countries belonging to the same groups, and no distinct Eurasian or North American lineages were observed. Figure 1 Figure 1. Phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 CIVs. (A) Phylogenetic tree of the HA gene. The tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method and rooted to the A/canine/Guangdong/1/2006 (H3N2) virus. Sequences with a nucleotide identity greater than 98% were grouped together. (B) Genotype analysis of canine H3N2 viruses. The eight gene segments are indicated at the top of each bar. The genotype of all H3N2 viruses was determined based on the combination of different groups observed in the trees presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1. 3.2 Molecular characterization of H3N2 CIVs Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the four H3N2 CIVs revealed a conserved monobasic amino acid (R) at the HA cleavage site, indicating their low pathogenicity. However, multiple substitutions at various sites within different proteins are critical for receptor binding, pathogenicity, and host adaptation of AIVs. As shown in Table 1, analysis of HA proteins identified that all four H3N2 isolates contain HA-G146S and HA-N188D mutations, which enhance receptor binding affinity of H3N2 CIVs toward α2,6-linked sialic acids and improve the thermostability of HA (Chen et al., 2023). One virus, CN/HLJ/2/19, harbors G16S in the signal peptide of HA, which enhances acid stability (Chen et al., 2023). No typical mammalian adaptive mutations, such as PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N, were detected in the polymerase proteins. Notably, PB2-292 T, which is common in seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses (Neumann et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2019); PB2-G590S, PB2-S714I, and PB1-D154G, which enhance polymerase activity and viral replication in mammals, were observed in all four H3N2 CIVs (Zhang et al., 2012; Czudai-Matwich et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2023). Another mutation, NP-R293K, dominant in human viruses, was found in all four viruses (Chen and Shih, 2009). In other proteins, we found only one mammalian adaptive signature, NS1-42S, associated with the pathogenicity of H5 and H1 viruses in mammals (Jiao et al., 2008). In addition, drug resistance mutations, NA-H157Y, and M2-V27I (Monto et al., 2006; Musharrafieh et al., 2018), emerged in all four H3N2 CIVs. Collectively, these data suggest that H3N2 CIVs have evolved to be more mammalian adaptive. Table 1 Table 1. Key molecular markers of H3 viruses in this study. 3.3 Genetic analysis of HA-V223I in recent H3N2 CIVs In addition to the observed adaptive mutations identified in our four isolates, the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 HA proteins also identified two mutations, HA-N171T and HA-V223I, which are dominant in 2023 H3N2 isolates (Figure 2; Supplementary Table S2). According to the structural analysis (Figure 2A), we noticed that only position 223 is located close to the receptor-binding domain of the globular head of HA, suggesting its role in host adaptation. Therefore, we analyzed the amino acid polymorphism of this position. As shown in Figure 2B, HA-V223I appeared in canine H3N2 in 2018 and became dominant in 2023 (Figure 2B). In avian H3N2, position 223 is highly conserved (Figure 2C), with only 2 viruses harboring HA-223I among all viruses analyzed (data not shown). Interestingly, in human and swine H3N2 viruses, we found that HA-V223I surged in 2011 and is now dominant in naturally circulating viruses (Figures 2D,E). These results suggest that HA-V223I may play an important role in host adaptation. Figure 2 Figure 2. Amino acid position 223 in the 3D structure of HA (PDB: 6aot) (A), and mutation dynamics in HAs from canine (B), avian (C), human (D), and swine (E) H3N2 viruses. The HA sequences of these H3N2 viruses were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (GenBank). 3.4 Receptor binding properties The H3N2 CIVs have gradually acquired critical mutations in HA that may alter their receptor-binding preference. Therefore, we evaluated the receptor binding affinity of the four wild-type H3N2 viruses using a solid-phase binding assay. As depicted in Figure 3A, the control viruses, A/chicken/Chongqing/SD001/2021 (H5N6) and A/swine/Jiangxi/261/2016 (H1N1), demonstrated a preference for α2,3-sialylglycopolymer (avian-type receptors) and α2,6-sialylglycopolymer (human-type receptors), respectively. All the tested viruses not only bind avian-type receptors but also exhibit an affinity for human-type receptors. These findings suggest that the four H3N2 CIVs possess the potential to infect humans. Figure 3 Figure 3. Receptor-Binding Analysis of H3N2 CIVs by using solid-phase binding assay (A), Biolayer interferometry (B), and bindind affnity to human treaches section (C). In the solid-phase binding assay, preferences for avian-type and human-type receptors were assessed using α2,3-sialylglycopolymer (blue) and α2,6-sialylglycopolymer (pink), respectively, conducted in triplicate with avian and swine influenza viruses as controls. The biolayer interferometry assay utilized the Octet Red 96 system to analyze receptor interaction with two biotinylated glycans, 3SLN (avian-type) and 6SLN (human-type), the indicated viruses were analyzed at 30°C for 1, 500 s. For the human tracheal tissue staining, sections were treated with the viruses followed by relevant polyclonal and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies and DAPI dye (blue), where green staining indicated successful virus binding. These methodologies collectively provided detailed insights into the receptor-binding dynamics of H3N2 CIVs. The HA-V223I, which is dominant in human and swine H3N2 viruses but highly absent in avian H3N2 viruses, may play an important role in canine adaptation of H3N2 CIVs. To get insights into HA-V223I on the receptor-binding preference in more detail, we selected one representative H3N2 virus, CN/HLJ/2/19, and rescued two H3N2 viruses with or without HA-V223I, CN/HLJ/2/19_PR8 and CN/HLJ/2/19_HA-V223I_PR8, with the surface genes from CN/HLJ/2/19 and the backbone of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8). Then, the receptor-binding preference of the indicated viruses was analyzed by using biolayer interferometry with two synthesized receptor analogs. Two viruses, A/Kansas/14/2017(H3N2) and A/chicken/Chongqing/SD001/2021(H5N6), which preferentially bind to human-type receptors and avian-type receptors, respectively, were set as controls. As shown in Figure 3B, CN/HLJ/2/19_PR8 showed a higher binding affinity toward human-type receptors than CN/HLJ/2/19_HA-V223I_PR8, while CN/ HLJ/2/19_HA-V223I_PR8 exhibited a lower binding affinity toward avian-type receptors than CN/ HLJ/2/19_PR8. These data demonstrate that HA-V223I enhances the binding affinity of H3N2 CIVs to avian-type receptors rather than to human-type receptors. To further investigate whether the isolated H3N2 CIVs with or without HA-V223I could bind to human-type receptors, sections of normal human tracheal tissues, which exclusively express α2,3-linked sialic acids (Kumlin et al., 2008), were used to analyze attachment patterns. A high affinity was observed for the human H3N2 control virus, A/Kansas/01/2017, whereas no signal was detected for the negative control. Consistent with the results from the solid-phase binding assay, CN/HLJ/2/19_PR8 (H3N2) demonstrated attachment to human tracheal tissues. Similarly, the CN/HLJ/2/19_HA-V223I_PR8 (H3N2) virus also exhibited binding to human tracheal tissues, albeit with a lower affinity compared to CN/HLJ/2/19_PR8 (H3N2) (Figure 3C). These findings strongly suggest that recent H3N2 CIVs have the capacity to bind to human-type receptors, thus posing a potential infection risk to humans. 3.5 Role of HA-V223I on thermal stability of H3N2 CIV Besides the receptor-binding preference, thermal stability is another critical factor influencing the transmission of influenza A viruses (Imai et al., 2012; Linster et al., 2014). First, we analyzed the thermal stability at room temperature over a period of 10 days. As shown in Figure 4A, the stability of H3N2 CIV with or without the HA-V223I mutation were relatively stable during the 10-day observation period, with CN/HLJ/2/19(H3N2)_HA-V223I_PR8 being more stable than CN/HLJ/2/19(H3N2)_PR8 on day 10. To confirm the difference in thermal stability, we next assessed the stability of H3N2 CIV with or without the HA-V223I mutation under heat treatment for 30 min at various temperatures (Figure 4B). As depicted in Figure 4, CN/HLJ/2/19(H3N2)_HA-V223I_PR8 exhibited higher thermal stability than CN/HLJ/2/19(H3N2)_PR8 when subjected to heat treatment. These findings suggest that H3N2 CIVs that carry the HA-V223I mutation may be better able to survive under adverse environmental conditions. Figure 4 Figure 4. Effect of Heat Treatment on Hemagglutination Activity of H3N2 CIVs at different temperatures. (A) Thermal stability of H3N2 CIVs at room temperature for 10 days, or (B) at different temperatures for 30 min. Aliquots of viruses containing 128 HA units were incubated at the indicated temperature for the indicated time periods, and the hemagglutination titers of the heat-treated samples were then assessed using a hemagglutination assay with 0.5% chicken red blood cells. Each data point represents the mean ± standard deviation from three replicate experiments. 3.6 Antigenicity analysis Immunity against H3N2 CIVs is pivotal in preventing cross-species transmission from dogs to humans. To comprehend the antigenic properties of H3N2 CIVs, Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assays were conducted using antisera generated against viruses isolated from humans and canines. Antisera against three human viruses and four canine viruses were generated in ferrets and chickens, respectively. As presented in Table 2, antisera against H3N2 human viruses exhibited robust cross-reactivity with the tested human viruses, albeit with HI titers against heterologous viruses 2–4-fold lower than those against their homologous viruses. Intriguingly, none of the antisera generated against human viruses exhibited reactivity with CIVs, with all HI titers below the test limit. Interestingly, antisera generated with H3N2 CIVs not only exhibited strong cross-reactivity with CIVs but also demonstrated significant cross-reactivity with human H3N2 viruses. However, HI titers against heterologous viruses were 2–8-fold lower than those against their homologous viruses. In addition, since human H3N2 viruses preferentially bind human-type receptors and the HI assay is usually analyzed with guinea pig red blood cells according to the Worldwide Influenza Center lab, we also analyzed the antigenicity with guinea pig red blood cells. The data indicated that the reaction pattern was similar to that analyzed with chicken red blood cells (Supplementary Table S3). Taken together, these data indicate that individuals immunized with human H3N2 vaccines may not be fully protected against the cross-transmission of canine H3N2 viruses from dogs to humans. Table 2 Table 2. Antigenic analysis of H3N2 viruses. 4 Discussion H3N2 CIV has been circulating in China for over a decade and is frequently isolated from dogs (Wasik et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024), highlighting its adaptation to the most important companion animal. This raises concerns about dogs serving as potential intermediate hosts for the cross-species transmission of H3N2 CIVs from dogs to humans. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and biological characteristics of four H3N2 CIVs isolated in China between 2018 and 2020. Our findings revealed that H3N2 CIVs have undergone substantial evolutionary changes, forming 15 distinct genotypes over time, with G15 emerging as the dominant genotype worldwide, indicating the establishment of a stable lineage in dogs. Molecular characterization unveiled the acquisition of numerous mammalian adaptive mutations, including HA-W222L, HA-G146S, HA-N188D, PB2-I292T, PB2-G590S, PB2-S714I, PB1-D154G, and NP-R293K. Biological experiments demonstrated that the four H3N2 CIVs have evolved to exhibit increased affinity toward α2,6-linked sialic acids and have gained the ability to attach to human tracheal tissues, thus highlighting their potential threat to human health. Interestingly, analysis of recent H3N2 CIVs identified a new host adaptive mutation HA-V223I. Although HA-V223I decreases the receptor-binding preference to human-type receptors, it increases the thermal stability of H3N2 viruses, indicating its easier survival in harsh environments. Therefore, the accumulation of HA-V223I did not downgrade the threat of H3N2 CIVs to human health. The acquisition of human-type receptor binding affinity is a critical indicator of the potential for influenza viruses to cause pandemics in humans. For instance, the 2013 H7N9 outbreak, which resulted in over 1,500 human infections, was characterized by the virus’s ability to bind to both avian-type and human-type receptors (Shi et al., 2023). Research by Xiong et al. identified two mutations, G186V and G226L, that enhanced the H7N9 virus’s affinity for human receptors (Xiong et al., 2013). Similarly, the HA-G226S mutation has been linked to increase binding affinity in H3N8 avian influenza viruses (AIVs), which were associated with human infections in 2022 and 2023 (Cheng et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2023). In this study, analysis of HA proteins revealed that all H3N2 CIVs in Genotypes 14 and 15 have acquired the HA-G146S mutation (Figure 1). This mutation leads to a shift from recognition solely of avian-type receptors to binding to both avian-type and human-type receptors (Chen et al., 2023). Our solid-phase binding assay, along with attachment analysis, confirmed their binding affinity toward human-type receptors. The changes in receptor binding affinities to avian-type receptors and human-type receptors are frequently observed in multiple influenza subtypes, such as H7N9 and H10N3. For H7N9 viruses, they initially bind to both avian and human-type receptors. However, after circulating in chickens for 5 years, they exhibit a gradual loss in their ability to bind to human-type receptors, while simultaneously developing a higher affinity for avian-type receptors (Yin et al., 2021), which is caused by the L226Q mutation in HA. In the case of H10N3 viruses, different mutations influence receptor affinity; the HA-G228S mutation increases affinity for human-type receptors, whereas HA-Q222R reduces it (Zhang et al., 2023). In our study, the genetic analysis of canine H3N2 HAs from various species identified HA-V223I as a mammalian adaptive mutation (Figure 2). However, there was no increase in affinity for human-type receptors. Instead, HA-V223I provided greater thermal stability, potentially enhancing the virus’s survivability in environmental conditions. Notably, Song et al. (2008) reported that the canine upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium mainly displays α-2,3 sialic acid receptors. It is reasonable that H3N2 viruses may gradually evolve to increase binding affinity to avian-type receptors (Song et al., 2008). Besides receptor binding preference, thermal stability is a crucial factor influencing virus transmission. For example, Imai et al. reported that the HA-N158D mutation increases the thermal stability of an H5N1 virus, facilitating respiratory transmission among ferrets (Imai et al., 2012). Similarly, Herfst et al. (2012) found that the HA-H110Y mutation, present in a ferret-transmissible virus, enhances the virus’s thermal stability (Linster et al., 2014). These observations collectively suggest that higher thermal stability may allow viruses to survive longer under harsh environmental conditions, thereby potentially improving their ability to transmit. This correlation between thermal stability and transmission highlights the complex dynamics of virus evolution and adaptation in different hosts and environments. In addition to receptor-binding preference, mutations in other proteins and reassortment play critical roles in the mammalian adaptation of influenza viruses. Two well-known mutations, PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N, frequently identified in mammalian-adapted H5N1 and H7N9 isolates (Hatta et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005), were not found in H3N2 CIVs. The gradual mammalian adaptation occurs through mutations in other proteins. PB2-I292V has been reported to enhance the polymerase activity of the H7N9 virus (Kong et al., 2019), while PB2-I292T has been suggested to facilitate the adaptation of human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses (Miotto et al., 2008). Additionally, PB1-D154G has been demonstrated to increase the polymerase activity of CIVs. Currently, both PB2-I292T and PB1-D154G are prevalent in H3N2 CIVs. Reassortment is another factor that can significantly impact the polymerase activity of influenza viruses in human cells. Bhat et al. found that acquiring the PA gene from an H9N2 virus markedly increased the polymerase activity of an H7N9 virus in human cells. Similarly, Hao et al. demonstrated that the PA gene from an H9N2 virus could enhance the polymerase activity and pathogenicity of an H5N1 virus in mice (Hao et al., 2016). Considering a previous finding that reassortment between H3N2 CIV and H9N2 AIV did occur (Lee et al., 2016), the possibility of a canine H3N2 reassortant with the potential for cross-species transmission is conceivable. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the potential threat posed by recent isolates of H3N2 CIVs. Our data indicate that these recent H3N2 CIVs have acquired multiple mammalian adaptive mutations and have gained affinity for human-type receptors, suggesting a potential threat to human health. Therefore, close surveillance and monitoring of H3N2 CIVs in dogs should be of the highest priority.

This region's complex ecological landscape, characterised by extensive river systems, wetlands, and migratory bird routes, coupled with small-scale poultry farming practices, and limited biosecurity measures, has historically been a breeding ground for avian influenza viruses. Since the early 2000s, the GMS has experienced several outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A/H5Nx, which have had significant impacts on public health, poultry production, and the economy. A novel reassortant A/H5N1 virus detected in the region signals a critical juncture in the ongoing fight against avian influenza and highlighting the need for a recalibrated, unified approach to surveillance, risk assessment, and response strategies.In addition to the challenges faced in the GMS, other Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines have also been battling the spread of avian influenza. In Indonesia, some A/H5N1 viruses have molecular markers associated with adaptations to mammalian hosts, raising concerns about zoonotic potential. The Philippines has experienced significant outbreaks, including the A/H5N6 in 2017 and A/H5N1 in 2023, which resulted in substantial poultry losses and raised public health alarms. The continued circulation of endemic lineages and emergence of novel avian viruses across Southeast Asia highlights the critical importance of collaboration and communication among all stakeholders in effectively managing this public health threat. Seamless information sharing between the ministries of health, agriculture, and environment within and between neighbouring countries is paramount for a swift and coordinated response. Engaging with key international partners, such as the Quadripartite Members (FAO, WOAH, WHO, UNEP), is equally vital in leveraging global expertise and resources. Open communication channels must be established and maintained with non-governmental organizations, the poultry industry, and the general public to ensure transparency, build trust, and facilitate the implementation of control measures. Sharing information on the virus's spread, genetic characteristics, and potential risks through regular updates and accessible platforms will help raise awareness and promote compliance with recommended actions. Collaboration with academic and research institutions is essential for advancing our understanding of the virus and developing evidence based strategies for surveillance, prevention, and control.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)’s Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) in the Region of Asia and the Pacific (RAP), in collaboration with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), will organize a regional expert consultation to tackle the challenges posed by reassortant strains of HPAI in the region. Funding for this consultation will be provided by the OSRO-RAS-409-USA project.ObjectivesThe objectives of the meeting are to:Share and discuss the latest developments concerning HPAI A/H5Nx, including its detection, spread, and genetic analysis within Southeast Asia.Identify current surveillance limitations and propose strategies for the augmented detection of the virus.Review the efficacy of existing control measures and explore additional, innovative strategies to limit the virus's spread.Perform a regional joint risk assessment on the risk of further emergency and spread of novel influenza viruses in animal populations and potential cross-over to humans.Improve information sharing protocols between regional countries and with international partners for a timely and coordinated response.

Experts worry the virus is developing new capabilities that could help it evolve to spread from person to person — something that has not yet been observed. According to the new research, cats and a raccoon acquired the virus and died, most likely after drinking raw milk.New research into the ongoing bird flu outbreaks on dairy farms describes in unprecedented detail how efficiently the virus has spread among cows, and from cows to other mammals, including cats and a raccoon. It’s an indication that the virus is developing new capabilities that have bird flu experts worried. Bird flu has affected more than 100 million wild aquatic birds, commercial flocks and backyard poultry in the U.S. over the last several years. Its spread has had scientists on alert about the possibility that the virus could one day evolve to spread from person to person, igniting the next pandemic. No human-to-human transmission has occurred yet, as far as researchers know. But the case total among people continues to grow: Colorado state health officials confirmed three new cases of bird flu in people Thursday, bringing the national total to 14. The human cases have all been in farmworkers infected after exposure to sick animals, and all but one have been diagnosed in the last four months. Though little is known yet about the three newest infections, the rest have been mild.The new study demonstrates that the virus is spreading from one mammal species to another — a relatively new phenomenon that could make it harder for authorities to control. The longer the virus remains uncontrolled, the more potential it has to evolve and adapt to become more of a threat to people, according to the authors of the new study, which was published in the journal Nature on Tuesday.“The virus is not very efficient in infecting humans and transmitting between humans, but if the virus continues to circulate in dairy cows and from dairy cows into other mammalian species, that could change,” said Diego Diel, an author of the study and the director of the Virology Laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University. “It’s concerning.” The new study evaluated the first outbreaks of avian influenza among cows at nine farms in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Ohio, sampling the animals and then comparing the genetic similarity of virus between them. The researchers found that the virus, a particular strain of bird flu known as H5N1, spread rapidly among farms. When infected cows were moved from Texas to a different farm in Ohio, the virus was soon discovered in the Ohio cows. And genetic sequencing suggests that cats and a raccoon acquired the virus and died, most likely after drinking raw milk. Sick cows began to eat less feed, ruminated less, experienced decreased milk production and produced discolored milk, the study says. On some affected farms, cows died at twice the normal rate.Andrew Bowman, a professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State University who was not involved in the new study, said the research reflects the experience veterinarians have had on many U.S. farms. “It matches with the clinical picture,” Bowman said. “That’s 100% what we’ve seen on dairy farms. This is just the first real published documentation.” The study bolsters evidence that handling or drinking unpasteurized milk is dangerous. Diel said infected cows shed incredible amounts of virus through their mammary glands when infected — at higher concentrations than the virus can be easily cultured in a laboratory setting. “It’s extremely risky to drink raw milk,” Diel said.Various studies have detected live H5N1 virus in raw milk, and others have shown that pasteurization inactivates the virus, making commercially produced milk safe for consumption. Farmers are not supposed to send any milk with a possibility of contamination for production. “Milk from sick cows shouldn’t be going into the milk supply,” Bowman said.As scientists continue to study the avian flu outbreak, Bowman said he will be interested to learn whether cows can shed the virus before they start to appear sick, as well as whether the virus continues to spread onward from the mammals that contract infections from cows. This is the third episode in which the virus has spread fairly quickly among a group of mammals, said Anice Lowen, a virologist and professor at Emory University School of Medicine who was also not involved in the new study. Previously, virus spread on mink farms and among sea lions and fur seals last summer. Cases in some mammals have been severe, and the virus has caused mass deaths among sea lions and seals, among other species. Lowen said health officials should also consider the risk that people could get infected with H5N1 and the seasonal flu at the same time this winter. When someone is infected by multiple influenza viruses, those viruses can go through a process called reassortment, in which they trade genetic information. This process can give viruses a shortcut to evolve, potentially altering the way they spread.“The virus we have right now in cows presents a relatively low risk to humans. CDC has said that and they’re right,” Lowen said. “But where the risk lies in my mind is viral evolution. They change when they adapt to new hosts. They change when they go through reassortment and exchange genes.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined to comment on the new research.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Pinterest Share via Email Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a viral infection that can affect birds and sometimes humans. There is currently a new strain which seems to be highly contagious among birds and can likely infect humans through direct or indirect contact with infected poultry or their droppings. It is caused by various strains of influenza A viruses, some of which can cause severe disease and death in poultry and wild birds, and others that can infect humans and cause mild to serious illness. Carolina experts are available to discuss the status of the current situation, including possible risk to animals and humans. They’re also able to discuss prevention and effective public health preparedness and response activities. Mark Heise, PhD is a virologist at UNC School of Medicine who researches how viral and host genetic factors influence virus-induced disease. He studies respiratory viruses influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, along with mosquito-borne alphaviruses. Heise is also the cofounder of READDI, a nonprofit biotechnology company dedicated to preventing global catastrophes caused by viruses.

So it is in the community, but still at a lower risk.”Dr. Cardona said while rare, bird flu is contracted when a person has close contact with an infected animal.Symptoms of the virus typically include fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, stuffy nose, and nausea.They may also get conjunctivitis, often referred to as “pink eye.”Bird flu in humans can be deadly.According to the CDC, in roughly 50% of known cases worldwide, the person died.However, when detected early, the virus is treatable.“People that have immunocompromising conditions or are pregnant, the elderly, may have some type of chronic condition such as with the heart, diabetes, and especially younger infants that have not developed their immunity, may be at risk for more severe illness with any type of influenza, including the bird flu,” she said Dr. Cardona. There is a test available for bird flu, which involves a throat or nose swab.Since the virus isn’t common, it’s important to tell your doctor right away if you suspect you were exposed to the virus.About Cleveland ClinicCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.

The researchers, from Cornell University, have issued a warning. “Efficient and sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission is unprecedented. It is worrisome because it may cause the virus to adapt, enhancing its infectivity and transmissibility to other species, including people,” the researchers note in their study, which was published urgently Wednesday in the journal Nature. The authors call for strict measures to prevent transmission to cows and to “reduce the risk of a pandemic in humans.”The world is currently experiencing the biggest avian influenza crisis ever known. A subtype of the H5N1 virus, designated 2.3.4.4b, emerged in 2021 in wild birds and has since killed hundreds of millions of birds worldwide. The World Health Organization still considers the risk to the public to be “low,” although its records show that the H5N1 virus has jumped from birds to at least 889 people since 2003, killing 463 of them (52%). Scientists’ worst nightmare is that a virus with such lethality will mutate and become capable of human-to-human transmission, which has not happened so far.Cornell researchers, led by Brazilian virologist Diego Diel, have observed that this subtype of the virus has a strong ability to infect udder cells and concentrate in milk, although it also appears in the lungs of cows. Scientists speculate that the pathogen may be transmitted via the respiratory or oral route, but they also suspect that it could enter through the teat orifice from contaminated soil or milking machines. As for the cats and the raccoon, the hypothesis is that they became infected by drinking contaminated milk. Two months ago, an experiment on mice showed that raw milk may contain viruses capable of transmitting the disease.Virologist Elisa Pérez is concerned about what is happening in the U.S., where 168 affected herds in 13 states have been identified since the first case was detected in a cow on March 25. “It is very worrying, because it implies that cows constitute a new reservoir of avian influenza — at least of this particular genotype — and that they can act as a source of infection for other species, both birds and mammals. This is something that had never been observed before with this virus, since the only natural reservoir of avian influenza was birds,” says the expert, from the Animal Health Research Center in Madrid. Infected cows may display symptoms such as reduced appetite, digestive disorders, respiratory problems and lower milk production. So far, there have only been outbreaks among cattle in the United States.The nine farms tested in the study are in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and Kansas. They are outdoor farms, where wild birds have contact with dairy cows, both directly and indirectly, through contaminated feed or water. The first affected farms are on a route commonly used by migratory birds to cross North America.On January 25, a scientific team found the B3.13 version of the 2.3.4.4b subtype of the H5N1 virus, the root of the unprecedented outbreaks in dairy cattle, in a Canadian goose in Wyoming. The analysis of the complete genome of the virus in cows has not detected mutations that favor the jump to humans.Pérez stresses that cows on a farm in Ohio became infected after the arrival of asymptomatic cattle from another facility in Texas. “This confirms that apparently healthy cows can transmit the virus. That is, not all cows develop clinical symptomatology after infection. This has very important implications for surveillance systems,” explains the virologist. “With these data, it is clear that we should not only carry out passive surveillance (testing only samples from cows with symptoms), but it is also essential to include active surveillance programs, such as, for example, testing tank milk on all cattle farms, as will be the case in Colorado, one of the states most severely affected by avian influenza in cows.”American epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove, director of the emerging diseases unit of the World Health Organization, declared two months ago that Covid-19 would not be “the last pandemic we will deal with in our lifetimes.” Diel points to H5N1 from his laboratory at Cornell University. “It is difficult to predict which virus will be next but given the propensity of influenza viruses to cause pandemics, it is very important to keep a close eye on the H5N1 situation in dairy cattle,” he explains to EL PAÍS.The first outbreak that set off alarm bells worldwide occurred at a mink farm in Spain. In autumn 2022, dead seagulls and gannets appeared on Galician beaches. In early October, American mink began to die of hemorrhagic pneumonia at a fur farm in Carral, outside A Coruña. Mortality in the outbreak exceeded 4% in just seven days. A study led by biologist Montserrat Agüero, of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Central Veterinary Laboratory, suggested in January 2023 that the avian flu virus had jumped from wild birds to mink, mutated on the farm, and been transmitted from mammal to mammal. Early last year, the mass death of sea lions from bird flu in Peru suggested that the virus might be jumping between mammals in the wild. Dutch veterinarian Thijs Kuiken, of the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, then posed a question in EL PAÍS: “If it occurs in minks and sea lions, why won’t it occur in humans?”Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

(by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Colorado health officials identified two more cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — in humans over the weekend, bringing the case count in the state to seven people who worked with inflected birds. A worker at a northeast Colorado commercial egg layer in Weld County, where five other cases occurred, was confirmed sick on Friday. On Saturday, officials identified another presumptive positive case in a worker at a separate poultry farm in Weld County. Another Colorado resident contracted the virus from infected cattle earlier this month. The cluster of cases, comprising eight people in Colorado, accounts for most of the bird flu cases reported in humans in the country. The recently infected workers were dealing directly with infected poultry and experienced mild symptoms such as pink eye and respiratory infection symptoms. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that heat could have prevented proper use of personal protective equipment, exposing the workers to the virus. Federal health officials have commissioned Moderna to develop a vaccine to protect people from an avian influenza that has been circulating in dairy cattle in recent months, according to reporting by the Iowa Capital Dispatch. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials said July 3 the agency would devote about $176 million to the effort, with the hope that final clinical trials might commence next year.

According to NACI, Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent has the most substantial body of supporting evidence among preferentially recommended vaccines for adults 65 years of age and older.i Delphine Lansac General Manager, Vaccines Canada, Sanofi "More than one out of two seniors in Canada who received a flu shot were immunized with Fluzone® High-Dose this past flu season. Fluzone® High-Dose has a longstanding and consistent body of clinical evidence supporting its benefits to protect adults 65 years and older from influenza and reduce the risk of its potentially severe complications. As a leader in public health protection in Canada, with roots dating back 110 years, we are proud to soon be manufacturing Fluzone® High-Dose right here in Toronto." Dr. Angel Chu MD, FRCPCInfectious disease specialist, Clinical Assistant Professor, University of Calgary, STI Clinic Calgary, and Vice-Chair of Immunize Canada "In the newest NACI statement, Fluzone® High-Dose continues to be recommended for adults 65 years of age and older. NACI also recognizes Fluzone® High-Dose has the most substantial body of supporting evidence among flu vaccines for seniors." Influenza can cause mild to severe illness, including approximately 12,000 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths annually in Canadaii. Some populations, especially young children and adults 65 years of age and older, are at a higher risk for serious influenza complicationsiii. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complicationsiv. Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine is specifically designed to provide protection for adults 65 years of age and older with 4 times the active component dosage of a standard vaccine. To date, Fluzone® High-Dose is available in more than 20 countries including the US, Canada, and Germany and continues to be publicly funded in Canada by numerous provinces and territories. Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine will transition to a trivalent formulation for the 2025-2026 influenza season. The timing of this transition is also in line with the recommendation of European health authorities. This is following the direction of the World Health Organization to exclude the B/Yamagata lineage from influenza vaccine formulations due to the absence of confirmed detection of naturally occurring B/Yamagata lineage viruses since March 2020. The benefits of annual influenza vaccination remain unchanged, whether trivalent or quadrivalent. There are no safety issues associated with the continued use of quadrivalent flu vaccines for all populations globally. Sanofi is a committed public health partner providing life-saving vaccines and immunizations for Canadians and people worldwide. As a global leader in influenza vaccine development and manufacturing, we have met increasing demand for doses of both Fluzone® Standard-Dose and High-Dose vaccines over the past 4 years. Our footprint in Canada continues to grow with two new vaccine manufacturing facilities in Toronto. This includes the country's largest pediatric and booster vaccine manufacturing facility, now open, and a second facility that will produce Fluzone® High-Dose.

The virus has driven up egg and turkey prices and crossed over from infecting just birds to numerous mammalian species, including sea lions, mice, cats, dairy cows, and, increasingly, humans. And it shows no signs of stopping — only reaching new milestones.The first milestone reached this month concerns the birds themselves. Last week, a Weld County, Colorado, farm that housed 1.3 million egg-laying hens detected bird flu and, per federal policy, was forced to kill the whole flock in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Those 1.3 million dead birds tipped the total number of chickens and turkeys killed during this outbreak to over 100 million — double the total from the previous outbreak in 2014 and 2015.The second milestone concerns us humans. Earlier in July, bird flu was detected on an even bigger farm — housing 1.78 million hens — in the same Colorado county as the first farm. A crew of some 150 workers were deployed to kill the hens. They were given goggles and masks for protection, but the 104-degree heat combined with strong industrial fans in the barns made it difficult for the gear to work effectively.Six workers contracted the virus, which made it the single most infectious bird flu event for humans in US history, more than doubling the number of Americans who had contracted the virus since April 2022. Workers remove their biohazard suits after culling ducks at a farm in Ontario, Canada, in 2022. Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals MediaAround half of the nearly 900 people who’ve fallen ill to H5N1 globally since the early 2000s have died, though the variant circulating during this outbreak has proven quite mild in humans. Patients in Colorado and elsewhere have reported pink eye, fever, and coughing, and the Centers for Disease Control maintains that the risk to the American public remains low. I spoke with four bird flu experts who generally agree with that risk assessment, but with some important caveats, which brings us to the third milestone. Some of those experts said that, based on genetic sequencing from one of the sickened farmworkers, the strain of the virus that infected all those hens and workers is related to a strain that’s been circulating in cows. That means the strain is more infectious for other mammals — like humans — than a normal poultry H5N1 virus.“I don’t think it is a coincidence that several people were infected with this version of the virus, which has adapted to cows,” said Philip Meade, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Health System.This doesn’t mean a bird flu pandemic is on the horizon. For that to happen, the virus would have to evolve in such a way that it effectively transmits from human to human and causes more severe symptoms, which may never happen. But that’s the bedeviling nature of bird flu — it’s highly unpredictable. Tom Peacock, a virologist fellow at the Pirbright Institute, which researches livestock diseases, said the risk level remains low “until it suddenly isn’t,” in the event that the virus adapts to transmit between people. That it’s circulating among cows increases the possibility that it could occur.Is bird flu here to stay?That the virus has been spreading in the US for over two years also raises the question as to whether it’s endemic, meaning it circulates year-round.Experts told me it’s highly likely that it’s already endemic in wild birds, the original reservoir for the virus, who spread it to poultry farms in the spring and fall during migration. In Europe, which has experienced a steep decline in bird flu outbreaks on poultry farms this year, wild birds seem to have gained some immunity from the virus, which could happen here too.But the persistence of H5N1 in the US during the summer months suggests that a “decent proportion” of recent poultry outbreaks, according to Peacock, seem to be caused by the cattle strain, which he described as a major change.Today, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.“The concern here is that the virus can maintain a transmission cycle involving cattle — which don’t usually die or sometimes even develop noticeable symptoms from bird flu — creating a reservoir from which the virus could mutate unfavorably or cause human outbreaks,” said Brady Page, an infectious disease research fellow at the Scripps Research Institute.In short, we could be entering some kind of bird flu doom loop, in which it has multiple reservoirs to infect farmed birds, and can more readily adapt to infect mammals.That the threat level is on the rise is also a damning indictment of the US Department of Agriculture’s sclerotic response to the virus, which has drawn sharp criticism from the infectious disease research community.Bird flu first began to infect dairy cows late last year, but it wasn’t detected until late March. The USDA then took several weeks to upload critical data about the virus. It also didn’t mandate routine testing of dairy cows, and farms with positive H5N1 tests weren’t required to report them — a move that hamstrung scientists’ efforts to track and prevent the spread. It took a month for the agency to at least require testing before cows crossed state lines, and there’s no proactive effort to test large numbers of farm workers. The response is in line with the USDA’s deferential relationship to industry and explains in part how we got here. The USDA has resisted calls to vaccinate poultry birds because it would disrupt trade agreements, and thus the industry’s bottom line. The USDA also helped build the modern factory farming system, which provides the perfect conditions for viruses to spread: hundreds to thousands of weak, genetically identical animals packed together in unsanitary barns. A young turkey on a farm in Israel is sprayed with firefighting foam to kill the flock during a 2016 bird flu outbreak in the country. Roee Shpernik/Glass Walls/We Animals Media“We should treat potential pandemic threats like this virus with the same seriousness that we apply to our national defense,” said Meade, the Mount Sinai researcher. If we don’t, we’ll have a harder time breaking out of the bird flu doom loop. Without a vigorous response to contain the virus — and sober reflections on the pandemic risk posed by America’s meat industry — we’re likely to see more and more farmed birds dying horrible deaths, more sickened cows, higher food prices, and an increased threat that we spark the next pandemic.

By Caleb Hensin | chensin@pioneerpress.comUPDATED: July 28, 2024 at 2:03 PM CSTDue to concerns over the avian influenza virus, the Minnesota State Fair announced new policies on Friday for cows currently producing milk.With the State Fair less than a month away, State Fair officials said that while Open Class, 4-H and FFA dairy cattle shows will still be held as scheduled, new guidelines from the Minnesota Board of Animal Health will require all lactating cows brought to the State Fair to be tested for the H5N1 virus within seven days.Other livestock shows will continue as usual.At the CHS Miracle of Birth Center, there will be no live dairy calf births, but dairy calves, a non-lactating dairy cow and beef cow/calf pairs will be on display.Other animals such as sheep, pigs and poultry will still have live births, and representatives from the FFA, University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine and Minnesota Veterinary Medical Association will still be on hand to educate visitors.The Cattle Barn and Moo Booth milking parlor will still be open to visitors at its regularly scheduled time. Only lactating cows with negative H5N1 tests will be in the barn; the Moo Booth is enclosed, and visitors watch the milking process through glass windows. Hand-milking demonstrations will take place with a fiberglass cow.No changes are planned for the poultry exhibits, but the statement said that State Fair officials are taking precautions “to minimize contact between dairy cattle and poultry at the fair.”The Minnesota State Fair update can be found at mnstatefair.org/updates. H5N1 in MinnesotaIn early June, H5N1, also known as avian influenza type A, was detected in dairy cattle in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Health. Originally found in wild birds and domestic poultry in 2022, H5N1 has been detected in more than 200 mammals in 2024 as well as a small number of dairy workers who had been in contact with sick cattle.Lucas Sjostrom, a dairy farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, said that avian influenza was not something dairy farmers had to worry about much before.“We’ve had to learn a lot in the last seven months,” Sjostrom said.One thing he did learn, he said, is that all milk and mammary glands are a vector for the spread of any type of influenza, including avian influenza. However, according to Sjostrom, there isn’t much known about what sort of exposure leads to the spread of H5N1 — whether it be as direct as ingesting raw milk, fumes or touch. Sjostrom noted that it is specifically raw, unpasteurized milk that can carry the virus. The pasteurization process “obliterates” viruses and infections, Sjostrom said.The main reason the disease took so long to detect, Sjostrom said, is because symptoms tend to be much more mild in cattle than they do in birds. Particularly for poultry like chicken and turkey, it can be deadly. Sjostrom said that the symptoms in cattle like cows tends to look similar to their equivalent of a “tummy ache,” and awareness of it being H5N1 only began to spread when dairy farmers noticed multiple herds of cattle all getting sick at the same time.The danger of H5N1, Carol Cardona of the University of Minnesota’s Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences says, is this recent leap from avians to cattle. Those types of animals often share an ecosystem, which implies that the virus has mutated to be able to “leap” from avians to mammals like cattle, which are much closer to humans on the evolutionary tree.The impact is smaller when it’s a handful of dairy farmers that work with animals regularly, but chance for infection increases when there is a large number of human interaction with the animals at an event like the State Fair.According to health officials, dairy farmers who were infected in Michigan and Texas experienced “mild illness, including red or water eyes (conjunctivitis) or cough.”The State Fair will be held in Falcon Heights from Aug. 22 through Labor Day, Sept 2.Related Articles Local News | Man charged in Labor Day shooting that injured 3 teens leaving MN State Fair Local News | Ice Castles moving to the State Fairgrounds this year Local News | With attendance topping 1.9 million, this year’s State Fair was busiest since pre-pandemic Local News | 3 teens shot, wounded near Fairgrounds after leaving Minnesota State Fair Local News | Grandstand review: Kidz Bop concert had kids singing along to Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo hits Originally Published: July 26, 2024 at 8:44 PM CSTShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Submit to Stumbleupon (Opens in new window) Most PopularMost PopularConcert review: Billie Eilish stuns sold-out Xcel Energy Center with her confidence and strengthConcert review: Billie Eilish stuns sold-out Xcel Energy Center with her confidence and strengthAfrican authorities cite wife’s extramarital affair in slaying of Minnesota missionaryAfrican authorities cite wife's extramarital affair in slaying of Minnesota missionaryFive takeaways from the Vikings’ 12-7 win over the JaguarsFive takeaways from the Vikings' 12-7 win over the JaguarsMary Stauffer recalls 1980 kidnapping in Roseville, being held with her 8-year-old daughter for 53 daysMary Stauffer recalls 1980 kidnapping in Roseville, being held with her 8-year-old daughter for 53 daysObituary: Jay Alberio, longtime Woodbury police detective, devoted his retirement to finding Jodi HuisentruitObituary: Jay Alberio, longtime Woodbury police detective, devoted his retirement to finding Jodi HuisentruitMan shot by St. Paul police was wanted for killing his pregnant wifeMan shot by St. Paul police was wanted for killing his pregnant wifeVikings overcome Sam Darnold’s mistakes in ugly win over JaguarsVikings overcome Sam Darnold's mistakes in ugly win over JaguarsCharley Walters: Sam Darnold likely out of Vikings’ price range for next seasonCharley Walters: Sam Darnold likely out of Vikings' price range for next seasonJoe Soucheray: If you want to be the dad, Tim, tighten your beltJoe Soucheray: If you want to be the dad, Tim, tighten your beltDentists are pulling ‘healthy’ and treatable teeth to profit from implants, experts warnDentists are pulling ‘healthy’ and treatable teeth to profit from implants, experts warn Trending Nationally NY State Parks employee dies while fighting forest fire‘We are very scared’: Fear grips migrant families on both sides of the border over Trump deportationsFormer Republican Rep.

On July 24, four experts joined a National Press Foundation online briefing to tackle questions about the “summer wave” of COVID, how influenza comes into the mix, and what it means for vaccine updates, protocols and more. COVID is a “two-humped camel,” says Dr. William Schaffner, spokesperson for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. That means “COVID doesn’t entirely disappear. It has a summer increase in addition to what we see in the fall and the winter.” Despite vaccines not providing immunity from the disease itself, “both influenza vaccine and COVID vaccines protect best against the most serious complications,” he said. The four panelists explored the science and public health messaging related to COVID and the flu, providing the context and insights that can fuel better coverage. Watch the video here: While it’s known that there are seasonal patterns to certain viruses, it’s unclear why, said Dr. Ariangela Kozik, an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at the University of Michigan. “There is some evidence that it has something to do with the environmental conditions… But as far as why influenza has a certain pattern and COVID has another pattern, I don’t think we know exactly why that is yet.” But she said the public needs to know that even though early on there was a lot of comparative language between COVID being like influenza or it’s like the flu, that’s not the case “as far as the biology is concerned,” she said. Kozik said that explaining how vaccination is a solution to a particular problem — the problem being the infectious agent that is changing over time — is a way to help people understand why it’s important to continue to get vaccinated. The emergence of the so-called “FLiRT” variants is another important theme for journalists to explore. According to Yale University researchers, The FLiRT strains are subvariants of Omicron, and together they accounted for the majority of COVID cases in the U.S. at the beginning of July. One of them, KP.3, was responsible for 36.9% of COVID infections in the United States, KP.2 made up 24.4%, and KP.1.1 accounted for 9.2% of cases. Dr. Schaffner explained that as these viruses spread, they encounter the immune system and adapt. “And so that, if anything, stimulates further mutation and we’re getting a succession of these variants. You can think of them as children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Omicrons. So far, knock wood, we have not seen a new dominant, more serious variant evolve anywhere in the world in recent months. Very, very good. Not one that is more serious and that can evade the protection that we have currently provided ourselves through vaccines and previous experience.” New York Times science and global health reporter Apoorva Mandavilli has reported on COVID since the beginning of the pandemic. She said the challenge is that people like to think in binaries. There will always be people think that the vaccine completely prevents long COVID despite her writing about “the vaccination lowering the risk of long COVID.” “People are notoriously bad at figuring out what personal risk is for anything. And so I try not to use too many numbers because the second you start using numbers, some people’s brains literally shut down… And so I try to explain more that you can really protect yourself in this way if you can get the vaccine, but you should still just try to avoid the virus also by protecting yourself in other ways.” While Mandavilli continues to report on the “summer wave,” she recently wrote the article Thousands Believe Covid Vaccines Harmed Them. Is Anyone Listening?, which focused on vaccine side effects. “That is not a story I’ve seen media really cover, and I think people have stayed very far from it. And I understand partly why. It’s really hard to do because what you don’t want is to fuel anti-vax messaging.” “But I would encourage my fellow journalists to actually go there and to just do a very nuanced take on the topic, but to address the very real concerns that people have, whether it’s about the fact that they don’t want it or they don’t need it or they’re worried about it or whatever it is…. you have to meet people where they are.” Whether it’s the flu or COVID, Dr. Bertha Hidalgo, an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology at UAB said that she frequently gets asked about when people should get vaccines. Public health departments are a good place to start, as well as journalists and the news. And Hidalgo urges journalists to remind the public that using masks is still a very important tool against infection. “I would say that as far back as when my youngest son was diagnosed with influenza at the age of seven, we were sent home with a mask from urgent care so that while the oral antiviral medicine took effect, we would all wear masks in the home. And this was before COVID. So I think there is a precedent for mask wearing when infected, but also for prevention.” Access the full transcript here.

It reports that eight farms have confirmed infections in the state of Victoria, two in New South Wales, and one in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT; around Canberra). All of these premises have been depopulated, and the sites are undergoing decontamination processes.Over the past two months, three different variants of HPAI virus have been isolated in the nation’s poultry. The first outbreak in the nation’s commercial poultry was confirmed in mid-May, according to the official report to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). It was the first detection of the H7N3 HPAI virus serotype in the state of Victoria. Within a few days, poultry at another location in the same state tested positive for the H7N9 virus. It represented the first ever detection of this variant in an Australian poultry flock although it was similar to viruses isolated from the country’s wild birds. Then in mid-June, a flock of free-range laying hens in New South Wales tested positive for the H7N8 serotype. This variant had not been detected in Australia before. Since those first reports, one more farm in Victoria has been hit by the H7N3 virus, according to WOAH notifications. Presence of this variant was confirmed on June 23 in a flock of more than 42,000 free-range laying hens in Lethbridge — near to premises with previously confirmed outbreaks.Linked to the H7N8 virus variant have been two further outbreaks at around the same time. These impacted a flock of around 87,000 free-range broiler chickens in New South Wales — in the same district of Hawkesbury as the earlier outbreak in the state. On June 24, a flock of around 170,000 laying hens tested positive for the same virus. However, this housed flock was at Belconnen in ACT — more than 200km away from the other outbreaks in this series. Subsequently, the Australian veterinary authority has reported to WOAH a fourth outbreak in this HPAI series covering H7N8 infections in commercial poultry.Starting on July 8, this affected a small flock in Hawkesbury, New South Wales. While it comprised just 11 birds, the agency categorized it as a commercial premises because the owner sells eggs to the public.Meanwhile, a separate disease series has been initiated with WOAH to cover outbreaks linked to the H7N8 HPAI virus in non-commercial poultry flocks.According to the relevant WOAH notification, the virus is genetically related to the one of this strain affecting commercial poultry, as well as to cases in Australian wild birds. As of June 30, birds in this category have tested positive for this virus at four locations — all near to the commercial outbreaks. Three of these were in the Hawkesbury district of New South Wales, and one in Belconnen in ACT. Affected so far have been a total of 13 birds in flocks, each comprising between one and five individuals.Recent emergence of HPAI in Australia’s pet chickens has prompted some to call for the compulsory registration of hobby birds. Currently, this is only a requirement in the Northern Territories, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. However, officials in other states say that encouraging registration would help support biosecurity education and traceability.H5N1 returns to regions of Bhutan, CambodiaFollowing a five-month hiatus, this HPAI virus serotype was detected again in the south Cambodian province of Takeo in the first week of July. According to the notification from the national animal health authority to WOAH, affected was a flock of 1,168 birds of a village flock. More than 470 of the poultry died, and the rest have been culled and their carcasses destroyed. Between late January and early February of this year, the same virus variant was detected in three other village flocks in Cambodia, and officially registered with WOAH. These outbreaks were widely dispersed across the country, affecting one village in each of Prey Veng, Siem Reap, and Kratie — provinces in the south, northwest and northeast of Cambodia, respectively. In April of 2023, the veterinary agency in the Kingdom of Bhutan declared an end to a series of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in the southwestern district of Samtse.However, the virus was detected again in this southern district earlier this month, according to a recent WOAH notification. This outbreak appears to be close to the border with India.Affected was a flock of around 4,000 village birds, more than one thousand of which died. Source of the infection is unknown. Latest on HPAI situation elsewhere in AsiaAt the end of June, the H5N1 HPAI virus was detected at two poultry farms in Taiwan.Affected were a total of more than 53,000 meat chickens at two linked premises in the same township in Yunlin county, according to the official notification to WOAH. The farms were under the same ownership, and authorities were alerted when mortality jumped suddenly as feed intake and egg production dropped. The virus was reported as belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, and of fully Eurasian origin.Authorities in Taiwan had recently closed an earlier HPAI disease series linked to a virus of the same origin and type. Between November of 2023 and June of this year, reports to WOAH linked it to 40 farm outbreaks involving a total of around 539,000 poultry in the territory. In the Philippines, there appears to be an easing in the number of new HPAI outbreaks in poultry. The disease situation is now on-going in just one province and region — Pampanga in Central Luzon. There are active outbreaks linked to the H5N1 HPAI virus at three farms in two municipalities in this area, according to the Department of Agriculture (DA) Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI).Despite the localized nature of the ongoing outbreaks, an increase in the country’s poultry meat imports so far this year has been partly attributed to the impacts of HPAI. The disease — combined with the effects of El Nino — reduced poultry production, reported the official Philippine News Agency.Just last week, the same source reported that the DA and BAI are warning people in the Philippines against purchasing bird flu vaccines through online platforms or other unregulated channels. As well as being illegal, these products pose a risk to the health of both people and poultry, said a senior DA official.To WOAH, Russia’s veterinary agency has declared the H5N1 HPAI situation “resolved” in one region of its Far Eastern federal district. The declaration followed a single outbreak at a large commercial poultry farm in the Sakhalin region, which started in early February. Three new human influenza cases in AsiaOver the past month, the World Health Organization has been informed about three new human infections with avian influenza A virus in the Western Pacific region.Two of these were detected in children in Takeo province in Cambodia. Early in July, a three-year-old boy was admitted to hospital, and subsequently tested positive for influenza A(H5N1). Through contact tracing, a five-year-old girl was traced. Although she had no symptoms, she also tested positive for the virus, and isolated and treated in hospital. In mid-June, a patient in Guizhou province in China developed influenza-like symptoms. Since testing positive for influenza A(H9N2) virus, the 31-year-old woman tested positive, and has recovered.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) before the animals are transported to a different state following the discovery of the virus in samples of pasteurized milk taken by the Food and Drug Administration. (Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Well-fitting masks or respirators can help stop the spread of a highly contagious strain of bird flu, according to new guidelines New Mexico animal health officials published as fair season kicks off. On Monday, three agencies published a three-page guidance document, and sent it to extension offices and fair organizers across New Mexico. In a statement attached to the guidance, the agencies said they’re “monitoring” Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in the state and “would like to help ensure a safe fair season.” A full list of 2024 county fair dates in New Mexico can be found here. The guidelines recommend fair organizers isolate sick animals away from the public, and hand out and use personal protective equipment when caring for sick animals, including disposable gloves, coveralls, boot covers, and eye protection. Tim Uyeki, chief medical officer for the CDC’s Influenza Division, said last month to avoid getting infected by a cow with bird flu, the recommendation is to wear a well-fitting N95 respirator, along with eye goggles or a face shield and gloves. The version of the New Mexico guidance published on Monday did not mention masks, even though it linked to the relevant CDC guidance recommending them. When asked about this omission on Wednesday via email, New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck responded with an updated version of the document, which she said was changed “to help with clarity.” In its list of recommended personal protective equipment for dealing with sick animals, the new version of the document replaces “etc.” with “well-fitting masks covering mouth and nose and/or respirator if available.” The document makes organizers responsible for deciding whether to postpone or cancel shows, sales or events, “except in the event of quarantine, health order, or movement restrictions.” If organizers do host events, the document states, the New Mexico State Veterinarian “recommends” they put the precautions in place “to minimize the transmission of HPAI.” It does not require them. For the general public going into a fair, the risk of catching bird flu is “relatively low,” said Tom Dean, head of the Eastern District for the Cooperative Extension Service at New Mexico State University and co-director of the Southwest Border Food Protection and Emergency Preparedness Center. The center helped write the guidelines, along with the New Mexico Livestock Board and the New Mexico Department of Health. “If I’m a person going to the fair, in order to minimize the risk of avian influenza, I’m going to walk through the barns, I’m not going to pet animals, I’m not going to try to feed animals,” Dean said. If someone does pet an animal, they should thoroughly wash their hands, and they should be “in pretty good shape,” he said. “We want to keep it from getting to that stage, where it’s easily mutated and traveling from animal to human,” Dean said. Researchers have found evidence that the H5N1 variant of HPAI is capable of jumping not only from birds to other species but also between different species of mammals, according to a peer-reviewed study published Thursday in Nature. “The spillover of HPAI H5N1 into dairy cattle and evidence for efficient and sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission are unprecedented,” the researchers wrote. “This efficient transmission is concerning as it can lead to the adaptation of the virus, potentially enhancing its infectivity and transmissibility in other species, including humans.”NM Biosecurity Fair Recommendatons 2024.V02 updated 7-24 The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday added two dairy herds in neighboring Colorado to the list of those confirmed to be infected with H5N1. Two workers in Colorado who are culling poultry tested positive for the virus, state officials said on Monday. Eight dairy herds in New Mexico have so far been confirmed to have positive cases among cattle, according to the USDA. No new case detections have been reported since April 17, said Jennifer Green, interim public information officer at the New Mexico Department of Agriculture. Fair season in New Mexico started this month and runs through October. The document states “the status and/or situation can change anytime, and updates to the guidelines may need to be made and followed accordingly to help reduce spread.” Holeck said she has been speaking regularly with extension agents and county fair organizers, including at least one veterinarian, about options for each county based on the risk in their area. “The situation has been rather fluid the last few months, which has posed a unique challenge in creating set guidelines, but we are doing our best to keep people up to date as we move forward,” she said.

Subscribe Not nowSign in Researchers at Oregon Health & Science University say a new study suggests that a different kind of vaccine could eliminate the need for annual flu shots while helping protect against other strains of the virus, including bird flu.The study looked only at the effects of the experimental vaccine on a small number of monkeys, and human trials to prove safety and effectiveness are years away at best. But, the researchers say, the new study indicates the potential to have a vaccine that is effective even as the flu virus mutates. The results show that a “one-and-done” shot is realistic and could be achieved within a decade, according to Jonah Sacha, chief of the Division of Pathobiology at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center and senior author on the study. The study was published Friday in the journal Nature Communications.Researchers in the study inoculated 11 macaque monkeys at the University of Pittsburgh with a vaccine formulated on the version of the influenza virus that circulated in 1918. The monkeys were then exposed to the H5N1 bird flu virus that is currently circulating among dairy cows across the United States. Six of the inoculated monkeys survived. However, another group of six monkeys who were not vaccinated all died after being exposed to the same strain of bird flu. The new study comes as public health scientists closely watch the H5N1 bird flu virus that has jumped to dairy cows and some people, with some warning that its progression could signal a new pandemic. “The world remains at risk of another influenza pandemic,” the study’s authors wrote. “The four influenza pandemics of the past 100 years killed tens of millions of people, yet a universal influenza vaccine capable of protecting against future pandemic influenza viruses still does not exist.”Already the common flu can be deadly, especially for the elderly and very young. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 72,000 people died from the flu and up to another 830,000 were hospitalized from the virus during the most recent flu season in the U.S. In 2022 in Oregon, 370 people died of influenza or of pneumonia, which can stem from the flu. Another 1,000 people were hospitalized with the flu in the Portland area during the 2022-2023 flu season, according to the state. “That got my mind turning. Maybe we should find a different way to vaccinate against influenza." Jonah Sacha, chief of the Division of Pathobiology at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center A new vaccine approachSacha told The Lund Report that his interest in improving the vaccine was sparked by his then 4-year-old son being so sickened by H1N1 swine flu in 2014 that he required hospitalization. His family had been vaccinated against the flu, but it didn’t protect them against the strain of the virus he picked up while traveling to a conference in Australia, he said. “That got my mind turning,” Sacha said. “Maybe we should find a different way to vaccinate against influenza. Because these current vaccines that we use, they change every year and they’re clearly kind of a guess based on what (flu) is going to come out.” Currently, annual flu shots are formulated in a manner intended to anticipate how the virus will evolve and trigger antibodies to fight it. Their effectiveness varies year by year and wanes as the virus changes. Image SHUTTERSTOCK A senior receives a flu shot. That’s because traditional vaccines are keyed toward proteins on the exterior of the virus, which continuously evolve and mutate.So for years, researchers at a variety of institutions have pursued what’s called a “universal” flu vaccine, one that could combat even newer variants of the virus over a person’s lifetime with a single inoculation.The OHSU researchers are working on a version that harnesses the cytomegalovirus, a common herpes virus related to Chickenpox that usually results in mild or no symptoms, but is long-lasting. The cytomegalovirus provokes an immune response from the body’s T cells, which target the virus’ internal proteins, rather than the rapidly evolving ones on its exterior.That’s why researchers were excited by the study’s indication of effectiveness for a vaccine based on a 1918 version of the flu, even if the test involved monkeys, not humans. In the university’s statement, Sacha said the vaccine worked because the virus’ interior protein has been well preserved “even after almost 100 years of evolution.”Although just six of the 11 inoculated monkeys survived, Sacha said the trial was successful considering that the monkeys were given a vaccine geared toward a 100-year-old flu strain and then exposed to H5N1, which he called “one of the most pathogenic viruses” known.“We as humans would never take those odds for a vaccine, but against a virus that’s this wicked, it’s pretty good,” he said. “It’s a start. We have to do better if we are ever going to go forward.”Sacha said future trials will use a version of the vaccine optimized for more current flu strains. The vaccine would then go to clinical trials on humans, which he said could be done fairly quickly because there are testing sites that use healthy volunteers. Sacha said an earlier experimental HIV vaccine developed by OHSU researchers laid the groundwork for the technology used in the flu vaccine. “We as humans would never take those odds for a vaccine, but against a virus that’s this wicked, it’s pretty good. It’s a start. We have to do better if we are ever going to go forward.” Jonah Sacha, chief of the Division of Pathobiology at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center OHSU, researchers are part-owners of technologyResearchers at OHSU have been working on the same vaccine technology for more than a decade, starting with efforts to combat HIV. In 2016, the university sold the technology to Vir Biotechnology, Inc., a San Francisco startup that’s publicly traded. OHSU remains a part-owner of Vir, and several of the researchers who participated in the recent study also have holdings in Vir, according to the study’s conflict-of-interest disclosure. Sacha said he does not own Vir Stock and is not affiliated with the company, but did do consulting for it years ago. Starting more than a decade ago OHSU researchers have reported similarly promising findings about its potential HIV vaccine based on the same technology. But human trials did not begin until last year. The human trials are necessary to show both safety and effectiveness, as the cytomegalovirus is considered to be species-specific.OHSU researchers believe the same technology shows promise for fighting cancer as well.You can reach Jake Thomas at [email protected] or via Twitter @jthomasreports Comments Log in or register to post comments More like this Oregonians brace for health care changes as second Trump term nears Premium Nov 7 Respiratory virus season looms, officials warn Premium Sep 19 Largest Oregon measles outbreak in 30 years endangers kids, expert says Sep 10 County health and social services contracts need better oversight, auditors say Premium Jun 27 Newsletter Sign up for our health news updates.Sign Up Get Involved NEWS TIPSSecurely submit an anonymous news tip or confidential document.DONATESupport our journalism by making a tax-deductible gift.

A Federal Order was issued on April 24, 2024, to mitigate the spread of the virus.As of now, the influenza virus has not been detected in livestock within Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the USDA and the Arkansas Department of Health, remains vigilant in monitoring this potential threat.Arkansas fairs and exhibitions provide a valuable opportunity for the youth of our state to showcase their animals. However, these events also pose a risk for the spread of illnesses among animals. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Livestock and Poultry Division, in collaboration with other state and federal agencies, encourages adherence to USDA requirements and recommendations to minimize the risk of influenza transmission. The full list of Recommendations to Minimize Influenza Transmission at Dairy Cattle Livestock Exhibitions can be found through the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.The list includes:Intrastate Movement•Testing:Prior to intrastate movement, lactating dairy cattle are recommended to receive a negative test for Influenza A virus at an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory using a NAHLN approved assay.•Documentation:The intrastate movement of all lactating dairy cattle must be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI).Interstate Movement•Testing:Prior to interstate movement, lactating dairy cattle are required to receive a negative test for Influenza A virus at an approved NAHLN laboratory using a NAHLN approved assay. •Documentation:The interstate movement of all lactating dairy cattle must be accompanied by a CVI.•Exhibition Requirements: Animals moving by interstate to an exhibition, show, or sale must have a negative test result from samples collected within seven days of movement. These animals may return to their home herd using the same negative test result, provided the event does not exceed 10 days.•Permitting:All dairy cattle entering Arkansas from states affected by HPAI in dairy cattle will require a permit from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture.Disposal of Milk•Negative HPAI Test: Lactating dairy cattle that have a negative HPAI test will be able to dispose of milk following state, federal laws, and rules, and regulations.•No HPAI Test:Lactating dairy cattle that do not have a negative HPAI test should follow the USDA recommendations for milk disposal.Additional Precautions•Equipment and Tools: Equipment and tools should not be shared between exhibitors.•Isolation Area:Each exhibition should prepare an isolation area for animals that develop symptoms.By following these requirements and recommendations, we can help protect our livestock industry and maintain the health and safety of animals at our events.

To read future updates, you can also subscribe to STAT’s Morning Rounds newsletter. Public health experts who’ve been following the surprising spillover of H5N1 bird flu into America’s dairy cattle herds now have all eyes on Colorado, waiting to see if a cluster of human cases there might balloon into something bigger.advertisement On July 14, Colorado officials announced that five workers involved in the culling of 1.8 million chickens at a large H5N1-infected egg farm in Weld County had tested positive for the virus. And the strain infecting the workers appears to be closely related to the virus infecting cows in Colorado and at least 12 other states. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a sixth case among the Colorado poultry workers. Almost 70 individuals involved in the “depopulation” operation were tested for H5N1 after showing symptoms of the disease, according to a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment. On Saturday, the state announced it had found a possible seventh human case; the CDC, which must conduct confirmatory testing, is expected to receive the sample on Tuesday. The six Colorado cases were all mild, with some experiencing the more traditional flu signs of fever and cough, and others having conjunctivitis, a symptom that’s been seen with some of the dairy workers who’ve been infected during the outbreak. But it’s the first time multiple human cases have been reported on a single farm in the U.S., raising questions about whether the virus has changed or the environmental factors presented unique opportunities for it to spread.advertisement A recent study led by noted flu virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison found evidence that the virus now circulating inside cows has acquired some ability to bind to receptors found in the upper respiratory tracts of humans, though other labs have produced conflicting data. The concern with a large cluster of human cases is the increased potential for those people to pass on the virus to others, particularly immunocompromised individuals.

Privacy Policy But Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said without more data, it’s too soon to say what the risk is with the situation in Colorado. “If we get 7, or even 70 more cases of conjunctivitis, what does that mean? Could this be a precursor to a respiratory infection, to influenza being transmitted people to people? No one knows.” He pointed to the situation in Michigan earlier this summer, where 54 farmworkers who had been exposed to infected cows and experienced some flu-like symptoms were tested by state public health officials. Only two of those individuals tested positive for H5N1. Results from a serological study of farmworkers in Michigan released by the CDC Friday provide additional reassurance that asymptomatic human infections are not going undetected. None of the blood samples collected from people who had been exposed to infected dairy cows on two farms but showed no symptoms were found to contain H5N1 antibodies, meaning they had not been infected. Further back in time was an outbreak of a different strain of avian influenza that struck commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands in February of 2003. Nearly 500 farmworkers registered health complaints, and while some complained of flu-like symptoms, and one veterinarian died, the majority experienced only conjunctivitis. Eighty-nine of those people tested positive for the bird flu virus, and all the cases were linked to direct contact with poultry. But the outbreak never spread more widely; by the next year it had largely burned out. “Clearly we’re vulnerable to H5N1 when it’s floating in the air,” Osterholm said. “Our bare eyeballs are a perfect landing spot for it. But there’s a big difference between that and the virus taking hold in the human respiratory tract.” During a news briefing Tuesday, federal officials said Weld County workers faced challenging conditions inside the poultry facilities. Temperatures that exceeded 104 degrees and high-powered fans made it difficult to wear the protective equipment, including full-body suits and N95 masks, meant to protect them from the virus, particularly if it becomes aerosolized. “The workers were finding it hard to maintain a good seal or a good fit, either between the mask or with eye protection,” said Nirav Shah, the CDC principal deputy director. “This confluence of factors may play a role in explaining why this outbreak occurred, where it did, and when it did.” Initial genetic analyses have indicated that the virus sickening the poultry workers is related to the version that’s spreading among cows, but it’s still unclear which dairy farm it came from. The state is in the early stages of conducting an investigation to understand those linkages, and has requested additional epidemiology support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The CDC on Friday said genetic sequencing of the virus infecting one of the poultry workers showed it was closely related to the first Michigan case and does not have changes associated with antiviral resistance. Weld County, just northeast of Denver, is home to 350,000 people and the largest concentration of dairies in the state. So it’s no surprise it’s been especially hard-hit by H5N1, Colorado State Veterinarian Maggie Baldwin told STAT in an interview last week. “Geography is a really big factor,” she said. “The fact that most of our dairies in Colorado are in the same region is going to lead to more transmission of this virus.” Colorado has been dealing with H5N1 on its poultry farms since early 2022, but until this summer, those outbreaks were sporadic and linked to wild birds. “What we have now is sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission of H5N1 in dairy cows, which is leading to a potential source of continued spillovers into our poultry operations,” Baldwin said. “So this is even riskier than what we have been seeing for the last two and a half years.” Since its first reported case of bird flu in dairy cattle in late April, Colorado has registered 41 additional H5N1-positive herds, with six in the past week alone. That means infections have been reported in 40% of Colorado’s herds. It now leads the nation, making up nearly a quarter of the 163 livestock outbreaks in the USDA’s official tally. Correction: An earlier version of this story had an incorrect number of people who tested positive for bird flu during the 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands.

Here's how to tell if you have one — and how to treat it.Rebecca Corey·ReporterUpdated July 25, 2024 at 1:16 AM·5 min read80Link CopiedRespiratory illnesses can strike even in the summer. (Getty Images)Just as you’re getting ready to hit the beach or embark on that long-awaited vacation, you may be blindsided by those telltale achy, sneezy symptoms. But it’s summer — can you really get sick?Unfortunately, yes. Experts say that while it’s true that respiratory viruses survive better in low temperatures and low humidity, colds, influenza and COVID-19 don’t just disappear when the days get longer and the weather warms up.“There's a whole group of viruses called enteroviruses that very commonly cause summer colds that many people mistake for allergies,” Dr. Jim Conway, medical director of the University of Wisconsin Health Immunization Programs, tells Yahoo Life.What’s behind summer colds and flu?Experts say there are several reasons why summer can actually enhance the spread of respiratory viruses.People are traveling. The Transportation Security Administration has anticipated that this year will be its busiest summer travel season ever. That means millions of people are packing into close quarters on airplanes and other public transportation with little ventilation and minimal masking.It’s cold and flu season in the Southern Hemisphere. “A lot of people may be traveling to the Southern Hemisphere: Australia, New Zealand, South America, South Africa,” Dr. David Weber, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, tells Yahoo Life. “And keep in mind it's their winter, when flu and RSV are peaking. So you're certainly at risk for picking up one of those viruses if you're traveling in that locale, and you can certainly bring it back and potentially transmit it to people here.”Heat drives people indoors. Extreme heat can drive people to congregate inside for the comforts of air conditioning. But those indoor conditions — with poor ventilation and chillier temperatures — replicate the same environment that enables respiratory viruses to spread so easily in the winter.Immunity from vaccines has waned. While the annual flu shot that’s available each fall can offer some protection, Conway says that by the time April rolls around, the strain of influenza that those shots protect against has likely changed — “so that immunity doesn't quite hold up as well, and you start to see these little outbreaks that happen even in people that have been vaccinated,” he says. In fact, the rapidly-changing nature of SARS-CoV-2 could be one reason we keep seeing summer peaks of COVID-19. “The major factor driving COVID is not the weather and the humidity and the temperature," Weber says, "but the evolution of new variants.”Is it a cold, the flu, COVID or allergies?A summer cold or flu feels pretty similar to what you’d experience during the fall or winter. Here’s a refresher on how to differentiate them from one another.Cold: Dr. Aashish Didwania, professor of medicine at Northwestern University, tells Yahoo Life that cold symptoms usually develop gradually. “Classic” cold symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and mild cough. “Fever can happen, but it tends to be less common. And muscle aches and fatigue can happen, but they're typically mild,” Didwania says.Flu: Influenza can also involve nasal symptoms and sore throat or cough; but unlike a cold, Didwania says flu symptoms will usually come on abruptly. “If I wake up one day and I've got a wicked headache, I feel like a truck ran over me, I'm spiking a fever, that's more likely flu than a cold,” he says.COVID: Some symptoms that set COVID apart include loss of taste or smell and nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Jennifer Walsh, an assistant professor at the George Washington University School of Nursing, tells Yahoo Life that both influenza and COVID tend to affect the whole body, with “significant fevers, body aches and headaches.” But she also cautions that a mild case of COVID or flu can appear similar to a common cold. “It can be a little tricky to parse out,” she says, so the safest way to be sure is to take a COVID test.Seasonal allergies: “Itchy eyes are a lot more common with allergies, and not with a cold and not with flu,” Didwania says. While you may experience some sneezing, runny nose and congestion, you shouldn’t encounter a fever or muscle aches. And while you’re at it, be on the lookout for “air con flu”; mold and dust spores in dirty air conditioning units can cause respiratory problems, including allergy and asthma symptoms.What should you do if you get sick this summer?Experts say that recuperating from a summer respiratory virus is similar to recovery from a cold or flu during any other time of year. In addition to staying home and resting, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with headaches or body aches; nasal saline sprays can help with upper respiratory congestion; and antivirals such as Paxlovid and Tamiflu, if used right away, can make a huge difference if you’re diagnosed with COVID-19 or the flu.Experts also say you should still get your annual influenza shot this fall, even if you get the flu this summer. “There are lots and lots of different flu strains that are out there, so by no means should people think that if they get the flu now during the summer that they're good to go" for autumn and winter, Conway says. Each year the flu shot is repurposed to protect against several of the strains expected to be most prevalent that flu season, so getting a shot every fall gives you the best chance at staying protected.

The first two both involved commercial table egg layers, with those flocks involving 1,313,800 and 1,790,800 birds. All three flock infections occurred in July.The state’s only other commercial poultry flock to be affected by HPAI in 2024 was a commercial broiler breeder flock in Delta County.

The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic killed an estimated 675,000 Americans and 40-60 million globally.It’s not a question of if we will have another pandemic, but when. Will it be a virus yet unknown or a new stain of COVID or influenza? No one knows.Avian influenza (bird flu) has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus. Periodically it proliferates in wild migratory birds. Currently, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) is pandemic in bird populations. Concern increases when bird flu infects domesticated poultry populations like chickens, turkeys and ducks. When the virus mutates and jumps to pigs or cows, apprehension rises since the virus has adapted to mammals. With further mutations, the virus could infect another mammal − humans.Rarely, individual human infection occurs with prolonged close contact with infected poultry or other animals. That’s where the transmission almost always ends. The virus is not “human-like” enough to support further human transmission.Pigs are especially adept at being infected by various animal flu types. Suppose a pig is infected with a bird and human flu virus simultaneously. The two viruses could mix their genomes when replicating to produce a new more human-like virus supporting unsustained human-to-human spread.Alternatively, a human could be infected simultaneously with a bird and human virus giving a similar result. With progressive mutations, the virus could advance to sustained human-to-human spread. Human clusters of infection without close animal exposures signal a terrifying situation. People would have little or no preexisting immune protection to this novel virus. The 1918 Spanish flu included avian components.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, A(H5N1) is widely infecting poultry and has jumped to dairy cattle, largely asymptomatically. The first herd infected from migratory birds was in December 2023 in Texas. Now, at least 151 U.S. herds of dairy cattle (the virus adapted to bovine mammary glands) in 13 states are infected, and infections could potentially spread worldwide.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the virus has infected eight individuals in the U.S. with prolonged close exposure to dairy cattle or farm poultry.The virus is widespread in milk and other dairy products. The Federal Food and Drug Administration reports no viable virus found in pasteurized milk and deems the pasteurized milk supply as safe. However, unpasteurized milk is legal for sale in 30 states.The eight human cases are probably just the tip of the iceberg. Although the risk to humans remains low, we were caught unprepared for COVID-19, and vigilance is warranted for avian flu. There should be intensified surveillance and testing of poultry, dairy cattle, and pigs. The USDA requires testing of dairy cattle transported over state lines, but testing is voluntary on the state level. That’s a problem. Herd Isolation and quarantine measures should be implemented.Continued testing of the milk supply, wastewater and especially at-risk individuals is important. We need to further vaccine development and offer vaccination to frontline farm-related workers if things progress.Local health departments must have standardized protocols and financial support for adequate infrastructure to address an avian flu pandemic. Farmers must receive informational resources about bird flu and be financially supported for preventative and unforeseen costs. Warnings should be issued regarding unpasteurized milk-product consumption.Influenza is an unpredictable virus. Monitoring for worrisome genetic changes is essential.If a pandemic occurs, let’s not let this one get away from us.Dr. Richard Feldman is an Indianapolis family physician and the former Indiana state health commissioner.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Avian influenza viruses have infected the world’s birds for millennia. We first became aware of them in the 19th century, when mass deaths of poultry triggered interest in what was then called “fowl plague”. But in 2021, something fundamental changed. As the world grappled with COVID lockdowns and economic chaos, the birds of the world were encountering a new strain, known formally as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 2.3.4.4.b. It spread easily and was capable of causing disease and death in a far wider number of bird species than previously seen before. So far, it has triggered the culling of half a billion farmed birds and killed millions of wild birds. (This is a different strain to the HPAI H7 strains which have infected poultry farms in Australia). If this new strain gets to Australia, carried on a migratory wild bird, it could pose similar risks to our unique wildlife. But we haven’t been sitting still. Australian researchers, governments, veterinarians and wildlife rehabilitators have been urgently preparing for its arrival. Why is this strain so bad? This strain has now made it to every part of the world bar Australia, New Zealand and Pacific nations. The virus killed many birds in the northern hemisphere before crossing to the Americas. In South America it proved particularly lethal, infecting and killing massive numbers of birds and marine mammals such as sea lions. Many strains of bird flu are “low pathogenicity”, meaning they tend not to cause severe disease. But these strains can evolve into highly pathogenic strains if they spill over from wild birds into poultry, as we’re seeing with the current outbreaks in poultry farms in Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT. Prior to 2024, Australia had experienced eight previous outbreaks of H7 HPAI in poultry, all of which were eradicated by culling poultry and isolating farms. Until now, bird flu has been dealt with by culling poultry. But the new HPAI H5N1 strain may not be stopped by this. AAP This new H5N1 2.3.4.4.b strain is much more worrying for our wildlife, because it transmits very easily between wild birds. It has proven it can kill mammals, including marine mammals, predators and scavenger species that eat birds. It also poses a real threat to our poultry industries. If H5N1 2.3.4.4b were to enter Australia, we could see more outbreaks in domestic poultry, which in turn could affect the supply of chicken and eggs – both very popular sources of animal protein in Australia. Given the virus is present worldwide, including in Antarctica, you might wonder why it hasn’t made it to Australia yet. Avian influenza travels most easily in waterfowl such as ducks. Australia’s waterfowl are not migratory and only travel short distances between Australia and countries to the north. But Australia is on the path of several flyways from Asia, along which millions of shorebirds migrate every year in spring. Some seabirds also migrate from the Atlantic. When this strain of bird flu hit South America in 2022, birds such as pelicans died off in droves. Paulo Aguilar/EPA How are we preparing? The devastation the virus has caused overseas has given Australia time to prepare. We can’t stop wild birds from migrating here. But we can slow the spread and protect at-risk wildlife from other threats such as invasive predators, giving them the best chance to survive the virus if it arrives. Around Australia and on our sub-Antarctic islands, a network of veterinarians, researchers, government officials, rangers and wildlife rehabilitators is on alert looking for sick birds with signs, such as respiratory illness. Shorebirds such as the common sandpiper migrate long distances, offering a potential avenue for the virus. selim kaya photography/Shutterstock If a bird showing these signs is spotted, they will call the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline (1800 675 888). Members of the public are also encouraged to report sightings. Other plans for the virus include: restricting human movements in and out of virus-affected areas, where appropriate surveillance to see how the virus is moving with wildlife triage and clinical responses to the virus, including euthanasia for dying birds. We have created information toolboxes to help wildlife managers and carers to manage risk and reduce transmission if the virus is confirmed here. These include improving baseline biosecurity, clearing away carcasses, restricting human movement to reduce spread, and euthanasing dying birds. For threatened species, we can explore the merits of vaccination trials for captive birds. New Zealand authorities are trialling this method. But such vaccination must ultimately serve the welfare interests of wildlife. There are many complexities to consider. Globally, vaccination of free-ranging wild birds has occurred for just one species – the endangered Californian condor, considered particularly at risk because of its low numbers. Black swan event? Overseas, waterfowl, shorebirds and seabirds have proven especially susceptible to the virus. Avian predators are also at risk if they eat sick birds or their carcasses. Specific data on Australian species are limited, but at least one local species, the black swan, has been found to be highly vulnerable to the virus because they lack some protective genes. The sheer variation of our ecosystems might offer some protection. We have many transient bodies of water, such as Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. If the virus arrived during a period of drought, it could have a different impact than if it arrived during flooding rains, which fill lakes and encourage movement of wild waterfowl. Because this strain is very new, we don’t know yet what the long term outcome will be. It’s possible birds which survive an infection will become immune and survive to breed. But some species and populations may not be able to survive this first assault. This threat is new territory for Australia. Many of the other animal diseases we worry about and prepare for only attack one species, such as African swine fever, or only affect non-native wildlife (such as foot and mouth disease). But this strain of bird flu has attacked over 500 bird species and is infecting a growing number of mammal species. What can you do? Keep an eye out for any sick or dead birds – and call the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline if you do.

They further document the detailed symptomatic outcomes of the resulting disease in these bovine populations. Finally, they use a multidisciplinary approach incorporating epidemiological and genomic analyses to highlight that the virus's evolution confers the ability to allow for not only cow-to-cow transmission but also efficient multidirectional interspecies spillover, infecting birds, domestic cats, and even a raccoon in proximity to diseased cattle. Study: Spillover of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to dairy cattle. Image Credit: Studio Romantic / Shutterstock Background Influenza A virus (IAV) H5Nx is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus causing widespread respiratory illness and subsequent death in bird populations across Africa, Asia, Europe, and most recently North America. First discovered in China in 1996, the colloquially termed 'bird flu' has since evolved into eight clades and three neuraminidase subtypes, with the H5N1 subtype 2.3.4.4b being its most prevalent and epidemiologically relevant representative. HPAI H5N1 is alarming, given its potential for spillover (cross-species infectivity). It has been reported to be transmitted from infected poultry populations into wild birds (2002), mammals (domesticated and wild), and even humans (2003). The World Health Organization (WHO) documented 860 human infections and more than 430 deaths since 2003 (fatality rate ~52.8%). The virus poses significant threats to ecology, economy, and public health, having claimed more than 90 million bird lives in the United States (US) alone. The most recent H5N1-associated morbidity event was that of dairy cattle across Texas (TX), New Mexico (NM), Kansas (KS), and Ohio (OH) between January and March 2024. Understanding the epidemiological and genomic underpinnings of this event may allow researchers to elucidate the etiology (origin) of the disease and prepare for future outbreaks.

Credit: CDC and NIAID About the study The present study documents the January-to-March 2024 morbidity event in American cattle across TX and its neighboring states. It uses a detailed multidisciplinary approach incorporating clinical, epidemiological, and phylogenomic investigations to elucidate the pathophysiology of the virus and the genetic underpinnings of its spillover potential. Related StoriesExclusive: Emails reveal how health departments struggle to track human cases of bird fluNew CDC report highlights disparities in flu hospitalization and vaccinationStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaResearchers first obtained samples for the clinic-epidemiological evaluation from nine farms across affected states – TX (5 farms), NM (2), KS (1), and OH (1). Notably, the singular farm in OH was affected following the introduction of cattle (assumed to be healthy) from the first affected TX farm. Data collection comprised nasal swabs, milk, blood buffy coats, and serum (n = 331). These samples were subjected to real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and viral metagenomic sequencing. Additionally, tissue from birds (great-tailed grackles, rock pigeons) and mammals (cats and raccoons) found dead at infected farms were subjected to rRT-PCR analysis. Virus-shedding investigations were conducted to elucidate the source and duration of viral transmissions following initial infections. Excised tissues from cows, dead birds, and mammals were subjected to histological examinations. Finally, phylogenomic analyses were conducted to isolate the etiological source of the viral strain and the genetic underpinnings of its substantial spillover. Study findings Clinical-epidemiological investigations revealed multiple disease symptoms in cattle, notably decreased feed intake, mild respiratory distress, reduced rumination time, lethargy, dehydration, abnormal feces, and abnormal milk production (20-100% reduction in quantity, yellow color, and thick consistency). Symptoms persisted for 5-14 days. However, milk production remained reduced for up to four weeks. All investigated rRT-PCR samples positively detected viral load, but virus shedding was the highest and most frequently detected in milk samples and mammary gland tissue. Notably, while virus shedding duration investigations detected viral loads in milk samples on days 3, 16, and 31 post-infection, infectious virus shedding was only observed on day 3. "Histological examination of tissues from affected dairy cows revealed marked changes consisting of neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic mastitis with prominent effacement of tubuloacinar gland architecture which were filled with neutrophils admixed with cellular debris in multiple lobules in the mammary gland. The most pronounced histological changes in the cat tissues consisted of mild to moderate multi-focal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with multifocal areas of parenchymal and neuronal necrosis." Phylogenomic analysis revealed that all recovered viral sequences aligned with a novel monophyletic reassorted substrain of H5N1 termed B3.13, first discovered in a Canada goose in Wyoming (25 January 2024). This lineage was most closely related to a sequence obtained from a deceased skunk in NM (23 February 2024). The similarity between viral genomes from investigated farms highlights circulation and cross-infectivity between their inhabitants, likely due to the transportation and introduction of animals between these farms. Conclusions The present study highlights the potential of H5N1 viral spillover and cross-infectivity in both avian and mammalian hosts across farms in the US. The mammary gland was highlighted as the region with the highest viral replication, with infected milk representing the most likely transmission route. The novel substrain (B3.13) identified herein is alarming given its spillover potential (to domestic and wild bird populations and even other mammals – cats, and raccoons). While no human infections were reported from under-study farms, mild infections were reported during the study duration from other farms near the study area, highlighting the virus's zoonotic potential and the potential for a human pandemic. Protective Measures According to guidelines from the CDC, it is crucial to wear the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when working directly or closely with sick or dead animals, such as animal feces, litter, raw milk, and other materials that might have the virus. The recommended PPE includes fluid-resistant coveralls, a waterproof apron, a NIOSH-approved respirator (e.g., N95), properly-fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety goggles or a face shield, head cover or hair cover, gloves, and boots. Proper procedures for putting on and removing PPE, such as washing hands before and after using PPE and disinfecting reusable PPE after every use, are essential. Additionally, it is advised to shower at the end of the work shift, leave all contaminated clothing and equipment at work, and watch for symptoms of illness for ten days after working with potentially sick animals or materials.

(Photo by AAron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post) By Meg Wingerter | mwingerter@denverpost.com | The Denver PostUPDATED: July 24, 2024 at 3:57 PM MSTColorado dairies must test their milk weekly as the state tries to stop further spillovers of the highly infectious bird flu from wiping out poultry farms.On Monday, Colorado state veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin issued an order that licensed dairies in the state must submit weekly samples of their milk to test for H5N1 influenza, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza. If a dairy’s sample comes back positive, the Colorado Department of Agriculture will order the facility to quarantine its cattle.Batch-testing milk is easier than swabbing individual cows for the bird flu virus. Research on dairy products available in grocery stores found that the virus doesn’t survive pasteurization.The order doesn’t include dairies that sell raw milk as part of a “cow share” program, because they aren’t state-regulated. Health experts have cautioned people against drinking raw milk or feeding it to their pets, because unpasteurized milk from an infected cow could spread the virus.Normally, avian influenza circulates in wild birds, which occasionally pass it on to poultry flocks. Earlier this year, the virus spilled over to dairy cattle in Texas, most likely from wild birds. From there, it spread from herd to herd across a quarter of the country.Colorado officials aren’t certain how it might have spilled back from infected cattle to chickens, though one possibility is that workers inadvertently carried it on their clothes.So far, this particular version of the virus hasn’t caused severe illness in people or shown that it can spread from human to human.In a news release Tuesday, Baldwin said the state’s previous strategy of more limited testing wasn’t working, as evidenced by two confirmed spillovers from dairies to poultry operations, and a third possible spillover. Genetic testing for subtle changes in a virus allows scientists to map whether it came from another herd or from wild birds. “We have been navigating this challenging, novel outbreak of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in dairy operations for nearly three months in Colorado and have not been able to curb the spread of disease at this point,” Baldwin said in the news release. “We have seen devastating impacts of this disease not only to our dairy industry, but our poultry industry as well. With the strong support of the dairy and poultry industries, we feel that this is the best next step in order to protect these vital industries in our state.”While cows typically recover from H5N1 without major complications, the virus is deadly to poultry. So far this month, Colorado farms affected by the spillovers have had to kill and dispose of about 3.2 million infected chickens.Six people killing infected birds on a Colorado poultry farm tested positive this month, as did one person working in a dairy. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Saturday that another poultry worker’s test appeared to be positive, though it was awaiting confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.None of the infected workers needed hospital care.Since March, the virus has spread to at least 170 dairy herds in 13 states. Colorado reported 48 herds have tested positive so far, which is the highest number in the country. States vary in their approaches to testing, however, so infections may go undetected elsewhere.Related Articles Health | U.S. health officials confirm 4 new bird flu cases in Colorado poultry workers Health | Colorado reports three more presumed human cases of bird flu after outbreak at commercial egg facility Health | Colorado dairy worker is 5th person in U.S. infected with bird flu Health | Bird flu confirmed in Colorado dairy cows as outbreak spreads In the last month, Colorado has been the epicenter for the outbreak in cows, with 30 out of 41 infected herds based here, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The threat level could change if the virus mutates to spread between humans, but so far it hasn’t shown signs of doing that.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.

This includes directly interviewing sources and analyzing primary source documents. A cow waits to be milked at a dairy near Fort Morgan on June 17, 2021. (Eric Lubbers, The Colorado Sun) The Colorado Department of Agriculture this week stepped up efforts to stop a runaway outbreak of bird flu cases on dairy farms by issuing an order requiring testing for the virus on all commercial cow dairies licensed by the state. But, separately, new information about the bird flu virus that infected a Colorado farmworker provides reassuring evidence that the virus remains a low risk to human health. The state has seen at least 51 cases of bird flu on dairy farms since April, meaning nearly half of all commercial dairies in Colorado have been affected. Of those cases, 30 have happened in the past 30 days. Colorado’s outbreak continues to surge even as others have dwindled nationwide — no other state has seen more than four cases in the past 30 days, and some major dairy-producing states like Wisconsin and California have never reported any cases. In issuing the order, state veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin said the virus, while not causing deaths of many cattle, has still been a devastating disruption to Colorado’s dairy industry — resulting in quarantines and loss of milk production. “We have been navigating this challenging, novel outbreak of HPAI in dairy operations for nearly three months in Colorado and have not been able to curb the spread of disease at this point,” Baldwin said in a statement, using a shorthand term for the virus, which is also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza. The order does not apply to farms that produce raw milk, which are not regulated by the state. Pasteurization kills the virus in milk sold in stores, but raw milk is unpasteurized, meaning there is the potential for it to contain live virus. ☀️ READ MORE Gray wolf tracked south of Interstate 70 in Colorado for the first time since reintroduction 12:26 PM MST on Nov 3, 20247:38 AM MST on Nov 4, 2024 A 20-year quest to bring back Colorado’s rarest apple that was once thought lost 4:20 AM MDT on Oct 13, 20246:34 PM MDT on Oct 13, 2024 A new solar farm is now shading Denver Botanic’s actual farm in one of the state’s biggest “agrivoltaics” experiments 4:08 AM MDT on Oct 2, 20247:39 AM MDT on Oct 2, 2024 Dive into climate and health, and where they intersect. Subscribe Dive into climate and health, and where they intersect. Subscribe Spillover cases Baldwin noted that, as the dairy outbreaks rage on, they are also generating spillover cases in other animals. Most notably, Colorado has begun seeing infections again in commercial poultry operations. There have been two major, confirmed outbreaks at egg-laying operations in Weld County, while a third, suspected outbreak is also under investigation. Those outbreaks have resulted in the culling of more than 3.2 million chickens just in July, according to the Department of Agriculture. Colorado has now seen 33 commercial poultry flocks affected since 2022, with more than 6.3 million domestic birds culled. Then there’s the human toll. One of those poultry outbreaks led to an unprecedented cluster of cases among workers who were doing the culling. Six workers were confirmed positive for bird flu, though their symptoms were relatively mild and none required hospitalization. Meanwhile, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Thursday that it has identified three new human cases of bird flu — these tied to culling operations at a different poultry farm. The workers, likewise, have mild symptoms and have been offered antiviral drugs for treatment.

Researchers say it should stop. Searching for genetic changes Including the new cases, the state has now identified 11 out of the 14 human cases nationwide since 2022, placing Colorado at the center of the nation’s bird flu epidemic. And the burst of human infections in Colorado has raised questions about whether the flu virus has mutated to make it more capable of infecting people. This image, captured through a microscope and artificially colorized, shows particles of avian influenza virus, in orange, inside cells. (Provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, via Flickr) But a new CDC analysis eases those concerns. The CDC took a virus sample from one of the Colorado poultry workers and sequenced its genome. Among the findings: The sample’s genetics are closely related to those of viruses found in animals from other recent outbreaks at poultry and dairy facilities. Among human cases, the Colorado worker’s virus is most similar to the virus that infected a dairy worker in Michigan earlier this year. The Colorado virus “maintains primarily avian genetic characteristics,” according to the CDC, meaning it isn’t especially adapted to infect people or spread person-to-person. It does, however, have one mutation that makes it better at infecting mammals. That mutation has been found in more than 99% of infections among cattle. There were no mutations found that indicate the virus is developing resistance to existing antiviral drugs. There are also no changes to the virus suggesting it is more capable of causing harm to humans. The virus is closely related to a couple bird flu samples available to vaccine manufacturers, meaning companies could start producing a bird flu vaccine quickly if needed. So, to recap: Nothing about the Colorado case suggests the bird flu virus has become better able to infect people, hurt people or spread to other people. The CDC said the analysis “supports CDC’s conclusion that the human health risk currently remains low.” No evidence of silent spread The CDC also reported some more good news last week: Blood tests of Michigan dairy workers were boring. Michigan’s public health department conducted what is known as a seroprevalence study of workers with known exposures to infected cows. The goal was to see if workers who showed no symptoms of bird flu actually had antibodies against the virus. If they did, it would suggest that they had been silently infected and that human cases might be more common than known. In this May 9, 2018 photo, Bryan Matthews prepares his cows to be hooked up to the automated milkers at his his farm in Callaway, Va. (Stephanie Klein-Davis/The Roanoke Times via AP) Instead, the results from every nonsymptomatic worker tested came back clean — no antibodies against bird flu. “This is an important finding,” the CDC wrote in a weekly update, “because it suggests that asymptomatic infections in people are not occurring.” That means the risk remains primarily to farmworkers who have direct contact with infected animals. And that puts the focus on efforts to provide information to farms and to ensure workers have access to — and are able to wear — protective equipment. “Ongoing cooperation is key to supporting workers’ health and safety, protecting animal health and welfare, and minimizing the spread of the virus,” Kate Greenberg, Colorado’s commissioner of agriculture, said in a statement.

On July 16, HPAI was confirmed in a flock of 1,313,800 commercial table egg layers. This brings the total number of bird losses in the county to more than 3.4 million in the last 30 days.Weld County has had six commercial poultry flocks struck by HPAI in 2024, but the county’s only cases in 2023 involved backyard poultry.Before July, Colorado had not seen a commercial case of HPAI in 2024 since February, which involved a flock of 66,500 broiler breeders in Delta County. Weld County has had human cases of H5N1 as wellOn July 20, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) reported that six poultry workers involved with the layer flocks affected by HPAI tested positive for the H5N1 virus.Previously, the CDPHE and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported four confirmed human cases of H5N1 and one presumed-positive case. CDPHE stated that the employees had mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis of the eye and common respiratory infection symptoms. None of the workers were hospitalized.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY CDC reveals new data on bird flu in Michigan farmworkers as US case count ticks upKristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption Right now people can't easily infect each other with bird fluThe CDC says there's no evidence humans can easily infect each other with bird flu, and the risk to the general public remains low right now.Scripps NewsWhether it spread from sick cows or sick poultry to people, the type of H5N1 avian flu virus that infected a commercial poultry worker in Colorado earlier this month is very similar to the virus that sickened a Michigan dairy farmworker in May, according to new genetic sequencing test results released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.And that's good news, said CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen, who visited Michigan this week to talk with local and state health leaders about efforts to better understand how the virus is spreading to humans, whether it is mutating to become more dangerous or causing asymptomatic infections."We are taking the cases of avian flu that we are seeing very seriously, but I want folks to know the overall risk right now to the population is low," Cohen told the Free Press during a Tuesday morning visit to an immunization clinic at the DMC Children's Hospital of Michigan Specialty Center in Detroit. "That's because we've never seen a human-to-human transmission of that virus. But we also learned very much through COVID that these viruses like to change. So our work is now to make sure we're giving that virus less opportunity to change and potentially then become something that can transmit humans to human.""We are doing two things: One, we want less virus to be circulating so that it has less chance to change. The other is get ready, be prepared. We want to make sure we have tests that are available, treatments that are available and vaccines that are available."Since April, 11 poultry and dairy cattle workers in Texas, Michigan and Colorado have been sickened following exposure to infected animals.Genetic sequencing tests suggest the subtype of the virus in a Colorado poultry worker is B3.13 clade 2.3.4.4b and hasn't mutated enough to easily spread from person to person, evade antiviral treatments, or cause more severe disease."The findings are reassuring, showing it is closely related to the first human case discovered in Michigan and that it does not have changes associated with antiviral resistance," the CDC wrote in an online update. "The full sequence was uploaded to a public database so that researchers in the U.S. and around the world can analyze it."Has the risk to people from H5N1 bird flu risen?Not yet."There are no changes to the virus that would suggest the risk to human health has increased," the CDC reported. "Overall, the genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N1) virus in Colorado supports CDC's conclusion that the human health risk currently remains low."So far, all 11 people with known cases of H5N1 influenza A in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, and/or upper respiratory symptoms.But that hasn't always been the case with this elusive virus; other H5N1 subtypes that have spread globally since the late 1990s have had mortality rates that topped 50%, the CDC reported.More: How Michigan became ground zero for H5 avian influenza in the USMore: Michigan’s top agricultural leader cautiously optimistic about bird flu in stateWhat else is known about the virus in Michigan?To get a better idea of whether there is asymptomatic spread of the bird flu virus among Michigan dairy farmworkers, the state Department of Health and Human Services led a seroprevalence study in June that tested blood samples of 35 people who worked directly with cows sickened by H5N1 infections.Many of the workers did not wear the recommended personal protective equipment such as N95 respirator masks or goggles around the animals, and had different jobs on farms across multiple Michigan counties. Most worked directly with the sick cows, the health department said.The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services analyzed the blood samples, looking for antibodies, which are produced when people develop an immune response to a virus, suggesting they have been infected even if they didn't feel sick or had had only mild symptoms.The CDC published preliminary results of that study July 19, finding:None of the 35 workers whose blood samples were analyzed developed neutralizing antibodies to the H5N1 avian influenza A virus, which suggests none of them had previous infections with the virus currently circulating in the U.S.Many of the farmworkers' blood samples showed neutralizing antibodies to seasonal flu viruses, which suggests they previously were vaccinated or infected with seasonal flu. It also means their bodies most likely could muster an immune response to seasonal flu viruses.The seroprevalence tests are important, the CDC said, "because it suggests that asymptomatic infections in people are not occurring and provides support to the current testing approach — i.e., collecting samples from symptomatic people who have been exposed to sick animals."What is the CDC doing to make sure it's ready if the H5N1 virus changes?Cohen said the nation is in "a very different place" than it was at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when scientists had to scramble to develop tests, vaccines and treatments."We have tests for avian flu that are specific," Cohen said. "We have them in all of our public health labs, and by the end of the year, we're working to have them in our commercial labs as well. We already have a treatment that is available — Tamiflu or oseltamivir. We have it not only in our pharmacies, but in our stockpiles as well."And then on vaccines, we have vaccine candidates. We learned from COVID that you want to match that vaccine with the exact ... type of virus that we see circulating. So we have candidates and we have the ability to scale up rapidly. So that's what we're focused on."We do have vaccine that is matched to the current strain, but we're seeing mild disease right now. ... What we are thinking about is if the virus were to change and get the ability to spread human to human, that would be when we'd scale up production. That is waiting in the wings."What is the scope of the H5N1 virus spread in Michigan and the U.S.?The H5N1 bird flu virus has been spreading for two years among wild birds and domestic poultry — forcing poultry farmers and egg producers in Michigan and across the country to cull millions of birds.The virus adapted to infect mammals and leapt to cows in late 2023, with high levels of viral particles identified in the milk and udders of sick livestock. Since then, the virus has been identified in cattle on 26 dairy farms in 10 Michigan counties: Allegan, Barry, Calhoun, Clinton, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Montcalm and Ottawa counties, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The disease also has been detected in dairy herds in 12 other states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Four U.S. dairy farmworkers have contracted bird flu after working closely with infected cows; two worked on Michigan farms, the CDC reported. The other confirmed U.S. human cases of bird flu this year have occurred among workers at two separate commercial egg-laying operations in Colorado, where the employees were culling infected chickens.Who is at highest risk for bird flu infection?Workers on dairy cattle and poultry farms, at commercial egg-laying operations, slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants, as well as people who have close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected animals or their environments are at greater risk of H5N1 infection.The CDC recommends:Avoiding unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, dairy cattle and other animals, as well as with their feces or other materials that could be infected with H5N1 viral particles.Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) if direct or close contact with sick or dead animals, feces, or other materials potentially contaminated with H5N1 viral particles can't be avoided. That PPE should include safety goggles, disposable gloves, boots or boot covers, a particulate respirator such as an N95 filtering facepiece respirator that has been fit-tested, disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, and disposable head cover or hair cover.Anyone exposed to H5N1-infected birds or other animals should monitor themselves for new respiratory illness symptoms, including pink eye, beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure.If anyone who had close contact with infected animals develops symptoms, state and federal health leaders recommend seeking medical care for evaluation, testing and treatment. If you are symptomatic, you should isolate from others until infection is ruled out (except to seek medical care).Are eggs, beef, dairy products and chicken safe to eat?Yes, so long as you fully cook your eggs, chicken and beef and consume only pasteurized dairy products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says.Although the FDA detected fragments of the H5N1 virus in the commercial pasteurized milk supply, the particles are not capable of replicating or causing disease.Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Today we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer. Andrea, welcome back.Garcia: Thanks, Todd. Good to see you and great to be here.Unger: Well, earlier this week, there was a health alert from the CDC about a supply shortage. Tell us more about what's going on and why it warranted this high of an alert.Garcia: Yeah, Todd, there was that health advisory that was issued this past Tuesday. And it's about a critical shortage of Becton Dickinson or BD BACTEC blood culture media bottles. And to provide some context, most blood cultures in this country are performed using what's known as continuous monitoring blood culture systems.These systems can operate unattended by a lab worker, and then an alert will sound when a foreign microorganism is detected in a blood culture. And as physicians know, blood cultures are used to assist in the diagnosis of bloodstream infections and related conditions so sepsis or endocarditis. And they can help identify the type of bacteria or other microorganism causing an infection.And that helps physicians treat patients with appropriate antibiotics. According to the CDC, that BD BACTEC continuous monitoring blood culture system is used in about half of us laboratories. And it's only compatible with its own blood culture media bottles. So this blood bottle shortage is no small issue.Unger: Well, given that kind of amount of use, do we have any idea just how broadly this is going to affect patient care?Garcia: Well, the CDC Alert did say that this shortage has the potential to significantly disrupt patient care by leading to delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, or making the management of patients with infectious diseases more difficult. It may also lead to missed infections that need treatment. And there was a CNN article that pointed out some studies have found that bloodstream infections have been more common in the U.S. in recent years, so this could further compound that issue.While blood cultures are needed in a variety of health care settings, experts say that hospitals are going to be most acutely impacted by this shortage because the tests are often needed to respond quickly to serious conditions. On a recent call related to this shortage, one hospital system reported receiving a shipment of 10 bottles for its 1,700-bed health system.And the medical director said it faced the very real possibility that they were going to run out entirely. So, it's definitely already affecting patient care.Unger: Well, Andrea, that sounds pretty serious. What are physicians and hospitals being asked to do in response to the shortage?Garcia: Well, in the case of hospital systems, like we were just discussing, they cut the volume of blood cultures by more than half with a few key mitigation strategies. That includes scaling their initial testing back to one culture instead of two, and then waiting 48 hours to retest. It's not ideal, but strategies like these can help ensure patients who need it can at least receive one culture.The idea has been floated to use blood culture bottles that are past their expiration date. However, FDA has not yet weighed in on that. The CDC Alert outlined some specific steps physicians and others can take to help mitigate the impact.For one, the agency is asking that physicians and anyone else impacted by this shortage develop plans immediately to manage the situation. And these plans should include good stewardship of bottles. And we need to optimize their current supply to minimize those effects on patient care.Unger: Well, tell us a little bit more about that. What should be included in plans like these?Garcia: Well, those plans, the keys there are really ensuring that no bottles go to waste, that we're reducing unnecessary testing, and if needed, prioritizing blood cultures for those patients highest at risk. There's should be a renewed focus on best practices for blood collection.So think about routine disinfection of skin prior to taking blood. That can help minimize the risk of contamination of the blood culture. And then ensuring proper blood volume collection, that can help eliminate the need to collect additional samples. It's also important to use safe blood collection and transfer devices to minimize the risk of damage to blood culture media bottles.The shortage may stretch until September. And health care professionals are really being encouraged to report any supply chain challenges or suspected adverse events that they experienced because of this shortage to device shortages at fda.hhs.gov.Unger: All right. Well, thank you so much for that update, Andrea. It's certainly a situation we'll continue to monitor. Andrea, now we're going to turn to two topics that we've talked about a lot over the most recent few weeks—extreme heat and bird flu. Now, one seems to be affecting the other. Can you talk more about that?Garcia: Well, first, we should note that The Washington Post reported that global temperatures have hit the highest levels ever recorded this past week, or at least since the last Ice Age more than 100,000 years ago. And that sort of comes on the heels of 13 straight months of unprecedented temperatures. And according to The Washington Post article, the hottest year scientists have ever seen. Environment & public health Explore education from Natural Resources Defense Council about the effect of environmental changes on public health and learn how to help do your part. Learn on AMA Ed Hub™ Now, in terms of how this is connected to HPAI or the bird flu outbreak, according to The Colorado Sun, extreme heat may have contributed to those human bird flu infections in poultry workers. There was a poultry farm. And it was reported that the heat actually made it very difficult for poultry workers who were handling infected chickens to wear PPE. Six of those individuals have tested positive.This cluster of six cases is the largest outbreak of human cases in the U.S. from the current strain. It's the only time in this country that more than one person has been confirmed to be infected from a single incident. And thankfully, those workers experienced relatively minor illness—conjunctivitis, mild flu-like symptoms like fever and cough.They were offered Tamiflu. They were asked to isolate. None required hospital treatment. But Colorado does seem to be the epicenter of this outbreak right now.Unger: Now, Andrea, I know the concern here is the potential for human-to-human transmission. Have we learned anything about that?Garcia: Well, genetic sequencing of the virus collected from the poultry workers closely resembles what is circulating in dairy herds. And that is suggesting that the cattle have introduced the virus into the poultry flock. As you noted, the bigger concern with a cluster of human cases is that increased potential for those people to pass the virus on to others. We particularly worry about those who are immunocompromised.By most accounts, the virus working its way through dairy cattle is still fundamentally well suited to infect birds, not people. And to be clear, there's no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, which is why CDC is still saying that the risk to the general public is low.There has been some reporting both by STAT and NPR on a recent study by a team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which found evidence that the virus may have acquired some ability to bind to receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans, though other labs have produced conflicting data around that question.Unger: So Andrea, what should we take away from all of this?Garcia: Well, I think in the Madison study, you have to keep in mind that these researchers artificially generated these receptors. Attach them to a piece of plastic, and then added the virus to see if it would stick. This was done in a lab. The results need to be interpreted with caution. At the same time, some scientists have indicated that the virus is more infectious in mammals than previous avian viruses.In that same stat article. Michael Osterholm, who is an infectious disease expert who has appeared on AMA Update, said that without more data, it is too soon to say what the risk is with the situation in Colorado and more broadly. He said if we get seven or even 70 more cases of conjunctivitis, what does that mean?Could this be a precursor to a respiratory infection to influenza being transmitted people-to-people? No one really knows. Continued surveillance is important. We need to understand the routes of transmission, so we can stop the virus from evolving and adapting to better infect humans.Unger: All right. Well, again, thank you for that update. We're going to end the AMA Update today with a bit of good news—some groundbreaking advancement in HIV prevention. Andrea, tell us the news there.Garcia: Well, Todd, this is exciting news. And it was a new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine. And it showed that twice yearly injections of lenacapavir, which is sold as Sunlenca, offered 100% protection against HIV.Now, the study looked at a group of about 5,000 young women and girls in South Africa and Uganda. No infections were identified in the group that was given the injections. There was another group that was given daily prevention pills. And roughly 2% of them ended up acquiring HIV in the study period.There was a director of an AIDS Research Center in Durban, South Africa, who was not part of the research, but said to see this level of protection is stunning. Because of these results, the study was actually stopped early. And all the participants were offered the injections.This injectable prescription medication is made by Gilead. It's sold as Sunlenca. And right now, it is approved in the U.S., Canada, and Europe and elsewhere, but it's only as a treatment for HIV. The company is waiting for results of clinical trials in men before they're going to seek approval to use the product as prep to protect against infection. This really does seem to be a game-changer given the gaps we see in uptake of adherence with currently available prep options, so definitely good news.Unger: Indeed. That's great news and a great way to finish off the week.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on July 25, 2024 Close Photo: USDA -- A poultry farm in the United States By Lindsey Toomer The Colorado Department of Agriculture will now require regular testing of dairy milk as the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — continues to spread throughout the state. Commercial cow dairy farms licensed by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that are not already under a bird flu-related quarantine will undergo weekly testing of bulk samples. This will include facilities with dairy cattle used to produce milk, butter, pasteurized and other cheeses, frozen desserts, ice cream, dry milk, condensed milk and cottage cheese, among other products for human consumption. The state issued the mandate on Monday. “We have been navigating this challenging, novel outbreak of (bird flu) in dairy operations for nearly three months in Colorado and have not been able to curb the spread of disease at this point,” Dr. Maggie Baldwin, the Colorado state veterinarian, said in a statement. “We have seen devastating impacts of this disease not only to our dairy industry, but our poultry industry as well. With the strong support of the dairy and poultry industries, we feel that this is the best next step in order to protect these vital industries in our state.” In the last 30 days, 30 cattle herds in Colorado have been affected by the virus, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 39 flocks in Colorado have had a bird flu outbreak, including both poultry and non-poultry. Eight people in Colorado have contracted the virus, the most of any other state in the country. Seven of those people work on poultry farms, while one works on a dairy farm. More Northeastern Colorado Poultry Workers Infected With Bird Flu Under the mandate, samples collected from farms will be tested at the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and any farm whose dairy produces a non-negative test result for H5N1 will be placed under quarantine. The order mandating testing does not have a set expiration date, so state agricultural leaders or the state veterinarian must issue another order to cease testing. Any farms that fail to comply with the requirements of the order will be referred to the Colorado attorney general’s office. “We appreciate the ongoing cooperation and partnership with both the poultry and dairy industries,” Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture Kate Greenberg said in a statement. “Mandatory surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza across all of Colorado’s Grade A commercial dairies is a critical next step to tamping down the virus and protecting the food system. Ongoing cooperation is key to supporting workers’ health and safety, protecting animal health and welfare, and minimizing the spread of the virus.” CDPHE says it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, as the proper handling and cooking of meat and eggs kills viruses. The risk of bird flu to the general public is low and there has not been evidence of the virus spreading from person to person.

The world urgently needs to prepare.Ayoade AlakijaSpecial Envoy for the Access to COVID19 Tools AcceleratorPublished On 21 Jul 202421 Jul 2024The United States has registered 10 cases of bird flu since April 2024 [File: Reuters/Dado Ruvic]In mid-July, the US state of Colorado reported six cases of avian flu – or H5N1 – in samples taken from poultry workers. This brought the national total to 10 cases confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since April 2024. The United States government has upped zoonotic/animal testing, and is now discovering more cases of infection with the virus in cows and other mammals. So far, it has reported H5N1 in more than 160 herds of cows. The growing number of cases comes amid growing concern about the spread of the virus, with a recent study published in the journal Nature suggesting that the H5N1 found in cows may be more adaptable to humans. In response to this situation, the US government recently awarded a $176m project to Moderna to support clinical trials for an mRNA vaccine against the virus. Other countries are also becoming alert about these developments, with Finland launching a vaccination drive aimed at safeguarding the most at-risk communities from the disease. The increasingly frequent reports of new cases have caused some experts to suggest that another pandemic situation may be on the horizon. While that is by far not a certainty, we should still be prepared for it. Yet the world’s readiness to respond to such health threats still appears fragmented and inequitable. It should be worrying to us all that we still do not have adequate tools for early detection and containment. What we know so far is that H5N1 is a fast-moving, rapidly evolving virus that can cause severe illness and death. However, the lack of diagnostic testing and genetic sequencing for humans and animals obscures our understanding of how the virus is mutating and if there are any potential mutations that may increase the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. The lack of focus on surveillance and investment in diagnostics is irresponsible. It is crucial to avoid repeating mistakes from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when dealing with H5N1, where the risks could be even greater due to its high mortality rate. Over the past 20 years, fatal outcomes have been reported in about 50 percent of known cases. It is likely that infections have been under-reported and under-diagnosed due to limited testing capacity and so the mortality rate may be lower. Furthermore, this rate would not necessarily be replicated if the virus established itself in the human population. Still, there is a risk that a H5N1 pandemic may be significantly different from the COVID-19 one – and deadlier. The bad news is that at present, there are currently no commercially available diagnostic tests to detect H5N1 specifically. Nucleic acid-based (molecular) tests are the current gold standard for the detection of influenza viruses, but they generally require lab infrastructure to support their use. And even when such infrastructure is available, it may not function fast enough. For example, when a sick Australian girl was tested for bird flu in March, it took several weeks to get the positive result back. As seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid tests that can provide a result in around 10-15 minutes are a critical tool for outbreak containment – even if they are less sensitive than molecular tests. Investing in research and development that leads to quick, affordable tests for H5N1 influenza can lay the foundation for preparedness. Tests should be made available worldwide – including in low- and middle-income countries – and prioritised in populations where there is a likelihood of human exposure to the virus, like farms or veterinary clinics. Scaling up the monitoring of bird and animal populations, training personnel effectively, streamlining reporting mechanisms and utilising cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence for speedy analysis should all be priorities for governments. There also need to be incentives to encourage at-risk populations, currently those working with animals that are potentially sick, to test. Effective ongoing collaboration on developing and sharing treatments and vaccines is equally essential. Partnerships, like the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator – which includes health leaders from the World Health Organization; the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – should be used to encourage governments and pharmaceutical groups to ensure the production of at-scale health countermeasures and that they are available to all countries. This is not charity, it is investing in global public health to ensure we are all protected. No country can stop a pandemic by itself. More than a million lives may have been lost during COVID-19 because of inequity. We need to make sure this does not happen again. There needs to be a focus on helping low- and middle-income countries gain access to all the countermeasures needed to tackle the next pandemic. Action is needed now, while human-to-human transmission has still not been detected, so that if and when it is, a rapid coordinated global response to H5N1 can be deployed. The new cases in Colorado do not suggest the world is about to end, but are a signal worth heeding. While the US and other Western countries are able to take measures, poorer countries that do not have the resources or access to technology cannot. This unequal situation not only threatens national health security but also hinders the world’s ability to prevent an H5N1 pandemic if it is to emerge. Global leaders must acknowledge the interconnectedness of health systems and commit to distributing resources fairly. If H5N1 starts spreading from human to human and we are not prepared for it, we will pay an unimaginable heavy price in terms of human lives and livelihoods.

Colorado News 10 human avian flu cases confirmed among Colorado’s poultry, dairy workers by: Heather Willard Posted: Jul 25, 2024 / 04:47 PM MDT Updated: Jul 25, 2024 / 05:33 PM MDT CDC this is the largest outbreak of human bird flu infections in US history by: Heather Willard Posted: Jul 25, 2024 / 04:47 PM MDT Updated: Jul 25, 2024 / 05:33 PM MDT SHARE DENVER (KDVR) — There are now 10 human cases of avian flu in Colorado, according to state health officials, making it the largest outbreak of human bird flu infections in U.S. history. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there have been 11 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans since the first was reported in 2022, and 10 of them were this year. If Yellowstone’s volcanic system erupted, how could it impact Colorado? There are now two poultry farms in Weld County with birds infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported Thursday. There are three confirmed cases at the second farm and six confirmed cases at the first farm. Another human case was found in a dairy farm worker, also in Colorado. Gov. Jared Polis issued a disaster emergency declaration on July 5 for the H5N1 avian flu outbreak in Weld County, when only one farm reported infections. H5N1 is a virus that has spread among mammals since 2020 and was detected in U.S. livestock earlier this year. State and federal health officials have said the virus is not a concern for the general public, as there’s been no evidence of person-to-person transmission. If contracted in humans, common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, eye redness or pink eye, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches and headaches. Mike Weber watches an employee clean a hen house at his egg farm in Petaluma, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. His company Sunrise Farms had to euthanize 550,000 chickens after avian flu was detected among the flock. A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of outbreaks that that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest. Legislators raise worker concerns amid Colorado’s bird flu outbreak U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who represents Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, publicized a letter Thursday to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking what the department is planning to help mitigate the H5N1 outbreak. The letter was signed by Caraveo and U.S. Reps. Brittany Pettersen, Joe Neguse, Diana DeGette and Jason Crow. The letter also noted that there have been a lot of obstacles for workers who have tested positive for H5N1. For one, workers at a poultry farm in Weld County who were tasked with culling the flock after it became infected were working in extreme temperatures in Colorado. The region set several records for high temperatures, and the level of personal protective equipment needed for culling is higher than for regular work: full-body suits, N95 respirators and goggles. Boulder County family warns others after their cat tests positive for tularemia At the same time, to help with the heat, large-scale industrial fans were circulating feathers in the barns, which also can spread the virus. The letter noted that there are H5N1 vaccines. Since May, the CDC has only tested about 118 people, according to CDPHE, and is not offering the vaccine to at-risk populations like farm workers. “We need to do everything possible to prevent further HPAI infections and potential hospitalizations among our farmworkers and other high-risk populations,” the delegation members wrote. “These efforts are crucial to developing an efficient, coordinated response and reducing the onset and spread of HPAI across the country.” Cow dairies under bird flu surveillance On Tuesday, the Colorado Department of Agriculture announced the implementation of mandatory statewide surveillance for all CDPHE-licensed commercial cow dairies. “We have been navigating this challenging, novel outbreak of HPAI in dairy operations for nearly three months in Colorado and have not been able to curb the spread of disease at this point,” Dr. Maggie Baldwin, Colorado state veterinarian, said in the department’s announcement. “We have seen devastating impacts of this disease not only to our dairy industry, but our poultry industry as well. With the strong support of the dairy and poultry industries, we feel that this is the best next step in order to protect these vital industries in our state.” West Nile confirmed in Boulder County mosquitoes The Department of Agriculture also noted that there have been two “spillover” events from dairy cows with the H5N1 strain into commercial poultry facilities, resulting in the depopulation of over 3.2 million chickens in July. In the approximately two years between April 2022 and March 2024, the state reported 33 flocks with the virus, which resulted in depopulation of over 6.3 million domestic poultry. CDPHE recommends that anyone interacting with poultry, fowl or livestock should take precautions, including wearing the recommended personal protective equipment, washing your hands after contact with birds or animals, dressing game birds in the field when possible and observing livestock and poultry for any signs of illness. As the number of cases continues to grow, the state plans to publish a data table for human cases across the state. The state health department said in a Thursday release that the table will include the number of presumptive positive human cases, confirmed human cases, the approximate number of people tested, and a link to the Colorado Department of Agriculture which shares the number of impacted dairy and poultry farms.

By FERN's Ag Insider FERN's Ag Insider The Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN) is the first independent, non-profit news organization that produces in-depth and investigative journalism in the critically under-reported areas of food, agriculture, and environmental health. Through partnerships with local and national mainstream media outlets, FERN seeks to tell stories that will inspire, inform, and have lasting impact. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on July 22, 2024 Close Photo: Getty Images An additional worker became infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus while culling sick hens at a Colorado egg farm, say state public health officials, raising the U.S. total of infected workers to 11, all with mild symptoms. Eight of the cases, seven involving poultry and one involving dairy, have occurred in Colorado. The Centers for Disease Control says the risk to the general public from the disease is low. It recommends using protective equipment, such as goggles, masks, and gloves, by people in contact with infected or possibly infected animals. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said six workers, one more than reported earlier, contracted bird flu while killing and disposing of H5N1-infected hens on a poultry farm in Weld County, northeast of Boulder. “The workers … had mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis [pink eye] and common respiratory infection symptoms. None were hospitalized,” the agency said. Chicken Culling, Disposal Raise Concern as Bird Flu Spreads In addition, a Colorado dairy farmworker contracted bird flu in early July; and in 2022 a correctional inmate participating in a pre-release program was infected with the virus. Since April, three other dairy farmworkers, in Michigan and Texas, have been diagnosed with bird flu. Some 100.4 million birds in domestic flocks, mostly egg-laying hens and turkeys being raised for meat, have died of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) since the disease appeared in the United States in February 2022, says a USDA database. That’s twice as many as in an HPAI outbreak in 2014–15 that was described as the greatest animal disease event in U.S. history. Since late March, the virus has been confirmed in 163 dairy herds in 13 states from Idaho to Michigan. Colorado has the most, 42 herds, followed by 30 in Idaho, and 26 in Michigan.

SIGNS LIKE THIS ONE ARE JUST ONE OF THE MANY STEPS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IS TAKING TO MAKE SURE THAT AVIAN FLU DOES NOT IMPACT THE STATE ANY FURTHER. WE’RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THIS VERY CLOSELY, DOCTOR GREG MARTIN WITH THE PENN STATE AG EXTENSION KNOWS HOW DEVASTATING AVIAN FLU CAN BE. THE STATE LOST MORE THAN 4 MILLION BIRDS SINCE THE OUTBREAK IN 2022, BUT NOW THERE’S A NEW THREAT. AVIAN FLU IS SPREADING TO CATTLE. IT’S ALREADY BEEN FOUND IN 12 STATES, INCLUDING NEIGHBORING OHIO. SO WE IN PENNSYLVANIA CANNOT JUST SIT BACK AND SAY, OKAY, WE’VE WE DODGED A BULLET. WE NEED TO STILL MAINTAIN GOOD HIGH LEVELS OF BIOSECURITY. MARTIN SAYS SIGNS LIKE THIS WILL BE POSTED AT BOTH POULTRY AND DAIRY FARMS AROUND THE STATE, AS A REMINDER TO STICK WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. PENNSYLVANIA IS ALSO MANDATING THAT ALL CATTLE COMING HERE GET TESTED FOR THE VIRUS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE JUST USE ALL PRECAUTIONS THAT WE CAN TO HELP REMOVE THE THREAT. MARTIN SAYS THAT WHEN A COW IS INFECTED BY THE AVIAN FLU, IT’S MILK IMMEDIATELY GETS SICK. KIND OF LIKE YOGURT. NOW THAT MILK IS THROWN AWAY AND YOUR MILK SUPPLY IS SAFE, MARTIN SAYS. HE ADDS THAT THE MILK YOU BUY AT A STORE HAS BEEN PASTEURIZED. THAT WAY, NO MATTER WHAT THE BACTERIA AND THE VIRUSES ARE ALL KILLED.

Updated: 8:02 AM EDT Jul 22, 2024 Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences says they are are testing the university's dairy herd for avian influenza out of "an abundance of caution."Video above: Pennsylvania agriculture leaders on alert as avian flu spreads through cattle farms. The announcement comes as an outbreak of bird flu has affected dairy cattle in more than a dozen states since March, a statement from the college said.The testing will done through a voluntary state testing program, which is aimed at getting data on the status of dairy herds in Pennsylvania and detecting bird flu as quickly as possible."The state herd monitoring program calls for conducting a weekly test of milk from a farm for three weeks," Penn State Extension veterinarian Ernest Hovingh said in a statement. "If all tests are negative and no clinical signs of the disease are observed, the herd is considered 'unaffected.' At that point, weekly testing would continue, to ensure that the herd remains free of the virus."For herds that are not part of the testing program, those animals do have to be tested before crossing state lines. "Because Penn State does not move dairy cows across state lines, our herd has not been subjected to testing so far," Hovingh said. "But participating in this program will allow us to determine if our herd is in fact HPAI-free, as strongly expected, and also will provide additional data to inform state and national surveillance efforts."The college says the chances of a positive test are remote, but if it happens, Penn State and state officials will "immediately investigate further."The test results will be released after a series of three weekly tests have been completed.

The research, “Spillover of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Virus to Dairy Cattle,” published in Nature, reveals a mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus—between cows and from cows to cats and a raccoon. Researchers used whole genome sequencing of characterized viral strains to gather information. “This is one of the first times that we are seeing evidence of efficient and sustained mammalian-to-mammalian transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1,” says Diego Diel, DVM, MS, PhD, associate professor of virology and director of the Virology Laboratory at the university’s Animal Health Diagnostic Center, and a co-corresponding author of the study. Researchers have identified cases of cow-to-cow transmission when infected cows from Texas were relocated to a farm in Ohio. The study also revealed the virus had spread to cats, a raccoon, and wild birds found dead on the affected farms. It is believed the cats and raccoon became ill after consuming raw milk from infected cows. While the exact route of infection for the wild birds remains unknown, research shows it may have been due to environmental contamination or aerosols generated during milking or cleaning processes. “The concern is that potential mutations could arise that could lead adaptation to mammals, spillover into humans, and potential efficient transmission in humans in the future,” Dr. Diel says, adding efficiency of human infection is currently low. In a statement released by the university, Diel highlights the importance of continued monitoring of the virus in animals and humans, as well as early testing, enhanced biosecurity, and quarantines to contain the virus’s spread.

Save & AcceptAustralia hit by bird flu outbreak of highly pathogenic strain - Chinadaily.com.cn Global Edition China Edition ASIA 中文 双语 Français Global Edition HOME OPINION VIDEO WORLD TECH CHINA BUSINESS CULTURE TRAVEL SPORTS HOME OPINION VIDEO WORLD CHINA TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS CULTURE TRAVEL SPORTS SERVICE NEWSPAPER China Daily PDF China Daily E-paper Subscribe Home | Asia Pacific Australia hit by bird flu outbreak of highly pathogenic strain By KARL WILSON in Sydney | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-07-26 15:22 FILE PHOTO: A person holds a test tube labelled "Bird Flu", in this picture illustration, January 14, 2023. [Photo/Agencies] With eggs in short supply and avian influenza spreading across Australian farms, the outbreak has the country on edge. Since May, several poultry farms in the states of Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory have been hit with avian influenza, or bird flu. These outbreaks have been devastating for the affected poultry farms, leading to large-scale culls, and caused knock-on effects for the country's egg supplies. "The bird flu situation in Australia is increasingly alarming, particularly due to the threat posed by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain, which has not yet reached the continent," said associate professor Dr Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist with the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences at Monash University's campus in Malaysia. Professor Adrian Esterman, head of Biostatistics and Epidemiology with the University of South Australia, said the current worldwide H5N1 outbreak has affected a wider range of bird species than previous outbreaks and has led to significant losses in both wild bird populations and poultry flocks worldwide. "The disease has also spread to a wide range of wild and domestic animals, including several cow herds in the US," he told China Daily. "At the moment, it is people working with poultry or infected animals or hunters that have caught the disease, and there is no evidence to date of person-to-person transmission. "The risk of widespread transmission of H5N1 among mammals and potential spillover to humans remains a concern, although at the moment the risk to humans is considered low," he said. Balasubramaniam agreed, telling the China Daily the H5N1 strain "poses a significant threat to global public health". He said the recent detection of an H5N1 case in a child returning to Australia from India "underscores the looming pandemic risk". He said understanding the virology and pathogenesis of avian influenza is crucial for tracking the virus's evolution, developing effective vaccines, and implementing appropriate public health measures. "Avian influenza viruses can be classified as highly pathogenic (HPAI) or low pathogenic (LPAI) based on their ability to cause disease in poultry. H5N1 is considered the most pathogenic HPAI strain, causing severe infections and high mortality rates," he said. "Continuous surveillance is essential to monitor the virus's genetic mutations and potential for human-to-human transmission." According to the World Health Organization, from 2003 to mid-2023,there has been 878 human cases of H5N1, resulting in 458 deaths across 23 countries. Analysts say it is only a matter of time before H5N1 arrives in Australia. The government has established a comprehensive framework to confront the potential threat of H5N1, including stringent biosecurity measures, vaccination strategies, and robust public health infrastructure. "However, systemic challenges in other parts of the world and the rapid pace of globalization pose formidable hurdles. International cooperation and resource allocation are crucial to prevent H5N1 from developing into a full-blown global crisis," Balasubramaniam, at Monash University, added. Esterman, from the University of South Australia, said the current outbreak of bird flu in Australia involves "different highly pathogenic avian influenza strains" – H7N3, H7N9, and H7N8). "The outbreaks are more geographically widespread and involve several different strains of avian influenza compared to previous outbreaks (in Australia)," he said. "The H5N1 bird flu is highly pathogenic for birds, and for the small number of humans infected over the last 20 years, the case fatality rate has been high …about 50 percent." He said the current worldwide H5N1 outbreak has affected a wider range of bird species than previous outbreaks and has led to significant losses in both wild bird populations and poultry flocks worldwide. Professor Robert Booy an infectious diseases and vaccine expert with an honorary professorship at the University of Sydney told China Daily that despite three different strains of bird flu now in Australia, the "key issue is that it (bird flu) is not easily spread between humans. And that remains the case". He said stockpiling of antivirals is again on the agenda in some countries such as Finland and the United States. "Australia," he said, "has some onshore abilities to develop and produce appropriate vaccines, but this needs more attention." Balasubramaniam said, while the Australian government has allocated A$7 million ($4.6 million) to address the potential incursion of the H5N1 strain, "I would like to strongly argue that this funding is inadequate given the scale of potential devastation." The H7 strain currently affecting poultry farms in Australia has led to the culling of approximately 1.8 million commercial birds and incurred costs that exceed A$40 million.

Immediate, coordinated preventive measures are essential.”The UN agency counted that 13 new human infections reported in Cambodia since late 2023, with additional cases in China and Vietnam.For instance, Indonesia and the Philippines are facing heightened security due to its diverse ecological landscape and limited biosecurity measures.Outbreaks in India and NepalMoreover, India, Nepal and Bangladesh are battling outbreaks, the UN agency added.It urged member nations to work together to implement comprehensive surveillance systems, including full genome sequencing, to track the virus’s spread and evolution.It also called on governments, international organizations and the private sector to share information transparently, and stressed the need for the poultry industry to strengthen biosafety measures.Bird flu spreads to farmed animals from wild birds.The H5N1 strain of avian flu has swept the globe in recent years.Loss Of LivesThis strain has killed billions of farmed and wild birds and is spreading to tens of mammal species.Australia, which is dealing with three parallel outbreaks of bird flu, reported a human H5N1 case in May.Earlier this year, a Chinese woman died from a rare H3N8 subtype of avian influenza.This was the world’s first death from the strain.Scientists tracking the bird flu spread are concerned that surveillance gaps may keep them several steps behind a new pandemic.FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp Previous articlePakistan’s Finance Minister In China for Talks on Power ReformsNext articleCan Delhi Save Colombo From The Dragon’s Deadly Embrace?

Credit Thomas Collard Birds need varied activities during avian flu lockdowns, new research shows. Scientists studied a flock of Chilean flamingos that were kept indoors due to a government order to stop the spread of avian influenza. Flamingos were very inactive during the lockdown and just after release, and were more alert while kept indoors. They also displayed unusual behaviour during and after the lockdown. “This project started because keepers noticed the birds performing an unusual behaviour – dropping their heads as if filter-feeding when they weren’t in the water,” said Dr Paul Rose, from the University of Exeter. “Chilean flamingos perform this sweeping action to filter-feed in water, and they had access to a pool while kept indoors, but for some reason they were making this motion on dry land. “We can’t say exactly why they did this, but it shows that birds need a variety of foraging and bathing opportunities to allow them to perform their natural behaviours.” This “mock” filter-feeding continued after the flamingos were allowed back outside, suggesting it takes time for natural behaviour patterns to reestablish after lockdowns. The higher level of alertness indoors is thought to be due to the proximity of humans – the flock being locked inside meant keepers had to be closer than usual to feed and care for them. Dr Rose added: “Our study shows the difficulty of trying to decipher animal wellbeing just by observing their behaviour. “To assess birds’ welfare, it’s better to consider a range of information – including social behaviour, resting and plumage condition.” Plumage is an especially important sign of flamingo health – they spend much of their time preening, and a flamingo with rich pink feathers is likely to be very healthy. Dr Rose was surprised to find plumage condition improved when flamingos were inactive – but this may be explained by the birds experiencing less disturbance after lockdown, meaning feathers were less likely to get ruffled. Commenting on the study’s wider implication for bird keepers – from zoos to people who keep pet chickens – Dr Rose said: “Lockdowns prevent the spread of disease but birds also have behavioural requirements. “Know your animal. They are hard-wired to do certain things, so you should try to provide opportunities – whether that means roosting, feeding in certain ways, or whatever else they do.” The flamingos in the study were at Banham Zoo in Norfolk, UK. The paper, published in the Journal of Zoological and Botanical Gardens, is entitled: “Evaluating potential indicators of welfare for zoo birds during 2 an Avian Influenza enforced housing order.” Tags: Dr Paul Rose, Nature, Research Continue Reading Previous New report: Embedding social sustainability into marine governanceNext Targeted career support for care-experienced academics would help create a new “effective pipeline”, study says More Stories Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Health Health and Community Sciences Research news Age-related health decline a predictor of future dementia risk 9 hours ago Tomi Adesina Cornwall campuses Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Staff news Student news Top stories Uncategorized University news Exeter subjects ranked among the world’s best 18 hours ago Duncan Sandes Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Health Health and Community Sciences Research Networks Research news Launch of national network to plug gaps on dementia prevention and quality of life 19 hours ago Louise Vennells Archives November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 View full archives Connect with us 中文网 Using our site Accessibility Freedom of Information Modern Slavery Act Statement Data Protection Copyright & disclaimer Privacy & cookies Site mapBird flu spreading beyond cows, now infecting cats and raccoons Skip to contentSubscribe to our free Newsletter! → Science Health Food News Best Of The Best More Animals Astronomy Brain Health Beauty Cancer Research Children Diet Studies Education Environment News Exercise Historical Research Longer Life News Money News Parenting Research Politics Society Sports Weight Loss Studies Weird Subscribe Search Home › Animal & Wildlife NewsBird flu spreading beyond cows, now infecting cats and raccoonsBy StudyFinds Staff• Reviewed by Chris MeloreResearch led by Kiril Dimitrov, Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and Diego Diel, Cornell University Jul 25, 2024Fact CheckedShare:PinFacebookTweetYummlyEmail(Credit: Kat Jayne from Pexels) ITHACA, N.Y. — Recently, researchers have documented bird flu mutating in a way that allows it to spread to cows. In a startling development that’s causing ripples through the scientific community, a new study has uncovered evidence that bird flu is now spreading among other mammals as well. This isn’t just any flu — it’s the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 – a strain that’s been making headlines for its devastating impact on bird populations. Now, it seems, the virus has found a new home in dairy cattle, raccoons, and even cats — crossing species at an alarming rate. Let’s break down the findings from the report in the journal Nature. For years, scientists have known about bird flu jumping from birds to humans occasionally. However, what’s happening now is different and potentially more concerning. The virus has made its way into dairy herds in several U.S. states, and now new evidence shows it’s moving from cows to local cats and at least one raccoon. “This is one of the first times that we are seeing evidence of efficient and sustained mammalian-to-mammalian transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1,” says Diego Diel, an expert in virology from Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, in a media release. In simpler terms, the bird flu virus is now passing between mammals easily and consistently. This is a big deal because viruses can change quickly when they start infecting new types of animals. Each jump to a new species is like a roll of the dice – there’s always a chance the virus could become better at spreading or causing more severe illness. New evidence shows H5N1 bird flu moving from cows to local cats and at least one raccoon.

However, the fact that it’s now moving between mammals is definitely raising eyebrows in the scientific community. So far, there have been 11 human cases reported in the U.S. since April 2022. Thankfully, these cases have been mild. Interestingly, four of these cases were linked to cattle farms, while seven were connected to poultry farms. The most recent outbreak involved four cases in Colorado, and the researchers suspect these infections came from dairy farms in the same area. While the virus can infect people, it doesn’t do so very efficiently at the moment. “The concern is that potential mutations could arise that could lead adaptation to mammals, spillover into humans and potential efficient transmission in humans in the future,” Diel warns. This situation highlights the importance of keeping a close eye on the virus as it spreads through animal populations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is offering free testing for H5N1, which is crucial for catching outbreaks early. If a farm tests positive, quick action – like quarantines and increased biosecurity measures – can help stop the virus from spreading further. Let’s rewind a bit to understand how we got here. The current wave of H5N1 infections in the U.S. started in January 2022. Since then, it’s led to the deaths of over 100 million domestic birds and thousands of wild birds. The jump from birds to cattle was first noticed by scientists at Cornell and Texas A&M, who detected the virus in dairy herds. The cows likely caught the virus from wild birds, and it’s making them sick in various ways. They’re eating less, having digestive issues, struggling to breathe, and producing less milk that looks abnormal. 4 cases of bird flu among humans were linked to cattle farms, while 7 were connected to poultry farms. (Photo by Jan Huber on Unsplash) One particularly concerning finding is that the virus seems to have a fondness for infecting cows’ mammary glands, leading to high levels of the virus in their milk. Don’t worry about your morning cereal, though — pasteurization kills the virus, keeping our milk supply safe. The researchers used some pretty high-tech methods to track how the virus was spreading. They looked at the genetic makeup of virus samples and used computer models along with good old-fashioned detective work to piece together the outbreak’s story. They found that infected cows from Texas spread the virus to healthy cows when they were moved to a farm in Ohio. However, it’s not just about cows now. The virus also infected cats, a raccoon, and wild birds found dead on affected farms. The researchers think the cats and raccoon probably got sick from drinking raw milk from infected cows. As for the wild birds, they might have picked up the virus from contaminated environments or from virus particles in the air during milking or cleaning. In the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, this study serves as a wake-up call. It shows that viruses can take unexpected paths as they evolve and spread. While there’s no immediate cause for alarm, it’s a reminder of why scientists work tirelessly to track and understand these microscopic invaders. Their work could help keep humanity one step ahead, ensuring we’re prepared for whatever nature might throw our way next. The study received funding from the Animal Health Diagnostic Center in Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine, the Ohio Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory, the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, and the USDA.

Photo / Mitchell HagemanA young Hawke’s Bay man’s life was tragically cut short by Influenza A two weeks ago. His brave mother and father, who were also hit by the illness as it spread through their whānau home, are speaking out to stop others taking the flu lightly.Te Arani Anthony Munro-Campbell, known as “Uncle Demon” to his adoring nephews, was a softly-spoken 27-year-old who loved his family.“He had a beautiful heart; he was so good to kids,” Robyne Te Whaiti said of her son.A selection of toy race cars sits on top of the box containing his ashes at the family home in Flaxmere, put there by the young people who loved him as a testament to his impact.“This morning, our mokos said, ‘Can we go to where Uncle Demon is? I miss him, Nan’.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“That hurt us.”Munro-Campbell died two weeks ago at home, just days after contracting Influenza A that swept through the family home. His death occurred while his mother lay in intensive care in Hawke’s Bay Hospital with the same strain of the illness.“I went downhill when I found out my son had died,” Te Whaiti said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“I almost lost my life that day; my heart rate went through the roof.”Influenza has three types that affect humans: A, B and C. Influenza A and B viruses regularly circulate and cause seasonal epidemics, most commonly in winter.It was Te Whaiti’s husband Eugene who got sick first.“He was off work for a couple of days, and then on Friday of that week, I took him to the hospital,” she said.“We were at the hospital for so long, and I started feeling cold and getting sick, too.“Eugene was tested for Influenza A and then got given medication.“Come Saturday, he started to come a bit better, but then I went down and our boy went down the same day.“On Sunday, Te Arani was really sick and his father took him to the hospital, and he tested positive as well.”By Monday, Te Whaiti was struggling to breathe, move and look at lights. She was soon taken into intensive care.“When we went outside, I couldn’t even see. By the time we got to the hospital, I couldn’t even get out of the truck and had to use a wheelchair. Within an hour and a half, I was in intensive care.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“It was really bad, I felt like someone was suffocating me.“It’s two weeks now, and I still feel really sick. Not only has it given me lesions on my lungs, but it’s also done damage to my heart.”Robyne and Eugene Te Whaiti say they don’t want anyone else to go through what their family went through after losing their son Te Arani Anthony Munro-Campbell to influenza. Photo / Mitchell HagemanMeanwhile, Munro-Campbell told his family he felt a bit better on Sunday night after having been on an IV.But at home, his health rapidly declined over the next few days. He started to have trouble breathing and his father Eugene urged him to let him take him to hospital again.“He said, ‘Nah, I’ll be alright, Dad’.”Tuesday and Wednesday saw him get progressively worse, and soon after, he succumbed at home to what doctors told the family was pneumonia brought on by the influenza.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“I’ve had the flu, we’ve all had the flu, but this is another dimension. Imagine what my poor son was going through,” Te Whaiti said.She pleaded with people to know the signs of deteriorating Influenza A and urgently seek help, even if they thought they could power through.“I lost my baby through this. He didn’t need to die.“If the awareness was out there and if he knew ... the repercussions of what could happen to him, I think he would’ve gone to the hospital again.”Te Arani Anthony Munro-Campbell had a deep love for his family.Munro-Campbell and his family were not vaccinated against flu this year. This year was the first time she and her husband had forgotten, Te Whaiti said.She said a lack of understanding of the potential severity of the flu on young people likely led to her son not getting or delaying his vaccine.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“You know what young boys are like. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe in [the vaccine]. He made sure his father and I were vaccinated because, ‘You fellas are old’.”Dr Bridget Wilson, medical officer of health, National Public Health Service, said the death of any loved one to influenza was a tragedy and she extended sympathies to the whānau.She said influenza changes often, meaning the vaccine has to be tweaked each year to match the new strains of the disease.“Getting a flu vaccine every year means you have the best protection.”Those at highest risk of severe influenza include the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, those with co-morbid conditions, people from low-income groups, and Pacific and Māori ethnic groups.“The flu vaccine is available from April 1 each year before winter starts.

That's bad timing with flu season, bird migrations just months awayA new, unusual cluster of human H5N1 cases in Colorado hints at looming challenges to come, all while the broader U.S. bird flu outbreak may be surging out of control, several scientists told CBC News.Cluster of infections among Colorado farmworkers could signal new challenges aheadLauren Pelley · CBC News · Posted: Jul 25, 2024 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: July 25A massive outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. has spread between wild and farmed birds, dairy cows, and humans, including a recent cluster of farm workers infected in Colorado. Scientists warn rising human case counts, mere months before the return of the regular flu season and the fall migration of millions of wild birds, could give this globetrotting virus countless more opportunities to evolve. (Wendy Martinez/CBC)Social SharingThe sheer scale of the U.S. bird flu outbreak is hard to fathom. More than 100 million farmed birds have been infected with H5N1 since 2022, followed by roughly 170 herds of dairy cows, along with virus detections in more than 200 other mammals — humans included.Colorado is now facing the country's first human outbreak, which has quickly hit the double-digits. As of Wednesday, there have been nine recent cases at two poultry farms, plus one earlier case from a dairy farm. And while the latest spread may be chicken-to-human, genetic sequencing suggests the virus strain is similar to the form of bird flu tearing through cow populations across more than a dozen states.The country's total human infection tally pales in comparison to the staggering case counts among poultry and livestock. There haven't been any farm worker deaths, and no cases linked to dairy farms have popped up yet in Canada, either.Yet this new, unusual cluster of human H5N1 cases may be a harbinger of looming challenges to come, all while the broader U.S. outbreak could be surging out of control.2 more poultry workers in Colorado infected with H5N1 bird flu: CDCHow H5N1 avian flu went global — and what scientists are bracing for nextThe timing is far from ideal, several scientists told CBC News, with farm worker infections ticking up mere months before the return of the usual flu season, and the fall migration of millions of wild birds — giving this globetrotting virus countless more opportunities to evolve."We are looking at, potentially, a huge outbreak that is still expanding, and still growing, and that is not containable," warned virologist Angela Rasmussen, a researcher with the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. "And that increases the risk of more and more human cases, which in turn increases the risk that this virus will become better adapted to humans."Mild infections, no onward transmissionOfficials first announced the discovery of several farm worker infections back on July 14, all linked to large-scale culling efforts involving H5N1-infected birds on an egg farm in Colorado.While there aren't signs of onward human-to-human transmission, sequencing from one of those cases showed the strain is closely related to the virus spreading in dairy cows, which features previously-documented adaptations to mammals, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted in a recent update.Bird flu strain in U.S. cow outbreak not easily spread by air, ferret study showsMore reassuring? So far, all the human cases in the U.S. have been mild infections, despite high H5N1 case fatality rates reported globally over the last two decades. Some farm workers in the Colorado cluster had traditional flu symptoms of fever and cough, while others experienced conjunctivitis, suggesting the virus may have snuck in through their exposed eye membranes rather than through the body's respiratory channels.But given the small number of known human infections in the U.S. to date, and the unusual transmission patterns that don't mimic how this virus would actually spread person-to-person, "we should put no stock at all on what we're seeing in terms of severity," noted McMaster University influenza researcher Matthew Miller, the director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research.More than 100 million farmed birds have been infected with H5N1 since 2022, followed by roughly 170 herds of dairy cows across 13 states just this year. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Virus mashup 'could create a whole new beast'If human infections keep rising into the fall, in Colorado or beyond, experts say the timing would be advantageous to a virus that's already proven quite adept at striking a wide variety of species. And a host of factors, several scientists agreed, may provide opportunities for H5N1 to better adapt to infect and harm more human hosts.For one thing, the dovetailing of heightened human H5N1 circulation and the return of seasonal flu strains could have dire consequences, said virologist Tom Peacock, a fellow with the Pirbright Institute, a U.K.-based research and surveillance centre for zoonotic viruses."Suddenly, some of these workers who are getting exposed and infected [with H5N1] have a chance of being infected with seasonal flu. And then the poultry or dairy worker is acting as the mixing vessel."Those scenarios would give the virus a chance to mash up its genetic makeup with other flu strains, potentially allowing it to mix-and-match characteristics that could sharpen its ability to transmit person-to-person. It's a process known as reassortment, and influenza viruses are particularly adept at it.That genetic reassortment, Miller said, "could create a whole new beast."Second OpinionBird flu in U.S. cows caught scientists by surprise. Canadian research has seen it coming since 1953Second OpinionBird flu vaccine candidates already exist. But if H5N1 sparks a pandemic, making enough doses won't be easyThere's also a heightened risk of other farms becoming infection sites in the months ahead, Peacock warned, given H5N1's penchant for spilling between species.Already, mounting evidence suggests heightened mammal-to-mammal transmission is taking place even now. A peer-reviewed paper in Nature, published online Wednesday, looked at genomic sequencing for a host of infected species, including cows, birds, domestic cats and a raccoon from impacted farms. The research team found evidence of both "multidirectional interspecies transmissions" and "efficient cow-to-cow transmission" after seemingly healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a facility in a different state.The possibility of onward spread into pig populations in the months ahead is one of Peacock's biggest concerns, since swine "have a lot of viruses circulating within them that are derived originally from human seasonal viruses.""This is how pandemics happen: The mixing of seasonal viruses with avian viruses or novel viruses," he said.The 2009 swine flu pandemic is one of the most familiar, resulting from a mashup of bird, pig and human forms of influenza A.Chickens are pictured at a large poultry farm in British Columbia. Both in Canada and the U.S., wild and farmed birds have fallen ill with H5N1 in droves in recent years. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Miller agreed the possibility of that happening on U.S. pig farms is a rising threat. "We're not doing enough proactive surveillance in those settings right now," he added. "It's a little frustrating."On top of that, scientists expect another wave of migrations could further fuel H5N1's global spread, with millions of wild birds set to fly along north-south avian superhighways in the months ahead."There are tremendous opportunities [for H5N1] to recombine in new and unexpected ways as these waves of migration take place," Miller said.Human spread remains hazy All those added variables could make the U.S. bird flu outbreak even tougher to contain, heightening the risk to humans and putting other countries — including Canada — on alert."Eventually, if this continues, we will have viruses emerging that are better adapted to humans. What that's going to look like in practice, and whether that causes a pandemic, we don't know," said Rasmussen. Complicating matters? The full extent of H5N1's human spread in the U.S. still remains hazy. Second OpinionThere's no question H5N1 bird flu has 'pandemic potential.' How likely is that worst-case scenario?Second OpinionWhy dangerous bird flu is spreading faster and farther than first thought in U.S. cattleA recent serology study in Michigan, which involved testing blood samples from 35 farm workers who'd spent time around infected dairy cows, didn't find evidence of prior infections — suggesting there might not be symptomless human infections flying under the radar. But it's just one small study, from just one health department. Just days after early reports of sick cows at several U.S. farms, H5N1 bird flu has been identified in at least a dozen herds across six states. Scientists are on high alert. But many say what worries them more is whether this virus will jump to more livestock — and pigs, in particular. (Ohio Department of Agriculture)Colorado, meanwhile, is ramping up surveillance efforts to combat the rampant spread of the virus, including a mandatory order on Tuesday for weekly bulk milk-tank testing at dairy farms. Two days later, the state announced the launch of a publicly-available dashboard to track cases of avian flu in humans, which will be updated twice a week.Yet data from other states remains thin thanks to patchwork testing efforts mired by bureaucratic roadblocks, which means the U.S. is likely missing both animal and human cases, experts have warned for months."It's really hard to tell if Colorado was genuinely in a worse state than a lot of other states, or it's just testing and finding stuff," said Peacock. "This is one of the major issues with this outbreak: We don't really have any idea."Calls for farm worker vaccinationsMeanwhile, Rasmussen says there's "not really clear decisive action being taken" to clamp down on animal or human infections.Alongside the need for heightened testing and surveillance efforts, she said H5N1 vaccination strategies targeting at-risk farm workers are another tool the U.S. should consider before the situation spirals out of control.AnalysisNow that bird flu is spreading among cows, scientists worry where H5N1 will jump nextSo far, however, the CDC has not recommended vaccinations for any livestock workers.Canada, Rasmussen said, should also remain vigilant, despite no known farm worker infections or any signs of the virus appearing in the country's milk supply. (Only one human case of H5N1 has ever been reported in Canada. The individual died from bird flu back in 2014 following a trip to China, where they likely got infected.)WATCH | 20 years of warnings about H5N1 avian flu: 20 years of avian flu making headlines and sparking pandemic concerns5 months agoDuration 1:43A look at CBC News coverage of H5N1’s spread across the globe between 2004 and 2024, from early bird flu outbreaks in Asia to the ongoing spread of the virus in dairy cows.Other countries are taking a different approach. In late June, Finland became the first to pursue proactive bird flu vaccination for any adults "who are at increased risk of contracting avian influenza due to their work or other circumstances."The U.S. should take note, Rasmussen said, as sweltering temperatures in Colorado limited workers' ability to wear protective equipment while they were killing infected poultry — leaving them vulnerable to catching the virus.With more hot months ahead, and untold numbers of virus-carrying farm animals across the country, that scenario could easily happen again."It's a mistake not to offer some limited vaccination," Rasmussen said.

Researchers from Cornell University have determined how cows infected with H5N1 bird flu were able to spread the virus to other cows and mammals. In the study published in the journal Nature on July 24, scientists used genomic data, computer modeling, and data about the virus’s spread to show how infected cows from Texas spread bird flu to otherwise healthy cows in Ohio, as well as cats, wild birds, and a raccoon in the area. The raccoon and the cats were likely infected from drinking raw milk from the infected cows, while the wild birds may have contracted the virus from environmental contamination or aerosols kicked up into the air during milking or cleaning. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also US expands bird flu testing after finding symptom-free infections in people Farm workers who have been exposed to animals with bird flu should be tested for the virus even if they do not have symptoms, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. Cornell professor Diego Diel, one of the study’s authors, said it is one of the few times there was “evidence of efficient and sustained mammalian-to-mammalian transmission.” Multiple spillovers from mammal to mammal can increase the likelihood of the virus mutating and spreading to humans. While genetic analysis so far has shown no signs of enhanced transmissibility to humans, monitoring is crucial. ADVERTISEMENT The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) called for an urgent and immediate response on July 25 to a rise of bird flu infections in humans and animals in the Asia-Pacific region. “Since late 2023, we have observed a rise in human cases and the virus spreading to new animal species,” said Kachen Wongsathapornchai, regional manager of the FAO’s Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases. “The emergence of novel H5N1 strains, which are more easily transmissible, increases the pandemic threat. Immediate, coordinated preventive measures are essential.” Since late 2023, 13 human infections have been reported in Cambodia, along with cases in China and Vietnam. Indonesia, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Philippines have also shown signs of outbreaks. In the United States since 2022, 11 individuals were confirmed to be infected with bird flu with five confirmed to be from H5N1, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bird flu in wild birds were found in all 50 states, with 48 seeing outbreaks in poultry and 13 having outbreaks in dairy cows. So far, more than 100 million poultry, more than 9,500 wild birds and 169 dairy herds were affected by the virus. In Canada, there have been no cases detected in humans or dairy cattle.

This decision comes in response to outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in certain US counties. PDF FILE Hong Kong, a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant food scene and international trade, has recently taken a significant step to safeguard public health. The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) in Hong Kong has suspended the import of poultry meat and products, including eggs, from specific regions in the United States. This decision comes in response to outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in certain US counties. The outbreaks The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Ionia County (Michigan) and Parmer County (Texas) in the US. These outbreaks have raised concerns about the potential spread of the virus through poultry products, prompting swift action from Hong Kong authorities. The decision and rationale In response to the WOAH notifications, the CFS instructed traders to suspend the import of poultry meat and products from the affected US regions. But why this decisive move? Here are the key reasons: Public health protection: Hong Kong places paramount importance on food safety. By suspending imports from the affected areas, the CFS aims to prevent the introduction of avian influenza into the local poultry population and minimize any potential risks to human health. Risk assessment: The CFS conducted a thorough risk assessment, considering factors such as the severity of the outbreaks, the likelihood of transmission, and the impact on Hong Kong’s population. The decision was based on scientific evidence and expert advice. Trade impact and stakeholders Hong Kong imported approximately 37,770 tonnes of chilled and frozen poultry meat and around 83.84 million poultry eggs from the US last year. The suspension undoubtedly affects the poultry trade between the two regions. Let’s explore the implications:Continue after advertising. Economic impact: Traders, importers, and exporters are closely monitoring the situation. The suspension disrupts established supply chains and may lead to economic losses for both sides. Consumer concerns: Hong Kong residents rely on poultry products for their daily meals. With imports halted from specific US regions, consumers may experience shortages or price fluctuations. Local poultry industry: Hong Kong’s poultry industry is also impacted. Local producers may see increased demand, but challenges remain in meeting the supply gap left by the suspended imports. Monitoring and future steps The CFS maintains active communication with American authorities regarding the avian influenza outbreaks. They closely monitor information from the WOAH and relevant agencies. Future steps include: Surveillance: Rigorous surveillance of local poultry farms and markets to detect any signs of avian influenza. Risk communication: Educating the public about the situation, preventive measures, and safe handling of poultry products. Reevaluation: Regular assessments to determine when it’s safe to lift the suspension based on disease containment and control efforts. Conclusion Hong Kong’s decision reflects its commitment to food safety and public health. As the situation evolves, stakeholders will adapt measures to ensure a resilient food supply chain while prioritizing safety.

It is also a natural source of protein and a variety of fatty acids, and supports muscle, bone and cardiovascular health. This is why a recent study caused concern when it presented findings of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 being contracted by dairy cows in the United States. We asked experts for their insights on the new evidence and how to ensure the cow’s milk we drink is healthy. Study finds avian influenza in dairy cattle The recent development was originally detected in March 2024. The Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N1) virus in dairy cattle in the United States for the first time. The H5N1 virus, part of the broader family of flu viruses, has proven its ability to cause severe disease and high mortality rates in birds, which has earned it the “highly pathogenic” label. Now, it appears to be infecting dairy cows. Researchers from Iowa State University, led by Rahul Nelli and Todd Bell, conducted a study to understand how this avian virus could infect and replicate in mammals like cows. The findings, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, state that the virus was found predominantly in the mammary glands and raw milk produced by the animals.

It was detected in unpasteurized, clinical samples of milk, swabs and tissue samples. Experts respond to concerns about cow’s milk Fuse/Getty So, does this news mean you should stop drinking dairy milk altogether? No, say experts, it just reinforces the importance of exclusively consuming pasteurized milk products. “In the United States, dairy products are subject to stringent regulations and standards enforced by government agencies,” explains Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES CDN, Preventive Cardiology Dietitian at EntirelyNourished.com. “These regulations cover aspects such as hygiene practices on dairy farms, milk processing and testing for contaminants and pathogens. Cow’s milk also undergoes pasteurization, a process that involves heating the milk to eliminate harmful bacteria and pathogens, which helps to reduce the risk of milk-borne illnesses. Consuming unpasteurized raw milk increases the risk of milk-borne illnesses, which is why raw cow’s milk is not recommended for consumption.” The study raises concerns about the possibility of cows transmitting avian influenza viruses to humans, which could pose a health risk, but it’s important to note that the transmission of avian influenza from cows to humans has not been documented widely in real-world settings, notes Routhenstein. While the study highlights a theoretical risk, she says, actual instances of human infections through cow’s milk have not been a significant concern historically.

Additionally, pasteurization is required for any milk entering interstate commerce. Pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. Milk from ill (symptomatic) animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the human food supply.” If you find milk that doesn’t have the word “pasteurized” anywhere on the label, it’s best to double check with a store employee or the seller if you’re purchasing from a farm for peace of mind.
