- The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has released the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy.
- The strategy aims to respond to the current Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 threat and to establish capabilities for rapid response to future pandemic influenza viruses.
- BARDA has outlined four objectives in the strategy: strategic implementation and deployment of the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile, enhanced protection through novel vaccines, leverage of therapeutics, and ensuring rapid and effective diagnostic tools.
- BARDA's activities are part of a larger HHS influenza research strategy and contribute to ASPR's preparedness responsibilities.
- Avian influenza A (H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has been circulating in wild birds since 2020, and it has recently been detected in North America.
- Avian influenza viruses have a natural reservoir in wild birds, and their movement is monitored by the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.
