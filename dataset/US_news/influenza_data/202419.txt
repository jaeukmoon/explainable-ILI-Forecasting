Dairy cows are a new and unexpected host of this virus, which has been spreading mostly among wild birds and poultry in the United States since January 2022, with sporadic infections in other species. The emergence of this virus in a new animal host impacts a new part of agriculture requiring the development of new processes and trusted partnerships. And the potential for this virus to spread in new or different ways between animals or to people poses new public health challenges. Some have questioned whether public health is able to watch this virus closely enough that it can detect important changes in a timely way. Summary What CDC knows CDC has multiple surveillance systems that are used year-round for seasonal flu and other illnesses that help the agency keep its finger on the pulse of the health of the U.S. public. There also are unique systems that focus exclusively on the detection and study of novel flu viruses. Taken together, these systems currently show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, including avian influenza A(H5N1) (bird flu). What CDC is doing CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes information on flu activity year-round in collaboration with many partners. CDC is actively looking at multiple flu indicators to monitor for novel flu viruses like A(H5N1), including looking for spread of the virus to, or among, people nationwide. CDC is committed to providing timely and transparent information on unusual flu activity. Detecting Important Changes to the Virus in a Timely Way CDC uses many flu surveillance systems, which provide visibility over whether this virus is spreading in people, and which are being fine-tuned and expanded with supplemental studies and analysis for the current situation. These public health systems are routinely used to detect rare events, like single human infections with flu viruses that usually spread in pigs, but when coupled with monitoring of exposed people and analysis of animal sequences associated with this bovine outbreak, this system is further enhanced to detect transmission and early changes in this virus. CDC monitors influenza activity, including that caused by novel influenza viruses like avian influenza A(H5N1) through the following methods: Monitoring through existing flu surveillance systems Surveillance for Novel Influenza A Viruses Virologic Surveillance: U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance Data Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) ­­­­­­­­­­­­­Outbreak specific activities Human monitoring and testing in states Enhanced flu surveillance Planned epidemiologic studies CDC's flu surveillance is a comprehensive and collaborative effort which includes multiple systems that monitor indicators of flu activity, such as illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to flu. These systems are used to monitor for signals and trends in seasonal as well as novel influenza virus infections. Influenza viruses can undergo abrupt, major changes ("antigenic shift") that result in a novel (new) influenza virus that is different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. This system is also optimally designed to detect a rare eventovel influenza virus among influenza positive surveillance specimens tested at public health laboratories in all states for effective intervention and control measures. Together, the multiple components of CDC's surveillance systems described below can detect this and inform the public health response. Surveillance for Novel Influenza Viruses Human cases of novel flu are nationally notifiable, which means CDC, states and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) agree that cases associated with a novel influenza virus should be reported to CDC and investigated. CDC publicly reports information about these human cases. This is important to facilitate prompt awareness and accelerate the implementation of public health responses to limit the spread and impact of these novel viruses. Virologic Surveillance In all 50 states, more than 100 public health laboratories use a number of different CDC diagnostic tests to detect both seasonal influenza viruses and novel influenza A viruses, including a test that specifically detects A(H5) viruses. About 140,000 of these H5-specific tests are already pre-positioned at the state and local level and another 750,000 tests are available for distribution if needed. CDC also continues to engage manufacturers of commercial diagnostic tests with the goal of having an A(H5N1) test that is widely available if needed. Because influenza viruses are constantly changing, CDC performs ongoing analyses of seasonal and novel influenza viruses to identify genetic changes that might allow for spread more easily to and between people, more serious illness in people, reduce susceptibility to antivirals, affect the sensitivity of diagnostic assays, or reduce neutralization of the virus by vaccine induced antibodies. For this A(H5N1) response, CDC sequenced, analyzed, and publicly posted the full genome of the virus from the human case in Texas and has analyzed hundreds of posted cattle sequences to inform the agency's ongoing public health risk assessment. To date, both the human and the cattle sequences remain primarily avian viruses and lack changes that would make them better adapted to spread between people. Ongoing analysis of specimens received from public health laboratories also serve as an important source of viruses to create candidate vaccine viruses for potential vaccine development, and CDC also analyzes these specimens for susceptibility to influenza antivirals. CDC monitors for unusual increases in flu activity by tracking the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza viruses based on data reported from approximately 300 clinical laboratories located throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia. Data are reported through either the U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System or National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). Surveillance of Flu Illness Activity U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) collects information from more than 4,100 outpatient providers and emergency departments about visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI). Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) is part of the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET), which is designed to conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalizations. National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance collects the number of flu-associated hospital admissions, ICU hospitalizations, and hospital admissions rates from hospitals throughout the United States. National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) collects, analyzes, and shares electronic health data received from emergency departments (EDs). By tracking all flu diagnoses among patients in EDs, public health practitioners can detect unusual levels of flu in near real-time. National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) has more than 600 sites reporting influenza A data to CDC. This monitoring detects but does not distinguish influenza A(H5N1) from other influenza A subtypes nor can it distinguish between human and non-human sources of A(H5N1), including dairy cattle or run-off from affected industries. Together, these systems provide strong insight into flu activity in the United States, and collectively, for the most recent week, they currently show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, including A(H5N1). In response to the outbreak of A(H5N1) in dairy cows and other animals in the United States, CDC is developing additional surveillance and research activities to help address key public health questions. CDC is in ongoing discussions with multiple states about state-led field investigations to explore key scientific and public health questions related to the ongoing outbreak. CDC is playing a coordinating role with regard to investigation protocols so that data collection can be standardized across states and results can be pooled. In addition, CDC is maintaining multilingual and multidisciplinary epidemiological field teams ready to deploy to support on-site studies when requested. The purpose of this work, alongside our interagency partners including the US Department of Agriculture, US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health, is to better understand the current outbreak in animals and the public health and One Health implications of the emergence of this virus in dairy cattle. There's more work to do to ensure our nation has the best possible visibility into potential human infections. The dairy industry represents a new sector within U.S. agriculture exposed to this virus, and CDC is in the process of building new relationships and the trust needed to have uniform access to developments in the field, across every impacted state and to provide support where and when needed. That work is urgent and underway. It is imperative that we curtail the opportunities for A(H5N1) viruses to spread further and evolve to pose a greater risk to the public's health. Protecting public health, and in this situation in particular, the health of the people at greatest risk of infection, is a vital priority, and testing is critical in the long term to stay ahead of avian flu. Actions for the Public CDC believes the current risk to the general public remains low; however, people with close or long unprotected exposures (without the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE) to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection. People exposed to A(H5N1)-infected birds or other animals (including people wearing recommended PPE) should be monitored for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Persons who develop any illness symptoms after exposure to A(H5N1) virus infected birds or other animals should seek prompt medical evaluation for possible influenza testing and antiviral treatment by their clinician or public health department. The FDA and USDA have indicated that based on the information currently available, the U.S. commercial milk supply is safe, however, A(H5N1) viruses have been detected in raw milk. The FDA has a long-standing recommendation to consumers not to consume raw milk (milk that has not been pasteurized) or raw milk products. Specific recommendations for farmers; poultry, backyard flock, and livestock owners; and worker protection are also available. More information on protective actions for people is available at H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary.

It is also used to determine the need for annual influenza vaccine updates as well as for pandemic preparedness. Performing antigenic characterization of IAV on a global scale is confronted with high costs, animal availability, and other practical challenges. Here we present a machine learning model that accurately predicts (normalized) outputs of HI assays involving circulating human IAV H3N2 viruses, using their hemagglutinin subunit 1 (HA1) sequences and associated metadata. Each season, the model learns an updated nonlinear mapping of genetic to antigenic changes using data from past seasons only. The model accurately distinguishes antigenic variants from non-variants and adaptively characterizes seasonal dynamics of HA1 sites having the strongest influence on antigenic change. Antigenic predictions produced by the model can aid influenza surveillance, public health management, and vaccine strain selection activities.

Antigenically drifted influenza strains may escape immunity induced by previous infection or vaccination2, leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality1. To counter antigenic drift, influenza virus strains included in the human influenza vaccine are regularly updated. The World Health Organization (WHO) holds vaccine composition meetings (VCMs) twice each year to recommend vaccine strains for the upcoming northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH) influenza seasons3. Genetic and antigenic characteristics of circulating isolates are considered when recommending vaccine strains at each meeting3.Antigenic characteristics of circulating isolates are primarily determined through hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays utilizing ferret post-infection antisera, although assessments using both human pre- and post-vaccination antisera are also conducted3. The HI assay measures the cross-reactivity of a test virus isolate to an antiserum raised against a reference virus isolate in ferrets or against the vaccine viruses in humans. Ferret antisera are produced in naïve animals and hence have high specificity compared to human antisera which generally have extensive cross-reactive antibodies due to encountering multiple infections or vaccinations against influenza. Large-scale antigenic characterization of circulating isolates using HI assays incurs high costs and is time and labor-intensive4,5.Computational methods that predict ferret HI titers of influenza viruses using genetic sequence data may help to reduce these burdens1,6. Accurate sequence-based models could enable more comprehensive antigenic surveillance of circulating virus isolates without the need for increased experimental resources1. The efficiency of evolutionary monitoring and vaccine selection procedures may be improved by providing targeted sets of isolates for experimental evaluation. Furthermore, by learning the complex map from genetic to antigenic changes, accurate prediction methods could yield new insights into influenza evolution and the processes underpinning antigenic drift2,7.Here we develop a machine learning (ML) model that predicts antigenic properties of influenza A virus (IAV) H3N2 isolates circulating in a season using their HA1 sequences and associated metadata while being trained on data from past seasons only. The model is designed and evaluated for predicting, on a season-by-season basis, HI titers of virus-antiserum pairs involving viruses sequenced globally as part of WHO’s seasonal influenza surveillance. This approach is distinct from previous sequence-based HI titer prediction methods4,7,8,9,10,11, which in many cases have considered the problem of predicting HI titers of virus-antiserum pairs randomly selected over time. For training and testing our model, we use the IAV H3N2 antigenic data of influenza seasons from 2003 – 2021 reported by the Worldwide Influenza Center at the Francis Crick Institute12, genetic data available at influenza sequence databases13,14, and their associated metadata. The model predicts HI titers of virus-antiserum pairs with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.702 antigenic units (where 1 antigenic unit ≈ 2-fold change in HI titer) per season and exhibits a strong discriminatory ability in distinguishing antigenic variants across seasons. The developed data-driven ML model captures from data the nonlinear effects in the relation between IAV H3N2 antigenic and genetic changes, which has been suggested by recent experimental studies15,16. We show that the model’s predictive power is robust to limiting training data per season. Moreover, incorporating a small amount of antigenic data from circulating isolates in model training significantly enhances its accuracy, particularly for seasons associated with strong antigenic drift. The model identifies key sites with the strongest impact on IAV antigenic change, most of which are located in HA1 epitopes, and reveals how they vary across different seasons. Overall, accurate prediction of HI titers by the developed model across seasons shows its viability for seasonal antigenic characterization of IAV H3N2.ResultsMachine learning model for seasonal antigenic characterization of IAV H3N2Our ML model for seasonal antigenic characterization of IAV H3N2 was designed under a seasonal framework (Fig. 1a) that mimics the WHO VCM protocols12 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The NH VCM is held each February and considers antigenic data for circulating isolates from the preceding September to January, while the SH VCM is held each September and considers isolates from the preceding February to August. Each of these periods constitutes an influenza season. Under the seasonal framework, for any given season, our model is trained using genetic, antigenic, and metadata information available prior to that season. The trained model predicts antigenic data for the current season based on genetic data of isolates circulating in that season, along with metadata (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: Overview of the seasonal framework and the designed ML method for seasonal antigenic characterization of IAV H3N2.a Seasonal division of data into training and test datasets respectively for training and evaluation of computational methods in a time-series fashion. Under this framework, historical genetic, antigenic, and metadata information of virus isolates from past seasons is included in the training dataset, while genetic and metadata information of virus isolates from the current season form the test dataset. b The trained AdaBoost model was used to predict NHTs using only encoded genetic difference and metadata information of virus-antiserum pairs. c Details of the encoding performed at the input of the AdaBoost model. The HA1 sequences of isolates in each virus-antiserum pair were encoded using the amino acid mutation matrix available in the AAindex2 database. One-hot encoding was used to represent the metadata information, which includes virus avidity, antiserum potency, and passage category of isolates. The encoded genetic difference and metadata of each virus-antiserum pair were used as input features of the AdaBoost model. Each training virus-antiserum pair was labeled by NHT-based antigenic difference (see “Methods”).Full size imageThe model employs an adaptive boosting method (AdaBoost)17,18 consisting of an ensemble of decision trees (Fig. 1b). The model is trained in a supervised fashion and learns a nonlinear mapping from genetic difference to antigenic difference (defined as normalized HI titers (NHT); “Methods”) between virus-antiserum pairs of past isolates. Pairwise genetic difference is based on the HA1 gene of isolates in a virus-antiserum pair and is encoded using the GIAG010101 mutation matrix from the amino acid index 2 (AAindex2) database19 (“Methods”, Fig. 1c). The model also utilizes metadata information including virus avidity7, antiserum potency7, and passage category (egg or cell) of virus isolates and antisera, which is represented using one-hot encoding (“Methods”, Fig. 1c). The trained model predicts the antigenic differences (in terms of NHTs) of circulating virus isolates using only their HA1 genetic sequences and metadata information (Fig. 1b, c).Model training, optimization, and validationFor model training, optimization, and evaluation, we compiled HI titers data of IAV H3N2 from reports published by the Worldwide Influenza Center (WIC) at the Francis Crick Institute, London,12 and genetic data from influenza sequence databases, GISAID13 and IVR14. The processed dataset included NHTs of 36,709 virus-antiserum pairs with corresponding metadata, spanning 37 influenza seasons from 2003NH to 2021SH (“Methods”). Data availability was limited in the early seasons and increased progressively over time (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Preliminary assessment using a baseline model (“Methods”) revealed sufficient data for reliable predictive performance from the 2012NH season onwards (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The four seasons 2012NH to 2013SH were selected as validation seasons to perform feature selection and model optimization.Using the validation seasons, it was found that incorporating all four metadata features provided optimal performance (MAE of 1.091) (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and substantially outperformed the baseline model trained with no metadata (MAE of 1.641). The metadata captures distinct information: virus avidity and antiserum potency account for experimental variations among HI assays7, while the passage category informs about antigenicity-altering mutations incurred during in vitro propagation of virus isolates using cell or egg lines1,20. Optimization of the model hyperparameters significantly improved performance (from MAE of 1.091 to 0.759) over validation seasons (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Selecting the optimal amino acid mutation matrix for genetic data encoding (Supplementary Fig. 3c; for details see “Methods”) further slightly improved performance (MAE of 0.75).Optimized model accurately performs seasonal antigenic characterizationThe performance of the optimized model in predicting NHTs was evaluated for each of the 14 test seasons (2014NH to 2020SH). This yielded a MAE, averaged across seasons, of 0.702 antigenic units (Fig. 2a). Predictions were generally more accurate in more recent influenza seasons, likely due to the increased availability of data over time (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Further experiments assessed the robustness of our model to variations in the training data. Prediction accuracy was retained even under conditions where there is substantially less antigenic data for training (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Minimal effects on performance (compromised performance for a single season only) were observed when omitting HI titers data from an entire season (Supplementary Fig. 4c).Fig. 2: Performance of the optimized model for seasonal antigenic characterization of IAV H3N2.a, b Model prediction and classification performance is shown in terms of (a) MAE and (b) AUROC respectively over 14 test seasons from 2014NH to 2020SH. The optimized model consisted of encoded genetic difference using the best-performing amino acid mutation matrix GIAG010101, optimized hyperparameters (see “Methods”), and all features in the metadata information (virus avidity, antiserum potency, and passage category (egg or cell) of virus isolates and antisera) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The classification score AUROC was obtained by converting the measured and predicted NHTs to binary labels such that if NHT was greater than 2 units it was assigned a binary label 1, otherwise 0. The ‘Average’ cell in (a, b) indicates the score averaged over 14 test seasons from 2014NH to 2020SH. The darker color cells indicate better performance. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe ability of our model to detect antigenic variants was also examined. An influenza virus is considered antigenically distinct from the virus used to generate the antiserum if a more than 4-fold reduction in HI titers is observed against the antiserum4,21. Our model classified antigenic variants and non-variants with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 92% across the 14 test seasons (Fig. 2b). Additional metrics (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) further demonstrated classification accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We have incorporated the model into a web application (https://huggingface.co/spaces/sawshah/SAP_H3N2) that reports predicted NHTs for user-specified H3N2 virus-antiserum pairs (see “Methods”).To further calibrate model performance, we assessed alternative approaches. These included a linear method (NextFlu substitution model7), ML methods (random forest (RF)22 and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)23), and neural network methods (multi-layer perceptron (MLP)24 and residual neural network (ResNet)24). These models, along with their implementation details, are described in “Methods”. Among these alternative models, NextFlu is the most widely used model for antigenic prediction. It has been employed to predict NHTs under a non-seasonal framework, where the model was trained on data spanning all time periods and the predictions were made for randomly selected historical NHTs. When evaluated under the seasonal prediction framework (Fig. 1a) over 14 test seasons (2014NH to 2020SH), the AdaBoost model achieved the best performance (MAE of 0.702), followed by the ML methods (MAE of 0.72 and 0.738 respectively for XGBoost and RF) and the NextFlu model (MAE of 0.819). The neural network methods achieved the worst performance (MAE of 0.964 and 0.986 respectively for ResNet and MLP) (Supplementary Fig. 6).Partial antigenic information of circulating isolates alleviates antigenic drift effectsDisregarding the initial season of 2014, the MAE of our optimized model was well below average in two seasons: 2016NH and 2019NH (Fig. 2a). This appears to be attributed to a larger antigenic drift observed in these seasons, which is evident from the presence of circulating isolates (red circles) that are widely dispersed from isolates of past seasons (gray points) (Fig. 3a). Importantly, performance was recuperated in subsequent seasons and degradation was not carried forward (Fig. 2a).Fig. 3: Partial antigenic information mitigates effects of seasonal antigenic drift.a Antigenic maps56 to visualize the antigenic drift in circulating isolates compared to isolates from the previous two recent seasons (see “Methods”). The maps on the left show two instances of large antigenic drift in the 2016NH (top-left) and 2019NH (bottom-left) seasons, while the maps on the right show two instances of small antigenic drift in the 2017SH (top-right) and 2020SH (bottom-right) seasons. Each square in a grid indicates the antigenic difference of two units, corresponding to a four-fold dilution of the antibody in the HI assay. Large antigenic drift is indicated by the presence of circulating isolates (red circles) dispersed far from past isolates (gray points). b The MAE performance of the model was evaluated over 14 test seasons, ranging from 2014NH to 2020SH. The top panel displays the MAE performance of the model trained on data from 2003NH up to the corresponding test season. The bottom panel shows the MAE performance of the model when data of randomly selected 10% circulating isolates was included in model training. For each test season, average scores of 50 Monte Carlo runs are reported. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWhile significant antigenic drift makes prediction more challenging, access to partial antigenic data for circulating virus isolates in a season may help overcome this challenge. Further analysis confirmed this hypothesis. For each test season, including as little as 10% of the antigenic data for circulating isolates in the model training improved performance uniformly, with the most significant gains observed in those seasons with large antigenic drift (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Access to a small amount of antigenic data can therefore help ensure high prediction accuracy irrespective of the level of drift experienced by IAV H3N2.Antigenically important sites identified by the model are temporally associated with HA1 epitopesAnalysis of historical data has demonstrated that the antigenic evolution of influenza is strongly influenced by mutations at a subset of sites within HA17,25,26. Our model enables the identification of the specific HA1 sites that have the greatest effect on antigenic changes during a given season, providing insights into the seasonal dynamics of these sites. Such sites can be predicted based on their feature importance22 scores from the model (“Methods”). Aggregating the top 20 sites identified for seasons 2014NH to 2020SH revealed 30 important sites in total (Fig. 4a). Of these, 25 were located within established HA1 epitopes25,27,28 (A, B, C, D, and E). Substitutions in these epitope regions are known to have a dominant effect on the antigenic evolution of IAV H3N22,25. Epitopes A and B were statistically significantly enriched among the identified 30 sites (\({{{{{\rm{P}}}}}} \, < \, 0.05\)), which supports previous findings that epitopes A and B are the most immunodominant26,28.Fig. 4: Model-inferred important sites: Correspondence with known epitopes and seasonal dynamics.a Majority of the 30 important sites identified by the model based on the feature importance scores lie in known IAV H3N2 epitopes. The sites are color-coded according to epitopes. The sites that do not lie in any known epitope are referred to as unknown. P value indicates the one-sided statistical significance of epitope enrichment within the identified important sites (see “Methods”). b The AdaBoost-based feature importance scores for the 30 important sites are analyzed across subsets of training data from 2003NH to x (x ranges from 2014NH to 2020SH), with the top 20 sites based on the feature importance scores listed for each subset. The darker color cells indicate a higher importance score of a site. c Change in the set of important sites, color-coded by epitopes, across two seasons (2014NH and 2020SH) is displayed over the HA structure (Protein Data Bank ID: [6AOU]; A/Brisbane/10/2007). The sites in epitopes A and D are labeled in the top-view (left panel) while the sites in epitopes C, E, and the unknown region are labeled in the front-view (right panel). For epitope B, sites 158, 159, 189, and 196 are labeled in the top-view (left panel) and sites 186, 193, 194, and 197 are labeled in the front-view (right panel). HA1 subunit is shown in white and the HA2 subunit is colored gray. Source data and exact P-values are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSeasonal analysis (Fig. 4b) revealed nine sites within epitopes that were consistently ranked in the top 20 sites over all 14 seasons from 2014NH to 2020SH. These comprised three sites in epitope A (140, 144, 145), three in B (158, 186, 189), and three in D (173, 208, 213). The relative importance of epitopes A and B persisted across all seasons, though epitope A appears to have become more important more recently (Fig. 4b, c). Outside epitopes A and B, the importance of epitope D was also reasonably stable across all seasons and this epitope was relatively more important than epitopes C and E (Fig. 4b, c). In earlier seasons (2014NH and 2014SH), site 189 of epitope B was predicted to be the most important antigenic site by our model. This site was previously identified experimentally to be responsible for two antigenic cluster transitions26 (EN72 to VI75 and BK79 to SI87). This site was also predicted to be the most important antigenic site by NextFlu7 on a dataset from 2005–2016. In recent seasons (2019SH to 2020SH), our model predicts site 159 of epitope B to be the most important antigenic site. The genetic analysis by Crick WIC12 showed that most of the viruses circulating in these seasons belong to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, where one of its characteristic substitutions includes Y159N resulting in loss of glycosylation that affects recognition of epitopes by antibodies29.Of the 30 sites identified across seasons as being most important, five did not belong to any known epitope (Fig. 4a). Among these, four sites are in close proximity (with distance between carbon-alpha atoms <8 Å) to the known epitopes: sites 223 and 241 are located close to epitope D, site 269 is located close to epitope E, while site 225 is close to both epitopes A and D (Fig. 4c). Two of these sites, 183 and 225, are part of the functionally important receptor binding sites (RBS)28. Site 225 was consistently ranked in the top 20 important sites across all seasons considered (Fig. 4b). Mutations at site 225 can alter the fitness landscape of epitope B30, and a mutation at this site was linked to egg-passaging adaptation in isolates circulating from 2019 to 202131.Overall, our model identified HA1 sites (predominantly within known epitopes but also some outside) that contributed significantly to the antigenic evolution of IAV H3N2 in the last decade and characterized the dynamics of these antigenic “drivers” over time.DiscussionWe have presented a machine learning model (Fig. 1b, c) that can accurately predict antigenic properties (in terms of NHTs) of IAV H3N2 isolates circulating in an influenza season using only their genetic sequence data and associated metadata. The model was trained and tested under a seasonal framework (Fig. 1a), mimicking the periodic influenza surveillance process followed by WHO for annual vaccine strain selection (Supplementary Fig. 1). The model remained robust under data-limited scenarios.Computational methods have been developed previously for antigenic characterization of IAV. These include the well-known antigenic cartography2 method, a multi-dimensional scaling approach that is helpful to visualize and study the relationship among virus isolates and antisera in two dimensions. Other sequence-based models have also been developed1,6, most of which considered a non-seasonal framework4,7,8,9,10,11, distinct from the seasonal framework (Fig. 1a) adopted in this work. The non-seasonal framework disregards seasonime information and randomly distributes HI titers (or virus isolates) in the multi-seasonal HI data among training and test datasets. Under this framework, the testing data may comprise isolates having antigenic changes that the model has already learned during training, which can lead to overfitting and inflate model performance. In addition to sequence data, information such as structural and physicochemical properties of HA have also been used for IAV antigenic prediction10,11.Antigenic changes in influenza HA have been shown to be nonlinearly related to genetic changes in recent experimental studies15,16. These studies demonstrated that epistatic interactions or specific HA backgrounds can affect the antigenicity of HA substitutions. Thus, linear or additive models that assume independent effects of HA substitutions on antigenicity might be suboptimal for capturing the genetic-to-antigenic relation for HA. By adopting a data-driven ML approach, tree-based models (including AdaBoost, as well as XGBoost and RF) capture nonlinearities in the mapping between genetic and antigenic changes. This is shown to yield improved performance when compared to a linear prediction model7 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, improved performance is still observed even when the AdaBoost model parameters are matched to those of the linear model (Supplementary Fig. 6). Capturing nonlinearities is however not the only factor which determines the performance, as highlighted by the inferior performance of the nonlinear NN models (MLP and ResNet). This discrepancy in the performance of NN models could be attributed to the tabular structure of the dataset used. Similar findings have been reported in the literature, indicating diminished performance of NN models when applied to tabular datasets32.Previous studies7,11,33 have demonstrated the value of incorporating virus avidity and antiserum potency in the computational antigenic characterization of IAV H3N2. Our findings highlight the importance of using passage history categories of virus isolates and antisera (e.g., if ferret antisera were raised to cell-propagated or egg-propagated virus isolates), as additional metadata features in model development. Using passage categories alone leads to performance improvement similar to that of using virus avidity and antiserum potency, and we show that incorporating all of these features together leads to significantly improved model performance (Supplementary Fig. 3a).The model’s predictive power is robust to variations in the training data (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Omitting data from a complete season degrades model performance in the following two seasons, but not beyond that (Supplementary Fig. 4c). This indicates that errors due to a lack of data in specific seasons are not retained in later seasons, and only affect the model’s accuracy for a maximum of one or two test seasons. Additional tests showed that training with data from only the two most recent seasons performed similarly to training based on all historical seasons (Supplementary Fig. 8). This is in line with the observed rate of antigenic drift of 1.2 units per year2 (equivalent to two seasons) for IAV H3N2, which infers that the antigenicity of H3N2 isolates would differ substantially beyond two seasons and thereby the corresponding data would likely contribute less to predicting antigenicity of the isolates in the current season.Some clades of H3N2, e.g., 3C.2a, failed to react in HI assays in the past as they had lost the ability to agglutinate red blood cells (RBC)34. To avoid such issues, HI assays are complemented with virus neutralization assays3. In comparison to HI assay data, neutralization assay-based antigenic data has been rarely used5 for developing computational models. This is because the HI assay is still considered the gold standard for characterizing IAV antigenicity, given its well-established protocols and high level of reproducibility and reliability, and in the last few years very few H3N2 viruses do not bind avian or mammalian RBC. Nonetheless, our model can be adapted to predict neutralization titers, a worthwhile problem to pursue in a future study.To predict NHTs, we used genetic information from the HA1 subunit of the HA protein since it contains the key antibody binding sites (epitopes)1,2. Recent research has shown high rates of amino acid substitutions outside the HA1 epitope region as well as in the other influenza surface protein (neuraminidase, NA), possibly indicating positive selection by host immunity1. The proposed model could be augmented with genetic information of the HA2 subunit and NA protein for potentially improving prediction accuracy and for examining the role (and temporal dynamics) of HA2 and NA in driving further antigenic changes in IAV H3N2. We focused on IAV H3N2 due to the availability of rich HI titers data for this subtype, as compared to other human influenza viruses1,21. We have also adapted the proposed model for IAV H1N1 using a dataset33,35 spanning 18 influenza seasons from 2001NH to 2009SH. This data set lacked comprehensive passage information, and hence, passage metadata was excluded. We found that the H1N1-adapted model performed seasonal antigenic characterization with an average MAE of 0.747 over these 18 influenza seasons (Supplementary Fig. 9). Our findings motivate the development of methods to track the antigenic evolution of other influenza subtypes, such as IAV (H1N1) pdm09 or influenza B viruses, provided sufficient antigenic data is available.Serological data is useful not only for guiding IAV vaccine strain selection during VCMs, but also for building computational models addressing general questions related to influenza evolution. These include models for identifying antigenic clusters2,36,37, and predicting relative growth of viral clades (genetically related isolates stemming from a common ancestor) and forecasting the clades that will likely proliferate in the next season5,38,39,40,41. The predictions produced by our model can augment experimentally available serological data and can, in turn, be incorporated into models of influenza evolution that use antigenic data.The AdaBoost model designed for seasonal antigenic characterization has several limitations. First, like any ML model, its performance is contingent on the availability of training data (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Given the limited training data available before 2012 (Supplementary Fig. 2a), we evaluated the model’s performance for seasons after 2012 only. Second, regardless of the amount of training data, the model’s performance is reduced in seasons with large antigenic drift (Fig. 3a). A small amount of antigenic information of circulating virus isolates (e.g., as low as 10% of the available data) for model training can help to largely overcome this issue (Fig. 3b). Third, since the model uses amino acid sites as features, it can determine the importance of individual sites (Fig. 4), but not specific amino acid substitutions. This may be addressed in future work by using amino acid substitutions as features for the AdaBoost model. Lastly, while the AdaBoost model can learn a nonlinear genotype-to-phenotype mapping and identify important sites individually, it cannot explicitly identify the collective effects of sites (i.e., epistasis) on antigenicity. Interpretable artificial intelligence techniques, such as Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)42, may potentially be explored to study the effect of interactions between sites.Seasonal influenza poses a significant threat to global public health, with high mortality and morbidity rates. The virus’s ability to evolve and evade population-level immunity developed from past infections and vaccinations underscores the importance of continued antigenic surveillance for controlling future influenza outbreaks. Noting that only a subset of circulating viruses is tested with HI assays due to practical constraints (e.g., animal availability, resources, cost), our approach could be used to provide normalized HI titers estimates for all sequenced circulating viruses in a given season. This would provide a more comprehensive picture of the antigenic landscape of viruses circulating in each season and could provide complementary input when making vaccine strain selection decisions. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to make rapid sequence-based predictions that suggest which subset of circulating viruses should be tested experimentally with HI assays in a given season. ML-based models, like the one proposed in this work, offer powerful tools for complementing existing antigenic characterization efforts, enabling comprehensive global influenza antigenicity monitoring, improved vaccine strain selection, and effective public health management.MethodsAntigenic and genetic datasets of IAV H3N2We obtained the antigenic HI titers data for IAV H3N2 from 35 biannual reports published during 2003 – 2021 by the Worldwide Influenza Center (WIC) at the Francis Crick Institute, London12 (Supplementary data 1). A total of 82,776 HI titers values against virus-antiserum pairs were extracted from these reports, where in each pair the virus represents the circulatingest virus isolate and the antiserum represents the reference virus isolate against which the post-infection ferret antiserum was raised. From these reports, we also extracted the metadata information of virus isolates including their names, passages, and collection dates. Based on the passage information, we labeled each virus isolate with either a cell or egg passage category. We used both the name and passage to represent a unique virus isolate. Invalid HI titers43 and HI titers of virus-antiserum pairs with passage categories other than egg or cell were removed. Following standard practices of the WHO2,7, we computed NHT-based antigenic differences for each virus-antiserum pair from the compiled HI titers values. NHT is defined as the difference of the 2-fold dilutions of the homologous and heterologous titers values as follows2,7$${d}_{{ab}}={\log }_{2}\left({T}_{b\beta }\right)-{\log }_{2}\left({T}_{a\beta }\right),$$where the homologous titers \({T}_{b\beta }\) and the heterologous titers \({T}_{a\beta }\) represent the reciprocal of the maximum dilution of antiserum \(\beta\) that is required to inhibit cell agglutination by the reference virus isolate \(b\) and the test virus isolate \(a\), respectively. In case the homologous titers were unavailable, we used the maximum titers value available for that antiserum2. We removed the virus-antiserum pairs against which sequences were not found in the influenza genetic databases and used the remaining antigenic data for seasonal antigenic characterization. This included a total of 36,709 NHTs corresponding to 3737 virus isolates paired with 268 antisera.In addition to NHT, Archetti Horsfall Titers (AHT)9,44 is also used to characterize antigenic differences between virus isolates. AHT measurement is a two-way analysis45 that requires four HI assays, and antiserum must be raised against each virus isolate in a pair. AHT is not used by WHO46 and thus was not considered in this work. We also note that HI assays are dependent on the agglutination of red blood cells. The source of these red blood cells has varied from chicken to turkey and then to guinea pig over the course of time, due to changes in receptor binding sites47 of IAV H3N2. While these variations are present in the dataset that we consider, the insensitivity of the model to these variations shows that they are likely taken care of by the model parameters of virus avidities and antiserum potencies7.For the virus isolates and antisera in this data, we downloaded the corresponding HA protein sequences from the GISAID13 and the IVR14 databases. We aligned the HA protein sequences using MAFFT48 with the full-length HA protein (566 amino acids) of A/Beijing/32/1992 (isolate ID: AAA87553)7 as a reference. We restricted our model to the HA1 subunit (amino acid sites 17–345) of the HA protein, as this subunit forms the globular head of the HA protein containing key epitopes known to be important for antigenicity of IAV H3N21,2.Encoding genetic and metadata informationTo provide inputs in numeric form to the AdaBoost17 model, we encoded the genetic sequences of virus isolates using the amino acid mutation matrices in the AAindex2 database19 (Fig. 1c). As alternatives, we also explored binary and one-hot encoding methods for encoding the genetic sequences of virus isolates (see below for details). The metadata information of virus isolates was represented using the standard one-hot encoding (Fig. 1c). The encoded genetic and metadata information was used as input features of the AdaBoost model.The AAindex2 database contains 94 20 × 20 amino acid mutation matrices, where each numeric entry of a matrix describes the rate at which an amino acid in a protein sequence is replaced by another amino acid over evolutionary time. These numerical values are based on the physiochemical and biochemical properties of pairs of amino acids. Of these 94 matrices, two matrices (MEHP950101 and MEHP950103) were discarded for being incomplete as they included gaps in their entries. Thus, the remaining 92 matrices were investigated for encoding the genetic information of isolates. Specifically, for each virus-antiserum pair, we computed genetic difference from a reference (antiserum) to test virus isolate by encoding the amino acid mutations at each site of their HA1 protein sequences using the numeric entry of the corresponding amino acid pairs in mutation matrices as described in ref. 44. Briefly, for a specific mutation matrix \({{{{{\rm{M}}}}}}\), the encoded genetic difference \(g\) between the sequences of a virus \(v\) and an antiserum \(a\) at HA1 position \(i\) is given by:$${g}_{i}={m}_{{v}_{i},{v}_{i}}+{m}_{{a}_{i},{a}_{i}}-{2m}_{{a}_{i},{v}_{i}},$$where \({v}_{i}\) and \({a}_{i}\) are respectively the amino acids at position \(i\) in the virus and antiserum sequence, and \({m}_{j,k}\) is the entry of the matrix \({{{{{\rm{M}}}}}}\) corresponding to amino acids \(j\) and \(k\).In the binary encoding scheme, for each virus-antiserum pair, the amino acid differences at each HA1 site were encoded as ‘1’ and otherwise ‘0’. Any ambiguous amino acid or gap in the protein sequences was also encoded as zero to avoid mapping ambiguous genetic information to antigenicity. For each virus-antiserum pair, the binary encoded genetic difference was represented by a binary vector of length 329 corresponding to the length of the HA1 protein sequence.In the one-hot encoding scheme, for each virus-antiserum pair, at each HA1 site, the amino acids in the two sequences were initially represented as binary vectors of length 20 (corresponding to 20 valid amino acids), as per standard one-hot encoding. Subsequently, a logical OR operation was applied between these two vectors to encode the amino acid differences. Consequently, at each HA1 site, distinct amino acids in a virus-antiserum pair are encoded as a binary vector of length 20 with a pair of ones, each representing a one-hot encoded amino acid. For the alternative case in which the amino acids are the same at a given site, these are encoded into a binary vector of length 20 with a single one, preserving the amino acid information. With this one-hot encoding strategy together with logical OR combining, the genetic difference for each virus-antiserum pair produces an encoded binary vector of length 20 × 329.Each metadata information of isolates—including their virus avidities, antiserum potencies, and passage categories—was considered as categorical data and converted to numeric data using one-hot encoding scheme in Scikit-learn49. The encoded vector corresponding to each virus-antiserum pair represents virus avidity, antiserum potency, and passage categories of virus and antiserum. The virus avidity of an isolate is represented by a binary sparse vector of length equal to the number of unique virus isolates in the training dataset, wherein all entries are ‘0’ except a ‘1’ at the position of that isolate in an array of all the virus isolates sorted by their collection dates, names, and then passages. A similar procedure was followed to represent the antiserum potencies corresponding to antisera. For instance, if the training dataset contains 100 unique virus isolates and 10 unique antisera and considering the two passage categories (cell/egg) for isolates corresponding to both virus and antiserum, the one-hot encoding corresponding to each virus-antiserum pair will result in a binary vector of length 100 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 114. Hence, the one-hot encoding scheme resulted in a sparse binary vector of length equal to the number of categories in each metadata information for the corresponding virus-antiserum pairs in the training dataset. It is worth noting that when predicting the antigenicity of a circulating virus isolate against an antiserum, the virus avidity is represented by a zero vector. This is because the virus itself is not available during the model’s training process under the seasonal framework.Training, validation, and test datasetsThe compiled dataset consisted of 37 influenza seasons from 2003NH to 2021NH. For each test season \(s\), the training dataset includes the NHTs corresponding to past virus-antiserum pairs starting from the earliest season 2003NH to the most recent season \(s-1\), while the test dataset includes NHTs of the isolates circulating in the test season \(s\) paired with the past antisera. The training and test data for each season are described in Supplementary Fig. 2a.We selected four seasons from 2012NH to 2013SH as validation seasons, which were used for model optimization. The next 14 seasons from 2014NH to 2020SH were selected as test seasons for model evaluation. This selection was based on the stable performance of a baseline model (explained in the next section) over these seasons. Note that virus-antiserum pairs available for the 2021NH season were very limited (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Thus, this season was excluded from the analysis to allow reliable model evaluation. Unlike prior works21,46,50,51 that used the entire dataset (including test seasons) for model optimization, our model was optimized solely using the data of past seasons to prevent data leakage issues52 that could inflate model performance46.AdaBoost modelIn the designed AdaBoost17,18 model, the encoded genetic difference at each site of the HA1 protein sequences was treated as an input feature that nonlinearly contributes toward the computation of the NHT. The remaining features of the AdaBoost model consist of binary identifiers for the virus and antiserum related metadata information, including virus avidity, antiserum potency, and their passage categories (Fig. 1c). The designed AdaBoost model is an ensemble of sequentially trained decision trees employing a boosting technique, where each subsequent decision tree seeks to rectify errors present in the preceding decision tree by assigning more weight to training data samples with large errors. At each splitting node of a decision tree, the candidate set of features is a random subset of the features (including encoded genetic differences at each site of the HA1 protein sequences and one-hot encoded metadata information). The predicted NHT by the AdaBoost model is the sum of the weighted predicted NHTs by an ensemble of decision trees.The baseline model was based on the AdaBoost model with default hyperparameters within the module AdaBoostRegressor in Scikit-learn49, which consists of the following hyperparameters: n_estimators = 50, learning_rate = 1.0, loss = linear, base_estimator = decision tree with a hyperparameter of max_depth = 3. We used a random seed equal to 100 for reproducibility. No metadata information was provided to this model and a binary encoding scheme was used. Hence, in this case, NHTs were predicted based on only the binary encoded genetic difference at each site of the HA1 protein sequences of the virus-antiserum pair.To optimize the AdaBoost model, we performed hyperparameter optimization independently for each of the 92 amino acid mutation matrices as well as for binary and one-hot encoding. We considered two hyperparameters in the module AdaBoostRegressor in Scikit-learn49 with each hyperparameter optimized over a search space defined as follows: n_estimators49—ranging from 10 to 1000 in steps of 10; and learning_rate49 ranging from 0.1 to 1.5. We set the estimator hyperparameter of the AdaBoostRegressor to DecisionTreeRegressor with its two hyperparameters optimized over a search space defined as follows: max_depth49—ranging from 1 to 10000 in steps of 10; and max_features49— ranging from 0.1 to 1. The values of hyperparameter learning_rate49 and max_features49 were sampled from a uniform distribution, while the rest of the hyperparameters were sampled from a quantized uniform distribution53. Bayesian optimization procedure termed as the Tree of Parzen Estimator (TPE)53 under module hyperopt53 was used to automate the process of hyperparameter optimization over 100 runs on the defined search space. The hyperparameter optimization of the AdaBoost model (with binary encoded genetic data and including all metadata features) significantly improved its performance from MAE of 1.091 to 0.759 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Further, depending on the choice of the mutation matrix the MAE varied between 0.835 to 0.750 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). This performance variation occurs because each mutation matrix incorporates specific amino acid attributes. The optimized AdaBoost model consisted of genetic difference encoded using the best-performing amino acid mutation matrix, GIAG01010119, and the hyperparameters were set as follows: n_estimators = 230, learning_rate = 1.393, max_depth = 1860, and max_features = 0.394. To ensure reproducibility, we maintained a fixed random state of 100 for each Python package across all simulations.Performance metricsTo assess the performance of the developed model in a particular season, we computed the MAE between the measured \(d\) and predicted \(\hat{d}\) NHTs as$${{\mbox{MA}}}{{{\mbox{E}}}}_{S}=\frac{{\sum }_{\left(i,j\right)\in S}\left|{d}_{{ij}}-{\hat{d}}_{{ij}}\right|}{{{\#}}(S)}$$Here, \(S\) denotes the set of virus-antiserum pairs \((i,j)\) in a season and \(\#(S)\) represents the cardinality of the set \(S\).To compute the average performance of the model over \(N\) test seasons, we used the weighted average of the \({{{{{\rm{MA}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}_{{S}_{n}}\) obtained for the season \(n\), with the weights equal to the cardinality of the dataset in the season \(n\). This is given by\({{{\mbox{Average}}}}\,{{{\mbox{MAE}}}}=\frac{{\sum }_{n=1}^{N}\#({S}_{n}){{{\mbox{MA}}}}{{{\mbox{E}}}}_{{S}_{n}}}{{\sum }_{n=1}^{N}\#{ (S_n)}}\)To compute the classification scores, the NHTs were converted to binary labels using a threshold of 2 antigenic units4,21 (equivalent to 4-folds change in HI titers). Thus, a virus-antiserum pair was classified as either antigenic variant (NHT > 2) and assigned a binary label ‘1’ or antigenically similar (NHT ≤ 2) and assigned a binary label ‘0’. The ability of the model to classify antigenic variants was then determined using standard classification metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, MCC, and AUROC. Similar to MAE, the classification performance of the model across seasons was computed using a weighted average. Note that the classification threshold can be chosen to improve the classification performance for either antigenic variants or antigenically similar virus-antiserum pairs, considering the target problem. For example, in the scenarios when both sensitivity and specificity are equally important, the threshold can be optimized to maximize Youden’s index (sensitivity + specificity – 1) averaged over the most recent three seasons for a given test season (Supplementary Fig. 5b).Alternate modelsTo benchmark the performance of the AdaBoost model for H3N2 antigenic characterization, we compared it with alternate methods. These included a linear method (NextFlu substitution model7), two ML methods (RF22 and XGBoost23), and two neural network methods (MLP24 and ResNet24). The implementation details of these methods are provided below.Linear prediction model (NextFlu): The NextFlu substitution model, a well-known linear model for antigenic prediction, was employed to benchmark our model’s ability to capture nonlinearities in the genetic-to-antigenic mapping. In the original work7, this model was evaluated under a non-seasonal framework. We adapted its implementation (available at https://github.comextstrain/augur/blob/master/auguriter_model.py) to fit our seasonal framework (Fig. 1a) and input data format. Our adapted version, like the original, did not incorporate passage information, and modeled normalized HI titers (NHT) as a linear combination of genetic difference, virus avidity, and antiserum potency.Machine learning and neural network models: For the RF model, we used the module RandomForestRegressor in Scikit-learn49. For the XGBoost model, we used module XGBRegressor in XGBoost23. For the MLP and ResNet models, we used TensorFlow54 to implement the architectures used in ref. 24., where the MLP architecture is defined as$${{{{{\rm{MLP}}}}}}({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}})={{{{{\rm{Linear}}}}}}({{{{{\rm{MLPBlock}}}}}}(\ldots ({{{{{\rm{MLPBlock}}}}}}({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}))))$$$${{\mbox{MLPBlock}}}\left({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}\right)={{\mbox{Dropout}}}({{\mbox{LeakyReLU}}}({{\mbox{Linear}}}({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}})))$$and the ResNet architecture is defined as$${{\mbox{ResNet}}}\left({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}\right)={{\mbox{Prediction}}}({{\mbox{ResNetBlock}}}(\ldots {{\mbox{ResNetBlock}}}({{\mbox{Linear}}}({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}))))$$$${{\mbox{ResNetBlock}}}\left({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}\right)={{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}+{{\mbox{Dropout}}}({{\mbox{Linear}}}({{\mbox{Dropout}}}({{\mbox{ReLU}}}({{\mbox{BatchNorm}}}({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}})))))$$$${{\mbox{Prediction}}}\left({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}\right)={{\mbox{Linear}}}({{\mbox{ReLU}}}({{\mbox{BatchNorm}}}({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}})))$$where, \({{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}=[{x}_{1}\ldots {x}_{j}]\) is a feature vector of \(j\) features corresponding to a single data sample. Here, ‘Linear’ indicates a fully connected neural network layer, ‘Dropout’ layer is used for regularization to reduce overfitting that makes the input equal to zero of a few nodeseurons in a layer, ‘BatchNorm’ layer normalizes the outputs such that the mean is close to zero and the standard deviation is close to one, and rectified linear unit ‘ReLU’ and ‘LeakyReLU’ indicate nonlinear activation functions defined as﻿$${{\mbox{ReLU}}}\left({x}_{j}\right)=\max (0,\, {x}_{j})$$$${{{{{\rm{LeakyReLU}}}}}}\left({x}_{j}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{c}\begin{array}{cc}{x}_{j} & \;{\rm {if}}\;{x}_{j}\ge 0\end{array}\\ \begin{array}{cc}\alpha {x}_{j} & {\rm {if}}\;{x}_{j} \, < 0\end{array}\end{array}\right.$$For a fair performance comparison against the AdaBoost model, we optimized the hyperparameters of these models to minimize the average MAE over four validation seasons (2012NH to 2013SH). For optimization of the RF model, we used 92 mutation matrices in the AAindex219 database as well as binary encoding. We found that the selection of mutation matrices had a relatively minor effect on the performance of the model (Supplementary Figs. 3c, 10). Based on this observation, we used nine mutation matrices (obtained by combining the set of top five mutation matrices for AdaBoost (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and RF models (Supplementary Fig. 10) for optimizing the remaining models (XGBoost, MLP, and ResNet). As for the AdaBoost model, a Tree of Parzen Estimator (TPE)-based Bayesian optimization procedure53 under module hyperopt53 was used to automate the process of hyperparameter optimization over 100 runs for the RF and XGBoost models, and the same procedure under module optuna55 was used over 50 runs for the MLP and ResNet models on their defined search space of hyperparameters (Supplementary Table 1). The optimized models include optimal values of their hyperparameters (Supplementary Table 1) for the top-performing mutation matrix (AZAE970101 for RF, GIAG010101 for XGBoost, WEIL970102 for MLP, and MUET010101 for ResNet) and their performance was then evaluated over 14 test seasons (Supplementary Fig. 6).Antigenic cartographyTo observe antigenic drift of IAV H3N2 isolates across seasons (Fig. 3a), we performed antigenic cartography of these isolates using R’s (version 4.2.0) Racmacs package56 (version 1.1.35). Racmacs uses the multidimensional scaling procedure, proposed in ref. 2., to position virus isolates and antisera on a lower-dimensional space (2D in our case) based on their HI titers. The 2D coordinates of virus isolates were obtained using default settings of Racmacs with 1000 optimizations and setting parameter minimum_column_basis to ‘none’.Feature importance scores of the AdaBoost modelIn the AdaBoost model, the feature importance scores depend on the base estimator, which is a decision tree in the proposed model. First, the importance of a feature in each decision tree is determined by how much that feature contributes to increasing leaf purity through variance reduction22. The importance scores from each tree are subjected to a weighted average calculation and normalized to a sum of one. The relatively high scores indicate more important features. We computed feature importance scores for all HA1 sites in the proposed AdaBoost model using the built-in function feature_importances_ in Scikit-learn49. To compute these scores, the AdaBoost model was trained on subsets of training data from 2003NH to \(x\) (\(x\) ranges from 2014NH to 2020SH). For each subset, out of the 329 HA1 sites, we selected the top 20 sites corresponding to the highest feature importance scores.Statistical significance of epitope enrichment in top sites (P-values)Epitope enrichment in the 30 important sites, identified using feature importance scores across seasons (Fig. 4), was calculated using a \({{{{{\rm{P}}}}}}\) value. It represents the probability of observing at least \(i\) sites out of \(j\) epitope sites in the set of important sites, where the set of important sites comprises 30 sites out of a total of 329 HA1 sites. Mathematically, this can be written as$${{{{{\rm{P}}}}}}={\sum }_{q=i}^{\min (j,n)}\frac{\begin{array}{cc}\left(\begin{array}{c}j\\ q\end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}329-j\\ 30-q\end{array}\right)\end{array}}{\left(\begin{array}{c}329\\ 30\end{array}\right)}$$The null hypothesis that \(i\) epitope sites were observed in the 30 important sites by a random chance was rejected if \({{{{{\rm{P}}}}}} \, < \, 0.05\).Structural analysisWe used Pymol (www.pymol.org) for representing the identified important sites over the three-dimensional HA structure of IAV H3N2 A/Brisbane/10/2007 (available in the Protein Data Bank; PDB ID: [6AOU]). To calculate the distance between an epitope and an identified important site that did not lie in any known epitope, we measured the 3D distance between the carbon-alpha of each epitope site and that of the identified site. The identified site was considered close to the epitope if the calculated distance was less than eight Angstroms for at least one of the epitope’s sites.Web applicationUsing streamlit (https://streamlit.io), we have developed a web application that provides an easy-to-use GUI for applying our model to perform seasonal antigenic prediction for IAV H3N2. With this web application, users can directly input full-length (329 amino acids) HA1 sequences of test virus-antiserum pairs and corresponding (optional) metadata information, or they may choose to upload the same data for multiple virus-antiserum pairs using a CSV file. Based on the season of the virus isolates being tested, the web application allows the user to select the appropriate model trained up to (but excluding) the test season.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article. Data availability The antigenic HI titers data for IAV H3N2 were obtained from biannual reports published by the Worldwide Influenza Center at the Francis Crick Institute, London12. The antigenic HI titers data for IAV H1N1 were obtained from the published dataset35. The corresponding HA protein sequences for IAV H3N2 and H1N1 were downloaded from the GISAID13 and the IVR14 databases. Supplementary Data 1 provides information on the virus-antiserum pairs of IAV H3N2 used in this analysis. It identifies the specific HI data from the Crick WIC reports12 and the HA protein sequence data from the GISAID13 and the IVR14 databases. The three-dimensional HA structure of IAV H3N2 A/Brisbane/10/2007 (PDB ID: [6AOU]) used in this analysis was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org). The amino acid mutation matrices were obtained from AAindex19 database. All data used in this work is publicly available as of the date of publication. Source data are provided in this paper.

It spread globally and has been reported in non-avian species including, and most recently in dairy cattle. This has led to widespread concern. On 24th April 2024, WHO, FAO and WOAH published a joint risk assessment.

Facebook Twitter Print Email No sign yet of H5N1 bird flu spreading between humans, says WHO chief 8 May 2024 Health The H5N1 avian influenza virus has so far shown no signs of adapting to allow human-to-human transmission, the UN health agency said on Wednesday, urging continued surveillance. So far, one human case has been reported in the United States since the outbreak of bird flu among the millions of dairy cattle across the country. At least 220 people are subject to monitoring and at least 30 have been tested.“However, many more people have been exposed to infected animals, and it is important that all those exposed are tested or monitored and receive care if needed,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the UN World Health Organization (WHO), said at his regular press briefing.“So far, the virus does not show signs of having adapted to spread among humans, but more surveillance is needed,” he urged.Pasteurisation kills the virusThe WHO chief also said that though the virus has been detected in raw milk in the US, “preliminary tests show that pasteurisation kills the virus”.“WHO’s standing advice in all countries is that people should consume pasteurised milk,” he highlighted. Tweet URL Pasteurisation is a heat treatment process for milk that reduces the numbers of possible pathogenic microorganisms to levels at which they do not represent a significant health hazard. It also extends the usable life of milk.Public health risk ‘low’ Tedros also noted that based on the available information, WHO continues to assess the public health risk posed by H5N1 avian influenza to be low and low-to-moderate for people exposed to infected animals.He added that the agency has a system for monitoring influenza globally through a network of centres in 130 countries, seven collaborating centres and 12 reference laboratories with the capacities and biosafety requirements to deal with H5 viruses.“We also have the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework to support the rapid development and equitable distribution of vaccines in case of an influenza pandemic,” he said.H5N1 spreadIn recent years, H5N1 has spread widely among wild birds, poultry, land and marine mammals and now among dairy cattle.Since 2021, there have been 28 reported cases in humans, although no human-to-human transmission has been documented.The outbreak in the United States has so far infected 36 dairy herds in nine states. ♦ Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic. ♦ Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.

The same subtype of bird flu is also spreading in other countries, in what experts are calling a “global pandemic for animals”. US public health officials have been monitoring dairy cow herds, as well as beef and milk products around the country since the first outbreak in cows was reported in March. So far, the US is the only country to have reported bird flu in cattle, but there are fears that it could pose a serious threat to humans, too. In April, a Texas farm worker contracted the virus in what is believed to be the first-ever transmission of the virus from a mammal – in this case, cattle – to a human. Thankfully, he suffered only mild conjunctivitis – an infection in the eye – and has since made a full recovery. The US’s first-ever bird flu case in a human was reported in 2022 when a poultry farm worker in Colorado was exposed to infected chicken. He reported only fatigue as the main symptom. However, bird flu can be extremely dangerous for humans. Since the virus – also known as Avian Influenza – was first detected nearly three decades ago in China, some 860 people have been infected by birds in 23 countries, including China, Egypt, Vietnam and Turkey, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Of those, 463 people died from the virus, giving a huge 52 percent death rate. So far, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected the virus in more than 200 cows, 9,000 wild birds and some 90 million chickens across the US. On Friday last week, Canada began implementing stricter import checks for US cattle, following similar measures in Colombia. So how is bird flu spreading, and could it become a more serious threat to humans? What is bird flu? Bird flu is a viral infection that primarily affects birds. Some strains of bird flu can, however, also be infectious to other animals, including humans. Bird flu belongs to the Influenza A group, one of four types of influenza, and the only one known to cause flu pandemics. There are also subtypes of avian influenza. Three of these – H5N1, H5N6 and H7N9 – have been found to cause illness in humans as well. While the letters in the names of these subtypes refer to a combination of proteins found in bird flu, the numbers indicate the subtype. The first and best-known subtype of bird flu is H5N1, which was first identified in domestic geese in the Guangdong province of southern China in 1996. This is the subtype of bird flu which is currently affecting birds and cattle in the US. In birds, the virus is likely to cause severe disease and death. Cows, particularly older ones, have displayed symptoms such as reduced appetite and lactation when infected. “This particular strain of the H5N1 virus has been causing a global pandemic for animals – the term is an epizootic disease – and it has affected a lot of domestic poultry production,” said Meghan Davis, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and trained dairy veterinarian. How widespread is bird flu among cattle in the US? Since late March, H5N1 has been reported in around 200 animals in 36 dairy cattle herds in the US states of Colorado, South Dakota, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, Idaho, Texas, Ohio and New Mexico. Some experts suspect that the outbreak may have begun to spread to cows before March – even as early as late 2023 – but was not reported. “What we don’t know is just how widespread this might be”, said Davis. “This is something where we need lots of surveillance, lots of eyes on this, lots of different ways of looking at the challenge.” Could bird flu spread to cattle in other countries? Although there have been no confirmed cases of bird flu in cows beyond US borders so far, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that there is a risk of it spreading internationally through the movement of migratory birds. “With the virus carried around the world by migratory birds, certainly there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected,” said Wenqing Zhang, head of WHO’s Global Influenza Programme, at a news briefing in Geneva in late April.

H5N1 is described by the CDC as “highly pathogenic”, meaning it is “strongly able to cause disease”, in birds. But it has also proved to be deadly to humans in past cases. Only 860 people around the world have contracted the virus since it was first discovered in 1996, but more than half of those have died from it, according to the WHO. Farm workers or others in direct contact with infected animals are most at risk. Beyond that, humans are unlikely to be able to transmit the virus to each other, although there was one suspected case of human-to-human transmission in Indonesia in 2006. In humans, bird flu can cause a range of symptoms within two to eight days after infection. This ranges from fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches, to more severe effects such as pneumonia and organ failure. How do we treat bird flu in humans? There is no vaccine for bird flu in humans. Infected people are typically prescribed antiviral medication such as oseltamivir or zanamivir to manage the symptoms. Health authorities including the CDC recommend administering such drugs as soon as symptoms begin. How do farmers deal with outbreaks of a virus? In most parts of the world, farmers cull animals which have been exposed to an outbreak of a deadly virus such as bird flu. Early in April, for example, a poultry farm in Texas destroyed 1.5 million chickens to curtail the spread of bird flu. So far, there have been no reports of cattle being culled. This is because bird flu has so far not been as deadly in cows as it has in chickens and turkeys, said Andrew Stevens, assistant professor of agricultural and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “In this setting, culling would be an extreme and costly step to prevent further spread of the disease. This is especially true because we don’t yet have as good a sense of how contagious the bird flu virus is between cattle,” he said. How is bird flu transmitted to farm animals and humans? Bird flu can be spread by wild birds and waterfowl such as ducks and geese through their droppings or secretions such as saliva. When poultry or other animals scavenge environments which have been contaminated or have come into contact with infected birds, they can catch the virus too. Infected wild birds may also be present on farms and come into contact with water or feed that cows consume, although researchers are still studying such potential modes of transmission, said Davis. In cattle, it is still not fully understood how the virus passes from one cow to another, but traces of the virus in milk suggest a heavy viral load can often be found in the mammary glands. Higher viral load in milk compared with respiratory tracts of cows may also point to the routes of exposure of the virus. Scientists suspect, therefore, that the virus spreads when cows are milked, as equipment may become infected or the virus may become aerosolised – suspended in the air – during cleaning. Humans who have close or prolonged contact with farm animals or wild birds can become infected when the virus enters their system via the eyes or mouth, or when droplets or small aerosol particles are inhaled via the nose. Can you contract bird flu from milk and beef products? Since April, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tested 297 milk products, including milk, cottage cheese and sour cream. Traces of the virus were found in 20 percent of an initial 96 samples but additional testing has confirmed that pasteurisation – a heating process used by farmers to screen out harmful pathogens and bacteria from farm products – kills the virus, removing the danger for consumers. Experts and public health authorities including the CDC strongly advise people to only consume pasteurised dairy products, not just because of avian flu but also to avoid bacterial infections such as salmonella and brucella. Beef samples tested by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have so far tested negative for bird flu, but official advice from the FDA remains against consuming raw beef. Aren’t all dairy products pasteurised? There is a growing movement against food regulation, seen by some in Western countries such as the US as a symbol of freedom. In 2015, for example, Wyoming passed the Food Freedom Act which allows farmers to sell raw milk and other farm goods directly to customers. Australia, the only country apart from Canada with a blanket ban on raw milk sales, also has a growing “Raw Milk Movement” which advocates for regulated distribution of unpasteurised products. Such regulations would include hygienic production and packaging of the milk, as well as testing for active harmful pathogens. While 30 US states allow sales of raw milk, federal law prohibits the distribution of unpasteurised milk across state lines. Additionally, milk from sick cows must be discarded completely under federal law. In cases where raw milk has been packaged before cows are found to be ill, however, products with traces of the virus could still make it to store shelves. Although such a study has not been conducted on humans due to research ethics, US studies of cats which consumed raw milk infected with H5N1 showed that the cats became sick or even died as a result. How are the authorities in the US responding to the bird flu outbreak? Experts and public health authorities such as the CDC say they have been studying bird flu for decades now, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to positive shifts in terms of preparing for outbreaks. Regulatory authorities are also stepping up surveillance of viruses. In late April, the USDA began to require all dairy cattle moving between states to be tested for bird flu. However, testing at farms within state boundaries is still only done on a voluntary basis, which may not be enough to curb the spread of the virus, said Davis. “What I would like to see happen is a switch from what we would consider to be more passive surveillance where we are waiting on farmers and workers to tell us that they’re having a problem, to a more active surveillance where we’re really trying to understand the scope of the problem,” she said. One way to do this is through antibody serology testing, she said, whereby samples of blood or saliva are taken from a human and tested to detect whether their immune system has been exposed to the virus recently. Another form of testing is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which typically uses more invasive nasal swabs to determine if a person is currently infected and may not be best suited for those who are asymptomatic or have not had very high exposure to a virus, said Davis. Rural populations in the US may especially be at a disadvantage during the outbreak, as they can lack access to healthcare services and personal protective equipment, she added. Medical centres may be far away and these populations may be unable to afford services. “And if they [farmers] are not interested in having cows tested, then would the workforce even have the opportunity to get tested? That’s unclear,” she said. How are other countries reacting to the US bird flu crisis? In late April, Colombia became the first country to limit trade with the US because of bird flu in cows. It has restricted imports of beef and beef products from states where cows have tested positive for the virus. Mexico, a major market for US beef and dairy products, has also increased surveillance of cattle entering the country for any sign of respiratory distress, the agriculture ministry said. On Friday last week, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency also tightened import controls relating to US cattle, introducing a requirement for exporters to provide negative bird flu test results for lactating dairy cattle as well as mandatory testing of retail milk to check for traces of the virus. Stevens said such measures are important for the long-term sustainability of supply chains. “Although increasing import checks of cattle and dairy products from the US may slightly increase the relative costs of US exports, these costs are small relative to the potential impacts of an import ban or moratorium.” Source: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media NetworkUSU Scientists Share Thoughts on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Cattle and Birds Utah State University sites use cookies.

(Credit: USU/Bronson Teichert) × Download Close Download As the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) from birds to dairy cows continues to unfold, Dr. Tom Baldwin, veterinary pathologist and director of the Utah Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UVDL), wants people to remember a few key things.“One of those things is that this virus does not kill dairy cows, nor is this an infectious disease that means the USDA has to implement mandatory slaughter,” Baldwin said. “It’s also not like some other viruses that cause more concerning problems like cows aborting their calves and it does not cripple a cow’s milk production long-term.”Bruce Richards, assistant professor of animal science and USU Extension dairy specialist, adds that the public also needs to know that pasteurized milk and properly cooked meat are safe to consume.Pasteurization destroys the influenza virus and other microbes in milk. Raw milk has not been through the high-temperature processing of pasteurization and carries a number of potentially dangerous microbes. Baldwin says the reason we began pasteurizing milk was to control the spread of tuberculosis.“And since pasteurization kills those bacteria, it will certainly inactivate flu virus,” Baldwin said.As of May 6, Colorado was the most recent state to report cows testing positive for HPAI. The American Veterinary Medical Association notes that there are 36 confirmed infected dairy herds in nine states, three of them adjacent to Utah — Idaho, Colorado, and New Mexico.In late April, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mandated that dairy cows must be tested for HPAI within seven days of being transported across state lines whether they are going to another dairy or a livestock show.What does HPAI look like in dairy cows?Baldwin said one of the first things dairy farmers have noticed is a change in the cow’s manure. Most dairy cows have very loose fecal material. What farmers report is that infected animals’ manure becomes thicker. Cows also have a sharp drop in milk production.Dr. Carmen Lau, a veterinary pathologist at the UVDL at Utah State University, noted that cows with the virus have a low-grade fever, their milk production decreases, and the quality of the milk changes, becoming thicker than normal. The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has information online about HPAI in cattle and poultry, including instructions about testing animals. A statement issued by Utah’s Assistant State Veterinarian Dr. Amanda Price says dairies that suspect cows may have the virus should move sick animals to a hospital pen and immediately contact their veterinarian.In the case of some illnesses, farmers and dairy workers bring samples they have taken directly to the UVDL for testing. Baldwin says that is not the procedure for suspected cases of HPAI. The state covers the cost of the test, but samples must be collected by a licensed veterinarian or “an approved sample collector” who has received a case number from UDAF before collecting the required milk samples. Cow Udder Anatomy 101A cow’s udder is comprised of four separate glands. Each gland is called a quarter.“It’s suspected that the virus is being spread by milking machines because they have found in some cows that only one quarter is affected instead of the whole cow,” Lau explains. “It makes us suspect that maybe some milking equipment is not self-cleaning the way it should, and it’s shooting infected milk into that quarter. We don’t have proof of that right now, but this virus isn’t showing any of the classic cow-to-cow transmission.”For example, Lau says pathologists find almost no HPAI virus in nasal secretions, so samples from nasal swabs alone are not reliable for diagnosing the infection and secretions are not likely to be a means of spreading it.Baldwin and Lau say that while being vigilant about animal health is important, they do not advise testing animals that are clinically healthy as a random surveillance of herd health.“If you are selling cows that are going across state lines, you test them,” Baldwin says. “Or if it appears you have a disease outbreak, you need to test.”Lau explains that testing healthy animals as a way of looking for disease is discouraged because it is not necessary and because it would consume large quantities of laboratory supplies that are needed to diagnose sick animals, especially if there were to be a large outbreak.Still a Virus Primarily in BirdsA lot of attention is currently focused on cross-species infections, but the virus still primarily affects birds. While it’s technically possible for humans to become infected, Lau says that to date, even workers at poultry farms are rarely infected where there are confirmed cases of HPAI and large numbers of sick and dead birds.Unlike HPAI in cows, the virus is deadly in chickens and some other birds. Ducks are commonly a host species spreading the virus but they often do not die from the infection.Richards adds that wild bird mitigation and biosecurity practices are on the agenda for the free USU Extension Dairy Producer Field Day, on June 4, at the Cache County Fairgrounds. Baldwin and Lau point out that there are other diseases to watch for in poultry.When a backyard chicken owner finds a single dead bird and more do not die shortly after that, it likely was not caused by avian influenza. But in a flock of 25 birds, if a quarter or half of them die over a week, it is possible that HPAI is the cause. In some cases, the numbers are more drastic.“When you suddenly find 20 of them dead in a day, that’s avian influenza,” Baldwin said. He adds that hotter summer temperatures will likely reduce the number of infections because the virus does not thrive in very warm temperatures. Also, fewer migratory birds that transport the disease travel through and stop in Utah in the summer. However, the virus will not be gone, and there will likely be another surge of cases in the fall as more birds migrate and temperatures decrease.

The MHA and its partners are monitoring the situation closely with data and resources available: HPAI was confirmed in Michigan on March 29, 2024, and has been detected within 10 cattle farms and six poultry facilities across the state. Only one human case of HPAI has been identified so far, in an individual in Texas, and transmission risk remains low risk to the general public. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for the State of Michigan, released a Public Health Bulletin on May 6 with information about the current situation, five action items and additional resources. According to the USDA, commercial dairy products remain safe for consumption due to the pasteurization process. There is limited information available about whether HPAI can be transmitted through consumption of raw milk, however it is understood that unpasteurized milk can pose serious health risks to consumers due to the presence of other dangerous microorganisms such as Campylobacter, E. coli and Salmonella. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services released a Raw Milk Risks document, which can be printed and shared. Members should refer to the April 24 MI HAN “Clinical Recommendations: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus” for more information, as well as the April 5 CDC Health Advisory. Hospital infection prevention and control and infectious disease providers are encouraged to use the new HPAI Playbook released by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology for additional information on identification, patient care, occupational health, outreach considerations and other supplemental resources.

He is affiliated with the National Mastitis Council and the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. He is a former USDA employee. Partners Colorado State University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Colorado has highly pathogenic avian influenza – also known as HPAI or bird flu – on a dairy farm, the ninth state with confirmed cases. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the virus on April 25, 2024, in a herd in northeast Colorado. This farm is one of 35 dairy farms across the U.S. with verified cases of bird flu in cattle as of May 7, 2024, according to the USDA. Bird flu is not new to Colorado. The state experienced an outbreak in poultry that began in 2022. Since then, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has reported that 6.3 million birds in nine commercial flocks and 25 backyard flocks have been affected by the virus. The most recent detection was in February 2024. But this is the first time the disease has made cattle in Colorado sick. I’m a veterinarian and epidemiologist at Colorado State University who focuses on infectious diseases in dairy cows. I spent many years on a USDA incident management team working on multiple cattle and poultry disease outbreaks, and I’m leading the efforts at Colorado State University to study this novel outbreak. The first cases of bird flu in cattle Bird flu was first detected in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas in March 2024. Colorado State University faculty responded to the outbreak by forming a multistate group with state departments of agriculture, the USDA and other universities to gain a better perspective of how this virus is transmitted between farms and among cows. The team is coordinating the sampling and testing of sick and healthy cows on affected farms to understand which animals are shedding the virus, meaning they are more likely to spread the disease, and for how long. We are also working to identify mitigation steps to help control this disease. Our network of animal health specialists is working with dairy producers and informing them of new data on a weekly basis. Detecting bird flu in cattle In February 2024, veterinarians and researchers began testing the blood, urine, feces, milk and nasal swab samples of sick cows. The virus was detected most frequently in raw milk, suggesting the disease may have been spread to other cows during the milking process. More recent laboratory tests have also detected the virus in cows’ nasal secretions for a short time before the virus presents in their raw milk. In late April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and USDA began testing commercial milk samples. To date, authorities have not detected any live virus in these samples. That’s expected because the pasteurization process, which heats milk to at least 161 degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius) for at least 15 seconds, kills the virus. Pasteurization times and temperatures used in the U.S. are designed to kill bacterial pathogens, but they are working against this virus. Raw milk, as its name implies, is not pasteurized. The CDC has linked drinking raw milk to many foodborne illnesses, including E. coli and salmonella. The presence of the virus that causes bird flu, H5N1, is an additional reason for concern. Dairy producers are required to divert abnormal milk and milk from sick cows from the food supply to protect consumers. In addition to milk, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service has tested samples of commercial ground beef from states with sick cows. No virus had been found in beef as of May 1, 2024. Slowing the spread of the disease At this early stage of the outbreak in dairy cows, researchers don’t know exactly how bird flu spreads in cattle, so recommendations to contain it may shift as more is learned. I have seen many infected cows and they look dull and depressed, similar to how humans feel during a viral infection. Many infected cows have signs similar to humans with the flu, such as a fever. Many dairy producers separate sick cows in hospital pens, away from healthy ones, so sick cows can be easily monitored and treated. Since the virus has been found in nasal secretions in early infection, it’s possible the water tanks for the herds’ drinking water could be a source of infection. Farmers should continue to clean these tanks at least weekly – and even more often in hospital pens – as a best practice. Infected cows can recover The good news is that most cows get better. Like a human with the flu, they respond to anti-inflammatory drugs and oral fluids. A small percentage of cows do get secondary bacterial infections and die or are humanely euthanized. Some cows recover from the infection but stop producing milk and are removed from the herd and usually slaughtered for beef. Because the virus is detected most often in milk from sick cows, our team recommends dairy producers continue following best milking practices on the dairy farm, including disinfecting the cow’s teats before and after milking, even healthy cows. Just one case of human conjunctivitis due to bird flu was reported in a Texas dairy farmworker in late March. The worker was likely exposed through direct contact with milk from an infected cow or from rubbing their eyes with their hands or gloves that had come in contact with contaminated milk. The CDC recommends farmworkers wear personal protective equipment, including eye protection, when in direct or close physical contact with raw milk. How dairy producers can protect herds Viruses can end up on farms through the movement of cattle, people, vehicles, equipment and wild birds. The U.S. dairy industry has a Secure Milk Supply Plan that addresses foreign and emerging dairy cattle diseases like bird flu. The plan calls for increased biosecurity practices on farms during disease outbreaks. Biosecurity practices include limiting cattle movement on and off farms, allowing only required personnel access to cattle, preventing vehicles and equipment from other farms from entering cattle areas, and cleaning and disinfecting vehicles entering and leaving dairy farms. Following these practices should greatly reduce the opportunity for the virus to enter new herds. Birds also carry the virus. They are more difficult to control because of their easy access to feed and water on dairy farms. State and federal fish and game departments and wildlife agencies work with farmers to reduce the risk of diseases spread by wild birds. These include programs to limit the number of birds attracted to dairy farms while respecting rules protecting these species. Producers who observe cows with clinical signs of bird flu should let their veterinarians know so that proper testing can be done to confirm the presence of bird flu. If a test result is positive, the lab that conducts the test must report it to the USDA. As USDA and affected states continue to track the disease, an accurate estimate of affected farms will allow investigators to determine how the virus is spreading from farm to farm – and if we are making progress in containing it.

These forecasts can help with planning and inform messaging to health care providers. Background Influenza (flu) places a significant disease burden on the U.S. population, but the magnitude and timing of flu activity varies from season to season, making the annual impact of flu uncertain at the beginning of each season. Flu forecasting can help decrease that uncertainty by predicting in advance when and where increases in flu activity will occur. Unlike CDC's traditional influenza surveillance systems, which measure flu activity while it is occurring, flu forecasting offers the possibility of looking into the future and better planning ahead for changes, such as increases in flu-related hospitalizations. About CDC's flu forecasting efforts CDC's efforts with forecasting began in 2013 with the "Predict the Influenza Season Challenge," a competition that encouraged outside academic and private industry researchers to forecast the 2013–2014 flu season. Since then, CDC's Influenza Division has collaborated each flu season with external researchers on flu forecasting. CDC has provided forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics while teams submit their forecasts, which are based on a variety of methods and data sources, each week. Currently, CDC coordinates forecasts of flu-related hospitalizations each week which are based on data reported to CDC's NHSN (National Healthcare Safety Network). Prior to the 2021-2022 season, flu hospitalization forecasts were based on FluSurv-NET data. The change to using CDC's NHSN hospitalization data (previously known as HHS Protect) was implemented during the 2021-2022 season because the data from this system can provide a more complete picture of the number of flu hospitalizations in the United States. CDC did not provide flu forecasts during the 2020-2021 flu season because there was too little flu activity to produce stable forecasts. How flu forecasts can be used Flu forecasts can be used to prepare for changes in flu activity, such as increases in hospitalizations. When forecasts accurately predict flu activity, more effective planning of public health responses to seasonal flu epidemics and future flu pandemics is possible. Flu forecasts can inform messaging to health care providers regarding: antiviral treatment allocation, preparation for an influx of flu-related hospitalizations, informing the distribution and placement of health care staff, hospital beds and treatment resources. Flu forecasts can also be used to help guide personal and community mitigation strategies. These can include non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as reducing contact during times of forecasted high flu activity, as well as conveying the importance of flu vaccination prior to forecasted increases in flu activity. Collaborating to understand and improve forecasts While significant progress has been made in the years following the initial competition, forecasting respiratory disease remains challenging. Flu viruses are constantly changing, and every flu season tends to be different from the one before it. CDC and participating teams collaborate to identify the best data, methods, and practices for forecasting in order to support the advancement of the science of flu forecasting, improving its ability to inform public health action. These collaborations are critical to developing a network of forecasters providing results that public health officials can use to guide their work. Examples of these collaborations include CDC's work with Carnegie Mellon University and University at Massachusetts Amherst, which were awarded funding in 2019 to further improve the accuracy and communication of flu forecasts at the national, and state level. CDC, FluSight partners, and stakeholders also gather at the end of every forecasting season to review forecasting approaches, discuss the accuracy of forecasts from the past season, identity overall challenges and successes and plans for future seasons, such as the additions of new forecasting targets. These meetings improve the usefulness of forecasting by providing the opportunity for collaboration among forecasters and public health officials.

Clinical symptoms of influenza virus infections can range widely, from severe pneumonia to moderate or even asymptomatic sickness. If left untreated, influenza can have more severe effects on the heart, brain, and lungs than on the respiratory tract and can necessitate hospitalization. This study was aimed to investigate and characterize all types of influenza cases prevailing in Nepal and to analyze seasonal occurrence of Influenza in Nepal in the year 2019. A cross sectional, retrospective and descriptive study was carried out at National Influenza Center (NIC), National Public Health Laboratory Kathmandu Nepal for the period of one year (Jan–Dec 2019). A total of 3606 throat swab samples from various age groups and sexes were processed at the NIC. The specimens were primarily stored at 4 °C and processed using ABI 7500 RT PCR system for the identification of Influenza virus types and subtypes. Data accessed for research purpose were retrieved from National Influenza Centre (NIC) on 1st Jan 2020. Of the total 3606 patients suspected of having influenza infection, influenza viruses were isolated from 1213 (33.6%) patients with male predominance. The highest number of infection was caused by Influenza A/Pdm09 strain 739 (60.9%) followed by Influenza B 304 (25.1%) and Influenza A/H3 169 (13.9%) and most remarkable finding of this study was the detection of H5N1 in human which is the first ever case of such infection in human from Nepal. Similar to other tropical nations, influenza viruses were detected year-round in various geographical locations of Nepal. The influenza virus type and subtypes that were in circulation in Nepal were comparable to vaccine candidate viruses, which the currently available influenza vaccine may prevent.

There are four different serotypes of this virus, which belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family: influenza A, influenza B, influenza C, and influenza D. Although the influenza A and B viruses are the ones that cause the common seasonal flu outbreaks in people, influenza C infections often cause minor symptoms and are not linked to widespread human flu epidemics. Influenza D viruses affect cattle largely and are not known to be able to infect or sicken humans2. Based on the antigenic characteristics of the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), influenza viruses of type A can be further divided into two major groups, namely low pathogenic seasonal influenza (A/H1N1, A/H1N1 pdm09, A/H3N2) and highly pathogenic influenza virus (H5N1, H5N6, H7N9)3,4. Eleven NA subtypes (N1-N11) and 18 HA subtypes (H1-H18) have so far been identified5.Seasonal epidemics are generally caused by influenza A viruses, including subtypes H1N1pdm09 and H3N2, and influenza B viruses, specifically lineages B-Yamagata and B-victoria6. According to current estimates, seasonal influenza kills between 250,000 and fifty thousand individuals worldwide each year, affecting between 10 and 20% percent of the global population7,8. The influenza A virus undergoes a minor antigenic change, namely antigenic drift from year to year and may also undergo a major changes, termed an antigenic shift as occurred with the emergence of the swine origin A/H1N1 pdm 09 influenza virus, which was considered a major pandemic threat to human health9. Influenza related complications including hospitalization and deaths are often seen in very young, elderly and people with underlying medical conditions10.Similar to the tropical and sub-tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Nepal experiences year-round influenza B, A/H3N2, and A/H1N1 pdm09 circulation, with a peak from July to November. However, the rate of infection transmission reach peak during the post-rain and winter season of Nepal8.As each influenza season is characterized by specific patterns of circulating influenza viruses, the identification and characterization of influenza viruses is essential in order to develop effective vaccines against the influenza strains predicted to circulate in the upcoming season6. Therefore, this study is aimed to investigate influenza cases, to characterize influenza types and subtypes and also to analyze the seasonal occurrence of influenza infection in Nepal.Methods and methodologyStudy design and sample collectionA retrospective, descriptive and cross sectional study was carried out at the National Influenza Center (NIC), National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Kathmandu, Nepal for the period of one year (January–December 2019). The data were obtained from the National Influenza centre for the research purpose on 1st Jan 2020. A total of 3606 throat swab specimens were collected from sentinel site of National Influenza Surveillance Network and NPHL. The samples obtained at sentinel sites were transported to NPHL in a cold chain box and preserved in viral transport media within 24 h where they were kept at 4 °C until processing. According to the WHO case criteria for ILI and SARI, patients included in the study either had pneumonia or influenza-like illness (ILI), which includes fever (> 38 °C), cough, running nose, chills, and sore throat within last seven days11.Sample processing and virus identificationAll samples in viral transport media were aliquoted into two micro centrifuge tubes. One was kept at − 70 °C while the other was utilized for RNA extraction. Using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and following the manufacturer's instructions, influenza viral RNA was extracted. Applied Bio systems TM 7500 Real-Time PCR System and AgPath-IDTM One-step RT-PCR Kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA, were used to identify the influenza virus. First, influenza A and B viruses were screened for in the retrieved RNA. Further classification into subtypes and lineages was done on the sample that tested positive for influenza A/B. Influenza A positive sample were further tested for Pdm A, Pdm H1, A/H3 while samples exhibiting influenza B positivity were checked for B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage. Due to limited supply of PCR kit, only 83 influenza B positive samples were further processed to determine their lineages. The primers and probes used in the reaction mixture for identification of various influenza virus types, subtypes and lineages (H1N1, H3N2, H1N1pdm09, Influenza B, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) were provided by US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the IRR and the assays were carried out according to manufacturer’s protocols. Cycle threshold (Ct) values greater than 40 were regarded as positive in samples12.In accordance with established guidelines and regulations, all methods employed in this study were conducted after obtaining approval from Nepal Health research council. The research procedures followed ethical standards and adhered to the recommended protocols outline in Helsinki declaration.Ethical considerationThis study is a Laboratory based retrospective study conducted at National Public Health Laboratory. Ethical approval was obtained from Ethical Review Committee, Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC ref. no. 1966 on 18 March 2020) and no individual consent from participants were taken as data was extracted from ongoing Global Influenza Surveillance Program with the approval of Director of the National Public Health Laboratory. All the samples were anonymized and only code number generated in Global Influenza Surveillance Program (Nepal) were used for analysis.Therefore, written informed consent is deemed unnecessary for this research as this study was approved by both NHRC and NPHL.ResultDemographic characteristics of patientsDuring the year 2019, a total of 3606 throat swab specimens from 1880 males and 1726 females were tested at National Public Health Laboratory for Influenza virus infection, among which 1213 samples tested positive (33.6%). Gender distribution and clinical findings (SARI or ILI) of samples received and positive cases is seen in Table 1. Table 1 Gender wise participants of Case.Full size tableAge-wise distribution of influenza suspected cases as well as influenza positive was observed higher in age group 15–45 years (Table 2). Table 2 Age-wise distribution of influenza positive cases.Full size tableNational Public Health Laboratory received samples from 73 districts in 2019. However, positive cases for influenza infection were confirmed from 56 districts only. District wise distribution of positive cases is shown in Fig. 1.Figure 1District wise transmission of influenza viruses, 2019 (Map was created independently using ArcGIS Version 10.5, arcgis.com).Full size imagePrevalence of influenza virusAmong 1213 influenza positive cases, Influenza type A accounted for 909 (74.9%) cases of infection whereas influenza type B was found in 304 (25.1%) cases. Among Influenza type A, most positive cases 739 (60.9%) were found infected with influenza A/Pdm09 subtype whereas 169 (13.9%) were positive for influenza A/H3 subtype. Among the 304 cases of influenza B infection, only 83 isolates were further differentiated into lineage and this revealed higher number of viruses from B/Victoria lineage 60 (4.95%) in comparison to B/Yamagata lineage 23 (1.89%) (Table 3). Table 3 Strain and lineage of the influenza virus.Full size tableSeasonal distribution of influenza virusesFigure 2, illustrates the distribution of cases of influenza in different months throughout the year 2019. It can be observed that higher numbers of influenza cases were reported with two peaks in the year 2019, first during the month of January–February and second during the month of August–September. The highest numbers of cases were recorded in the month of January and February. Positivity rate was 53.1% in January, 47.4% in February and 37.3% in the month of September. The least number of influenza positive cases were reported in the months of May, June, July, November and December.Figure 2Month wise analysis of influenza cases in year 2019 (N = 3606).Full size imageInfluenza A/Pdm09 strain was found predominant during the first peak whereas InfA/H3 was predominant during second peak. (Fig. 3) A single case of H5N1 was also identified which was first human case of H5N1 reported from Nepal.Figure 3Influenza subtypes identified in different moths of the year 2019 (n = 1213).Full size imageDiscussionIn Nepal, influenza is one of the major causes of public health problems, yet little is known about its epidemiology. Following an outbreak, the influenza virus has been seen to re-assort with various types of genetic alterations, creating a new strain that may further fuel an epidemic13. According to the World Health Organization, the H1N1pdm09 or H3N2 subtype of the influenza A virus has been co-circulating in the European region throughout the 2018–2019 flu season14. However, either influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 or A(H3N2) dominated (2014/15–2016/17) of influenza season15. Every season, a new strain or genetic variation of the influenza virus reemerges, bringing with it novel antigenic features that may reduce vaccine-induced protection due to strain mismatches between the vaccine and circulating strains. To provide the best protection against influenza infection, it is required to identify and define the novel strain of virus and adjust the vaccine in accordance with the dominant strain. The Early warning response system (EWARS) in Nepal, established by the Epidemiology and Diseases control division (EDCD) in 1997 is a hospital based syndromic surveillance that received weekly reporting of number of cases and deaths of six priority diseases / syndromes including SARI. At present 118 sites are reporting to EWARS. In 2019, 10542 SARI were reported to EWARS from these sites16.During the study period, influenza A/Pdm09 was the most predominant strain (53.1%) circulating in Nepal. A study conducted by Adhikari et.al also reported similar finding according to which pandemic influenza AH1N1 dominated in the year 2009 in Nepal17. However, different from previous study by Upadhayay et al. and Jha et al. which showed influenza A/H3 was responsible for 60.1% and 51.0% of the total infection in year 2014 and 2016 in Nepal respectively8,15. According to a study from tropical Asia, influenza A predominated over influenza B between 2007 and 2013, which is consistent with our study18. In this investigation, we found that the B/Victoria lineage of the influenza type B virus predominated over the B/Yamagata lineage, which was different from the study carried out by Jha et.al in the year 2016 in Nepal15. Although our research reveals that B/Victoria lineage predominated over B/Yamagata which is similar to study conducted by Northern Hemisphere during the 2016–2017 season19. The prevalence rates given in different studies may differ since they were conducted at diverse times and locations.This study illustrates circulations of influenza infection throughout the year with the first peak in January–February followed by August–September. The study conducted by Jha et al. in the past from the same institution also demonstrated that Nepal observes two peaks of influenza infection round the year; first in the month of January and second in the month of July–August15. In our study second peak was observed in the month of August–September rather than July–August which is slightly different from previous study. Similar to our findings, a study from mainland China by Sun et al. showed two influenza activity peaks, one in the winter and the other in the spring of each monitoring year20. In contrast, the temperate region of the Japanese mainland only suffers a single surge in influenza activity during the winter months21. Numerous research looked at the seasonal patterns of influenza, but the mechanisms by which new virus strains arise and propagate are still not fully known but likely include a combination of climatic conditions, susceptibility of the population and virus characteristics22,23. From the perspective of public health, knowledge of the seasonality of pathogens is essential to help determine the timing of interventions, especially in a nation with a variety of climatic and economic conditions24. In this perspective, for optimizing influenza management tactics and for understanding the epidemiology and seasonality of influenza, a good influenza monitoring and surveillance system is crucial25.One of the most remarkable findings of this study was the detection of H5N1 from human, which was the first ever case of such infection in human from Nepal. NPHL confirmed the Influenza A infection from throat swab sample of 21-year-old male patient admitted in Hospital. However, the patient could not be saved and died following respiratory complications on 29th March 2019. The subtype of the virus was tested negative for Influenza A/Pdm09 and Influenza A/H3, which was later confirmed at NIC of Japan, on 30 April, 2019 a WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza to be Influenza A/H5N126,27.Due to several restrictions on this work, including a lack of funding and resources, we were unable to carry out comprehensive genomic characterizations. However, to comprehend the epidemiology and seasonality of influenza and to optimize control methods, effective and ongoing influenza monitoring and surveillance systems are required.Conclusion and recommendationsIn Nepal, influenza viruses have been found all year long in various regions, just like in other tropical countries (Supplementary Information). All forms of influenza viruses are in circulation, with the peak season occurring between January and March. To connect viral genetic changes with antigenic changes, it is required to compare the genetic patterns of the influenza virus throughout time.

La vacas lecheras son un huésped nuevo e inesperado del virus, que hasta ahora se propagaba principalmente entre aves silvestres y de corral en los Estados Unidos desde enero del 2022, con infecciones esporádicas de otras especies. The emergence of this virus in a new animal host impacts a new part of agriculture requiring the development of new processes and trusted partnerships. And the potential for this virus to spread in new or different ways between animals or to people poses new public health challenges. Some have questioned whether public health is able to watch this virus closely enough that it can detect important changes in a timely way. Resumen Lo que los CDC saben CDC has multiple surveillance systems that are used year-round for seasonal flu and other illnesses that help the agency keep its finger on the pulse of the health of the U.S. public. There also are unique systems that focus exclusively on the detection and study of novel flu viruses. Taken together, these systems currently show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, including avian influenza A(H5N1) (bird flu). Qué están haciendo los CDC CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes information on flu activity year-round in collaboration with many partners. CDC is actively looking at multiple flu indicators to monitor for novel flu viruses like A(H5N1), including looking for spread of the virus to, or among, people nationwide. CDC is committed to providing timely and transparent information on unusual flu activity. Detecting Important Changes to the Virus in a Timely Way CDC uses many flu surveillance systems, which provide visibility over whether this virus is spreading in people, and which are being fine-tuned and expanded with supplemental studies and analysis for the current situation. These public health systems are routinely used to detect rare events, like single human infections with flu viruses that usually spread in pigs, but when coupled with monitoring of exposed people and analysis of animal sequences associated with this bovine outbreak, this system is further enhanced to detect transmission and early changes in this virus. CDC monitors influenza activity, including that caused by novel influenza viruses like avian influenza A(H5N1) through the following methods: Monitoring through existing flu surveillance systems Vigilancia de nuevos virus de influenza A Vigilancia virológica: U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System and Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Enfermedades Respiratorias y Entéricas (NREVSS) Red de Vigilancia de Enfermedades Similares a la Influenza en Pacientes Ambulatorios de EE. UU. (ILINet) Red de vigilancia de hospitalizaciones a causa de la influenza (FluSurv-NET) Vigilancia de hospitalizaciones de la Red Nacional de Seguridad en el Cuidado de Salud (NHSN) Datos de vigilancia de mortalidad del Centro Nacional de Estadísticas de Salud (NCHS) Sistema de vigilancia de mortalidad infantil asociada a la influenza Programa Nacional de Vigilancia Sindrómica (NSSP) Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Aguas Residuales (NWSS) ­­­­­­­­­­­­­Outbreak specific activities Human monitoring and testing in states Enhanced flu surveillance Planned epidemiologic studies CDC's flu surveillance is a comprehensive and collaborative effort which includes multiple systems that monitor indicators of flu activity, such as illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to flu. These systems are used to monitor for signals and trends in seasonal as well as novel influenza virus infections. Influenza viruses can undergo abrupt, major changes ("variación antigénica") that result in a novel (new) influenza virus that is different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. This system is also optimally designed to detect a rare eventovel influenza virus among influenza positive surveillance specimens tested at public health laboratories in all states for effective intervention and control measures. Together, the multiple components of CDC's surveillance systems described below can detect this and inform the public health response. Surveillance for Novel Influenza Viruses Human cases of novel flu are nationally notifiable, which means CDC, states and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) agree that cases associated with a novel influenza virus should be reported to CDC and investigated. CDC publicly reports information about these human cases. This is important to facilitate prompt awareness and accelerate the implementation of public health responses to limit the spread and impact of these novel viruses. Vigilancia virológica In all 50 states, more than 100 public health laboratories use a number of different CDC diagnostic tests to detect both seasonal influenza viruses and novel influenza A viruses, including a test that specifically detects A(H5) viruses. About 140 000 of these H5-specific tests are already pre-positioned at the state and local level and another 750 000 tests are available for distribution if needed. CDC also continues to engage manufacturers of commercial diagnostic tests with the goal of having an A(H5N1) test that is widely available if needed. Because influenza viruses are constantly changing, CDC performs ongoing analyses of seasonal and novel influenza viruses to identify genetic changes that might allow for spread more easily to and between people, more serious illness in people, reduce susceptibility to antivirals, affect the sensitivity of diagnostic assays, or reduce neutralization of the virus by vaccine induced antibodies. For this A(H5N1) response, CDC sequenced, analyzed, and publicly posted the full genome of the virus from the human case in Texas and has analyzed hundreds of posted cattle sequences to inform the agency's ongoing public health risk assessment. To date, both the human and the cattle sequences remain primarily avian viruses and lack changes that would make them better adapted to spread between people. Ongoing analysis of specimens received from public health laboratories also serve as an important source of viruses to create candidate vaccine viruses for potential vaccine development, and CDC also analyzes these specimens for susceptibility to influenza antivirals. CDC monitors for unusual increases in flu activity by tracking the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza viruses based on data reported from approximately 300 clinical laboratories located throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia. Data are reported through either the U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System or Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Enfermedades Respiratorias y Entéricas (NREVSS). Surveillance of Flu Illness Activity Red de Vigilancia de Enfermedades Similares a la Influenza en Pacientes Ambulatorios de EE. UU. (ILINet) collects information from more than 4 100 outpatient providers and emergency departments about visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI). Red de vigilancia de hospitalizaciones a causa de la influenza (FluSurv-NET) is part of the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET), which is designed to conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalizations. Vigilancia de hospitalizaciones de la Red Nacional de Seguridad en el Cuidado de Salud (NHSN) collects the number of flu-associated hospital admissions, ICU hospitalizations, and hospital admissions rates from hospitals throughout the United States. Programa Nacional de Vigilancia Sindrómica (NSSP) collects, analyzes, and shares electronic health data received from emergency departments (EDs). By tracking all flu diagnoses among patients in EDs, public health practitioners can detect unusual levels of flu in near real-time. Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Aguas Residuales (NWSS) has more than 600 sites reporting influenza A data to CDC. This monitoring detects but does not distinguish influenza A(H5N1) from other influenza A subtypes nor can it distinguish between human and non-human sources of A(H5N1), including dairy cattle or run-off from affected industries. Together, these systems provide strong insight into flu activity in the United States, and collectively, for the most recent week, they currently show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, including A(H5N1). In response to the outbreak of A(H5N1) in dairy cows and other animals in the United States, CDC is developing additional surveillance and research activities to help address key public health questions. CDC is in ongoing discussions with multiple states about state-led field investigations to explore key scientific and public health questions related to the ongoing outbreak. Los CDC están actuando como coordinadores con respecto a los protocolos de investigación para que la recopilación de datos pueda estandarizarse en todos los estados y sea posible agrupar los resultados. In addition, CDC is maintaining multilingual and multidisciplinary epidemiological field teams ready to deploy to support on-site studies when requested. The purpose of this work, alongside our interagency partners including the US Department of Agriculture, US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health, is to better understand the current outbreak in animals and the public health and One Health implications of the emergence of this virus in dairy cattle. There's more work to do to ensure our nation has the best possible visibility into potential human infections. The dairy industry represents a new sector within U.S. agriculture exposed to this virus, and CDC is in the process of building new relationships and the trust needed to have uniform access to developments in the field, across every impacted state and to provide support where and when needed. That work is urgent and underway. It is imperative that we curtail the opportunities for A(H5N1) viruses to spread further and evolve to pose a greater risk to the public's health. Protecting public health, and in this situation in particular, the health of the people at greatest risk of infection, is a vital priority, and testing is critical in the long term to stay ahead of avian flu. Medidas para el público CDC believes the current risk to the general public remains low; however, people with close or long unprotected exposures (without the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE) to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection. People exposed to A(H5N1)-infected birds or other animals (including people wearing recommended PPE) should be monitored for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Persons who develop any illness symptoms after exposure to A(H5N1) virus infected birds or other animals should seek prompt medical evaluation for possible influenza testing and antiviral treatment by their clinician or public health department. The FDA and USDA have indicated that based on the information currently available, the U.S. commercial milk supply is safe, however, A(H5N1) viruses have been detected in raw milk. The FDA has a long-standing recommendation to consumers not to consume raw milk (milk that has not been pasteurized) or raw milk products. Recomendaciones específicas for farmers; poultry, backyard flock, and livestock owners; and worker protection are also available. More information on protective actions for people is available at Influenza aviar H5N1: resumen de la situación actual.

Accordingly, we genetically characterized Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in 633 ILI and SARI cases by rRT-PCR and WGS. ILI and SARI cases showed H1N1pdm09 prevalence of 20.9% and 23.2% respectively. 135 (21.3%) H1N1pdm09 and 23 (3.6%) H3N2 and 5 coinfection (0.78%) of H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed H1N1pdm09 resemblance to clade 6B.1A.5a.2 and their genetic relatedness to InfA/Perth/34/2020, InfA/Victoria/88/2020 and InfA/Victoria/2570/2019. Pan 24 HA and 26 NA nonsynonymous mutations and novel HA (G6D, Y7F, Y78H, P212L, G339R, T508K and S523T) and NA (S229A) mutations were observed. S74R, N129D, N156K, S162N, K163Q and S164T alter HA Cb and Sa antibody recognizing site. Similarly, M19T, V13T substitution and multiple mutations in transmembrane and NA head domain drive antigenic drift. SARS-CoV-2 strains genetically characterized to Omicron BA.2.75 lineage containing thirty nonsynonymous spike mutations exhibited enhanced virulence and transmission rates. Coinfection although detected very minimal, the mutational changes in H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 virus infected individuals could alter antibody receptor binding sites, allowing the viruses to escape immune response resulting in better adaptability and transmission. Thus continuous genomic surveillance is required to tackle any future outbreak.

Yearly, around 3–5 million people were reported infected with Influenza virus globally causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths2. As of 17 December 2023, over 772 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 causing nearly seven million deaths have been reported globally3.Since, both the virus have the similar route of droplets transmission to infect the upper respiratory tract, short incubation period and similar clinical manifestation, there is always the likelihood of these viruses to cause coinfection1. Its imperative imminence also evident from various published reports of coinfection1,4,5. While H1N1pdm09 emerged as the result of reassortment between Swine, Human and Avian Influenza virus, the origins of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear, although majority of the reports suggest zoonotic origins from animal sources, varying from Bat to Civet with animal to human transmission not precisely defined6. Nevertheless, both these viruses are highly mutation prone and taking the cognizance of the fact, WHO has underlined the importance of continuous periodical monitoring of both these viruses to keep the close watch on any mutational changes in these viruses to initiate appropriate advanced management preparedness including modification in the current vaccine virus7. Due to the similarity in clinical presentation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections, the WHO integrated surveillance of both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A, B and their subtypes using multiplex reverse transcriptase real time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for their detection7. WHO categorized the cases into two syndromes Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) to screen them for detection of Influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Both ILI and SARI cases experience acute respiratory infection with onset of fever ≥ 38 °C and cough for the last 10 days, with SARI cases including additional parameters requiring hospitalization7.In India, very few data of screening of ILI/SARI cases has been published checking prevalence of H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2. An earlier case report has found coinfection of 0.04% from Western, Northern and Southern India1. Even these cases were not reported for genomic characterization of mutational pattern. Further, there is no published data from the state of Chhattisgarh, Central India.The objective of the current study was genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1pdm09 viruses and investigation of their patterns of co-infection in ILI and SARI cases by rRT-PCR, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and bioinformatics analyses for strain identification, genetic relatedness and mutational patterns analyses to describe their possible effect on viral proteins.Materials and methodsSamples collectionState-Level Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur, a government designated state nodal diagnostic and treatment center for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and Influenza surveillance under “ILI/SARI Sentinel Surveillance: A pan-India project” obtained the institutional ethical approval for the current study (AIIMSRPR/IEC/2021/1044). A total of six hundred thirty three (633) ILI/SARI cases visiting AIIMS, Raipur and various district hospitals of Chhattisgarh between 1st July to 30th December, 2022 were included in the study. The combined clinical sample of nasopharyngeal (NPS) and oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) were collected in viral transport media (VTM) after obtaining informed consent from all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s). The combined NPS and OPS samples were processed for following investigation in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.rRT-PCR for Influenza and COVID-19 diagnosis and subtypingThe viral RNA extraction was performed from the collected clinical samples using commercially available QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat. No. 52904) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was used to perform rRT-PCR assay developed and provided by National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, India for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2, Infleunza A and its subtype (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2) and Influenza B and its subtype (Victoria or Yamagata) by using respective primers and probes1,8.Whole genome sequencingA total of thirty nine (39) randomly selected positive samples from 17 ILI and 22 SARI cases including five coinfection (01 ILI and 04 SARI cases) were processed for the respective viral WGS. The cDNA library has been prepared using extracted RNA and Superscript III OneStep RT-PCR (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) along with hexamer random primer at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 50 min and 70 °C for 15 min. Second strand synthesis master mix was subsequently added and kept at 16 °C for 60 min to synthesize the second strand. AMPure XP beads were utilized to purify the complete double-stranded DNA9. Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) was used for library preparation according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, the DNA was tagmented with bead-linked transposomes, followed by eight cycles of amplification of the tagmented DNA with enhanced PCR mix and index adapters. The prepared libraries were then cleaned using 0.9 × sample purification beads and quantified by the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay kit (Invitrogen) followed by sequencing on the MiniSeq platform (Illumina) using paired-end Mid-output Cartridge (300 cycle)10,11.Data assembly and submissionFastQ sequence raw data obtained for all 39 samples in MiniSeq local run manager (Illumina, USA) were processed in the sequential manner for trimming to remove indexes adapter, subsequent mapping with reference sequence and final assembly into consensus sequences using QIAGEN CLC Genomics Workbench version 21.0.4. The Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), (FJ984386, FJ969827, FJ969529–FJ969531, FJ969536, FJ969538, and FJ969540), and SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain NC045512 were used as reference sequence. The thirty nine whole genome consensus sequences of influenza H1N1pdm09 and 5 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and their details and accession numbers are mentioned in Supplementary Table 1.Phylogenetic analysis and variant identificationFor phylogenetic analysis and variant identification, our thirty nine sequences of H1N1pdm09 and 5 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were aligned with forty sequences of the Influenza A various reference clades and the representative sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using the MAFFT (multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform)12. Clade defining sequences were indicated by Next strain platform (https:/extstrain.org/flu/seasonal). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbour-joining (NJ) method with a bootstrap resampling (1000 replicates) protocol by the MEGA-X bioinformatics tool version 10.2.513. The nucleotide substitutions/deletions and subsequent amino acid (aa) change in the sequences were identified with the help of a reference prototype to explore their effect on the protein stability, structure and function.Structure modelling and evaluationThe 3D modelling of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene of the reference H1N1pdm09 sequence was used to study the effect of specific aa mutational changes in the HA and NA gene from the thirty nine sequences. The homology model of HA and NA protein was obtained through the SWISS-MODEL server using template structure (PDB ID: 3UBE for HA and 5NWE for NA). Further, the 3D refine server was used to restrain the model by using the energy minimization process as it effectively escapes any local minima and moves closer to the native protein structure14. After optimization, the stereochemical quality of the obtained model was validated by using the various assessment tools, namely Ramachandran plot and G-factor in PROCHECK15, ERRAT Plot16 and ProSA Local energy profile17 programs available freely from the Structural Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) (http:/ihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES). Subsequently, the modelled structure was imported into the Schrödinger software, and in it, the various mutations of substitution and deletion identified in our sequences were added. The visualization of all the predicted models was done in PyMOL to analyse the mutations and images output.Ethics statementILI/SARI surveillance under “ILI/SARI Sentinel Surveillance: A pan-India project” has obtained the institutional ethical approval (AIIMSRPR/IEC/2021/1044).ResultsA total of 297 ILI and 336 SARI cases were screened for the presence or absence of Influenza A and its subtype H1N1pdm09 and H3N2, Influenza B and its subtype Victoria or Yamagata and SARS-CoV-2 by multiplex rRT-PCR. Gender distribution revealed 53.71% male (n = 340) and 46.28% female (n = 293), with a median age of 38.13 years. Among 297 ILI cases, H1N1pdm09 was detected in 61 cases (20.5%), H3N2 in 23 cases (7.7%) and co-infection of H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 in one case(0.3%) (Fig. 1). Among these ILI patients males were found more affected than females, although the difference was not found significant either in H1N1pdm09 (χ2 = 0.372, p = 0.541, p > 0.05) or H3N2 (χ2 = 0.603, p = 0.437, p > 0.05). On the other hand in 336 SARI cases, H1N1pdm09 was detected in 74 cases (22%), co-infection in four (04) cases (1.2%) and no H3N2 infection (Fig. 1). In SARI cases too, males were found more affected than females, however the difference was not found statistically significant in (χ2 = 0.377, p = 0.539, p > 0.05). Influenza B was not detected in any of the ILI or SARI cases. Thus, overall 163 Influenza A comprising 140 H1N1pdm09 (62 ILI and 78 SARI) and 23 H3N2 (all ILI) cases were detected. These 140 H1N1pdm09 included 05 cases of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 infection also. In both ILI/SARI, Influenza A was found affecting more males (n = 91, 55.8%) than females (n = 72, 44.4%), although difference was not found statistically significant (χ2 = 0.665, p = 0.414, p > 0.05). The average mean age affected was 38.66 Yrs. H1N1pdm09 infection was observed more in elderly patients while H3N2 and co-infection was seen more seen in younger patients (median age 21–23 years) (data not shown).Figure 1Patients diagnosed for Influenza A, B and their subtypes and SARS-CoV-2.Full size imageAnalysis of clinical symptoms revealed that fever and cough was the predominant symptom in all cases followed by sore throat (40.3%), sputum production (36.8%), nausea (33.2%), chest pain (27.2%) and other feature (Table 1). Categorical analysis of ILI/SARI cases revealed clinical features more manifested in SARI cases. Five patients, who presented with co-infection of Influenza A H1N1pdm09 with SARS-CoV-2 were found vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and unvaccinated against Influenza A H1N1pdm09. Among these coinfection patients, one 55 year old male SARI case has succumbed due to H1N1pdm09 Pneumonia for 5 days and ARDS for one day.Table 1 Characteristics symptoms of ILI/SARI cases and laboratory-confirmed influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 positive cases.Full size tablePhylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA gene sequences from all thirty nine isolates of (H1N1)pdm09 together with biologically diverse contemporaneous global Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viral sequences, including sequences recovered in India in previous years revealed that all sequences belonged to clade 6B.1A.5a2. All Influenza A H1N1 strains were genetically related to A/Perth/34/2020, A/Victoria/2570/2019 and A/Victoria/88/2020 strains (Figs. 2 and 3). In the phylogenetic analysis of HA sequences, 12 subclusters (I–XII) were observed, while in NA they observed as ten clusters (I–X) of virus strains. Subcluster genetic closeness was variable: subcluster III was phylogenetically related to A/Sydney/29/2020 while subcluster IV was phylogenetically related to A/Wilconsin/588/2019.Figure 2Phylogenetic analysis of HA gene sequences.Full size imageFigure 3Phylogenetic analysis of NA gene sequences.Full size imageMutational analysis of HAA total of twenty four aa non-synonymous pan signature mutations were observed in all analyzed HA gene.

Apart from these pan mutations, other non-synonymous mutations specific to certain strains clusters were mentioned in Table 3. Notable sole mutation S299A was found confined only in SARI cases forming group II on phylogenetic analysis. All other group specific mutations were present in both ILI and SARI cases (Table 3).Table 3 Neuraminidase aa mutation other than pan mutations and specific to certain viral strains cluster.Full size tableThree dimensional structural analysis of HA and NA protein for our 39 strains were also performed (Figs. 4, 5).

The mutation of S74R, N129D, N156K, S162N, K163Q and S164T appears to significantly changed Sa and Sb antibody recognizing sites helping in better adaptability of the virus for more efficient human transmission.Figure 6(A) Superimposed structures of reference influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic, PDB: 3UBE and mutated HA, where reference structure is highlighted in green and mutated structure in magenta.

These five cases comprising one ILI and four SARI cases were not observed to have any mutational difference in structural and non-structural gene sequences (Table 4).Figure 7Phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strain identified in coinfection with Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09.Full size imageTable 4 Mutation pattern noticed in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.75.Full size tableDiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, the present study would be the first of its nature from central India to report the screening of both Influenza and COVID-19 from a total of 633 cases of ILI (297 cases) and SARI (336 cases) to investigate the etiological speciation, genetic relatedness, mutational characterization and their plausible effect in protein structure and relevant function. ILI cases showed 20.9% prevalence of H1N1pdm09 while in SARI cases, it was found 23.2%. Among 140 H1N1pdm09 cases, five were found coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 to show 0.78% coinfection rate. These coinfection cases included four (04) SARI (1.19%) and one ILI (0.3%). On literature search, 0.04% coinfection rate was reported from western, northern and southern India1. Another recent pan India surveillance study has reported 0.09% coinfection rate in ILI and SARI cases8. H1N1pdm09 viruses identified in the ILI and SARI cases were belonged to clade 6B.1A.5a.2 and were genetically related to vaccine strains A/Perth/34/2020, A/Victoria/2570/2019 and A/Victoria/88/2020. SARS-CoV-2 from five of the cases belonged to Omicron lineage BA2.75.H1N1pdm09 contain two glycoprotein, the HA and NA. HA act as receptor binding and fusion protein while NA ensues receptor destroying activity to facilitate release of progeny virions from infected cells, decoy receptors and prevents virus self-aggregation18. Both plays an important role in host tropism, pathogenesis, transmission and are prime targets of immune response. Thus genetic monitoring of HA and NA may help in understanding viral changes and their effect on host-virus parasite relationship. HA consist of two domains HA1 and HA2. HA1 representing globular head domain consist 327 aa (position 1–327) while the HA2 representing the stalk domain comprising 222 aa (position 328–548). Seasonal Influenza vaccine elicits antibody (Ab) response mainly against HA1 while chimeric HA based universal vaccine elicit Ab response against HA219. Thus, there is all likely possibility that in the event of antigenic drift, the protective humoral immune response generated either by seasonal Influenza vaccine eliciting strain specific antibody against HA1 or chimeric universal Influenza vaccine inducing broadly cross reactive antibodies against HA2 could prove inefficient19,20,21,22,23. Any single aa substitution in HA1 and HA2 may result in antigenic drift. Therefore, identifying these mutations were of utmost significance.In all HA sequences, among 24 pan signature mutations in both ILI and SARI, substitutions at positions S74R, S84N, D97N, N129D, K130N, N156K, L161I, S162N, K163Q, S164T, S183P, S185I, S203T, I216T, V250A, A256T, N260D were found in the head domain HA1 while in HA2 representing stalk region exhibited four mutations of E374K, E451K, E499 K and E506D. These mutations were reported to help the virus for immune escape and plausibly enhanced the adaptability of the virus for high rate of transmissibility19. The five antibody-recognizing sites (antigenic sites) identified on HA protein were Ca1 (residues 169–173, 206–208, 238–240) Ca2 (residues 140–145, 224–225), Cb (residues 74–79), Sa (aa residues 128–129, 156–160, 162–167) and Sb (aa residues 187–198). We had observed six nonsynomous substitution in antibody recognizing Sa sites namely S74R at Cb and N129D, N156K, S162N, K163Q, S164T. These substitution could be the reason of inefficient antibody response19,24. I216T substitution was observed in the receptor binding site (Fig. 5E) and could plausibly alter the adaptability of the virus for enhanced transmissibility efficiency of the Influenza A pdm09 strain to cause outbreaks. The noted mutational substitutions however not likely to alter the overall 3D tertiary structure of HA (Fig. 5A). Previous reports revealed the functional effects of these common mutations in virulence by destabilizing antibody binding site or alter its orientation to the incoming glycan ligand or trigger conformational changes on ligand binding25,26,27. H1N1pdm09 viral strains carrying N156K, N129D/K130N and S162N/K163Q/S164T mutations could lead to antigenic drift and alter the antibody response of the Influenza vaccine19,28. K130N has been suggested to cause decreased receptor binding avidity. SARI/ILI cases analysis of H1N1 mutation pattern revealed some interesting findings. HA novel mutations Y78H, T508K, S523T and G6D, Y7F, P212L, G339R specifically were observed in the H1N1pdm09 strains from SARI cases. Theses mutations could be the probable reason of enhanced virulence of the H1N1 virus enabling more clinical manifestations in SARI cases requiring further study to ascertain their role. Similarly, I96R and C538F observed only in ILI cases requiring further studies to check its specific role. On comparison with WHO recommended egg based vaccine strain Inf A/Victoria/2570/2019 and cell culture based vaccine strain Inf A/Wisconsin/588/2019, except P83S, mutations for HA and NA mentioned in Tables 2, 3 were not inherited in vaccine strains and thus needs to consider for future vaccine candidate specially for Indian population.The phylogenetic analysis revealed an evolutionary pattern of H1N1pdm09 which was found congruent with its isolation period. Interestingly, majority of HA mutational pattern revealed to the pre-established clade 6B and some of the mutation belonged to circulating viruses have fallen into clade 6B.1A, defined by the aa substitutions S74R, S84N, S162N, S164T, I216T, and I295V. The additional aa changes that further characterized to clade 6B.1A.5a (5a) include the HA substitutions N129D, S183P, T185I and N260D. Clade 5a has further diverged into two major subclades: 5a.1, defined by aa substitutions D187A and Q189E in HA and 5a.2, defined by K130N, N156K, L161I, V250A and E506D. Subclade 5a.2 viruses collected after August 2021 have additional HA1 mutation of K54Q, A186T, Q189E, E224A, R259K and K308R. All these substitution specific to 5a.2 found in our sequences confirm the circulation of H1N1pdm09 of clade 6B.1A.5a.2 in Chhattisgarh. H1N1pdm09 viruses belonging to both subclades have circulated during 2021–2022 in different geographic locations.NA on the other hand plays a key role in virion release from cells, decoy receptors and act as an important target for antiviral drugs and antibodies18. The NA amino acid sequences showed a total of twenty six pan signature mutations in both ILI and SARI cases. Among these twenty six pan mutation, NA was reported to have an 16 amino acid substitution (N248D, V106I, N369K, V241I, N44S, I106V, N200S, I321V, I34V/K432E, N386K, L40T, I314M and V13I/V264I/N270K) fixed in H1N1pdm09 virus population from 2009 Influenza pandemic to till 2015 to indicate their biological relevance18. These substitutions were affecting both antigenic and enzymatic properties with several mutations affecting multiple properties. K432E was reported to affect catalytic activity, substrate specificity and the pH optimum to alter antigenicity of NA to enable it to cleave sialosides at low pH during virus entry to enhance virus replication and transmission rate18. Earlier studies have reported the substitution of N386K and K432E in bringing antigenic drift in H1N1pdm09 by inhibiting H1N1pdm09 specific monoclonal antibodies20,29. Substitutions close to the active site were N200S, N248D, V241I and K432E and among these K432E had the largest effect on NA catalytic activity. V106I was also reported to increase low pH activity of NA and also affect Ca2+ dependent thermo-stability of NA. N369K increased the cleavage of fetuin containing α-2,3 linked sialic acid. Dual V241I and N369K mutation were reported to enhance the in-vitro activity and fitness of contemporary H1N1pdm09 viruses in ferrets30. V241I and N369K are the permissive mutation which were reported to be present in > 99.9% of circulating H1N1pdm09 virus to confer virus the robust fitness in acquiring NA H275Y Oseltamivir resistance mutation and correlated with enhanced surface expression and enzymatic activity of the NA protein30. Further, the substitution V264I and N270K were reported to increase the cleavage of α2,6 linked sialic acid18. N248D, N369K and N449D also reported to alter NA surface resulting in loss of binding by human monoclonal antibodies leading to immune escape of the virus20. The biggest change in antigenic relatedness in 2013 was observed with occurrence of K432E and N386K among which the later mutation causes loss of glycosylation site. Analysis of SARI and ILI cases in respect of NA mutations revealed the presence of S299A exclusively in SARI requiring further studies to unravel its role.We have the opinion that the mutations observed in both HA and NA most probably be occurred due to selection pressure either elicited by vaccination or natural viral infection to help the virus in evading immune response. The enhanced mutation in HA and NA in SARI than ILI cases could be the reason of more severity associated with SARI cases. The HA and NA mutational pattern would further prove pivotal in helping researcher and pharmaceutical companies to prepare future vaccine/chemotherapeutic formulation.This study has reported five co-infection cases (0.78%) of SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1pdm09 in one ILI and four SARI cases. One of these SARI cases has succumbed to infection showing the severity of the co infection and underline the importance of early screening of these patients. Earlier studies have also reported coinfection from various countries indicating its global existence and the likely public health threat4,5,31. An earlier study from Northern, Western and Southern India had reported 0.04% coinfection of SARS-CoV-2/Influenza but no mortality1. This shows virus had geographically restrictive evolutionary changes. The likely explanation for the coinfection could be the incubation period of Influenza virus of 1–4 days found similar to the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 varies from 1 to 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 infects the nasopharynx to cause mostly initial mild upper respiratory tract infection followed with further dissemination to the lower respiratory tract to inflict severe lower respiratory tract infection. Influenza virus similarly replicates in the upper respiratory tract and also spread to lower respiratory tract causing complications like pneumonia. Thus, human influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 since having similar initial clinical presentation especially to cause fever and cough, needs to be identified to institute appropriate therapeutic interventions and infection control measures. We have reported SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.2.75) variant in one ILI and four SARI cases with no specific mutational presentation for these clinical conditions. The predominance of omicron BA.2.75 over other omicron (BA.1.1.529, BA.2, BA.2.38, BA.2.43, BA.2.56, BA.2.74, BA.2.76, BA.5.2 and BA.5.2.1) was reported earlier by us11. Among the total 37 mutation detected in spike gene, the signature mutations of T19I and V213G in the N-terminal domain (NTD), S373P, S375F, T376A, and D405N in receptor-binding domain (RBD), D614G, H655Y, N679K, and P681H at the furin cleavage site, N764K and D796K in fusion peptide, and Q954H and N969K in heptapeptide repeat sequence (HR)1 were observed. Various non-synonymous mutations in spike protein have been implicated in virus infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, immunological bypass, decreased neutralizing ability of monoclonal antibodies, high risk of reinfection, treatment failure, and even Omicron diagnostic detection failure11.LimitationThe limitation of the study is unable to sequence all the 140 cases of H1N1 due to financial constraint. We also did not follow up diseases severity pattern in monoinfected or coinfected individual as this study primarily focused on molecular characterization of the mono and coinfected cases. Further we felt five co-infection cases were not sufficient to decide and define specific genetic and clinical correlation. The specific HA and NA mutations in ILI and SARI cases warrants further study to ascertain their pathogenic role. Nonetheless, the finding of the study has provided the first ever data from Central India and could act as the baseline information for surveillance and future studies to understand mutation pattern underwent by both H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2.ConclusionThe present study disclosed H1N1pdm09 strains circulating in Chhattisgarh, India belonged to 6B.1A.5a.2. The regionally acquired mutations encompassing novel Y78H, T508K, S523T and G6D, Y7F, P212L, G339R in HA and S299A in NA domains in SARI cases may be associated with more clinical severity than ILI cases. These mutations allow viral adaptability for local geographical sustainability resulting in an efficient human transmissibility. HA and NA novel mutational pattern of H1N1pdm09 may potentially raise the possibility of antigenic drift resulting in looming threat of immune escape of the virus from vaccine induced monoclonal antibody response. Thus to thwart any possible sporadic outbreak by the mutated virus, it is recommended to vaccine manufacturer to match vaccine virus with circulatory mutated virus for effective vaccine induced immune response. Coinfection cases and one mortality underlines the importance of susceptibility of SARI and ILI cases to COVID-19 infection requiring immediate treatment management to thwart possible mortality. WGS surveillance to monitor mutational changes help in initiating appropriate public health measure in advance before the mutational driven enhanced transmissibility and virulence result in more severe infection and mortality.

The network helps to facilitate laboratory and epidemiologic capacity building for flu and other respiratory disease surveillance. About ANISE ANISE was founded in 2009 and currently has more than 260 members from more than 30 countries working on improving detection, case management, control, and prevention of flu and other respiratory viruses in Africa. The network aims to highlight best practices and the latest research for prevention and control, as well as pandemic preparedness. The ANISE Network is made up of laboratorians, epidemiologists, public health officials, clinicians, veterinarians, researchers, and policy makers. The importance of ANISE in Africa This network is particularly important because while the impact of flu has been well studied in developed settings, flu may have a different impact in lesser resourced settings, like in Africa, due to untreated co-morbidities, malnutrition, and other factors. ANISE builds flu surveillance capacity and helps raise awareness of the impact of flu in Africa ANISE priorities Generate and disseminate data on the burden and epidemiology of flu in Africa. Share and promote use of standardized surveillance methods in the region. Coordinate and provide laboratory and epidemiologic support for the continued surveillance of seasonal flu and for the detection of viruses with pandemic potential. ANISE Network impact ANISE has promoted the use of standardized protocols for surveillance of respiratory illnesses with the vision to estimate flu-related disease and economic burden in the continent, generating evidence-based data to support public health interventions and relevant changes in policy. Another important activity for the network is to facilitate capacity building through collaboration in epidemiology, laboratory, and surveillance efforts. This has been achieved through one-to-one exchanges between members of various participating countries and also through convening workshops on topics such as data management, scientific writing, molecular diagnostic methods, and disease burden estimation. A flu surveillance nurse collects a sample from a child with acute respiratory illness at a local hospital in Rwanda. Collaboration among participating countries has led to important studies such as: Timing of seasonal influenza epidemics for 25 countries in Africa during 2010–19: a retrospective analysis published in The Lancet Global Health in 2023, identifying timing for seasonal flu epidemics for 25 countries in Africa. Severe acute respiratory illness deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa and the role of influenza: a case-series from 8 countries and a supplement published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in 2012 which focused on flu in Africa and included more than 25 articles with original data from Africa. ANISE members can use the network to coordinate with one another and provide laboratory and epidemiologic support to other members.

Domestic Summary In February 2022, USDA's APHIS announced an HPAI A(H5N1) virus outbreak in a commercial poultry facility followed by outbreaks in three U.S. states in commercial poultry facilities and a backyard flock, marking the first HPAI A virus detections in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020. Since February 2022, additional H5N1 bird flu outbreaks have been identified in poultry, including both commercial and backyard flocks in multiple states. The latest bird flu outbreaks in poultry in the United States are available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) webpage at 2022 Confirmations of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Commercial and Backyard Flocks. Preliminary genetic sequence data from some of the H5N1 bird flu viruses obtained from infected poultry suggests they belong to clade 2.3.4.4b, like most of the viruses recently detected in wild birds in the United States. More information is available in CDC spotlight articles. Global Summary From late 2021 to current 2022, the predominant HPAI A(H5) virus subtype causing poultry outbreaks worldwide is A(H5N1), according to WOAH. In December 2021, new HPAI A(H5N1) virus poultry outbreaks [610 KB, 6 pages] were reported in Africa (Niger), Europe (Germany, Russian, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal) and Asia (Israel, Japan, Korea and Vietnam). Ongoing HPAI A(H5N1) virus poultry outbreaks for which there were new reported outbreaks included Africa (Nigeria), Asia (Israel, Japan, Korea, Vietnam) and Europe (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary.) WOAH data collected on 18,620 HPAI A virus outbreaks in poultry between 2005 and 2019 reported by 76 affected countries and territories showed that spread of HPAI A virus among birds typically is lowest in September, begins to rise in October, and peaks in February. Between 2005 and 2020, HPAI A viruses resulted in the death and mass slaughter of more than 246 million poultry worldwide, with peaks in 2006 and 2016, according to WOAH. During the peaks in 2006 and 2016, about a quarter of the world's countries were affected with HPAI A viruses, according to WOAH. Background Outbreaks of avian influenza (bird flu) among poultry occur periodically worldwide. More information is available from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH's) World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID), HANDISTATUS II HANDISTATUS II (oie.int) and U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2022 Detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza webpage. CDC coordinates with the World Health Organization and other international partners to minimize the public health risk posed by bird flu viruses. Both HPAI and LPAI A virus outbreaks occur among poultry sporadically in the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the lead federal agency for outbreak investigation and control in domestic poultry. CDC coordinates with USDA and state health departments on appropriate public health measures and works with animal health colleagues to minimize public health risk posed by avian influenza A viruses.

What is H5N1, and What Is All the Fuss About? Scientists explain how bovine leap moves avian flu virus closer to pandemic potential minute read by Debra Melani | May 7, 2024 Although bird flu (H5N1) has circulated among wild and domestic flocks for 30 years, it has surprised public health experts in the past two years with the longest, largest and deadliest outbreak in history. Either through infection or preventive culling, the avian flu virus has affected a record 90 million domestic birds since January 2022 in the United States alone. Last month, the addition of dairy cattle to a growing list of mammals infected by the avian strain – from skunks and bears to cougars and sea lions – added more urgency to government surveillance of the virus, which has spread to bird populations across the globe. As of May 2, the virus has been detected in 36 herds in nine states, including on a dairy farm in northeastern Colorado. “This raises concerns from a pandemic preparedness standpoint, because the more animals that the virus is capable of infecting, the more likely it is that we could be one of those animals that it becomes efficient at replicating in,” said Jenna Guthmiller, PhD, an assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Only two human cases have been reported with the outbreak so far – a Colorado worker from an infected poultry farm in 2022 and a Texas worker from an infected dairy farm this year. Those cases were mild, and the threat to humans not exposed to infected animals remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The recent avian flu outbreak has taken a huge toll on chickens and the poultry industry, forcing many farmers to cull their flocks and pushing up egg prices. So why the concern about humans? While fewer than 1,000 human cases have been documented in the past 30 years, H5N1 has been highly pathogenic in humans with about a 50% death rate, said Daniel Olson, MD, PhD, an associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases with SOM and of epidemiology with the Colorado School of Public Health and its Center for Global Health. And, as an influenza A virus, H5N1 also has an unusual mutation ability, he said. All influenza viruses (which include A, B, C and D) can change through a process called antigenic drift, where they develop small mutations over time. That’s why modified flu vaccines are produced each year, said Olson, who studies the intersection of viruses between humans and animals. But with influenza A, when more than one virus infects a host, entire segments of the viruses (whether human or avian) can get scrambled up and combined, creating a completely new virus through a process called antigenic shift, Olson said. That new virus can be highly infectious or deadly to humans, he said. “That’s what led to the H1N1 swine flu outbreak,” Olson said. “Most of the big pandemics with influenza happened with antigenic shift, and pigs are the ultimate mixing vessel, so they are able to be infected with a lot of different types of influenza A. If this avian influenza somehow managed to jump into a pig, then that would definitely be concerning.” Signs and Symptoms While rare, human cases with avian flu range in severity from mild to fatal. Symptoms can mimic regular flu (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, shortness of breath). In the most recent Texas case, the dairy farm worker’s symptoms were confined to the eyes and were incorrectly reported as mild conjunctivitis. Pain, subconjunctival hemorrhage and serous drainage were symptoms noted upon exam. Anyone with symptoms should contact a medical provider immediately. Antivirals given within the first hours of infection can reduce symptoms. More information on symptoms. More information on prevention and treatment. Some influenza viruses, such as H1N1 (2009 flu pandemic) and H3N2, that cause seasonal influenza infections in humans came from animals, said Guthmiller, whose lab studies viral spillover and human immunity to influenza viruses with an end goal of developing the first universal flu vaccine. “So those viruses caused pandemics and now have persisted within the population,” she said. What makes the cattle stand out? H5N1’s jump to cows, however, was highly unexpected, Guthmiller said. “Influenza A has never been recorded like this in cows before. There’s the occasional cow infected, but they are not a natural host for influenza A viruses. And so this is really quite shocking to the field.” How the virus was transmitted remains a question being studied, but because high levels of the virus have been found in the cows’ udders, and the infection appears restricted to dairy cows, some focus has been on the milk and milking machines. A CDC report noted that on one of the infected dairy farms, half of the barn cats that drank the unpasteurized milk died, with autopsies finding high levels of the virus in the felines. Also unusual, unlike birds and humans, the infected cows appear to have generally mild or nonexistent symptoms, though some have moderate disease with lethargy and decreased milk production. “And while that’s good for the cattle, that also makes it harder to prevent transmission,” Olson said. “So, likely, these cattle have been infected for some time, and this virus has been spreading across the country among different cattle populations.” Scientists suspect the virus struck cattle as early as December 2023. Is it safe to drink milk? Scientists testing dairy products in stores found DNA evidence of the virus but no sign of active virus, confirming that pasteurization is effective. “As long as it’s pasteurized, I have no concerns,” said Guthmiller, who grew up on a dairy farm. “Influenza viruses are actually pretty fragile viruses, so anything you throw at them, they will fall apart. They can’t get around being heat killed.” “Unpasteurized milk is a different story,” Olson said, referring to the farm cats in the CDC study. “While we haven’t heard of human cases from drinking unpasteurized milk, I’m not going to be drinking unpasteurized milk. And that’s the recommendation of the CDC right now.” Can the outbreak be controlled? Infected cattle present bigger challenges than poultry when it comes to halting the virus spread. “For the avian influenza, if you have cases detected in a flock of birds, you cull the entire flock,” Olson said. That would not be an acceptable solution with the much more valuable cattle. “You have to weigh the risks and benefits, even economic risks and benefits.” The government has already restricted transfers of herds across state borders. Expanding wastewater testing, increasing biosecurity measures and implementing influenza surveillance and vaccination of farm workers (the highest risk population) are also preventive options, Olson and Guthmiller said. But first, officials need to get a better understanding of the extent of the outbreak, both experts said. “The things that concern me is that we don’t have a strong handle on what the breadth of this outbreak is,” Guthmiller said. “There’s also already evidence that it’s jumping back into birds. So now you have a virus that’s somewhat adapted to mammals jumping back into birds, and those birds can go transmit it to other mammals and cause further outbreaks.” Right now, it’s important to remember that the human threat is low, and that a lot is happening on the government front in response to the issue, Olson said. Also, if needed, antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and vaccines being stockpiled are so far reportedly effective against circulating strains, he said. “There will certainly be more information that’s coming in the next few weeks,” Olson said. “And it’s always possible that this one virus just infected cattle, it spread, and there isn’t much more to the story than that. But I think only time will tell whether that is the case.” Topics: Public Health, Infectious disease, Spread the word: Featured Experts Daniel Olson, MD, PhD Jenna Guthmiller, PhD Related Articles Employers Get Firsthand Look at Recovery Friendly Workplace Benefits by Carie Behounek | Nov 5, 2024 ColoradoSPH Dean Predicts a Bright Future Invested in Saving Lives by Christina Abel | Oct 23, 2024 Buckle Up: Flu Season Is Just Around the Corner by Chris Casey | Oct 7, 2024 University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus CU Anschutz Fitzsimons Building 13001 East 17th Place Aurora, CO 80045 info@cuanschutz.edu 303-724-9290 Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Partnerships UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital Children's Hospital Colorado University of Colorado Medicine Resources Employment Ethics and Compliance Freedom of Expression Submit Content Subscribe Sustainability HelpCompass Tools Faculty/Staff Directory A-Z Index Find a Doctor Academic Calendar Events Calendar Media Newsroom Media Contacts Film Requests RSS Feed Contact Us Website Feedback CU System Privacy Policy Terms of Use Accessibility Accreditation Employment Give Now © 2024 The Regents of the University of Colorado, a body corporate.

The USDA said the measures build on a federal order, which took effect on April 29, that called for collecting and aggregating H5N1 test results and halting most interstate movement of lactating herds.The new programs incentivizes personal protective equipment (PPE) for farm workers who interact with infected herds, which now number at least 42. The USDA will also reimburse farmers for veterinary expense associated with infected animals and offset shipping costs for influenza A testing at laboratories in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network."Taken together, these tools represent a value of up to $28,000 per premises to support increased biosecurity activities over the next 120 days," the two agencies said.CDC moves on wastewater surveillanceHHS also announced new funding investments through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) totaling $101 million to mitigate the risk of H5N1."Although the CDC's assessment of the risk of avian influenza infection for the general public continues to remain low at this time, these investments reflect the Department's commitment to prioritizing the health and safety of the American public," HHS said.Although the CDC's assessment of the risk of avian influenza infection for the general public continues to remain low at this time, these investments reflect the Department's commitment to prioritizing the health and safety of the American public.Included in the CDC funds are $8 million in vaccine activities to determine whether current Candidate Vaccine Viruses would be effective and the current strain of H5N1. The CDC will also allocate $3 million for wastewater surveillance.Today Reuters reported the CDC will begin to post data on influenza A found in wastewater in a public dashboard. The news agency quoted Marc Johnson, PhD, a virologist at the University of Missouri who developed a wastewater monitoring system for COVID."I'm not worried about the cows. I'm not worried about the milk. But I'm worried that there are lots of other animals that it can jump to, and eventually it's going to find a combination that can make it into humans if we're not careful," he said.No live virus in commercial milkThe FDA today announced the completion of testing on 297 retail dairy samples; all were found to be negative for viable H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses.Preliminary results had been announced last week. The FDA said it would continue to fund surveillance and research on the safety of commercial milk. The agency also said an additional $8 million is being made available to support FDA efforts to ensure the safety of the commercial milk supply. "This funding will support the agency's ability to validate pasteurization criteria, conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, bolster laboratory capacity and provide needed resources to train staff on biosecurity procedures," the FDA said in a news release.The FDA also continues to advise against the consumption of raw milk."To date," the FDA added, "the totality of evidence—including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of HPAI H5N1 in eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, negative retail sample results to date, and real-world evidence from the last 100 years of the PMO [Pasteurized Milk Ordinance]—continues to indicate that the commercial milk supply is safe."At the same time, the FDA also continues to advise against the consumption of raw milk (milk that has not been pasteurized)."New H5N1 detections Finally Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported yesterday 6 more dairy herds infected with H5N1, raising the total to 42. They are in already affected states: Michigan (4 herds), Colorado (1), and Idaho (1). The number of affected states remains nine.In Michigan, both a dairy herd and a backyard poultry flock in Ionia County were hit with H5N1. That county has reported the virus in cattle previously and, earlier this week, in pigeons.

Experts say there are key scientific and political reasons why the dairy industry was caught off guard by the H5N1 avian influenza virus—and that understanding those factors will be vital to controlling the disease on dairy farms and preventing an outbreak in humans.“The dairy industry has never had to deal with something like this before,” says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a former dairy veterinarian. “This is probably going to be the most important outbreak in my professional career.”After weeks of uncertainty—fueled by the unnerving revelation that the outbreak likely began last December and took months to recognize—the federal government is taking some action. The USDA has mandated testing for lactating cows that are being transported across state lines in the hopes of squashing the spread of the virus, which has so far been confirmed in 36 herds across nine states. One human case has been reported this year, but the infection was mild, and more than a month has passed with no new cases confirmed. Epidemiologists have called for more human testing to better monitor the situation, however. Meanwhile Food and Drug Administration testing has shown that viral particles that were found in pasteurized milk were not infectious, suggesting little threat to consumers.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

And bird flu has been devastating poultry farms around the world for years now. Veterinarians and epidemiologists have been on high alert since 2022, when a new strain began tearing through wild birds and even mammals, killing or forcing U.S. farmers to cull some 90 million domestic birds. How could it take months to notice the same virus was spreading in dairy cows?One reason the outbreak went undetected for so long is that people thought it was unlikely that the virus would jump into cows. Avian influenza is, after all, most common in birds, whereas flus in general have been rare in cows. “The chances of it going from migratory birds to cows were so low,” Poulsen says. “And then it happened.”Dairy farmers typically worry about contagious bacterial mastitis, an infection of a cow’s udder, or bovine viral diarrhea—illnesses the industry is familiar with and knows how to treat. Avian influenza “wasn’t on our bingo cards for the year,” says Emily Yeiser Stepp, an animal scientist and executive director of the National Dairy Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Program. The program, which is housed within a lobbying group called the National Milk Producers Federation, acts as an on-farm social responsibility program for the dairy industry, a mission that includes promoting animal health.The next challenge was connecting the dots to determine what was infecting the cows—which was difficult because the symptoms of H5N1 in these animals weren’t known in advance and aren’t particularly distinctive. Sick cows weren’t eating well and were producing less milk—and the milk that they did produce was sometimes thick and yellow-hued. But none of these symptoms were particularly unusual, says Meghan Davis, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian.“The number-one presenting complaint to call a vet out to your farm is: [your cow is] off feed, and you can’t figure out why,” Davis says. “So it’s not surprising to me that it took a minute to figure this out.”Moreover, only about 10 percent of an affected dairy herd seems to get infected with H5N1. And cows aren’t dying; they bounce back to health within a couple of weeks. “Cows are like walking battle tanks,” Poulsen says. But this is also a very different manifestation of avian influenza than that seen in domestic chickens: H5N1 can blaze through and devastate a flock in days, he adds. Wild mammals that have been infected with avian influenza display serious respiratory and even neurological symptoms such as seizures. In contrast, infected cows are tricky to spot. “You need to look for it; it’s not something very apparent,” says Zelmar Rodriguez, a dairy veterinarian at Michigan State University, who has visited farms with H5N1-infected cows.Because farmers didn’t know they had avian influenza on their hands, the low impact of the disease made it easy for them to shrug off the infection. Once veterinarians pinned down H5N1 as the culprit, the situation became more serious because of the implications for human health. The complications of the dairy outbreak make containing it a challenge, however.Scientists still aren’t certain how avian influenza jumps between cows. Influenzas are typically considered respiratory diseases, yet cows seem to produce the most virus in their udders, so milking machinery could be carrying virus-laden droplets of milk from one cow to the next. Lactating cows can experience discomfort when they are not milked regularly, so all that’s left for farmers to do is to try to increase safety measures in the milking process itself.Adding to the problem, the dairy industry moves tens of thousands of female cattle between states every week, Poulsen says, because the animals grow well as calves in hot, dry environments but produce more milk as mature cows in cooler regions. This movement of sick animals likely facilitated early spread between farms.The USDA has already moved to address this spread: as of April 29, it is requiring that lactating cows test negative for H5N1 before they can cross state lines. Controlling the spread of avian influenza without stopping the complex system of cow movement is a crucial balance, Poulsen says. “We can’t just turn off milk production, and we can’t turn off the supply chain of those cows,” he says.Testing and other monitoring strategies need to be strengthened even for cows staying in one place, however. “I think that we are a bit behind on the surveillance,” Davis says. In particular, she says she’d like to see cows undergo serological testing, which looks for antibodies in blood that are tailored to a specific pathogen and can signify past exposure to that pathogen. She also notes that existing milk-monitoring systems set up for food safety may offer opportunities for better tracking of H5N1, given the virus’s prevalence in milk. In addition, the same wastewater monitoring infrastructure that scientists developed to keep an eye on COVID is also offering insight on where avian influenza is striking dairy cows, as well as other animal infections.Tackling avian influenza in dairy animals poses additional logistical complications. Compared with the poultry industry, the dairy industry is more fragmented, Davis says: the latter is made up of many independent farms rather than large, centralized companies that hire farmers on contract.Another distinction between the industries is that the government has an indemnification system that reimburses poultry farmers for birds that are culled to keep the disease from spreading. By contrast, experts say that killing cows wouldn’t help stem the dairy outbreak because of the animals’ lower infection rate and milder symptoms. Yeiser Stepp isn’t sure yet what financial strategy makes the most sense for the farmers who work with her. She’s also a herd owner who has cows based in states that are not reporting H5N1 cases, and she says her biggest concern is about the fees for calling a vet out to the farm more regularly.Rodriguez says that at present he thinks the priority needs to be strengthening biosecurity measures that can protect both cows and the humans who care for them. Existing recommendations hold that workers should be wearing gloves during the milking process, but doubling down on this guideline and adding additional personal protective equipment such as disposable coveralls, face shields, masks and goggles are important steps for keeping the virus out of humans. Currently, dairy workers are among the people who are most at risk of avian influenza, and many are disempowered migrant workers who face structural barriers to accessing health care. To determine what comes next, however, scientists need to pin down the outbreak’s many lingering unknowns, such as how the virus is spreading and how long cows remain infectious. “I think that biosecurity is the only thing that we can do right now, at least until we have more answers in terms of the dynamic of the virus,” Rodriguez says.Despite the stumbles early in the response, Poulsen says, there’s still time to put an end to the dairy outbreak before it becomes a bigger issue for the industry as a whole or for the general population. “We have the best veterinarians and public health scientists in the world,” he says. “We can do it. We just need the funding and the political will.”Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

In this Contemporary Pediatrics interview, Courtney Nelson, MD, attending physician, director of Quality Division of Emergency Medicine, Nemours Children's Hospital Delaware; assistant professor of Pediatrics, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, discussed racial and ethnic disparities of influenza vaccination in an emergency department (ED) delivery setting. Nelson was the presenting author of the session "Racial and Ethnic Disparities in an Emergency Department-Based Influenza Vaccine Delivery Model," held at the 2024 Pediatric Academic Societies meeting in Toronto, Canada. Since there are known racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity due to influenza, Nelson and colleagues sought to describe racial and ethnic differences in influenza vaccine acceptance and administration in an ED-based vaccine delivery model. "We know that nationally, Black children are much less likely to be vaccinated against the flu, whereas Asian families are much more likely to be vaccinated against the flu, so there's definitely a disparity in vaccination rates, and we see that same disparity within our institution," said Nelson in the interview.According to the presentation abstract, a multidisciplinary team in 2020 consisting of ED nurses, physicians, educators, and analysts developed a vaccine delivery model "whereby nurses screen for vaccine eligibility during triage and vaccines are administered by the nurse upon discharge from the ED."The vaccine delivery programs took place over 4 seasons:February 2020 to March 2020September 2020 to June 2021October 2021 to June 2022September 2022 to March 2023Patients who had not received an influenza vaccine that season, who had no contraindications for the vaccine, and whose parents agreed to them receiving the influenza vaccine in the ED were considered eligible. Vaccine acceptance was defined as the percent of patients whose parents agreed to the influenza vaccination in the ED among those who did not have a flu shot that season. The percent of patients who received the vaccine among those who were eligible was vaccine administration. Across all 4 seasons, there were 33,678 patients screened who had not received their influenza vaccine for that influenza season. A total of 4782 (14.2%) parents agreed to have the influenza vaccine administered in the ED.Of the 3231 eligible patients for the flu vaccine, 1608 (49.7%) received it. According to investigators, there was a significant difference in vaccine acceptance among racial and ethnic groups.Data revealed that Hispanic patients were most likely to accept the influenza vaccine (16-28%), followed by patients classified as "other" (11-22%). Black, non-Hispanic patients were the least likely to accept the vaccine (9-15%), followed by White, non-Hispanic patients (10-19%) (P < 0.0001). Among all groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of influenza vaccine administration (P > 0.05, each season, respectively), according to the investigators. "What was sort of interesting to see over the years is vaccine acceptance actually decreased within our White population as well. So that gap is really narrowing between White and Black patients," added Nelson. "We probably need to do some more thoughtful thinking about why our acceptance rates are so low, especially among our Black children and their families, and how do we target that population to make sure that they're getting vaccinated at the same rates that everybody else is."

At least one Colorado dairy farm was hit by highly pathogenic avian influenza, though the lack of testing means that no one knows how widespread the virus is. By Meg Wingerter | mwingerter@denverpost.com | The Denver PostUPDATED: May 8, 2024 at 9:03 AM MSTThe bird flu has arrived in Colorado, and while it doesn’t represent anywhere near the threat that COVID-19 did at the beginning of the pandemic, people should take some precautions with animals that could carry it, experts say.The Denver Post compiled the latest information on H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, the bird flu virus that has jumped to cows in at least nine states — including Colorado — and has infected a small number of people.While the virus at this point is only a threat to people who work with animals, scientists are concerned that it could mutate enough to spread between people, possibly sparking another pandemic.If you want more in-depth information, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Agriculture will hold a virtual town hall on avian flu at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at tiny.cc/birdfluwebinar.How widespread is the virus in Colorado?The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza had reached a dairy cow herd in northeast Colorado as of late April. The state also is investigating a second herd, but hasn’t released any information while waiting for testing results.Cows typically don’t get influenza A viruses, the family that includes H5N1, so it was a shock to find they were infected, said Jenna Guthmiller, an assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical CampusAt least 36 herds across nine states have tested positive, but without routine testing, the virus could be spreading undetected in others.Over the last two years, some Colorado poultry operations have had to cull their birds (killing and properly disposing of all members of an infected flock to avoid spreading the virus to other farms), and the state health department has found infected wild birds or mammals in more than half of Colorado’s counties. You can reasonably assume that birds in your county also are carrying the virus, even if testing hasn’t found it. Right now, the country doesn’t have a clear picture of how widely the virus has spread, particularly among cattle and people who work with them, Guthmiller said. Cows often have mild symptoms and may be able to spread the virus even if they’re asymptomatic, she said.“The major concern right now is still in dairy farm workers,” she said.“Highly pathogenic” sounds worrisome. How concerning is this virus?The name refers to the high mortality rate among poultry. It doesn’t appear to make cows severely ill, however, and we don’t know how bad it could be for people.A separate subgroup of H5 avian influenza, found in Asia in the 1990s, had an official human mortality rate of about 50%. The subgroup that’s spreading now has caused 13 confirmed human cases worldwide and one death, though given the lack of testing, other cases may have flown under the radar, Guthmiller said. (Flu viruses are named based on two types of proteins on their surfaces. The current subgroup and the high-mortality one in Asia share one major protein — H5 — but have different forms of the second protein.)So far, we only know of two human cases in the current U.S. outbreak: a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022 and a dairy worker in Texas this year. Both had mild symptoms and recovered.So far, the current avian flu hasn’t picked up mutations that would allow it to spread efficiently between humans in the way that the seasonal flu does. As it infects more mammals, however, it gets additional chances to adapt to bodies that are closer to our own. Scientists are watching for infections in pigs, in particular, because they can carry multiple types of flu viruses, which could swap genes and grant each other new abilities.“The concern is that if H5N1 spilled over to humans, it could cause a pandemic and stay with us” as another seasonal flu virus, Guthmiller said.Is the food supply safe?Farmers are required to dispose of eggs and meat from infected birds. Since the virus is so severe in poultry, the odds of products slipping through because no one realized the birds were sick are extremely low.Scientists found fragments of the bird flu virus in milk from grocery stores, but couldn’t grow any live viruses, meaning the process of heating the milk to kill bacteria also killed the virus. Other products made with pasteurized milk also are safe to eat.Raw milk might not be safe, however, because it hasn’t undergone pasteurization to kill viruses and bacteria. (This made drinking it a risky decision even before the avian flu started to infect cows.) Cats in Texas died of neurological symptoms related to bird-flu infection after drinking raw milk, though researchers couldn’t rule out that they could have caught the virus by eating wild birds.Colorado doesn’t allow sales of raw milk, though people in “cowshare” programs can receive it from the cow they partially own.A sampling of ground beef from animals in states with avian influenza dairy outbreaks didn’t find the virus in meat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, though other studies are ongoing to find out if the virus could get into muscle tissue in cattle.What are the state and federal governments doing?Veterinarians in Colorado have to report flu-like illnesses in cattle, and can request testing of herds.The federal government also requires testing a sample of cows when moving a herd of lactating animals between states. It exempts calves and adult cows not involved in milk production. (The current leading theory is that the virus is spreading between cows during the milking process.)On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked state health departments to work on distributing personal protective equipment to dairy and poultry farms, as well as slaughterhouses. Workers aren’t required to wear masks and other protection, however.States and the federal government could do a better job working with people whom farmers trust, such as local veterinarians, to increase testing, Guthmiller said.

A few years ago, however, it underwent a mutation that made it more contagious among a wider range of bird species as well as mammals.The outbreak is concerning because of the virus' ability to infect other animals, such as cattle. In a recent study, the data shows that the virus can jump back and forth between birds and cows, which may help it spread over large geographic areas.Here's what we know about the spread of the bird flu virus in the U.S.:Bird flu virus outbreak in dairy cowsThe multi-state outbreak, the first ever seen in cattle, probably began late last year.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have confirmed the safety of milk and milk products after more than 67 dairy cattle herds (as of May 28) in nine states and three men have been confirmed infected in the U.S.According to the health officials, meat samples from retail locations in states where dairy cows are experiencing avian flu outbreaks are being tested to confirm that raw meat poses no health risk to the public.

More: Third human case of bird flu detected in Michigan farmworker, says the CDCPasteurized dairy is safeIn April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said fragments of the virus were found in samples of pasteurized milk.Cattle apparently can spread H5N1 through their milk. It's not clear whether they can pass it through other routes, but researchers are studying this now.Later studies confirmed that pasteurization, the process of heating milk to kill pathogens, destroys the H5N1 virus.So the fragments seen in the milk were not contagious and the milk supply and products made from pasteurized milk are safe, the FDA's Dr. Donald A. Prater said earlier this month. Tests of infant and toddler formula did not find any viral fragments, so these are also safe, he said.Bird flu's adaptability to spreadThere have been four human cases of bird flu in the U.S.: One in 2022 (in a case not connected to the current outbreak) and three in April and May of this year. Each case involved people who work with animals. The more times humans are exposed to the virus, the higher the likelihood that it may mutate to become transmissible among people, leading to an outbreak or even a wider pandemic. Human cases of avian flu are still very rare, but when they do occur, they can be fatal. There have been reports of 889 cases and 463 influenza-related deaths from 23 different countries worldwide from 2003 and April 1, 2024.There have been reports of wild bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow, cow-to-poultry, and two cases of cow-to-human transmission. There is no evidence so far of human-to-human transmission.More: Bird flu outbreak: Don't drink that raw milk, no matter what social media tells youWhere bird flu has been detected in wild animalsSince 2022, several U.S. counties have reported that wild animal species have become infected with the bird flu virus.

Dairy cows feed on silage in a barn in San Joaquin Valley, California. Ed Young/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group/Getty Images CNN — In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle. Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder. Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldn’t be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage. Several more dairies called. One owner told her he thought his farm had “whatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,” indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle. After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University. What they found – loads of the H5N1 influenza virus – has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place. Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls – hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic. Bird flu tries out new hosts For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen. Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection – but cows weren’t on anyone’s radar as potential hosts.

Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC Related article H5N1 bird flu was circulating in dairy cows for four months before it was detected, USDA scientists say Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. “The finding in cattle has been so different,” said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. “Here we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,” Larsen said. Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds. He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests. Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasn’t infectious and couldn’t make anyone sick. That hasn’t stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. There’s big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDA’s economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity. How viruses break into cells Viruses need a way to hack into cells. For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2. For flu viruses, it’s a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid. Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts. If you hold your index finger straight up, that’s kind of what a bird’s sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University. If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, that’s what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said. Cows are seen standing in a feedlot on June 14, 2023 in Quemado, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Related article Spikes of flu virus in wastewater raise questions about spread of bird flu Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasn’t been shown to spread efficiently between people. Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didn’t catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1. Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors. They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope. What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people. Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen. That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses. This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time. “If you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,” said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses – a bird flu virus and a human flu virus – a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasn’t known before this study. “I think this is probably a pretty rare event,” said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years. In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human. Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote. Milk for sale at a grocery store in Houston, Texas on Monday, April 29, 2024. Ongoing tests of dairy products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have not found any active H5N1 bird flu virus in 297 samples purchased in grocery stores. Aaron M. Sprecher/AP Related article Continued FDA testing finds no active bird flu virus in variety of dairy products Still, it’s not unheard-of. Pigs also have both human and bird sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tracts, and flu infections in pigs have been known to spark pandemic viruses. The 2009 pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza, for example, is believed to have started in pigs in Mexico when the virus reassorted to become one that was able to spread quickly between people. Another way the bird flu virus could change in cows, Webby says, is more gradual – and more common. Each time a virus copies itself, it makes mistakes. Sometimes, those mistakes make the virus less potent and hurt its chances of survival, but in other instances, they’re happy accidents – at least for the virus. If a bird flu virus happened to change in a way that made it able to bind more easily to the human-type sialic acid receptors in cows, it could gain a survival advantage: the ability to infect more cells and more types of animals, like humans. Viruses can shift and drift Reassortment would be a big shift in the evolution of the virus, but the gradual passage of the virus through new hosts could also result in a change to the virus’ genome by evolutionary drift. Either way, it’s not good news, said Dr. Sam Scarpino, a computational biologist and director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University. “We now have a piece of data that suggests the risk profile is higher,” said Scarpino, who was not involved in the new study. He notes that this is early research. It needs to be confirmed by a different group of researchers, and it was published quickly as a preprint ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. But he said the findings are also important because no one had really looked to at the susceptibility of cow tissues to influenza A viruses before.

It doesn’t mean there isn’t another one out there, but a number of us looked at it pretty carefully and didn’t find any,” he said. Kristensen said the researchers also couldn’t find any prior research on it, which is why they did the study. “We just felt that, given the situation, that we should go out with these results as fast as possible,” Larsen said. Other experts said that although there are more dots to connect, the study clearly raises the level of alert. “I think we now have more than enough information to conclude that what has to happen is, we need to stop transmission in dairy cattle,” Scarpino said. “We need to increase the kinds of protection that are mandated for workers that are in close contact with cows and milk products and significantly increase the funding that’s going into understanding influenza and in cows, because there’s just a huge amount that we don’t know that we need to learn very quickly.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesJust when you stopped regularly hearing about COVID-19 in the news, another infectious disease began to dominate headlines this spring: bird flu. The good news is—for now, at least—public health experts don’t see this latest bout of avian influenza evolving into the likes of the coronavirus pandemic. But given the disease has spread to poultry in 48 states, dairy cows in nine, and two people in Texas and Colorado, you may be worried about its potential impact on your health. Fortune spoke with a trio of epidemiologists, who below answer critical public health questions about bird flu. What is bird flu? The type of bird flu that’s currently circulating is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)—a disease that can seriously sicken wild and domestic birds, posing a major threat to the poultry industry and thereby the global economy, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The other kind, low pathogenicity avian influenza, causes mild infection in wild fowl but can turn into HPAI in poultry. Influenza viruses are divided into four types, A, B, C, and D, explains Edwin Michael, PhD, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. What we think of as the seasonal flu in humans is caused by types A and B. Bird flu falls under the umbrella of influenza A viruses. The strain currently spreading in the U.S. is H5N1, an HPAI named for proteins on the virus’s surface. “It can spread very quickly through the bird population—wild birds. That can spread it all across the world,” Michael tells Fortune. “From the bird, the virus is shed in mucus, saliva, feces, and then that can go and get into domestic poultry.” When HPAI strains reach domestic poultry, they can kill entire flocks within days, the USDA says. Birds with HPAI infection may show a slew of symptoms including diarrhea, lack of energy and appetite, and a drop in egg production. Because HPAI can’t be treated, poultry depopulation is the sole solution. Such culling can be effective in curtailing the spread in birds crucial to U.S. agriculture and food production, says Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “This particular bird flu virus, in its variants, has actually been around for a long time—over a decade,” Schaffner tells Fortune. “It’s been gradually spreading but recently, somehow, for reasons that at least I don’t understand, its spread around the world has become much more prominent and much more widespread.” Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a disease that can seriously sicken wild and domestic birds. This type of bird flu is a major threat to the poultry industry and thereby the global economy, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.DIGICOMPHOTO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY VIA GETTY IMAGES How does bird flu spread to humans and other mammals? H5N1 is a shapeshifter, so to speak, due to its segmented DNA, Michael explains. “For example, if a human gets infected with a bird flu and also carries a human influenza A virus, these two viruses can exchange genetic material. This is known as genetic shift,” Michael says. “That can form very new viruses [and] cause epidemics.” Flu pandemics are rare, though, occurring roughly three times a century, Michael says. Perhaps the most notable is the so-called “Spanish flu” of 1918–1919, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates “an avian-like H1N1 virus” killed 50 million, and possibly as many as 100 million, people worldwide. You probably remember the swine flu pandemic of 2009, caused by a previously unknown H1N1 virus that contained swine, human, and avian genes. How did that happen? Because bird flu viruses don’t always effectively spread among humans, they sometimes need help from other species to thrive, Schaffner explains. “The pig’s respiratory tract is set up in such a way that it can accept bird flu infections and—and—infections with a human virus,” Schaffner says. “You could think of the pig as a test tube into which goes a bird flu and a human flu, and if that happens simultaneously in the same pig, then those two viruses get together and can have the capacity to exchange genetic elements.” While the latest H5N1 strain isn’t known to spread among humans, it has already spilled over to more than a dozen species of wild mammals, from black bears to a bottlenose dolphin. As recently as May 3, red foxes in New York and Michigan tested positive, according to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). “This bird flu virus is not relying on pigs but is mutating on its own to become a more effective infection in a variety of different mammalian species,” Schaffner says. “The one that has been in the news is dairy cattle, which surprised every virologist.” When did bird flu most recently appear in the US? Government agencies have been monitoring the latest bird flu outbreaks since Jan. 12, 2022, when a Northern Shoveler duck in Hyde County, North Carolina, tested positive for a Eurasian strain of H5N1. Among wild birds, the disease had spread throughout more than 1,100 counties as of May 8, 2024, infecting nearly 9,400 fowl. The situation is worse in U.S. poultry. As of May 7, nearly 91 million birds, including commercial poultry and backyard flocks, had been infected. This encompasses more than 1,100 outbreaks in 522 counties across 48 states. APHIS recorded the first poultry infection in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, on Feb. 8, 2022. Though H5N1 has been circulating nationwide in wild birds, domestic poultry, and mammals since 2022, you may have only been hearing about it recently because of its jump to dairy cattle. The first positive case was documented in Texas on March 25, 2024. As of May 7, nearly 40 dairy cattle herds had been infected across nine states. The logistics of modern industrial farming may be fueling the H5N1 spread to cattle, Michael says. “Look at the density of animals in those farms—those are not natural settings,” Michael tells Fortune. “So as soon as you get [an infection], these things will spread very quickly among farm animals.” Michael adds, “We have to shed a light on how farming is done. That’s the trade-off, you want cheap meat and all the rest of it, but then you farm animals in this way and you’re opening the door up for other things.” Is it safe to drink milk and eat chicken? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledges the presence of bird flu in dairy cows is “a novel and evolving situation.” That said, no previous studies have been done on the effects of pasteurization—a sterilization measure that kills harmful bacteria—on HPAI in bovine milk. However, the FDA says existing research has informed its understanding and conclusion that milk consumption is safe. The FDA and USDA are conducting a national commercial milk sampling study, which includes milk-derived baby formula. As of May 1, no HPAI had been detected in any formula products. While bird flu had shown up in milk, sour cream, and cottage cheese samples, pasteurization inactivated the virus. “There is no need to be concerned about milk, eggs, [and] chicken as sources of infection,” Schaffner tells Fortune. “I’m out there drinking milk, and we had chicken last night for dinner.” Both Schaffner and the FDA urge the public to steer clear of raw, unpasteurized milk. The CDC recommends cooking eggs and poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees to kill bacteria and viruses, H5N1 included. How worried do you need to be about H5N1 affecting people? Simply put, don’t panic, says Michael Osterholm, PhD, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “There’s no evidence yet at this point that this is an imminent risk to humans,” Osterholm tells Fortune. “We’ve not seen it cross over to humans in a way that would support that it’s going to be the next pandemic virus. “On the other hand, a reassortant event, or continued mutations, could occur tomorrow.” Two humans have so far caught H5N1, according to the CDC. A person exposed to dairy cattle in Texas tested positive April 1, 2024, and a person in Colorado involved in culling poultry tested positive April 28, 2022. No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, and the more recent patient’s only symptom was conjunctivitis, or pink eye. “We do have two, three receptor sites in our eyes, and so having a case of conjunctivitis would not be considered unusual,” Osterholm says. “There was no evidence of any kind of respiratory infection, which is the key piece for serious illness and then being able to transmit the virus.” The Texas case marks the first time a human has been infected with H5N1 through contact with a mammal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Even so, WHO considers the public health risk to the general population low. For farmworkers and other industry staff likely to be exposed to the virus, the risk is low to moderate.

Ascension said in a statement that it detected activity on “select technology network systems” on May 8, which is now believed to be a cybersecurity threat. Teams responded immediately to activate “remediation efforts” while Ascension continues to investigate the situation. As a result of the attack, Ascension explained that there is currently a disruption to clinical operations; it is assessing the impact and duration of the disruption with help from Mandiant, a third-party cybersecurity expert. Ascension also noted that it would notify individuals if sensitive information was leaked.Medicare, Medicaid Integration Rule to Shake Up MarketA new federal policy aimed at integrating Medicare and Medicaid coverage appears ready to benefit health insurers who have Medicaid expertise and serve a substantial population of Medicare Advantage members with complex medical needs, according to Modern Healthcare. CMS issued a final rule last month that emphasizes its commitment to supporting Dual Special Needs Plans (D-SNP). It aims to enhance health outcomes and cut costs through tightly coordinating Medicaid and Medicare benefits. By 2030, it will limit most D-SNP enrollment to a single integrated Medicare-Medicaid plan per geographic service area, or one county. These changes may increase competition among insurers, prompting mergers and acquisitions. Insurers like Centene and Molina Healthcare view this as an opportunity, leveraging their Medicaid expertise to capitalize on strategic growth prospects. Conversely, leading Medicare Advantage carriers like UnitedHealthcare and Humana express anticipate revenue risks and potential shifts in their market strategies.US to Post Influenza A Wastewater Data to Assist Bird Flu InvestigationThe CDC is planning to post data on influenza A found in wastewater in a public dashboard as soon as today, May 10, according to Reuters. CDC wastewater team lead Amy Kirby told Reuters that the agency identified spikes of influenza A, a H5N1 subtype, in some sites and is investigating the source; however, there is no indication of human infection with H5N1. The CDC has been collecting wastewater influenza data in about 600 sites since the fall to better track respiratory infections. That data can now be helpful in tracking the H5N1 bird flu outbreak that has infected 1 dairy farm worker and 42 dairy herds in 9 states. Although the findings do not indicate the source of the virus, the dashboard will allow individuals to check for influenza A increases in their area.Related VideosRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 11th 2024Veterans’ Medicare Advantage Enrollments Drive Cost DuplicationMaggie L.

EsveltMay 8, 2024 Reprints Adobe It should be hard — exceedingly hard — to obtain the synthetic DNA needed to recreate the virus that caused the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic without authorization. But my lab found that it’s surprisingly easy, even when ordering gene fragments from companies that check customers’ orders to detect hazardous sequences. Our experiment demonstrates that the immense potential benefits of biotechnology are profoundly vulnerable to misuse. A pandemic caused by a virus made from synthetic DNA — or even a lesser instance of synthetic bioterrorism — would not only generate a public health crisis but also trigger crippling restrictions on research.advertisement Both the genome sequences of pandemic viruses and step-by-step protocols to make infectious samples from synthetic DNA are now freely available online. That makes it essential to ensure that all synthetic DNA orders are screened to determine whether they contain hazardous sequences, which should be shipped only to legitimate researchers whose work has been approved by a biosafety authority. Gene synthesis leaders are aware of the security risks and the potential for liability: sequence providers who belong to the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC) have been voluntarily screening orders since 2009. But these efforts aren’t very useful if most of the dozens of non-members don’t screen their orders, if IGSC firms will ship fragments of hazardous sequences without proof of biosafety approval, or if sequence screening can be easily bypassed. Related: In a world of synthetic biology, publishing virus DNA sequences may mean perishing To test the effectiveness of current practices, Rey Edison and Shay Toner, both Ph.D. students in my lab at MIT, conducted a red-teaming experiment overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They used simple evasive strategies to camouflage orders for gene-length DNA fragments that could be used to generate the 1918 influenza virus, which killed more than 50 million people. The orders were placed on behalf of an organization that doesn’t perform lab experiments and requested shipping to an office address that obviously lacks laboratory space, providing extra reasons for suspicion. Alarmingly, 36 out of 38 providers — including 12 of 13 IGSC members — shipped multiple 1918 influenza fragments. Only one company detected a hazard and requested proof of biosafety approval.advertisement Using complementary DNA pieces for safety, Edison and Toner then showed that standard synthetic biology techniques could assemble harmless constructs equivalent to ones that would generate the infectious virus. In other words, it’s now so easy to assemble fragments of the 1918 influenza genome that a collection of pieces is as dangerous as the entire thing. This isn’t a criticism of gene synthesis providers, many of whom have been voluntarily screening orders at their own expense. The problem is that governments don’t mandate security across the industry — and even though it’s a crime to ship DNA sufficient to generate the entire infectious 1918 influenza, there’s no law against shipping pieces of it. A step in the right direction is November’s Executive Order 14110, which will require federally funded entities to purchase synthetic DNA only from firms that conduct screening. The move has strong support from the gene synthesis industry, which has been lobbying Congress for even more stringent regulations. While many providers understandably waited to see what the implementation framework would look like, others have been adopting new screening software and solutions. SecureDNA, a privacy-preserving system that can detect all of the evasive strategies and order-splitting attacks that we used to obtain the complete genome of the 1918 influenza virus, is now freely available to all DNA synthesis providers and manufacturers of synthesis devices. Developed by an international team of biologists and cryptographers and operated by a neutral Switzerland-based nonprofit, it was designed to verifiably screen orders against an up-to-date database of hazards, potentially limiting provider liability while protecting trade secrets.

Browse our upcoming events to see what's on the horizon. Privacy Policy The Common Mechanism, a new screening system by the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS) that is now in open beta release, is similarly freely available. It uses a different detection algorithm than SecureDNA, making the tools complementary. Established commercial services to assist gene synthesis providers are also available, and Aclid now offers know-your-customer support, completely removing the burden from gene synthesis providers. The problem is the lack of any strong incentive favoring truly effective security. The new implementation framework of Executive Order 14110 is already outdated: it won’t reliably detect the types of evasive strategies we used to acquire the DNA for 1918 influenza virus. Worse, it applies only to customers who receive federal funding, meaning that firms currently offering DNA synthesis as a side business without any security precautions can continue to do so. To safeguard the bioeconomy, follow-up regulation is needed that empowers firms to compete based on their actual security. This might be achieved by: mandating monthly security audits in which experts like Edison and Toner try to obtain hazardous DNA from providers in any way they can; producing a security score for each provider based on how many attempts succeed, including those that split hazards among multiple providers; and mandating that providers consistently earn a security score not far short of the top industry performers in order to continue selling synthetic DNA. Thanks to the dedication of leading IGSC providers — many of whom have already closed vulnerabilities after being privately warned of our red-teaming results — such a policy would virtually guarantee best-practice security across the entire DNA synthesis industry. Until then, the least companies and organizations can do is exclusively buy DNA from providers who take security seriously, and urge any providers who aren’t screening to begin as soon as possible.

Privacy Policy Would incentivizing robust screening increase costs or compromise privacy? Not necessarily. Both the Common Mechanism and SecureDNA are freely available to all providers, and SecureDNA uses cryptography to protect trade secrets, learning nothing about screened orders except the number of subsequences matching hazardous genes. New technologies will continue to lighten the burden: SecureDNA has developed software that makes it easy for research institutions to turn existing biosafety approvals into public-key infrastructure certificates that can be uploaded with DNA synthesis orders, so legitimate researchers can obtain DNA from any gene or organism they’re already approved to work with without any delays. Meanwhile, subsidized trade-in programs could replace existing small-scale “benchtop” DNA synthesizers — which allow labs to make short DNA fragments of their choice without any screening — with modern machines that feature built-in screening of the input as required by the Executive Order, simultaneously closing existing vulnerabilities and accelerating research. The world has too much to gain from the life sciences to continue letting just anyone obtain DNA sufficient to cause a pandemic. Ensuring that only researchers with approval from a biosafety authority can obtain DNA that is at risk of misuse can safeguard the future of biotechnology. Kevin M.

Smith, DVM, Ph.D., University of Vermont and Phil Durst<durstp@msu.edu>, Michigan State University Extension - May 09, 2024 Share Tweet Save Share Print Email On Monday, April 29, USDA required that all lactating cows being shipped across state lines have a negative test for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), what all does it mean and how does a farmer get that done? If you are planning to move dairy cattle, the first step is to contact your herd veterinarian. Your veterinarian will take milk samples from the cows to be shipped. USDA is providing free diagnostic testing for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza HPAI. In cattle, this virus is also known as bovine influenza A (BIA). Dairy producers will need to pay for the sampling and shipping, but not the tests run by qualified laboratories. Until further notice, for lactating cows being transported interstate (and not going directly to slaughter), negative test results and a certificate of veterinary inspection are needed prior to moving those cattle. Lactating animals going directly to slaughter must be accompanied by a certificate of veterinary inspection, an owner-shipper statement, or other document that meets the applicable state requirements. No lactating animals showing clinical signs consistent with HPAI are eligible for interstate movement or movement directly to slaughter. Work with your veterinarian to ensure current requirements are being met. For now, the federal order only applies to dairy cows that are producing milk, no matter what volume. When a negative test result is required, the test must be performed no more than seven days before the interstate movement occurs. Test results are generally available within one to three days. However, additional testing needed to confirm results may take a couple more days. Milk samples are to be collected by, or under the supervision of an accredited veterinarian, or a state licensed veterinarian, or a sample collector approved by the appropriate state animal health official. Understanding that your veterinarian may be required to take the milk samples, you should plan ahead so that the veterinarian arrives for milking and that the animals to be sampled are in one group. Milk must be collected from each quarter as there have been some reports where only one quarter had the virus. Composite milk samples from each individual cow are needed for shipments of up to 30 animals. Do not pool samples from multiple cows. For shipments of more than 30 animals, only 30 animals must be tested. In addition to pre-movement tests, USDA is also reimbursing qualified laboratories for testing samples from cows showing clinical signs consistent with HPAI, from cows that appear healthy in affected herds, and from other animals (e.g., cats, birds) on affected dairy farms. Your veterinarian will need approval before submitting samples in these cases. A National Premises Identification Number (PremID) is required to process all samples for HPAI. What laboratories are running the required test? Laboratories qualified to test for HPAI are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network or NAHLN. If there is any question about where to submit samples, the veterinarian should contact the laboratory they usually work with or the USDA. What if a test is not negative? The initial test results will either be “negative” or “non-negative.” A non-negative test result requires a different type of test to rule out a false positive or confirm a positive result. Other terms that also apply to non-negative results include “suspect case” and “presumptive positive case.” A test designed to detect the specific molecular sequence of avian influenza virus matching the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus is required to confirm a positive case. What if a cow tests positive to the confirmatory test? Positive cows and herds will be reported to USDA. A certificate of veterinary inspection (CVI) will not be issued if at least one in the herd tests positive. The animal must be held for 30 days and test negative prior to moving across state lines. The follow-up sample must be collected at least 30 days after the previous one. What about other classes of animals? The Federal order that requires testing for interstate movement pertains only lactating cattle for now. The current situation is that USDA has identified spread between dairies with cattle movements, spread between cows within the same herd, spread from cows to poultry, and cows without clinical signs that have tested positive. Therefore, as the situation continues to evolve, USDA reserves the right to require testing for other classes of dairy cattle or other milk-producing farmed species that will be based on scientific factors concerning the virus and its evolving risk profile. Containing spread of disease is always better that dealing with the outcome of wider disease spread. Likewise, dairy and beef cattle producers should increase their biosecurity to reduce the risk of introduction of this disease, as well as others, to their herds. For more information on herd biosecurity, contact your MSU Extension dairy or beef professional and talk with your veterinarian. This article was published by Michigan State University Extension.

Carlos Duarte/Getty ImagesThe U.S. government has two candidate vaccine viruses for H5N1 bird flu that could be used to make vaccines.Studies suggest vaccines based on these would offer good protection against the bird flu virus circulating among cattle in the U.S.It would take months to produce and ship millions of doses, but experts worry that uptake will still be low.The H5N1 bird flu circulating in the U.S. remains far more dangerous for birds than for people. Currently, this strain of the flu that circulated in cows has led to just a single person being affected in the last few months. But the strain of influenza has the potential to mutate, so federal health officials are already thinking ahead toward a potential vaccine.The country has two candidate vaccine viruses available to manufacturers for the production of a bird flu vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on its website.How U.S. could make millions of bird flu vaccines within weeks“These [candidate vaccine viruses] are like seed stock that are kept in reserve in case there is an outbreak of that particular strain,” said David Diemert, MD, a professor of medicine in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at George Washington University, and director of the GW Vaccine Research Unit.If bird flu started easily spreading to people, “[the candidate vaccine virus] can be sent to manufacturers to make millions of doses of vaccine,” he said, “using the existing hen egg technology that we normally use for the regular seasonal vaccine.”A candidate vaccine virus is attenuated, or weakened version of the virus. As a result, it is unlikely to lead to active infections in people who get the vaccine. This type of weakened virus is able to grow well in hen eggs, which is what most manufacturers use to produce seasonal flu vaccine. The candidate vaccine would also have the surface proteins — known as hemagglutinin — of the virus circulating in the community. This enables a vaccine to generate a protective immune response.Would these bird flu vaccines work? The U.S. National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) has four types of H5N1 candidate vaccine viruses, reported STAT News. The bird flu affecting dairy cows is a strain of H5N1.Only two of these candidate vaccine viruses are a good match for the currently circulating strain of bird flu.Studies suggest that vaccines based on these two candidate vaccine viruses “will offer good cross-protection against cattle outbreak viruses,” Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a call on May 1.However, Amesh Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned that the candidate vaccine viruses are not a “perfect match” for the currently circulating strain of H5N1. This means they may not produce vaccines very effective at preventing disease.In addition, research done in the mid-2000s found that H5N1 vaccines don’t trigger a strong immune response in people unless it is given in a large enough dose; or if it is given with a compound known as an adjuvant, which boosts the immune response.Adalja pointed out that the H5N1 vaccines that we have in the stockpile are really not that good at provoking an immune response. “Even for the viruses they are targeted against,” said Adalja. “In clinical trials, the protective antibody levels that people had were modest.”One of these existing H5N1 vaccines in the NPIVS is made by CSL Seqirus, which supplies flu vaccine to the U.S. market.Still, Diemert thinks a bird flu vaccine based on the two candidate vaccine viruses in the NPIVS would be effective and potentially more effective than seasonal influenza vaccines.This is because a bird flu vaccine would likely only have to target a single virus strain. In contrast, during seasonal flu season, there may be multiple strains of influenza that spread. Seasonal flu vaccines are developed to target certain strains of influenza every year. The vaccines are developed in the summer and early fall by looking at common strains in the Southern Hemisphere. But during flu season the strains that become more common in North America may not be the strains the vaccine was primed to target. As a result, seasonal flu vaccines may end up targeting strains of influenza virus that are not the ones in circulation that year.“That’s one of the reasons that [seasonal flu vaccines] are not 100% effective because they’re not a perfect match,” said Diemert.Would vaccines need FDA approval?Before bird flu vaccines could be rolled out, they would need to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but the agency has a process for approving updated seasonal flu vaccines each year.So this should go fairly smoothly, said Diemert, “especially since the [bird flu] vaccines would be made using the same manufacturing process that they use every year [for seasonal flu vaccines].”Also, “I’m sure if there was a massive outbreak of this particular strain, then the FDA would speed things up,” he said. “So I don’t see regulatory approval being a rate-limiting step.”How quickly could the vaccine be rolled out?In terms of getting the vaccine to the people who need it the most, “all of the pieces are in place to be able to roll out a vaccine relatively quickly,” said Diemert. However, “when you send [the candidate vaccine virus] to the manufacturer, it still takes weeks to months to make all the doses you need,” he said.This is especially difficult in a “fast-moving situation” such as a pandemic, said Peter Chin-Hong, MD, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health.Federal health officials estimate that over 100 million doses could be shipped within three to four months. However, they expect people to need two doses, so this would only cover 50 million people.Vaccine production could also be affected by the same virus the vaccine would be designed to protect against.Manufacturers most often use hen eggs to produce flu vaccines, but chickens are also susceptible to the bird flu virus that is affecting cattle.So, “if you have a global [influenza] pandemic, and you have birds dying too, that may constrain supplies such as chicken eggs,” said Adalja.As of May 6, over 5 million chickens and other commercial or backyard poultry birds in the United States have been affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). which includes H5N1, reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The big question is whether enough vaccine doses could be rolled out in time to make a difference.“With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, by the time the vaccine came out, the pandemic had already dissipated,” said Chin-Hong.During that outbreak, tens of millions of Americans were vaccinated, but by the time the vaccine doses were available, the fall wave had subsided.However, “this is 2024 and things have changed,” said Chin-Hong, referring to the fast development and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines. “When people put their mind to it, it could be done fast … But the devil is in the details.”Overall, “it’s going to take some time to actually gear up to be able to vaccinate everybody who’s at risk for flu,” said Adalja. “And as I said, the candidate vaccine virus that is stockpiled is not a perfect match. And even if it were a perfect match, [the H5N1 vaccine] is not a great vaccine to begin with.”mRNA vaccines and other optionsFederal health officials said the government is also pursuing an mRNA bird flu vaccine, based on the same technology as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines.Chin-Hong said this type of vaccine could potentially be updated more quickly to match the currently circulating strains of the virus. But these vaccines have their own challenges, he said, such as needing to be stored at extremely cold temperatures.In addition, given that these vaccines would be a new use of the mRNA vaccine technology, the FDA may require clinical trials which could delay the roll-out to the greater population.There are other options for dealing with an outbreak of bird flu in people, including antivirals such as Tamiflu, which would be given to people who are already infected.“Different interventions speak to different people,” said Chin-Hong. “In general, Americans prefer to treat something rather than prevent it, which can be a challenge.”Vaccine hesitancy may slow uptakeAs seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s not just how many vaccine doses you can ship that matters, but also how many people receive the vaccines.“The problem we may have is that there is more vaccine hesitancy now, so people may not be as willing to get vaccinated,” said Diemert. “I don’t know if that will be different because the [hen egg] flu vaccine technology has been around for decades and there’s a lot of evidence of its safety.”Chin-Hong pointed to the poor current COVID-19 vaccination rates among American adults as a sign of vaccine fatigue.Around 22% of all American adults have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine, with a slightly better rate (38%) among older adults, according to the CDC. Both rates are much lower than health officials would like to see.“That shows how fatigued people are [with vaccination campaigns],” said Chin-Hong. “This [hesitancy] would need to be addressed in the same breath as having a well-oiled plan [for rolling out the vaccines].”Adalja is concerned not just about vaccine hesitancy, but with growing public opposition to vaccines, in general.“In 2009 with H1N1, vaccination uptake was subpar because concerns raised by the anti-vaccine community — which were unwarranted concerns — dissuaded people from getting vaccinated,” he said.But “after COVID-19, the anti-vaccine movement is more powerful than it has been in decades,” he added. “So I think mounting a vaccination campaign in an [future] emergency is going to be very difficult to do in the current political environment.”TakeawayThere is no sign that the H5N1 bird flu circulating in dairy cow herds is developing the ability to spread easily to people. But federal health officials are planning for the rollout of a bird flu vaccine as a precaution.The federal government has two candidate vaccine viruses stockpiled. These are weakened so they cannot infect people or cause illness, but they grow well in hen eggs, which is how flu vaccine are most often made.The candidate vaccine viruses are not a “perfect match” for the bird flu virus currently circulating, but they should offer good protection, say health officials. However, experts are concerned that vaccine fatigue will deter uptake.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Shawn Radcliffe on May 7, 2024 — Fact checked by Kevin Cyr, MDRead this nextEating Beef and Chicken During the Bird Flu Outbreak: What to KnowAs bird flu spreads among cattle and poultry, is it safe to eat beef and chicken?

New incentives could encourage farmers to increase testing among herds. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images fileMay 10, 2024, 10:33 PM UTC / Updated May 11, 2024, 3:34 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsFederal authorities on Friday pledged nearly $200 million in an attempt to control the spread of bird flu on dairy farms. Some of that money would go directly to farms to help them reduce the spread of the virus, cover veterinary costs and compensate farmers who’ve lost milk because of sick cows.The money is also intended to encourage testing of both dairy cows and the people who work closely with them — a key step, experts said, in understanding the true scope of bird flu, also known as H5N1, across the U.S.“Incentives work very well to get a better understanding of epidemiology,” said Katelyn Jetelina, who tracks illnesses for a website called “Your Local Epidemiologist.” Right now, there is no requirement for dairy cows to be tested unless they’re being moved across state lines, according to a recent federal order. Otherwise, the decision is left to farmers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that since that federal order went into effect at the end of April, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network reported 905 tests for bird flu among cattle. Among those, 112 were positive.(During a press briefing Friday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said only around 80 cows had been tested since the order went into effect. A USDA spokesperson later clarified that since the order went into effect, an additional 80 tests have been conducted daily.)As of Friday, 42 herds in nine states — Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas — had been affected by the outbreak.“Those 42 family farm operations are suffering, and we want to make sure we’re there to provide help and assistance,” Vilsack said.The USDA will offer $98 million to affected farms over the next four months, which could equate to as much as $28,000 per farm, Vilsack said. Jetelina called the program “a fantastic step” but “way overdue.” The outbreak among dairy cattle was first announced at the end of March. “The incentive program is a huge leap forward,” especially for smaller farms, said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. It’s likely not enough, however, for larger farms that could lose upward of $3 million with a bird flu outbreak, he said.“This is not going to get fixed tomorrow,” he said. But incentives “like this lay the groundwork for it to be better, and it also gives us precedent if and when we deal with the next large outbreak.”The Department of Health and Human Services will put in an additional $101 million to ramp up monitoring of people who have been exposed to sick animals, contact tracing and genetic testing of the virus to watch for mutations. Part of those funds will also go toward wastewater surveillance of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to start posting that data publicly as early as Monday, a CDC spokesperson told NBC News. A separate monitoring system called WastewaterSCAN, which tracks 191 sites in 41 states, is showing high levels of influenza A in the Midwest and Northeast. That’s unusual for mid-May, well past the typical flu season. The bird flu is a type of influenza A virus.Those findings prompted the WastewaterSCAN researchers to look more closely at wastewater sites in Texas, where it’s believed the bird flu outbreak began.Further testing indicated that, at the sites in Texas, “what we were seeing was most likely attributable to an H5 influenza virus,” said Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. While wastewater testing can detect influenza A, it can’t distinguish whether the virus came from a human or an animal, according to the CDC. The findings, coupled with recent announcements that fragments of the bird flu virus had been detected in 1 in 5 samples of pasteurized milk, indicate that bird flu may be spreading undetected. Further testing confirmed that the milk, along with other pasteurized dairy products including sour cream and cottage cheese, were safe to eat or drink.Just one person, a dairy worker in Texas, has tested positive for the virus during the current outbreak. His illness was mild, and his only symptom was pinkeye.But experts have suggested that other cases could be going undetected. Friday’s incentives announcement included a $75 payment to any farm worker who agrees to give blood and nasal swab samples to the CDC. Meanwhile, experts said the risk of bird flu spreading among the general public remains low. “Stay aware, but only let it take up a small part of your brain,” Jetelina said. “There is a good probability that this will fizzle away.”Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoHow Pasteurization Kills Bird Flu Virus in Milk | Think Global Health Toggle side menu Go to homepage Share this page Share on X Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share via Email Go to homepage Close menu Enter a search term Submit Environment Poverty Trade Governance Food Urbanization Aging Gender Migration Data Visualization Recommendations Research & Analysis Series Interviews About This Site Submission Guidelines Newsletter Enter your email address Submit Thanks for signing up.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid by Rachel Nuwer May 7, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Copy link Science students around the world learn about Louis Pasteur's nineteenth-century discovery that heat destroys pathogens in food and beverages, reducing the risk of disease transmission. That breakthrough eventually led many countries to mandate pasteurization of certain products, including alcohol, fruit juice, and eggs. Milk and other dairy products are also on that list, and their safety is of particular interest now due to the outbreak of H5N1, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), in U.S. dairy cows. As of May 6, the virus had been detected in 36 herds in nine states. Experts have continued to emphasize the lack of any evidence or reason to believe that viable bird flu virus will get through pasteurization. On May 1, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a statement reassuring the public that "preliminary testing did not detect any live, infectious virus" in fluid milk, cottage cheese, and sour cream. The tests "show that pasteurization is effective in inactivating HPAI." It's understandable, though, that the public has been confused by mixed messaging from government officials and the media, including about genetic fragments of the virus initially recovered in pasteurized milk from supermarkets. That makes a clear explanation of the science, facts, and unknowns all the more pertinent. A Century of Safety Milk safety in the United States is regulated in part by the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, a set of rules that dates to 1924. Centennial celebrations have been tempered somewhat by the current H5N1 outbreak, yet there is no reason to suspect that the pasteurization methods adopted a century ago are any less effective at preventing disease today, says Alex O'Brien, the dairy food safety and quality coordinator at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Center for Dairy Research. Experts have continued to emphasize the lack of any evidence or reason to believe that viable bird flu virus will get through pasteurization The United States saw almost immediate public health returns after it adopted widespread pasteurization. In 1938, milk-borne illnesses accounted for 25% of all disease outbreaks attributed to contaminated food and water, but by 2014, that figure had declined to less than 1% (and of that 1%, the majority of cases—70%—were from raw, unpasteurized milk). Milk processing standards have become stricter over time, O'Brien says, and exhaustive federal and state regulations and standards now exist across production, processing, and packaging. More than 90% of milk produced in the United States meets Grade A standards, meaning that it is sufficiently sanitary to be safely consumed as a beverage. Grade B milk, which constitutes most of the rest, can be used only to make certain dairy products, including ice cream, butter, and cheese. Why Pasteurization Destroys Avian Influenza VirusUnlike sterilization, pasteurization does not eliminate every microbe a product may contain. Its primary purpose, instead, is to ensure that pathogens are destroyed with a 99.999% reduction. Pasteurization does this by heating products to a certain temperature for a certain time, the specifics of which are based on the biology of pathogen in question and the characteristics of the food or beverage being heated.Generally, though, "anything can be inactivated by temperature, it's just a matter of how high and how long," says David Swayne, a Georgia-based poultry veterinarian who specializes in avian influenza, and the former director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. H5N1 is an enveloped virus, meaning that it has a lipid-based outer wrapping that protects its genetic material and other essential components. Heat delivered through pasteurization dissipates this envelope and destroys some of the essential proteins in the virus's structure. "The envelope just starts to melt away," says Erwin Duizer, a virologist at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands. "And if the envelope from a virus is basically gone, then the virus is not infectious anymore." Plastic containers with milk are seen inside the El Elyon church, in El Paso, Texas, on March 17, 2021. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez Likelihoods and Unknowns No data currently suggests that the H5N1 virus circulating in dairy cattle and found in infected cows' raw milk can survive pasteurization. Past pasteurization and cooking studies that Swayne and his colleagues conducted in chicken eggs and meat, for example, showed that heat treatment is effective at inactivating H5N1. The latter finding offers hope for ongoing testing for the possibility of H5N1 in beef. On April 25, the FDA announced that it had detected genetic fragments of H5N1 in about 1 in 5 pasteurized retail milk samples from a nationally representative study. Swayne emphasizes that these results do not mean that viable virus had been found in milk. The pasteurization process inactivates viruses, but it does not remove their genetic material. What is left over, he says, is not "a whole virus that can infect someone." This conclusion was supported by FDA testing of 297 retail dairy samples from 38 states that failed to detect any infectious virus, reaffirming "that the commercial milk supply is safe," the FDA wrote on May 1. The agency added that it will continue collecting samples and conducting studies "to further validate pasteurization." Ongoing testing is warranted given the current outbreak, Duizer says, but he sees little cause for concern given pasteurization's proven track record. What's of more concern, he says, is "the ease with which this virus makes species jumps." With the current information we have and the past 100 years of data from pasteurization, I have no concerns Alex O'Brien "Things can change on a dime," O'Brien agrees. "But with the current information we have and the past 100 years of data from pasteurization, I have no concerns." O'Brien says standards exist for pasteurization machinery, and are enforced stringently, to make sure the process is uniform across the industry. He says Grade A facilities are also randomly inspected each quarter by officials. No evidence has been found so far of H5N1 infection in beef cattle, but continued testing is a good idea, Swayne says. If the virus does appear in beef cattle, it is unknown whether it would be present in their beef. Should that happen, though, Swayne reiterates that "cooking is highly effective at killing HPAI." All that said, one group of consumers could be at higher risk of direct foodborne transmission of bird flu: those who drink raw, unpasteurized milk or who eat dairy products made from it. Tests the FDA conducted of raw milk collected from infected cows confirmed that the samples contained high levels of viable H5N1 virus. Whether contaminated raw milk could lead to an infection in a person is unknown. But evidence is beginning to suggest that several domestic cats that lived on dairy farms were fatally infected this way. Regardless of whether H5N1 can be transmitted to humans in raw milk, O'Brien warns that drinking it still introduces safety concerns: "Bacteria is everywhere, and cows can be carriers of things, too."

Carrasquillo-Mangual, Michigan State University Extension. - May 10, 2024 Share Tweet Save Share Print Email This Article is offered in: English, Espanol Enhancing bio security practices in the milking parlor can mitigate the risk of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection in farm workers. Photo by: Martin J. Carrasquillo-Mangual, Michigan State University Extension. Though recent reports indicate that humans safely recover from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI/H5N1), there is still a risk of illness, especially for farm workers exposed to potentially infected animals. As the HPAI outbreak continues to evolve, it is important that farms implement precautions to protect human and animal health. Currently the USDA reports that nine states have at least one dairy herd with positive HPAI tests. Due to the nature of the job and the current understanding of HPAI pathology, milking technicians are at higher risk of exposure and infection. Therefore, it is important to communicate the risks and precautions parlor employees should take to mitigate the risk of infection. Why is there a higher risk for milkers? According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those who have job-related exposure to infected animals are at greater risk of contracting HPAI. This risk may also be higher for milkers or other workers in direct contact with the unpasteurized milk of infected cows. In April (2024) Texas reported the first case of a farm-worker infected linked to dairy cattle. USDA analysis from nasal swabs, tissue and milk showed that the highest concentration of virus shedding is found in milk prior to pasteurization. According to their report virus replication in the dairy cow mainly occurs in the udder. Therefore, unpasteurized milk droplets are considered as a primary medium of infection to other mammals including humans. How can milkers be infected? Milking technicians are constantly exposed to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Several steps that occur during the milking procedure increase exposure including fore-stripping, CMT testing/sampling or leaking cows. Milk can also be found in equipment, used towels, work clothes and many other areas of the parlor floor, walls etc. Additional risk is present in dairies that use raw milk to feed calves. If milk is not pasteurized on the farm prior to feeding, the risk can potentially extend to calf feeders and other employees who are in contact with the raw milk. However, many of these processes are vital for the optimal functioning of a dairy farm. This highlights the importance of increasing awareness and implementing strategies to reduce the risk for dairy farm workers. What practices should be employed every day? Standard hygiene practices and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be reviewed and updated if necessary. Hands should be washed with hot, soapy water prior to starting a shift and before taking breaks. After a shift ends, the employee should shower (highly recommended) or wash hands and face with water and soap. Parlor employees should wear the following PPE throughout their shift: Gloves: Should be worn 100% of the time in the parlor (including cow “pushers” who step inside the milking pit. Gloves should be instantly replaced if torn. Clothing: Clean clothing is recommended. If outerwear protection is used (e.g. aprons or arm sleeves) they should be rinsed after each shift. Work attire should remain at the farm or kept separated from other clothing at the milker’s home. If no outerwear is used, work clothes should be kept and washed at the farm. Boots: Preferably impermeable and slip-resistant shoes should be used while working in the parlor. These should be cleaned prior to a shift and often rinsed if stepping in manure or other areas outside the milking pit (e.g. the holding pen) boots should be disinfected with chlorinated water at the end of each shift. Is there anything extra to add to mitigate HPAI infection? Additional protective equipment can be employed. Any equipment that protects the worker from milk droplets can aid in reducing the risk of infection. Impermeable aprons and sleeves can be added to protect arms and clothes. If the herd is confirmed positive MSU Extension recommends the following: Workers should wear safety glasses to protect the eyes from milk splashes. Current guidance from the CDC also establishes the use of N95 masks or respirators for workers exposed to animals positive for HPAI. If visibility becomes problematic due to the high humidity environment in the parlor, a face shield can be used to protect the face from milk droplets. Workers should avoid touching the face, eyes and nose area during their shift. If needed, use a clean disposable towel and quickly discard after use. Dispose of gloves every time the worker exits the parlor area. Disinfect and wash prior to lunch breaks, bathroom use or anytime workers exit the parlor. New gloves should be used when they return to the milking floor. MSU Extension recommends that farms provide a container (pan or bucket) with chlorinated water next to the door to the milking floor so workers can step in to clean their boots every time they exit the parlor. Is important to rinse the boots to remove manure or sand prior to disinfection. Do not provide raw milk to cats or other animals, especially if the herd is positive for HPAI as this can lead to further spreading of the disease and presents an additional risk of infection. Although current information suggests that HPAI presents a low risk to humans and those affected have recovered successfully without any major setback, we should still employ methods to reduce the risk of infection and limit the spread of this disease. HPAI still presents clinical symptoms in humans that may vary in severity and length. Therefore, any action to mitigate the risk of infection will lead to a safer work environment For additional questions or recommendations, contact Martin J Carrasquillo-Mangual at carrasq1@msu.edu, or reach out to your local MSU Extension dairy extension educator.

But the country’s initial approach has had an unsettling resonance with the first months of COVID.By Dhruv KhullarMay 5, 2024FacebookXEmailPrintSave StoryIllustration by João FazendaSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyIn December, 2021, a few weeks after the Omicron variant emerged to spark a new, punishing phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jim Lester’s birds got sick. Lester, who owns an exhibition farm in Newfoundland, Canada, learned that the culprit wasn’t the novel coronavirus but the first known outbreak in North America of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, called H5N1. Hundreds of birds were infected and died. Scores more—peacocks, geese, an emu—had to be culled. They all “had personalities,” Lester said. “It was a true tragedy.” Since then, the virus has propagated down through the Americas, killing tens of millions of birds and, perhaps more concerning, infecting dozens of mammalian species: bottlenose dolphins in Florida; sea lions in Peru; elephant seals on the islands near Antarctica. Now, for the first time, the virus is circulating among cattle, and at least thirty-four herds across nine states in this country are known to be infected. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration announced that one in every five samples of milk in the United States carries fragments of the virus, suggesting an even wider spread. One expert called the situation “totally unprecedented.”Influenza is a promiscuous pathogen. Its potential to unleash pandemics is due partly to the modular structure of its genome, which allows it to swap segments of its genetic material wholesale when different versions of the virus co-infect a cell. This occurred in the mid-nineties, when H5N1 was first isolated, from a goose in southern China, and went on to infect some twenty per cent of the poultry in Hong Kong markets, precipitating the slaughter of more than a million and a half chickens. In the intervening decades, the virus has periodically caused devastating outbreaks in poultry, but it remains poorly suited to the human respiratory tract, and that has limited its spread among people. Still, for those who do get infected—usually farmworkers and others with exposure to animals—the effects can be lethal. In some prior outbreaks, the virus inflicted a case-fatality rate of more than fifty per cent. Fortunately, only two people in the U.S. are known to have been infected, and both experienced mild symptoms. Since 2022, only about two dozen human cases have been recorded worldwide, and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk to public health remains low.The prevalence of the virus in our milk supply may also be less alarming than it sounds. The P.C.R. test used to identify it can detect minuscule amounts of genetic debris, and a positive result does not imply that the virus is alive, much less contagious. Nearly all milk sold in the U.S. is pasteurized—heated to destroy potential pathogens—and that process may be especially effective for unstable viruses such as influenza. (Many states—some, recently, as part of a broader backlash against public-health measures—have legalized the sale of raw milk, which health officials generally do not advise consuming.) The tests needed to conclusively determine whether pasteurization kills H5N1 take time and involve injecting eggs with milk samples, but, according to the F.D.A., preliminary studies haven’t found any traces of live virus.It now seems likely that H5N1 was first transmitted from a bird to a cow late last year, and that the virus has been circulating unchecked among cattle for months. Many cows who shed the virus don’t show symptoms, and how it spreads among them remains a mystery. Contamination of milking equipment is the most probable route, but respiratory transmission is also a possibility. So far, pigs haven’t contracted the virus, which is good for them—and us. Pigs have receptors for both avian and human versions of the flu, so they can serve as “mixing vessels,” facilitating genetic exchange in ways that could spawn a mutant capable of spreading among people and igniting another pandemic.In the unlikely event of that emergency, we’re far better positioned than we were for COVID. Influenza may be the world’s most familiar viral pathogen—its genome, virulence, and transmission patterns have been studied for decades. The U.S. has a large stockpile of Tamiflu, which should work against bird flu, as it does for other influenza strains, and which could be given to an infected person’s contacts to mitigate spread. Health officials have also indicated that they could rapidly scale up testing and, if needed, shift the nation’s annual flu-vaccine production to shots that are tailored for H5N1.But the ability to respond is not the same as responding. The country’s initial approach has had an unsettling resonance with the first months of COVID. Because there is no widespread program to screen farm animals for H5N1, we have little sense of how many have been tested or what proportion of tests have been positive. It took a month after bird flu was detected in cattle for the Department of Agriculture to require that lactating cows be tested before crossing state lines, and the agency has since clarified that only thirty animals in a group must be tested, irrespective of how large the group is. Last month, when the government released genetic sequences for scientists to study, it did not share information about where or when the samples were collected, making it difficult to track how the virus is spreading and evolving. Meanwhile, we haven’t conducted antibody studies of farmworkers that could determine the extent to which they are getting infected; we’ll know they’re sick if they show up in emergency rooms.Many hospitals, of course, are still reeling from the pandemic, and leaders have expressed concern that they don’t have the staffing, the resources, or the morale to contend with another crisis. The deeper problem, though, is the country’s COVID hangover. America has emerged from the pandemic not just fatigued, but resentful and divided. If bird flu becomes human flu, one gets the sense that our principal fight won’t be with the virus, but with one another.In Albert Camus’s novel “The Plague,” the vectors of disease are not birds but rats. The authorities are slow to act and, as the death toll mounts, people grow depressed, distrustful, violent. Even when the crisis eventually recedes, a doctor comes to feel that plague “never dies or disappears for good.” He notes, “Perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.” The rise of pandemic pathogens is an inextricable part of the modern world. The scale of their destruction doesn’t have to be. ♦Published in the print edition of the May 13, 2024, issue, with the headline “From the Birds.”New Yorker FavoritesCan reading make you happier?Why walking helps us think.The Vogue model who became a war photographer.The perils of Pearl and Olga.Sentenced to life for an accident miles away.The resurgent appeal of Stevie Nicks.Fiction by Lore Segal: “Ladies’ Lunch”Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.Dhruv Khullar, a contributing writer at The New Yorker, is a practicing physician and an associate professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.Read MoreThe LedeShould Political Violence Be Addressed Like a Threat to Public Health?Treating political violence as a contagion could help safeguard the future of American democracy.By Michael LuoCommentTrump’s Health, and OursStudies increasingly suggest that a healthy nation depends on a healthy democracy.By Dhruv KhullarThe LedeThe A.D.L. of Asian AmericaA new foundation tied to the Anti-Defamation League aims to end “discrimination, slander, and violence.” Both groups are navigating a crisis of mission about who and what they represent.By E.

To prevent chapter two from becoming a reality, the most important tool in our arsenal will be widespread testing. Testing isn’t just about diagnosing people with the virus. Containing the spread of this highly pathogenic bird flu strain in cattle hinges on our ability to detect and track it. The H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows is widespread and spans multiple U.S. states. Although only one human infection with the virus has been documented, more infections are likely going undetected. Most importantly, unchecked transmission among cattle means the virus is increasingly bumping up against humans. Every human exposure, in turn, provides an opportunity for new mutations that could enable human-to-human transmission.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that as of now, the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low. And indeed, it is entirely possible H5N1 might never turn into a human pandemic. However, being wrong would be incredibly costly. We find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of early 2020, when the U.S. stood on the brink of the COVID-19 pandemic and hesitated to take decisive action, restricting testing to only those with epidemiological links to China. Scientists estimate that by early March 2020, less than 1% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the U.S. were detected by testing. We effectively flew blind straight through chapters one and two of the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, genomic analyses tell us that bird flu had been circulating in dairy cows for at least four months before it was detected in March 2024. The delay was despite early warning signs of infections on dairy farms in February. The U.S. government cannot afford to repeat the mistakes made at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the risk of an H5N1 pandemic may currently be low, the consequences of inaction could be catastrophic, and the benefits of proactive testing far outweigh the short-term costs.Read More: Why Experts Are Worried About Bird Flu in CowsDespite the high stakes, government action initially has been slow and uncoordinated. Until mid-April, testing was not only voluntary but restricted to symptomatic animals, with limits on the number of tests per farm. A complicating factor is that responsibility for outbreak control is divided between three federal agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for livestock, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for food safety, and the CDC for human health and surveillance. Yet by May, the CDC was aware of only about 30 people who had been tested for bird flu. The CDC has been monitoring data from emergency departments in areas where H5N1 has been found in cattle and has found nothing unusual so far. But if and when infected people show up at the ER, it will be way too late to contain the outbreak at its source. We must stop flying blind. Regular and widespread testing is our only way to detect H5N1 and stop the virus from spreading.The recent federal order requiring mandatory testing of dairy cows before they cross state lines is a step in the right direction. But we could be doing more: we should incentivize testing, rather than restricting it. A layered testing strategy that combines waste or wastewater surveillance on the farms, routine testing of pooled milk from the cows, and active surveillance testing of animals and humans—including those without symptoms—is our best hope of stopping the virus from spreading.The tools and infrastructure for such a testing regimen are already at our fingertips. During the pandemic, the U.S. government spent billions supporting testing and creating an extensive biosurveillance infrastructure. Influenza monitoring via wastewater surveillance has already shown increases in the H5 subtype—the viral group to which H5N1 belongs. In 2024, labs across the U.S. now have PCR machines sitting idle, waiting to be turned back on. And U.S. test manufacturers have efficient automated manufacturing lines capable of producing millions of rapid tests a day.Read More: Is It Safe to Eat Eggs and Chicken During the Bird Flu Outbreak?For animal testing, we should accelerate evaluations of both laboratory and point-of-need tests. Testing should include cows, but also pigs, which are known “mixing vessels” for viruses across host species. We should also evaluate different specimens like swabs and cow milk, including the pooling of samples to test more efficiently. If existing influenza A rapid tests could detect the virus from a drop of contaminated milk, it would be a game changer. Given the sky-high virus loads detected in milk from infected dairy cows, it is possible that a single drop could be enough. But if the tests need to be tweaked, the USDA and FDA should be funding studies to do so now. With H5N1 circulating in herds nationwide, we can quickly assess the effectiveness of these tests and refine our strategies accordingly.When it comes to human testing, it is laudable that the CDC is now engaging with test manufacturers to develop a widely available H5N1 test. In the meantime, existing authorized rapid tests for influenza A will likely detect H5N1. To confirm, the CDC, FDA, and the National Institutes of Health’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program should support evaluations that close that knowledge gap. If these broad influenza rapid tests detect H5N1, we could send any positive influenza A test to a lab for confirmation and evaluation of H5N1 or another virus. This surveillance testing algorithm, which leverages broad influenza tests for initial screening and reserves more specific H5N1 assays for confirmation, followed by rapid sequencing of positives, would allow us to allocate our public-health resources with maximum efficiency. The rapid turnaround times of point-of-need tests would enable infected people to immediately isolate themselves and get influenza antivirals, minimizing the risk of transmission. The federal government keeps the influenza antiviral Tamiflu as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) in its Strategic National Stockpile. To ensure that tests are similarly available, the government must send a clear demand signal to manufacturers, committing to purchase a substantial quantity of tests, just as they do for antivirals and PPE. This would give manufacturers the confidence needed to ramp up production and create a robust national stockpile. Congress should allocate funding to support these efforts, with the White House’s new Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response coordinating a unified response across the CDC, USDA, and FDA. The government must also address the stigma associated with positive test results and provide financial aid and resources to help affected farmers and their workers. Many of the individuals working on dairy farms are undocumented, for example. The current administration should make assurances that offer protection to undocumented workers who agree to test as a part of public-health surveillance testing programs. Success in public-health prevention is difficult to spot, and success in preventing a pandemic can be misconstrued as a failure or a misappropriation of funds. It’s nearly impossible to recognize the absence of a pandemic that never happens, but would have if not for aggressive and early efforts. However, tracking detections and documenting actions taken will help. The cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of prevention. We risk losing all the lessons learned from COVID-19 if we don't apply them now.The good news is that we have the tools to prevent an H5N1 pandemic at hand. But we must be willing to use them, and fast.More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comTIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

The influenza season started in week 17 (week starting 22 April 2024) when the influenza detection rate (3-week moving average) from the NICD inpatient pneumonia sentinel surveillance in public hospitals breached the seasonal threshold and remained above the threshold for two consecutive weeks (Figure 1). As of the 9 May 2024 within the pneumonia surveillance programme, the most commonly detected subtype and lineage is influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (29/52, 55.8%) followed by influenza B/Victoria (7/52, 13.5%) and influenza A(H3N2) (2/52, 3.8%). Of the 52 samples that tested positive for influenza, 1 sample (1.9%) had inconclusive influenza A subtyping result, 7 samples (13.5%) were pending influenza A subtyping results, 1 sample (1.9%) had inconclusive influenza B lineage result, 3 samples (5.8%) were pending influenza B lineage results and 2 samples (3.8%) tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria (Figure 2). Influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B are common seasonal influenza strains in humans. The majority of people with influenza will present with mild illness, usually resolving within 3-7 days. However, influenza may cause severe illness leading to hospitalisation or possibly death, especially among those who are at risk of severe influenza illness or complications. High-risk groups include pregnant women, individuals living with HIV, those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, lung disease, tuberculosis, heart disease, renal disease, and obesity, older individuals (≥aged 65) and children <2 years old. These groups should be encouraged to seek medical help early. Updated guidelines on influenza diagnosis and management are available at: https://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Influenza-guidelines_-25April-2023-final.pdf Influenza vaccination is recommended to protect against infection and severe illness. Ideally the influenza vaccine should be administered prior to the start of the influenza season because it takes about 2 weeks for antibodies to develop following vaccination. However, it is never too late to vaccinate. Individuals at risk for severe illness are strongly encouraged to seek the influenza vaccine from either a public health clinic or privately through general practitioners and pharmacies. Annual vaccination is needed as the influenza virus is constantly changing and immunity to the vaccine wanes with time. Receiving the vaccine can reduce visits to clinics or doctor’s offices, absenteeism from work and school due to influenza illness, as well as prevent influenza-related hospitalizations.

It’s OK to drink. The bird flu virus, or H5N1, has recently appeared in cattle herds that supply dairy and beef. Although fragments of virus have been found in milk, live infectious viruses have not. Properly handling and preparing food will prevent infection. If you’ve heard the rumors flying around about the bird flu outbreak showing up in weird places, it’s true: H5N1, the avian influenza that typically affects poultry and wild birds, has recently spread to some dairy herds that supply our milk and beef products. Don’t worry: The virus doesn’t appear to spread easily from cattle to humans. So far, only one person is known to have contracted the virus during this outbreak — and they only developed conjunctivitis (pink eye). Fortunately, the infection also seems to be treatable with current flu drugs. However, many people are (understandably) starting to fear contracting bird flu, given its recent spread. What is bird flu? Bird flu — officially known as highly pathogenic avian influenza — has caused widespread outbreaks among wild birds and poultry for decades. It’s called highly pathogenic because of its devastating effect on birds. Infection among mammals is less common, and though infections in humans are rare, they can be deadly. Aside from its impact on wild and domesticated bird flocks, the risk that it or a virus like it might someday become a pandemic virus is a concern. Thankfully, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently believes the current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses is low. So, the question becomes: If the virus has impacted poultry and cattle, should we scratch eggs, chicken, beef and dairy off our grocery lists? (Most) milk is safe to drink Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease expert at UW Medicine, says you don’t have to throw out your milk; it’s almost certainly OK. However, now is not the time to try raw milk: Make sure the milk is pasteurized to ensure any possible H5N1 virus — not to mention harmful bacteria — has been killed off. Chu explains that lab tests are currently in progress to check for the bird flu virus in dairy and beef products. “We do not yet know whether there is evidence that there is living virus in the milk or the beef and, even so, if the amount is enough to cause infection,” says Chu. Some tests have found bird flu virus RNA in milk, but they are extremely sensitive. “What they're finding right now are really just the fragments of the virus, dead virus, in the milk. They found no evidence of live virus in the milk,” says Chu. “And even if it was originally live in the milk, that process of pasteurization should kill it.” You can eat eggs and beef (if they’re cooked well) Again, there’s no evidence to suggest that humans can get the bird flu from eggs or beef. It’s more likely for someone to get other foodborne illnesses from these foods, like salmonella or E. coli. As long as you properly handle and thoroughly cook your food, you should be safe from infection. When you’re cooking, remember to wash your hands before and after handling raw meats, don’t re-use wash cloths after wiping your counters and cutting boards (especially if you’re cleaning raw meat juice) and check the temperature of your meat to ensure it's fully cooked. “Beef and eggs, if cooked thoroughly, should be fine to eat because the process of cooking food at high temperatures will destroy the virus,” says Chu. 145 degrees is the minimum internal temperature for cuts of meat and 165 degrees for ground meat and poultry before it’s safe to eat. The takeaway Moving forward, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is requiring that dairy cattle must receive a negative influenza test when crossing state lines to prevent the spread of the virus to other herds or people. So, as long as you follow safe food temperatures and avoiding eating things raw, you should still be able to enjoy a morning latte, some scrambled eggs and a nice steak dinner without worrying about catching the bird flu.

Initially, spotting tainted milk was believed to be fairly easy because cows that get sick with H5N1 begin producing milk that is thick and yellowish. But in recent weeks, studies have found genetic traces of H5N1 in a large percentage of commercial milk products. Significant amounts of viral material from the avian influenza have also turned up in wastewater in Texas, specifically in areas where dairy processing plants are located. The presence of these viral fragments doesn’t mean H5N1 is biologically active in these samples or capable of causing disease. All the evidence generated to date indicates that pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1 in milk, though the FDA continues to study the issue.advertisement That is a huge relief. But it raises a big and important question: How is it that so much virus is getting off of affected farms and into the national milk supply in the first place? The most plausible and also the most concerning scenario is that visibly sick cows, the ones with strange looking milk and flu-like malaise, are just the tip of the outbreak. Although there’s little hard data at this point, scientists say the available evidence suggests that many more animals are likely being infected and producing virus-laced milk without any noticeable symptoms or changes to their milk’s color and consistency. Further readingH5N1 bird flu: Go deeper The top scientist at the WHO says social factors are as important as biology in controlling the spread of a virus. Jeremy Farrar warns of compliance reluctance, from migrant workers to farmers fearing financial losses. In studying possible methods of bird flu transmission, scientists look at where the H5N1 virus is most prevalent in cows — the udders. The bird flu threat to humans remains low, but potential mutations keep the CDC's top flu scientist up at night. First Opinion essay: To curb bird flu spread, the U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements. “Viral fragments in milk are likely from subclinically infected cows,” Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University, told STAT. In a recent study of 150 commercial milk products representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states — including Texas, Kansas, and others where herds have tested positive for H5N1 — Bowman’s team found viral RNA in nearly 40% of them.advertisement A larger survey of 297 milk products, including cottage cheese and sour cream, conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, found viral RNA from the H5N1 bird flu in about 20% of samples. The presence of viral genetic fragments is not believed to represent a risk to human health. Because pasteurization is a thermal process and doesn’t involve the physical removal of any bacteria or viruses, the sensitive tests used for identifying DNA or RNA can detect dead genetic material left behind. Additional studies by both Bowman’s team and FDA scientists found no evidence of infectious virus in the store-bought milk products sampled. “We were hoping all that milk was getting caught before it entered the supply system,” said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist who studies respiratory viruses at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Now we’re relying particularly on pasteurization to say the milk is safe.” There are a few other possible explanations for how virus-containing milk is getting off the farm. One is that farmers are simply ignoring the FDA’s instructions to discard milk from infected cows. But farmers have strong incentives — both in the interest of public health and their own economic outlook — to not allow abnormal milk into bulk tanks. Human error or neglect could also be at play, but unlikely given that milk from clinically affected cows is so obviously abnormal. Related: Pasteurization inactivates H5N1 bird flu in milk, new FDA and academic studies confirm An FDA spokesperson did not directly address questions about how H5N1 is winding up in the national milk supply. In a statement, the agency acknowledged the possibility that asymptomatic cows may be shedding virus and reiterated its stance that the dairy industry refrain from manufacturing or selling raw milk products. “Given the detection of H5N1 in dairy cows is a novel and evolving situation, we are still learning about the dynamics of this particular virus,” the statement said. The FDA currently recommends that farmers discard milk only from symptomatic cows. The agency also has instructed farmers to take extra precautions, including heat-treating or pasteurizing milk, prior to disposing it or feeding it to calves or other farm animals. A recent investigation of outbreaks at dairy farms in Texas and Kansas found that at one farm where cats were fed unpasteurized milk from sick cows, about half the cats died after suffering neurologic symptoms. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture referred questions to the FDA. In a technical note the USDA released on Tuesday, further clarifying a federal order to require testing of lactating dairy cows prior to interstate travel, the agency said it is not placing restrictions on the shipping or processing of milk from herds that have a non-negative test — that is any result that is either presumptively positive, suspect, or otherwise not obviously negative. The note reiterated the FDA’s recommendations that producers discard milk from symptomatic cows. But crucially, milk from cows in the same herd that are not showing symptoms — but may have been infected — can be sent for processing under these rules. Every tank of milk that travels from a dairy farm to a processor is sampled and screened for the presence of bacteria, antibiotics, and somatic cell counts. These are a measure of the immune cells that show up whenever a cow has an infection. Most dairy farmers receive an incentive bonus for better quality milk; the lower the somatic cell count, the higher the price it commands. Related: There’s never a good time to drink raw milk. But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Given how the H5N1 virus is behaving in cows, with clear signs of infection in the udders, but little evidence of respiratory tract infections, it’s “reasonable to believe somatic cell counts would be significantly elevated in sick animals,” Terry Lehenbauer, a bovine disease epidemiologist and director of the Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center at the University of California, Davis told STAT via email. “The dairy farmer would be motivated to not allow abnormal milk from affected cows to go into the bulk tank.” That’s why he believes the most likely contributor to the problem is that there are infected dairy herds with asymptomatic animals producing H5N1-laced milk that looks normal. But with farmers reluctant to allow inspectors to test their cattle — because of stigma and a lack of financial incentives to do so — they can’t know if their cows are the ones introducing the virus into the milk supply. It is getting introduced, that much is clear. Not just from commercial milk testing, but also from analyzing what’s flowing through city sewers. About a year ago, researchers at Stanford University and Emory University developed a probe to detect H5N1 genetic material in city wastewater, to be ready just in case it jumped into humans. The work was part of WastewaterSCAN, a nationwide initiative to fish out fragments of RNA or DNA from viruses like SARS-CoV-2, human influenzas, and monkeypox from sewage, in collaboration with Verily Life Sciences. The probe hadn’t yet been operationalized when the researchers began seeing unusual spikes in influenza A in parts of northern Texas in February, March and April of this year. Unusual because the human flu season had already mostly passed, and because the numbers were so huge. “Some of the concentrations we measured were among the highest overall influenza concentrations that we’ve ever measured as part of the program,” said Marlene Wolfe, an environmental microbiologist and epidemiologist at Emory University and a co-principal investigator for WastewaterSCAN. Based on that aberration and the reports of H5N1 outbreaks in cattle, her team decided to go back and apply the probe to samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants — two in Amarillo and one in Dallas — dating back to February 4. Related: From sewage to safety: Hospital wastewater surveillance as a beacon for defense against H5N1 bird flu In a preprint posted last month, Wolfe and her team described what they found: large concentrations of the H5 gene ticking up in mid-March, at the same time the USDA was confirming the first outbreaks in dairy cows in the Texas panhandle. They also found that all three sewershed areas they tested were home to dairy processing facilities with permits to discharge milk byproducts into the sewers. Such discharges are highly regulated and carefully monitored, with strict limits on volume, pH, and components such as fats, oil, and grease, Rachel Ravencraft, a spokesperson for the National Milk Producers Federation, said in an email. That’s because large influxes of milk, with its high concentrations of fat and protein, can overwhelm municipal wastewater treatment systems and mess with the microorganisms that break down sewage. In a typical processing environment, Ravencraft said, about 1% of fluid milk gets lost during normal operations, including cleaning and sanitizing equipment. “No one just dumps a volume of milk down the drain.” That fits with what the Wastewater SCAN scientists think happened in North Texas. “Our hypothesis is focused on the discharge of waste from facilities that are operating, for the most part, we believe, as expected, and that there is likely an H5 influenza that is part of that discharge,” Wolfe said. For now, it’s just a hypothesis, she emphasized. Wastewater surveillance can’t determine the number of cases associated with those spikes, how many cows might be contributing to the uptick, or even what species is shedding this into the sewer. “At this stage where we are sort of early still in this response, and there’s not a lot of testing available, having the situational awareness about what is present in an area that we can get from wastewater and some information on trends, is useful.” Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy One thing that’s useful in this case, is the indication that there may have been additional unidentified outbreaks among cattle in the region with milk sent to these facilities since milk from infected animals is required to be diverted from the food supply. “Even though the measures of discarding milk and pasteurizing milk are not always perfect by themselves,” Lehenbauer said, “the combination of these actions together have provided strong evidence that our current milk supply is safe.” While the evidence so far supports the effectiveness of pasteurization, microorganism destruction depends on the combination of temperature and holding times in the pasteurizer as well as the specific properties of the pathogen and how many of them are present in the milk. Higher levels of bacteria or viruses will take more time to kill. The FDA has been testing samples of raw milk trucked from farms to processing facilities to better understand how much virus the pasteurization equipment might encounter, officials told reporters at a briefing last week. That information will be used to inform additional experiments the agency plans to conduct to further validate the effectiveness of different pasteurization methods. The method used depends on whether the milk is intended for drinking, making cheese, yogurt, ice cream, or to be dried into powdered milk or baby formula. Such studies are more important now than ever as it’s becoming increasingly clear that attempts to keep contaminated milk from reaching dairy processing plants are falling short. Although public officials continue to stress that the bird flu virus currently poses a low risk to humans, they do worry about it spreading silently throughout the nation’s dairy cattle herds. If it were to become endemic in cows, the chances go up that it could mutate into a strain that could more easily infect people. And that’s the scenario that keeps the nation’s top flu scientist up at night.

Source: GettyThe world’s growing love of meat has been linked to the terrifying strain of avian influenza that’s killed millions of birds, thousands of wild animals, and has even spread to humans.Although wild birds have carried low pathogenic forms of the virus for centuries, the cramped, often dirty conditions common in modern farming have likely created the perfect conditions for it to mutate into dangerous variants.Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at Australian National University and Canberra Hospital is upfront that he loves meat, but has concerns about industrial farming methods which are used to fill supermarket shelves and fast food restaurants with cheap chicken, eggs, pork, beef and dairy. He argues the widespread use of antibiotics to prophylactically prevent disease indicates there’s something wrong with these systems.“My own view is you need to give antibiotics to animals if they're sick. But if you're having to do it routinely and feed it to 1000 animals at a time, there is a problem with your farming practice,” he said. “Using antibiotics to fix problems is because you need to change your methods to prevent that from happening. It could be vaccination, but it could be less crowding and changing feeding habits”Farming fast factsModern-bred meat chickens can reach slaughter weight at just 36 days.

Source: GettyRelated: Are KFC, eggs and dairy safe from the spread of bird flu in Australia?Concern after cattle fed chicken wasteLast month, the HPAI strain of avian flu was reported to have spread to cows in Texas, and Collignon has suspicions about what caused it to jump species.Unlike in Australia, cows in the United States can be fed waste that’s scraped from the bottom of sheds used to house chickens, populations of which have been devastated by the virus in that country.“One of the things that worries me is in the US they are allowed to feed them litter, which is a mixture of waste from chicken. And in birds, the main way flu is spread is faecal-oral,” he said.“The problem now in the US is giving cows food they wouldn’t normally eat. Look at Mad Cow Disease in England, we turned cows into meat eaters – we fed them sheep.”Reports of deadly virus suddenly stop as Antarctica goes darkNew Zealand prepares for threat of avian influenza as virus spreads to AntarcticaLogging company responds after 'botching' simple endangered species rule 188 timesStressed birds in filthy conditions aiding spread of virusPeter Stevenson OBE, is the chief policy advisor at Compassion in World Farming, an international non-profit that advocates for improvements in animal welfare. Nine months ago it warned avian flu was a “ticking time bomb” and called for mass vaccinations of poultry, and reform of industrialised poultry and pig farming systems.Noting there is a “very, very strong link” between poor animal husbandry and the rise of zoonotic pandemics, Stevenson believes it's likely farming has played a role in the rise and spread of HPAI.“In the large poultry sheds there are a huge number of birds which are hosts for the virus. It can move very quickly amongst them, perhaps mutating as it does so,” he said.“That highly pathogenic bird flu can then get out of the poultry sheds, for example, through ventilation systems, and infect wild birds. So you’re getting a virus that’s continually evolving.“At the core of it is the keeping of poultry in very crowded, stressful conditions. These are birds that are not particularly in good health. Both the egg flock and the meat flock – the broilers – have been genetically selected for either very high egg production or very fast growth rates, and this is putting a huge stress on them, so these are relatively frail birds, very vulnerable to disease.”Love Australia's weird and wonderful environment?

Is human-to-human transmission next? And are we ready for another pandemic?David CoxSat 11 May 2024 06.00 BSTShareOver the past four years, a silent pandemic has been raging. One in which the death toll is believed to number in the hundreds of millions, but which has received remarkably little attention until now.The pandemic in question is bird flu, the H5N1 strain of influenza, which since 2020 has moved far beyond the avian world and into mammals ranging from dairy cattle to domestic pets, and species that live on our doorsteps, such as foxes. The virus’s presence has been detected on every continent, even Antarctica. While it has yet to evolve the capability of spreading between humans, alarm bells were raised last month after a dairy farm worker in Texas contracted H5N1, seemingly from cattle.It would appear to be the first known case of bird flu jumping to humans from another mammal. “There is increasing concern at the scientific and public health levels,” says Dr Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s vaccine research group, who has previously compared the rising infection rates among animals to “the rumbles prior to an earthquake”.It is clear that a couple of years ago, the current strain of bird flu changed to become superchargedWhile H5N1 is well known for its devastating impact on wild bird populations and poultry farms in the US – as of 5 May, 91m farmed birds have been infected in the US across 48 states – Poland has been particularly alarmed by reports of pet cats contracting the virus from cattle and becoming seriously ill or dying. “We have very little research to tell us how this is all occurring in cattle, and how it is being spread,” he says.In the UK, the virologist Prof Paul Digard and his team at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh were awarded an additional £3.3m grant last year to ramp up their research into bird flu, and assess the risk the current strain of H5N1 might pose to humans.“Flu is constantly evolving, and it is clear that a couple of years ago, the current strain of bird flu changed to become supercharged,” says Digard. “Now that it seems to be fairly widespread in the cow population in the US, that’s a much more direct route where it could transmit to people and gain the adaptations it needs to go pandemic.”The Roslin team’s task is to figure out the precise changes in the viral sequence that seem to be allowing it to infect cows, and then test the strain on human cells and mini-organs in the lab. The ultimate goal will be to make predictions about whether it is starting to become more dangerous to humans and to animals that live in close proximity to us, and to feed that information back to the relevant public health authorities.American cows now have bird flu, too – but it’s time for planning, not panic | Devi SridharRead moreIf the findings spark concern, it could provide the government with more evidence to start bolstering national supplies of flu vaccines. Last year, reports emerged that the UK Health Security Agency had run a procurement exercise to source suitable jabs, while the US has accumulated a national reserve of four types of flu vaccine that could provide some protection against H5N1 in case of any future outbreak. But even this stockpile would not be sufficient for the entire country, and Digard explains that governments face a desperately difficult decision when it comes to balancing the economic cost of vaccines against trying to ensure that they are as ready as possible for an outbreak.“The issue is trying to decide when to pull the trigger for go,” he says. “Because if you wait until it’s already a pandemic, then you’re playing catchup, and you know that you’re not going to be able to make enough vaccine quickly to protect everybody.”The vaccine bottleneckIf H5N1 did start spreading among people, the good news is that the world has plenty of recent experience when it comes to rolling out large-scale vaccination programmes. More than 13bn doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered, covering 70% of the world’s population, while at the height of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, around 3bn vaccine doses were churned out.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are two candidate vaccines against a related strain of flu viruses that could be shipped within weeks, if necessary. Various manufacturers also have special dispensations from regulators to update their flu vaccines with relevant targets from the H5N1 strain, without needing to seek new licensing.View image in fullscreenA dairy cow: bird flu is now ‘fairly widespread’ in US cattle, probably as a result of contact with wild birds. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe World Health Organization (WHO) says its estimates suggest that 4-8bn doses of influenza vaccines could be produced within a year in an H5N1 pandemic. Experts say that would require a significant expansion of the global capacity for making flu vaccines, placed at about 1.2bn doses.“Remember that it takes two doses, three to four weeks apart, to achieve protective immunity,” says Poland. “You can quickly do the maths and see where that leaves us.”While manufacturers have been working on H5N1 vaccines since the mid-2000s, research has always indicated that they pose a much greater technical challenge than the seasonal flu vaccines distributed each year. In particular, the jabs seem to require a far larger dose to generate a sufficient immune response. A dose of the H5N1 vaccine candidate manufactured by the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi is 90 micrograms, six times the size of a typical seasonal flu vaccine. Poland says this would make it far more challenging to produce the jab at the scale required.The WHO’s capacity predictions may be relying on ramping up the production of adjuvanted vaccines. These utilise an additional ingredient, or adjuvant, which is combined with the vaccine to boost the immune response, enabling a far smaller dose, and one that is easier to produce in large quantities. The pharmaceutical company GSK says that its pandemic influenza vaccine Adjupanrix, which uses an adjuvant, has a dose of 3.75 micrograms. “In 2022, we signed a contract with the EU’s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority for the reservation of future production and supply of 85m doses of Adjupanrix,” the company says. “In the event of an influenza pandemic declared by the WHO, this will ensure the ready production and supply of Adjupanrix to 12 EU member states.”However, speed of production could still prove to be a bottleneck. In the event of an H5N1 pandemic, the WHO estimates that 79% of the vaccines produced would be made using traditional gold-standard technologies, which require incubation in chicken eggs. While a Sanofi spokesperson said that during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, vaccines were produced within three months, egg-based platforms are known to be more time-consuming: the process can take up to six months.Newer technologiesInstead, messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which proved so invaluable in generating Covid-19 vaccines, could once again be a vital tool, with the platform known to be faster and more efficient than older egg-based technologies. Current clinical trials by both Moderna and GSK and CureVac working in collaboration are testing H5N1 vaccines in people. However, given past difficulties in stimulating sufficient immune responses to H5N1, Digard says there is insufficient data to examine the possible effectiveness of mRNA vaccines.“It’s technology that is potentially applicable to this,” he says. “I don’t think we have the data yet to say that it works as well.”Given that H5N1 is still largely confined to the animal population, one idea for reducing transmission and limiting the potential for jumping to humans may be vaccinating poultry and farm animals on a mass scale. However, Karen Grogan, an associate professor at the University of Georgia’s Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center, is not convinced this would make a significant difference.If we divert all the vaccine production into H5N1 jabs, that means we aren’t making seasonal flu vaccines“Vaccination of commercial poultry would not decrease the amount of viable virus in the environment since there is so much being shed by wild birds,” she says. “The spread into dairy cattle is likely linked to wild birds on those dairies. There are no approved H5N1 vaccines for use in farm animals or household pets; those would need to be developed, which is a process that takes around four years.”If there is an H5N1 pandemic, Poland predicts that healthcare services around the world would have to rely partially on antiviral medication for the first six months of the outbreak, until sufficient vaccine stocks became available to provide full population-level coverage. According to the CDC, analysis of the strains circulating among cows show that the virus should be susceptible to the current range of antivirals that are approved against flu.But whether it’s stockpiling antivirals or instructing pharmaceuticals companies to switch to H5N1 vaccine production, Digard says that governments face a difficult dilemma when it comes to how best to respond to the bird flu threat.Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is ‘enormous concern’, says WHO Read more“All this costs money,” he says. “It’s a very delicate juggling act. With vaccines, for example, if we begin diverting all the vaccine production to make H5N1 jabs, that means we don’t make the seasonal flu vaccines. So if you start an H5N1 vaccine programme prematurely, you’ve disrupted the supply of seasonal flu vaccines which are still needed.”Although the prevalence of H5N1 in the wild is worrying, Digard is keen to point out that, while the virus is widely reported as having a fatality rate of 52% in humans, based on 882 cases of infections between January 2003 and December 2023, it does appear to have become much less pathogenic for people in recent years.“There have been human cases in the UK over the last couple of years, but they’ve been really mild and generally asymptomatic,” he says. “I’m not minimising the risk – if this did go pandemic, even with a very mild virus, people would end up dying because of the sheer numbers who get infected. Even swine flu, which is the mildest flu pandemic we have records for, still killed hundreds of thousands of people. But it wouldn’t be a science-fiction style pandemic.”Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe ObserverFluHealthImmunologyEpidemicsMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

File | Photo Credit: PTI Amidst the ongoing Lok Sabha election, several states across the country including Kerala, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand among others have been directed to stay alert and vigilant about the ongoing bird flu spread and the emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza now in cattle — detected in eight U.S. states. (For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters) H5N1 outbreak: route of mammalian transmission among cattle unclearWhile the Central Government has asked for vigilance, the World Health Organization (WHO) expressed deep concern regarding the increasing transmission of H5N1 bird flu to other species, including humans. ”The current bird flu outbreak, which originated in 2020, has now affected not only ducks and chickens but also cows and goats, which is why the flu has been described as “a global zoonotic animal pandemic,” it said, warning about the potential risk of the virus evolving to infect humans and gaining the ability for human-to-human transmission. Although there is no evidence of human-to-human spread yet, the mortality rate among those infected through contact with animals remains high. Over the past 15 months, WHO has documented 889 human cases across 23 countries, resulting in 463 deaths, equating to a mortality rate of 52 %Central government in India maintains that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly known as Bird Flu, was first detected in India in the state of Maharashtra in February 2006. Since then, the country has experienced annual outbreaks of HPAI in different regions, leading to substantial economic losses. The disease has been reported in 24 states and union territories, resulting in the culling of over 9 million birds to control its spread. India’s approach to controlling HPAI follows a “detect and cull” policy as outlined in the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control, and Containment of Avian Influenza (revised - 2021). This comprehensive response includes the humane destruction of infected and exposed animals, eggs, feed, litter, and other contaminated materials. Additionally, measures such as restricting the movement of poultry and poultry products, disinfection and clean-up of infected premises, and a Post-Operative Surveillance Plan (POSP) have been implemented. It’s important to note that vaccination against HPAI is not permitted in India. The Central Government has maintained that with the long-term use of vaccination either the disease has become endemic and therefore widespread, or the infection in affected animals is too difficult to detect. Accordingly, the Government of India does not permit use of any vaccine against Avian Influenza in the country.An article titled, ‘Bird flu in US cows where will it end’’ in Nature on May 8, 2024, notes that various forms of the H5N1 virus have been circulating since the 1990s. A particularly deadly variant that was first detected in 1996 has killed millions of birds and has been found in numerous mammalian species, including seals and mink. But until now, cows were not among the virus’s known hosts. US officials first announced on 25 March that H5N1 had been found in cattle, and cows from 36 herds in 9 states have tested positive as of 7 May. Tests of pasteurized milk have found no living virus. But the virus’s increasing ubiquity has made scientists uneasy. It adds further that from a human perspective, cows might be one of the worst possible animal reservoirs for influenza because of their sheer number and the degree to which humans interact with them. Culling poultry has curbed previous bird flu outbreaks, that isn’t a viable option for cattle. The animals are too valuable and, unlike birds, don’t seem to die from the infection.Data released by the Central Government notes that India, is the third-largest producer of eggs (129.60 billion) and the fifth-largest producer of poultry meat (4.47 million tonnes) globally and in the fiscal year 2022-23, it made significant strides in the global market, exporting a notable 664,753.46 metric tons of poultry products, with a total worth of Rs. 1,081.62 crores (134.04 Million USD) to over 57 countries. According to a recent market intelligence study, the Indian poultry market achieved a remarkable valuation of USD 30.46 billion in 2023 with a CAGR of 8.1% from 2024-2032.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jonas Brothers (@jonasbrothers) While Jonas fans are saddened, his Influenza A diagnosis opens a platform for a conversation around this viral illness. What Is Influenza A? Influenza A, commonly known as the flu, is a viral infection that affects millions of people each year. While it shares symptoms with the common cold, it can be more severe and may lead to complications, especially in vulnerable populations such as young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Identifying whether you have influenza A is crucial for proper treatment and to prevent its spread to others. Symptoms of Influenza A According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the symptoms of Influenza A are: Fever: One of the hallmark symptoms of influenza A is a sudden onset of high fever, often exceeding 100.4°F (38°C). Muscle and Body Aches: Severe muscle and body aches, often affecting the back, arms, and legs, are common with the flu. Fatigue: Feeling extremely tired and lacking energy is typical, sometimes lasting for several weeks after other symptoms resolve. Cough: A dry or productive cough can accompany influenza A, leading to chest discomfort and irritation. Sore Throat: While not as common as with a cold, some people with the flu experience a sore throat. Headache: Intense headaches, often felt behind the eyes or in the forehead, can occur with influenza A. Nasal Congestion: Stuffy or runny nose is possible, although less prevalent than in colds. Chills and Sweats: Rapid changes in body temperature, leading to chills followed by sweats, are frequent flu symptoms. Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Some individuals, particularly children, may experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea with influenza A.

Even more, 36 cattle herds in nine states, and one human, tested positive for bird flu since late March, leading the FDA to test dairy products for the virus. According to the FDA’s most recent update, the agency conducted tests on 297 pasteurized retail dairy products from 38 states after previous findings showed that fragments of the virus got into the commercial milk supply. The FDA deemed commercial milk safe, and went a step further to test powdered infant and toddler formulas for the virus, reporting no evidence of the bird flu in the products as well. Meet the expert: Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health SecurityAhead, we break down the foods that are safe to eat during the bird flu outbreak, and what to avoid.Wait, what is bird flu?“Bird flu” is a colloquial term for avian influenza, which refers to influenza viruses that naturally circulate in avian species, says Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. At this point in time, there is no evidence that the circulating strain of the bird flu, called H5N1, spreads easily from person to person. The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to continued spread among people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). How does someone contract bird flu?Historically, humans can contract avian influenza from animals, says Dr. Adalja. “In fact, the 1918 influenza pandemic virus was an avian influenza virus,” he notes. Most current cases of bird flu in humans are clustered in individuals who have close contact with infected poultry, though one case has been linked to infected cattle, he adds.Keep in mind, though, that the person’s case was mild and reported eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis), as their only symptom. No hospitalizations or deaths have been reported as of press time.Still, the risk to the general public remains low, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told NBC.Foods safe to eat during bird flu outbreakThe FDA made clear that the tests showed that the products didn’t contain a live virus that could make people sick. In their findings, the FDA determined that in dairy products including cottage cheese and sour cream, in addition to fluid milk, pasteurization was effective in inactivating the virus and these products are safe to eat. All dairy products are safe to consume with the exception of dairy that is not pasteurized, says Dr. Adalja. He also notes that “beef is completely safe to eat.”Per the FDA report, the following products are safe to eat and enjoy:Cottage cheeseSour creamPasteurized milk and dairy productsBeefThe new preliminary results “affirm the safety of the U.S. commercial milk supply,” Don Prater, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during the briefing. He also shared that the latest findings confirm that the pasteurization process inactivates the virus, making the previously infected dairy products unable to infect people. While the FDA tested raw milk for live virus, the agency strongly advises against drinking unpasteurized, raw milk.Avian influenza is only the newest reason not to partake in unpasteurized dairy products as there are scores of potentially dangerous pathogens present in “raw” or unpasteurized milk products, adds Dr. Adalja.Foods to avoid during bird flu outbreakExperts say that foregoing unpasteurized products is key to avoiding bird flu. More specifically, make sure that you do not consume:Unpasteurized milkDairy products made from unpasteurized milkUndercooked eggs, poultry, and meatSymptoms of bird fluThere are no specific symptoms of “bird flu,” says Dr. Adalja. Bird flu is “influenza and causes the same spectrum of illness/symptoms but, in some cases, the symptoms might be more severe.” For example, more severe pneumonia might ensue, he notes.Per the CDC, here are the most common symptoms of the flu:Fever or feeling feverish/chillsCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigue (tiredness)Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)The bottom lineIn general, you don’t have to worry too much about your exposure to bird flu in the supermarket or at the dinner table. As long as you avoid consuming raw milk products (and raw poultry or beef), you should feel free to keep enjoying the milk, cheese, and yogurts that you already have in your daily diet.This is a developing story that is accurate as of press time.Related StoriesChina Reports First Human Case of H3N8 Bird FluWhat Is the H10N3 Bird Flu?Bird Flu Is Back in the U.S.: Why It MattersAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowFood & NutritionShould You Add Fenugreek to Your Routine?Cheese Recall Over Listeria Concern: Full ListFrom Prevention for U.S. SoyWhy You Should Cook With SoyWhat Is the Least Healthy Vegetable?Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowDietitians Say These Are the Healthiest BreadsIs Almond or Peanut Butter Healthier?Shortcut Chicken PhoLabne-Swirled Chocolate Dessert DipVegan Caramelized Onion DipA Peek Inside the Mind of a Registered DietitianTry These 11 Foods for an Energy BoostMint "Guacamame"Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Prevention.comNewsletterPress RoomGive A GiftCommunity GuidelinesSubscribeMedia KitAdvertise OnlineOther Hearst SubscriptionsCustomer ServiceA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

Region - Industry Forecast 2024-2031 Report ID: SQMIG35A2886 | Region: Global | Published Date: May, 2024 Pages: 215 |Tables: 63 |Figures: 70 DESCRIPTION TABLE OF CONTENTS METHODOLOGY ANALYST SUPPORT Avian Influenza Vaccine Market Insights Global Avian Influenza Vaccine Market size was valued at USD 140.0 Billion in 2022 and is poised to grow from USD 145.88 Billion in 2023 to USD 202.74 Billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 4.2% in the forecast period (2024-2031). Avian influenza is caused by avian influenza virus type A, which is found in waterfowl and subsequently causes disease in domestic poultry. The virus was first detected in China. The Asian H5N1 version was discovered the following year in an outbreak in Hong Kong and has since spread to Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa and the Middle East Avian influenza can be classified as a pandemic greater virus and less virulent based on its molecular structure. Depending on the virus, the viruses are classified into H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2. In addition, type A virus of subtype H5N1 is currently considered to be the most pathogenic avian influenza virus under investigation. Bird flu is known to be transmitted to humans through nose and mouth breathing. Classification of avian influenza vaccines includes H5 avian influenza vaccine, H7 avian influenza vaccine, and H9 avian influenza vaccine. Among manufacturers, China stands out as the largest supplier of avian influenza vaccine, with the US being the largest supplier. There were 633,323 adults in the US. with cirrhosis, or about 0.27% of the population. Sixty-nine percent said they did not suspect liver disease. It was higher among non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans who were poor and had less than 12th grade education. Diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C and B, male gender, older age, and cirrhosis were independently associated, with 53.5% accounting for the proportion of the population due to viral hepatitis (mostly hepatitis C), diabetes mellitus, and excessive alcohol consumption every two years in cirrhosis. There was a mortality rate of 26.4, compared with 8.4% in characteristic-matched controls.

The market, based on strain, has been bifurcated into H5, H7, and H9. Based on application, the avian influenza vaccine market has been chicken, turkey, and goose & duck. The Avian Influenza Vaccine Market, based on region, has been divided into the APAC & Middle East, Europe, Americas, and Africa. Analysis by Strain Avian influenza viruses are classified based on their hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)-related proteins. The H5 subtype is associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that can cause severe disease in poultry. The H5 subtype is generally associated with the emergence of highly pathogenic influenza strains, which can cause severe disease in poultry populations Avian influenza vaccines targeting these specific subtypes are being developed to prevent the spread of the HPAI virus in poultry. Vaccination helps reduce the incidence of serious diseases in the poultry industry and reduces economic losses. Vaccines targeting the H7 subtype are needed to prevent the spread of HPAIs in poultry populations. These vaccines are designed to boost the immune system and reduce the severity of the disease. The presence of the H7 subtype increases the risk of the virus becoming more virulent, this poses a threat to livestock and public health. Avian influenza vaccination for the H7 subtype plays an important role in risk prevention and active control. Timely vaccination of birds can prevent the evolution of pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) into highly contagious forms. Analysis by Application Turkey is a major focus of the global avian influenza vaccine market as they are one of the most widely raised poultry species worldwide. The development and use of avian influenza vaccines for poultry is essential to protect the poultry industry and prevent economic losses due to pandemic outbreaks. Like chickens, chicken is susceptible to bird flu virus. Vaccination is an important preventive measure to protect turkey populations. The global avian influenza vaccine market can differentiate between poultry and turkey vaccines to meet the specific needs of each animal species. Global Avian Influenza Vaccine Market By Strain (%) To get detailed analysis on other segments, Request For Free Sample Report Avian Influenza Vaccine Market Regional Insights The global avian influenza vaccine market is dominated by Asia Pacific. This can be attributed to increased poultry production and increasing outbreaks of bird flu in the region. China produced 13,900 thousand metric tons of poultry meat in 2022, according to a recent Foreign Agricultural Service/USDA report, it is estimated that the U.S. will exhibit significant market growth due to growing meat and poultry industry, increasing animal health expenditure. Asia-Pacific is expected to register a steady revenue CAGR over the forecast period due to higher R&D activities, higher incidence of liver diseases, unmet medical needs and investments due to the region’s increasing healthcare industry.

This virus is commonly found in waterfowl and can infect domestic chickens and other bird species. Based on viral surface proteins, subtypes of influenza type A viruses can be classified into neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA). Based on their molecular characteristics and ability to cause disease and death in chicken avian influenza viruses are classified as highly pathogenic and low pathogenicity but both in poultry, high prevalence is reported. Nonpathogenic bird flu viruses show no signs of illness. Only mild diseases such as egg decline and wildflies show it. However, infection with the highly pathogenic influenza virus is associated with high mortality. Growing Incidence of Poultry Mortality Increasing incidence of disease, especially in developing regions, is a major cause of mortality in more than 90% of poultry farms. High demand for poultry vaccines, ongoing research to develop effective vaccines, and rising incidence of infectious diseases contribute to the global influenza vaccines market but these vaccines rapid deterioration at room temperature in two hours makes it unsuitable for transport to remote villages. Furthermore, according to the U.S. According to the Department of Agriculture (U.S. DA), currently available vaccines do not meet efficacy requirements and therefore, should not be used to treat avian influenza outbreaks. Restraints Viral Mutational Challenges The rapid mutation rate of avian influenza virus presents a challenge to maintain vaccine coverage. There are ongoing research opportunities to understand the dynamics of the virus and to improve the quality of vaccines accordingly. Global Distribution Challenges Global avian influenza vaccination, especially in poultry-rich areas, remains a challenge. There are also opportunities for collaboration in the distribution system to overcome access barriers.

(Supplied)abc.net.auews/calls-to-vaccinate-young-children-against-flu-as-season-begins/103783508Link copiedShareShare articleIn short: Children aged zero to four have reported the highest number of influenza cases so far this year, according to national data.The Immunisation Coalition is calling on parents of children born during the COVID pandemic to get them vaccinated against the flu.What's next? Free vaccinations are available for certain groups, and in some states free for all residents. Parents of children born during the COVID-19 pandemic are being urged to get their children flu shots, with almost 5,000 cases in children aged zero to four so far this year. More than 43,800 people have been diagnosed with influenza so far this year, according to the National Communicable Diseases Surveillance Dashboard (NCDSD).Of those, the highest cohort of those diagnosed with flu so far this year are those aged zero to four, with almost 5,000 reported cases. Last year, those under the age of 14 had the highest influenza notification rate in the country and a "low" vaccination uptake, according to the Department of Health and Aged Care. Chair of the Immunisation Coalition and GP Dr Rod Pearce AM said young children were particularly vulnerable to the flu and the number of recorded flu cases was rising as isolation and COVID-19 cases waned."Not only are they more likely to catch it, but they are also more vulnerable to serious disease," Dr Pearce said."We've now got some children who were born when influenza was not circulating because of COVID, so a three or four-year old child hasn't seen influenza through natural protection so, the only thing they've got to rely on is their flu vaccine, otherwise they're going to be hit by a disease the body has not seen."Influenza is a nasty disease in children, we've always recognised that and that's why we've got a free vaccine, but we've also got a population that hasn't seen the flu before so, they don't have any natural protection."He said 13 children died from contracting influenza last year in Australia.Dr Pearce said the flu season still peaked in winter, but the season was becoming longer, in part due to international travel."Flu is a seasonal and winter season mainly, but we are now seeing it in the northern part of Australia all year round … and the season is going longer," he said.Mother-of-two Hannah Pianta has recently fought off a bad cold after her daughters Alba and Belle contracted a virus. "It’s horrible as a parent, because you’re hearing them breathe and cough," Ms Pianta said."Their sleep is then impacted, and their eating is impacted ... it’s horrible for them."Ms Pianta, who lives near WA's Bunbury region, said she had kept her daughters away from daycare since being on maternity leave and has booked their flu vaccinations this week."They’re not exposed to that time in daycare where there’s more infections going around and their immune system can build up quicker," she said."As a parent, a peace of mind that I can provide for myself, is to try and help my kids not get as sick."Adelaide mother Anh Tran told the ABC her five-year-old son Nicholas was very sick after he contracted the flu late last year. She said her family was travelling at the time when her son woke in the middle of the night with his skin turning "dark red".He had painful joints and a fever that lasted more than three days."Cold and flu symptoms also were present in terms of a runny nose and a cough but with influenza, Nicholas would complain of joint pain," Ms Tran said."So, that's the big difference the really high fevers and joint pain and they don't understand why it just hurts."The mother said her family booked in for flu jabs every year, but her sons contracted influenza at the end of flu season on two occassions."Both of them, they always get it around the four-to-five month mark, and that's what the GP said normally the flu vaccine lasts around three-to-four months," she said.Fewer flu vaccines administered so far this yearAustralian Immunisation Register data shows that from March 1 to April 28, 2,990,814 people had been vaccinated against the flu, compared to 3,573,490 in the same time period last year. Dr Pearce said falling vaccination rates, in part because of a misunderstanding between COVID and the flu, would also have an impact on cases and severity."Our vaccination rates are low compared to last year and the incidence of flu is the same or more and we've just come off a season when we've had flu as a less of a peak, but a longer season," he said."COVID is a different disease, it's doesn't always follow the winter season and it's not such an important disease for children, but nastier for older people, whereas influenza is a nasty disease in children and we've got good, safe vaccines.Fewer Australians have had a flu vaccination so far in 2024, compared to 2023.

(Image: Sina Schuldt / Alamy) Fermín Koop May 8, 2024May 8, 2024 A deadly strain of avian influenza is spreading across the global ocean. Scientists estimate that it has caused the death of tens of millions of poultry and wild birds around the world. Officially called A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, it has also been detected in at least 48 mammal species and is strongly implicated in mass die-offs of sea lions and seals. Bird flu was previously considered primarily a threat to poultry and secondarily a potential human pathogen. But it has now become a terrifying, albeit still largely unquantified, threat to marine life too. Where is it? The current troubling form of the virus was first detected in Europe in autumn 2020. At the end of 2021, it was discovered in North America and has since been recorded in wild birds in every US state. The virus then went south and by December 2022 had reached the southern tip of South America. It has now been detected in Antarctica, as well as Africa and Asia. Only the Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand remain free of it. How is it affecting ocean wildlife? Populations of wild birds have been hit hard across the globe. At least 100,000 from 24 species had died in Peru’s protected areas after contacting the virus between November 2022 and mid-March 2023, a study found. Various mammals have been infected by previous strains of H5N1, mainly dogs and cats and some animals classed as ‘semiaquatic’ such as mink. But the current strain has spread to significantly more species and been reported in 13 marine mammals, according to a March study. Mass deaths have occurred. In Argentina, over 17,000 southern elephant seal pups were found dead on the Valdés Peninsula in a die-off attributed to the virus. There have been at least 24,000 sea lion deaths linked to it recorded in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Víctor Gamarra-Toledo is an author of the March study, and a researcher at the Natural History Museum of Peru’s San Agustín de Arequipa National University. He says the large number of deaths is undermining ecosystem services provided by the animals affected. So many birds have perished in Peru it is lowering the production of seabird excrement that farmers use as fertiliser, he told Dialogue Earth.

The recent wave of avian flu has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of seabirds, seals, sea lions and other marine animals. (Image © Ralph Vanstreels / University of California, Davis) How bad could it get? The virus is already exacerbating the predicament of several species of conservation concern. As well as sea lions and elephant seals, this includes marine otters and dolphins. “It’s a real blow to some species and they will take a long time to recover. The bird flu also reached the Galapagos”, says Claire Smith, UK policy lead on avian influenza at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Of the 56 native Galapagos bird species, 45 are endemic, meaning found only there. Recommended Impacts on wild marine birds have varied widely. In the UK, there has been a 70% reduction of northern gannets at their key breeding ground of Bass Rock. But, on the other side of the world in Antarctica, Adélie penguins tested positive without showing any ill effects. The true impact of the outbreak is hard to quantify. “Any number of deaths is an underestimate. Birds and mammals can die in areas where there’s no surveillance and we don’t find out. We also don’t have much numbers from what’s happening in Africa. Millions of birds have died and the impact on populations is significant,” says Christian Walzer, executive director of health at the Wildlife Conservation Society. How did this problem start? Bird flu is nothing new in the poultry industry. These viruses are categorised as either low or highly pathogenic depending on their lethality to poultry. Highly pathogenic H5N1 was first detected in farmed geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996, and quickly spread through populations of captive, commercial birds. What sets the most recent strain apart is the rapidity with which it spreads and the severity of the disease it causes among wild birds and mammals, experts told Dialogue Earth. “It used to be present mostly in winter, with peaks of infection, and then a big drop. Now the infection is present all year round, generating many risks and more chances of transmission,” says Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America program at the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center, University of California, Davis. A tern colony in Tierra del Fuego, at the tip of South America. Animals typically catch avian flu through contact with infected saliva, nasal secretions or droppings. (Image: Alamy) How is it spreading? In birds, avian influenza primarily spreads through contact with the saliva, nasal secretions, or droppings of infected birds. Once it becomes prevalent among wild populations, it can spread globally as birds migrate, including to marine areas far from farms. Scientists are not yet sure how it passes between birds and mammals. Many infected species are scavengers, suggesting that eating infected corpses could be involved. Healthy animals may also get the virus from contact with faeces from infected members of their own kind. Species that seem to be resistant to severe illness could still be spreading the virus. Recommended In a study published in February, scientists report collecting brain samples from sea lions, one fur seal and a tern found dead on the shores of Argentina. They all tested positive for H5N1 and genome sequencing revealed that the virus was almost identical in each, with mutations that assisted spread in marine mammals. Are humans at risk? Humans can be infected with H5N1, but it is relatively rare and the risk to the public has been widely regarded as low. Most infections have been among those, such as poultry workers, who have had close contact with infected birds. A total of 20 countries have reported 882 cases of bird flu in humans since 2003, half of which were fatal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts advise avoiding close contact with sick or injured birds and mammals. “If the virus can be transmitted between marine mammals, as it’s now believed, that’s a big problem for us [humans],” says Pablo Plaza, an Argentine veterinarian working at the Centro Científico Tecnológico Patagonia Norte. “The virus is here to stay, and while things seem to be calmer now, it can keep on surprising us.” What can be done? Detecting bird flu early is the primary line of defence, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). Early detection and timely reporting of infected birds lets countries know which flu subtypes are in circulation. They can then limit the movements of poultry and monitor wildlife. While there is a vaccine being used on poultry, WOAH says it must be part of a wider disease-control strategy. Culling is one of the recommendations, along with quarantining. We can’t vaccinate wildlife – it would never endChristian Walzer, Wildlife Conservation Society “It’s something we have control over, live poultry travels very long distances,” says Diana Bell, a UK conservation biologist based at the University of East Anglia. Bell suggests making farms self sufficient in rearing eggs and chicks, instead of exporting them internationally. She also advocates stopping the trend towards megafarms that contain over a million birds. Researchers are trialling a vaccine for endangered condors in the US, but implementing this on a large scale in other wild birds would be difficult. “We can’t vaccinate wildlife; it would never end. It’s preferable for the virus to hit a population and for it to develop natural immunity,” says the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Walzer.

The spread of the virus is overlapping with environmental changes due to climate change, and the latter could increase the problem of the former. In Chile, for example, the El Niño weather phenomenon had a strong impact last year on fish that birds rely on for food, placing more stress on animals and likely making them more susceptible to the virus. Vivian Fu, Asian Flyways Initative lead at WWF-Hong Kong, says the ongoing bird flu disaster highlights the importance of a One Health approach. This involves looking at the close connection between the health of people, other animals and our shared environment. For now, ocean researchers face a nervous wait to see where the virus appears next, how badly it harms the animals it infects, and how that reshapes our understanding of the threats to marine life. “Over 40% of the Peruvian pelicans died because of the virus,” Uhart says. “A country might have a conservation strategy with marine protected areas and think that is sufficient to mitigate impacts to a species, but the virus brings a new layer of complexity. “We might think a bird or a marine mammal is doing well based on their conservation status and the number of individuals out there. But then something like this happens and it changes everything.” Share × Copy link to page Republish × Republish this article We encourage you to republish Dialogue Earth articles, online or in print, under the Creative Commons license.

It’s Not a Dire Threat for Most of Us — Yet. • South Dakota Searchlight HOME NEWS Government Environment Economy Health Justice Education Decision 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Government Environment Economy Health Justice Education Decision 2024 9:23 News Story Health Bird Flu Is Bad for Poultry and Dairy Cows. It’s Not a Dire Threat for Most of Us — Yet. By: Amy Maxmen - May 6, 2024 9:23 am The Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State University tests samples from animals for viruses such as avian influenza. (Photo courtesy of Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory) Headlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations. A menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn’t happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak “a low risk to the general public at this time.” Viruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. “As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,” Shah said. “What we’ll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.” What he means is that what’s known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change. With that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now. Q: Who gets the bird flu? Mainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year. What makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it’s spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases — except for the sea lion infections — appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another. The cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus’s genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested. “Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Q: Is this the start of the next pandemic? Not yet. But it’s a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies. Feds to require bird flu tests of dairy cattle before transport Although at least one person has been infected with H5N1 this year, the virus can’t lead to a pandemic in its current state. To achieve that horrible status, a pathogen needs to sicken many people on multiple continents. And to do that, the H5N1 virus would need to infect a ton of people. That won’t happen through occasional spillovers of the virus from farm animals into people. Rather, the virus must acquire mutations for it to spread from person to person, like the seasonal flu, as a respiratory infection transmitted largely through the air as people cough, sneeze, and breathe. As we learned in the depths of covid-19, airborne viruses are hard to stop. That hasn’t happened yet. However, H5N1 viruses now have plenty of chances to evolve as they replicate within thousands of cows. Like all viruses, they mutate as they replicate, and mutations that improve the virus’s survival are passed to the next generation. And because cows are mammals, the viruses could be getting better at thriving within cells that are closer to ours than birds’. The evolution of a pandemic-ready bird flu virus could be aided by a sort of superpower possessed by many viruses. Namely, they sometimes swap their genes with other strains in a process called reassortment. In a study published in 2009, Worobey and other researchers traced the origin of the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic to events in which different viruses causing the swine flu, bird flu, and human flu mixed and matched their genes within pigs that they were simultaneously infecting. Pigs need not be involved this time around, Worobey warned. Q: Will a pandemic start if a person drinks virus-contaminated milk? Not yet. Cow’s milk, as well as powdered milk and infant formula, sold in stores is considered safe because the law requires all milk sold commercially to be pasteurized. That process of heating milk at high temperatures kills bacteria, viruses, and other teeny organisms. Tests have identified fragments of H5N1 viruses in milk from grocery stores but confirm that the virus bits are dead and, therefore, harmless. Unpasteurized “raw” milk, however, has been shown to contain living H5N1 viruses, which is why the FDA and other health authorities strongly advise people not to drink it. Doing so could cause a person to become seriously ill or worse. But even then, a pandemic is unlikely to be sparked because the virus — in its current form — does not spread efficiently from person to person, as the seasonal flu does. Q: What should be done? A lot! Because of a lack of surveillance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have allowed the H5N1 bird flu to spread under the radar in cattle. To get a handle on the situation, the USDA recently ordered all lactating dairy cattle to be tested before farmers move them to other states, and the outcomes of the tests to be reported. But just as restricting covid tests to international travelers in early 2020 allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected, testing only cows that move across state lines would miss plenty of cases. Two veterinarians, hundreds of miles apart, solved a cow sickness whodunit Such limited testing won’t reveal how the virus is spreading among cattle — information desperately needed so farmers can stop it. A leading hypothesis is that viruses are being transferred from one cow to the next through the machines used to milk them. To boost testing, Fred Gingrich, executive director of a nonprofit organization for farm veterinarians, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said the government should offer funds to cattle farmers who report cases so that they have an incentive to test. Barring that, he said, reporting just adds reputational damage atop financial loss. “These outbreaks have a significant economic impact,” Gingrich said. “Farmers lose about 20% of their milk production in an outbreak because animals quit eating, produce less milk, and some of that milk is abnormal and then can’t be sold.” The government has made the H5N1 tests free for farmers, Gingrich added, but they haven’t budgeted money for veterinarians who must sample the cows, transport samples, and file paperwork. “Tests are the least expensive part,” he said. If testing on farms remains elusive, evolutionary virologists can still learn a lot by analyzing genomic sequences from H5N1 viruses sampled from cattle. The differences between sequences tell a story about where and when the current outbreak began, the path it travels, and whether the viruses are acquiring mutations that pose a threat to people. Yet this vital research has been hampered by the USDA’s slow and incomplete posting of genetic data, Worobey said. The government should also help poultry farmers prevent H5N1 outbreaks since those kill many birds and pose a constant threat of spillover, said Maurice Pitesky, an avian disease specialist at the University of California-Davis. Waterfowl like ducks and geese are the usual sources of outbreaks on poultry farms, and researchers can detect their proximity using remote sensing and other technologies. By zeroing in on zones of potential spillover, farmers can target their attention. That can mean routine surveillance to detect early signs of infections in poultry, using water cannons to shoo away migrating flocks, relocating farm animals, or temporarily ushering them into barns. “We should be spending on prevention,” Pitesky said. Q: OK it’s not a pandemic, but what could happen to people who get this year’s H5N1 bird flu? No one really knows. Only one person in Texas has been diagnosed with the disease this year, in April. This person worked closely with dairy cows, and had a mild case with an eye infection. The CDC found out about them because of its surveillance process. Clinics are supposed to alert state health departments when they diagnose farmworkers with the flu, using tests that detect influenza viruses, broadly. State health departments then confirm the test, and if it’s positive, they send a person’s sample to a CDC laboratory, where it is checked for the H5N1 virus, specifically. “Thus far we have received 23,” Shah said. “All but one of those was negative.” State health department officials are also monitoring around 150 people, he said, who have spent time around cattle. They’re checking in with these farmworkers via phone calls, text messages, or in-person visits to see if they develop symptoms. And if that happens, they’ll be tested. Another way to assess farmworkers would be to check their blood for antibodies against the H5N1 bird flu virus; a positive result would indicate they might have been unknowingly infected. But Shah said health officials are not yet doing this work. “The fact that we’re four months in and haven’t done this isn’t a good sign,” Worobey said. “I’m not super worried about a pandemic at the moment, but we should start acting like we don’t want it to happen.” KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT A flock of ducks guided by ‘masters’ at Kainakary in Kuttanad. Recurring bird flu outbreaks have put duck farming, a consistent source of income for several families in the Kuttanad region in Kerala, at a crossroads. The latest bout of avian influenza (H5N1) has resulted in the death/culling of over 65,000 birds, mostly ducks, at six hotspots-five in Alappuzha and one in Kottayam district, causing a sense of uncertainty and apprehension among stakeholders.Abraham Ouseph, a seasoned duck farmer from ward 1 (Kodupunna) in Edathua grama panchayat in Alappuzha, lost his entire flock of 7,500 ducks to the outbreak two weeks ago.“After ducks started to drop dead, I informed the Animal Husbandry Department (AHD). Tests confirmed bird flu. The rest of the ducks were culled by rapid response teams of the AHD. Though the region has witnessed several bird flu outbreaks, my flock was affected for the first time. I have been raising ducks after taking a loan. I suffered losses to the tune of lakhs. I am not thinking about a return to duck farming any time soon,” says Mr. Ouseph, adding that the promised government compensation was too little. With Kuttanad reporting six avian flu outbreaks in the past 10 years, the number of big duck farmers in the backwater region has dwindled from thousands to hundreds. More big and small duck farmers are considering abandoning the business entirely, terming the latest outbreak the “final nail in the coffin”.It casts doubt over the sustainability and viability of traditional duck farming practices in the region. Though the outbreak has directly impacted only a small number of farmers, it put almost all the stakeholders in trouble with the authorities regulating the trade of meat and eggs of ducks along with chicken and quail in a bid to tackle the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza. According to farmers’ associations, between 10 lakh and 15 lakh ducks are reared in the region annually. The production is certain to fall further if bird flu continues to wreak havoc in the region, they say. Unlike the poultry farming method of rearing birds indoors, farmers in Kuttanad, known for its vast backwaters and paddy fields, rear ducks (Chara and Chembally- two local breeds) in the open. They move ducks from one place to another for feeding. This, according to experts, makes the birds more vulnerable to diseases like avian influenza as the place is frequented by migratory birds. Experts say that being a threat to human health and affecting tourism, avian influenza outbreaks should be handled with due importance but at the same time government should provide all support to duck farmers. “It is difficult to control and eradicate bird flu. At the same time, things can be done to make the outbreaks less severe. Steps should be taken to boost the immunity of ducks. As there is a real threat of local breeds going extinct, it is important to conserve germplasms,” says A. Jalaludeen former Director of Academics and Research, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, adding that stringent post-outbreak restrictions are damaging the poultry sector.There are also calls for a cap on the number of birds a farmer can raise along with mandatory registration for duck farmers. The farmers, meanwhile, demand the setting up of a biosafety level 3 laboratory in the region for testing samples, introduction of an insurance scheme and increasing the compensation amount. .

But if H5N1 sparks a pandemic, making enough doses won't be easyBoth global and Canadian health officials say pandemic plans are in place to help produce H5N1 vaccines, in the event that bird flu starts spreading between humans. But how simple is that process? Scientists warn another pandemic-level vaccine rollout would be fraught with challenges.Canada among countries with pandemic plans, as scientists warn vaccine rollouts would be complexLauren Pelley · CBC News · Posted: May 11, 2024 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: May 11People receive a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination clinic in Toronto in June 2021. Scientists warn another pandemic-level vaccine rollout would be fraught with challenges, even though vaccine candidates for a dangerous form of bird flu, H5N1, already exist. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)Social SharingThis story is part of CBC Health's Second Opinion, a weekly analysis of health and medical science news emailed to subscribers on Saturday mornings. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.While there's no sign a dangerous form of bird flu has gained the ability to transmit between humans, the steady spread of the virus to new species of mammals — most recently, dairy cattle throughout the U.S. — suggests H5N1 is closer to us than ever before.Officials are quick to note that without a few key evolutionary leaps, this pathogen won't spark a human health crisis. Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) health emergencies program, said as much during remarks on Wednesday."Nobody is suggesting that H5N1 is the new, next pandemic. I don't believe anybody can predict that," he said. "But it's certainly concerning when a virus like this begins to infect multiple mammalian species, which means the virus that is adapting to [animals] that are more like us than birds, and therefore there's a higher level of alert."Given the risks, WHO officials say that behind-the-scenes processes are in place, including agreements with drugmakers, to produce "billions" of H5N1 vaccine doses within the first year of a pandemic, should this virus gain the ability to spread between humans.Other scientists warn that's easier said than done, given the complexities involved in manufacturing and distributing a new set of vaccines."Even though we have a massive global infrastructure capable of producing flu vaccines… we will never be ready for a pandemic," McMaster University immunologist and vaccine researcher Matthew Miller said.No stockpile in CanadaThe spread of H5N1 throughout cattle herds across at least nine U.S. states is the latest curve ball from a virus that's proven adept at latching onto new hosts, raising questions over whether the world is prepared for more surprises.U.S. farm workers in multiple states may now be in regular contact with infected cattle, as officials are monitoring at least 260 people for symptoms — amid growing concerns that limited testing could be masking the true scale of the outbreak, both in cows and in humans. (On Friday, the U.S. federal government did announce major funding to expand testing efforts, which includes paying up to $75 to farm workers who take part in studies.)Early research, which hasn't yet been peer reviewed, also suggests the cells in cows' mammary glands can be infected by both avian and human influenza viruses. Scientists warn that scenario may provide a viral mixing vessel, fuelling the development of adaptations that hike the risk to human hosts.None of these signals are a smoking gun that H5N1 will evolve to sustain transmission in a human population. Yet the possibility is always present, even if the virus's next moves remain somewhat unpredictable.Workers from the Animal Protection Ministry cull chicks to contain an outbreak of bird flu, at a farm in the village of Modeste, Ivory Coast, in 2015. (Luc Gnago/Reuters)In response to questions from CBC News, WHO officials stressed that there are two H5N1 vaccine candidates already available that could be used in a pandemic scenario, along with options targeting other forms of avian influenza. There's no need to begin manufacturing these shots now, the WHO's Ryan said. Scaling up to produce pandemic vaccines would also mean a trade-off where manufacturers are forced to hit pause on annual shots for other strains."You can't just press the button and begin producing pandemic [H5N1] vaccines," Ryan said. "You have to stop producing your seasonal vaccine, and all of you out there know how life-saving that vaccine is... so this requires very careful consideration."Some countries have H5N1 vaccines already on hand, including the U.S., which has two types of shots that are well matched with the currently circulating strain in dairy cattle. Both candidate vaccines are available to manufacturers, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The CDC is also testing human blood samples from people previously vaccinated with H5N1-based vaccines to see how it reacts to virus samples taken from the recent human case in Texas. So far, their research suggests vaccination "will offer good cross-protection against cattle outbreak viruses."Here in Canada — where no cases have been reported yet in dairy cattle — federal officials say they're not acquiring a fixed stockpile of shots, since any changes in the virus that would allow it to transmit between humans could "fundamentally influence the antigen required for a human vaccine."Currently, there are two H5N1 vaccines authorized in Canada, based on strains from previous outbreaks. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) also has agreements with several vaccine manufacturers, both domestic and international, the agency noted in a statement.A GlaskoSmithKline facility in Quebec, for instance, produces seasonal flu shots each year, and one of its subsidiaries also developed one of the country's two authorized H5N1 shots. That vaccine is approved for use in children six months of age and older, and no special safety concerns were identified in clinical studies, according to Health Canada's regulatory decision on its use."Under these contracts, the vaccine production process would be triggered by a WHO pandemic influenza declaration or a decision by the Government of Canada that influenza vaccine manufacturers switch from seasonal to pandemic influenza vaccine production," PHAC's statement continued.Lessons from COVID-19While those preparations paint a rosy picture of countries' ability to rapidly respond, Miller, from McMaster, stresses that the process — from testing to manufacturing to shipping — is complex and lengthy, even in a best-case scenario.He pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which drugmakers raced to develop brand-new vaccines for a never-before-seen threat. The pace of those trials was astounding; shots began rolling out in some countries as early as December 2020. A COVID-19 vaccination clinic at the Vancouver Convention Centre in Vancouver on Jan. 13, 2022. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Yet, a year later, infections and deaths soared to new heights thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant, even as vaccination campaigns kept rolling out through the population.It wasn't because the shots weren't effective, Miller added, "but because the virus evolves, and that causes problems."The explosive spread of H5N1 among dairy cattle in mere months also points to how fast this kind of situation can change. Miller agrees that while it's a simple switch to start producing pandemic-based vaccines, manufacturing and distributing eight billion global doses can't possibly happen overnight.And the challenges don't stop there. Jillian Kohler, a professor at the University of Toronto whose research focuses on global access to essential medicines, says nationalism and rampant misinformation would surely complicate vaccination efforts in the event of another pandemic. "There are a lot of variables that could easily derail getting vaccines out. And it's not just getting vaccines out, it's getting people to accept the vaccines."Vaccine equity, she says, also remains a major issue. During the COVID pandemic, wealthier countries — Canada included — had an oversupply of vaccines, while others went without. And in 2022, when mpox spread worldwide for the first time, vaccines rolled out in many higher-income countries, yet the hardest-hit regions of Africa didn't have any shots.Second OpinionThere's no question H5N1 bird flu has 'pandemic potential.' How likely is that worst-case scenario?Canada expanding surveillance, testing milk for H5N1 avian flu amid U.S. dairy cattle outbreakRaw milk may be riskier amid avian flu outbreak in U.S. Stick to pasteurized dairy, experts warnWithout learning lessons from those prior crises, Kohler warned much of the world could be sidelined during vaccination campaigns if H5N1 ever makes its human-to-human leap.She also questioned the role of private industry in preventing pandemics, including decisions over which shots and customers to prioritize at any given time."Why are we relying on drugmakers to make the policy decisions that should be in the hands of government?" Kohler asked. "To put trust in the industry to make sure we get the vaccines out in a timely fashion is repeating a mistake that we had before."Scientists warn Canada 'way behind the virus' as bird flu explodes among U.S. dairy cattleABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Truth or bear: Reducing grizzly confrontations on the ranch Cattle producers are no strangers to working through conflict and managing difficult relationships but imagine if your adversary is a… So, here’s what we knew as of April 18 about the bovine influenza A outbreak in the U.S. The disease was first noted in Texas dairy herds in late March, but it wasn’t initially diagnosed as influenza. Genetic sequencing eventually identified the pathogen as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Milk production dropped in infected cows, and they had loose manure as well as decreased feed consumption and rumen motility. Some cows produced thicker milk that looked like colostrum. Older cows in mid-lactation were most likely to be affected, but the cows recovered. Generally, symptoms seem to be mild. It is a zoonotic, and one dairy worker contracted it, after being in contact with infected cattle. It sounds like the worker had something like pinkeye. Cats were infected and died, and people noticed dead birds as well. Dr. John Ellis, speaking on the Beef Cattle Health and Nutrition podcast, notes it likely wasn’t spreading between cats, which is a good thing. Instead, cats may have got a high dose from eating infected birds. The dead birds, in this case, were not migratory waterfowl, but grackles and pigeons. As the disease is far less severe in cattle than birds, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners started referring to it as bovine influenza A virus. The disease has since spread to more states. Although wild birds are the reservoir, it seems the bovine version may also have spread between farms by cattle. There is also some suspicion it spreads by milking equipment on farms. Ellis explains that there are four “sub-families” of influenza virus — A, B, C and D. The A sub-family includes the most important pathogens for mammals and birds. Within those families, there are several “serotypes.” But there’s a lot of variation within serotypes, which can cause confusion. For example, the Spanish flu was an H1N1 virus, but so are seasonal flus, which are milder. The serotype doesn’t tell you much about virulence, Ellis says. The current bovine flu is an H5N1 virus, in the “A” sub-family. The World Health Organization states influenza A viruses have been “rarely reported in bovine species.” Influenza D is more commonly found in cattle. Ellis says there’s a long history of looking for influenza A in cattle. “Whether or not this is really that new or unique is, I think, up for grabs at this point.” ADVERTISEMENT A study published in June 2019 in the National Library of Medicine reviewed research of suspected bovine influenza A cases (Influenza A in Bovine Species: A Narrative Review. doi 10.3390/v110605610). They found cases where influenza A was a likely suspect, with symptoms similar to what we’re seeing now. For example, in 1997, dairy cows in Bristol, U.K., were producing much less milk and were producing antibodies against influenza A. These cows weren’t producing antibodies to other common respiratory diseases. However, no one was able to isolate influenza A virus from infected animals. A lot of the cases in the study were like this — some suggestion that cows had contracted influenza A, a drop in milk production and other symptoms like what we saw in April, but often no concrete proof. But scientists were able to isolate bovine influenza A from time to time. Researchers also infected beef calves and ponies with influenza A. The calves didn’t shed much virus or show clinical symptoms. Study authors kept referring to bovines as “refractory” to influenza A, meaning they seem to be resistant, so that seems like good news. Given the mild symptoms in cattle, you might wonder why the nervousness around bovine influenza A. Part of it is because of the unique way flu viruses can mutate. Influenza viruses have segmented genomes, meaning if a host is infected with two different flu viruses at the same time, the viruses can swap genetics, Ellis explains. Historically, that’s the situation that spawns a pandemic virus. Dr. Nathan Erickson was on the same podcast as Ellis, hosted by Dr. John Campbell. Both Ellis and Erickson agree the flu virus could arrive in Canada, possibly infecting beef cattle, although they don’t see any reason for panic. Erickson says it’s worth considering similarities between production systems, particularly feedlots and dairies. Both are intensively managed, for example. Cow-calf operations are extensively managed, but the cattle do have contact with wild birds, which is difficult to prevent. Erickson says it’s hard to say how high the risk might be from watering from sloughs, for example. Infected dairies will have to think about what to do with infected raw milk. It doesn’t seem prudent to dump it into a lagoon, as it might infect wildlife. On the cow-calf side, feeding raw milk from another herd to bottle calves is ill-advised (there are other disease issues as well). If you have cats and dairy cattle, you may not want to feed them raw milk, either. Think about quarantining new animals or any that have been off-farm. Think about hand washing and other hygiene for people handling animals, too. Monitor livestock and wild birds and call the vet if anything seems suspect. I’m not a farmer, but if I had different types of livestock, I would be thinking about where the flu virus could hitch a ride between species. ADVERTISEMENT Ellis says, based on what’s happened in the past, this flu is unlikely to take off in cattle. But the “critical factor” will be the virus’s adaptability, he says. “In other words, is there going to be a genetic change in that avian flu virus isolate that allows it to better replicate in cattle? The thing to watch for is the hard evidence of spread in the new species.” About the author Lisa Guenther Editor Lisa Guenther is a writer and agricultural journalist based in northwestern Saskatchewan.

Professor Geoghegan explains what this means for NZ, its wildlife and potential human-to-human transmission. by Dr Jemma Geoghegan 07/05/202406/05/2024 Share this:ShareClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) New Zealand is home to many bird species that are found nowhere else in the world. But over 80 percent of them are already endangered. This highly pathogenic virus has killed millions of birds around the world. If, or when, this virus arrives in New Zealand, it will be devastating for our native birds. Photo: Getty Images Expert opinion from University of Otago - Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka Professor Jemma Geoghegan, of the University of Otago, Otakou Whakaihu Waka, co-leads a Te Niwha project aimed at understanding how and where avian influenza could affect Aotearoa New Zealand, as the highly infectious H5N1 virus spreads globally.The virus has now spread to all continents except Oceania and was recently confirmed in a United States dairy worker who contracted it from cows. Professor Geoghegan explains what this means for New Zealand, its wildlife and potential human-to-human transmission.How concerned should we be about bird flu spreading from animals to people?H5N1, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (or bird flu), recently made the jump into dairy cows, infecting multiple farms across the United States. By examining the virus’ genome from cows and other hosts such as birds, scientists believe the virus may be transmitting from cow to cow. If this is the case, it makes it a lot more likely the virus could also transmit from person to person because cows and humans are mammals. That hasn’t happened yet, and it might not. But every time the virus gets into a mammal, it gives it an opportunity to evolve and get better at infecting mammals. This is something scientists, including Te Niwha experts, are closely monitoring.Is there any way we can stop bird flu reaching New Zealand?Unlike the Covid-19 pandemic, we can’t close our borders to infected wildlife. But we can be better prepared for when the virus does arrive. Bird flu has changed dramatically over the last few years. The virus can now infect a much broader host range, and therefore spread across a larger geographical range than was previously thought. So we need to adapt our surveillance systems. We need to get better at spotting then stopping the virus from spreading further. In a recently funded Te Niwha project, my colleagues and I are working on trying to better understand virus transmission among birds in New Zealand. We are also working on ways we can use rapid environmental testing to improve our early warning system.How devastating would it be for our wildlife if it reaches New Zealand?New Zealand is home to many bird species that are found nowhere else in the world. But over 80 percent of them are already endangered. This highly pathogenic virus has killed millions of birds around the world. If, or when, this virus arrives in New Zealand, it will be devastating for our native birds.What should the public do if they see potentially infected wildlife?The signs of H5N1 vary but the most obvious one is several dead birds or other wildlife species. Signs could be milder, including those related to the nervous system such as lack of coordination and involuntary movement. If you see sick or dying wildlife, do not touch them. They should be reported immediately to Biosecurity New Zealand (0800 80 99 66), which regularly investigates instances of disease. Are there any vaccines or treatments available for wildlife?The Department of Conservation are using vaccines in a trial with the aim of protecting our most vulnerable species against bird flu to prevent species extinction. The trial is limited to a small number of threatened native species including takahē and kākāpō. The vaccine being trialled has been used in zoos elsewhere and contains inactivated virus, meaning it cannot cause a bird flu infection.

Influenza (flu) is a contagious acute viral infection that spreads via particle droplets produced by sneezing and coughing.1 Doctors are urging the public, particularly vulnerable populations, to get vaccinated for the 2024 flu season, as it has already arrived. Microbiologist and Pathology Awareness Aotearoa ambassador Dr Juliet Elvy said, “More often than not, people don't think about flu until they have fallen ill with flu, and then it's too late to get the vaccine because there’s no time for immunity to develop, and the risk of becoming very sick is increased.” She continued, "This is particularly important for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and people living with chronic conditions, who may be at higher risk of bacterial super infections following influenza, such as pneumococcal disease and group A streptococcus, making the health risks to these vulnerable groups even greater. The flu vaccine reduces the risk of serious infection and complications for all." A total of 10,165 influenza cases were detected across Aotearoa last year (2023) by the World Health Organisation’s National Influenza Centres (WHO NIC), with influenza A representing 63.2%, and influenza B 36.8% of all influenza cases.2 This is a 43% increase compared to the previous year (2022), when a total of 7,080 influenza viruses were reported by WHO NIC.3 Vaccination remains the most effective tool in combating serious infections and overall spread of influenza. Annual vaccination for influenza is recommended due to long-term protection against the virus waning year-on-year. Dr Juliet Elvy emphasised the critical importance of early vaccination "It takes a few weeks post-vaccination for protection to develop, so it is important to get vaccinated against influenza as soon as possible in order to lower the risk of contracting flu and becoming seriously unwell." She warned, “Historically, the flu season kicks off in May, but throughout the month of April we have already seen influenza in a big way across New Zealand in our communities and hospitals. While the borders were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza cases plummeted, but now with increased international travel and less immunity built up over time, influenza is spreading at a much more rapid rate.” Influenza symptoms can include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, blocked or runny nose, muscle aches, joint pain, headaches, fatigue, and specifically in children, symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea can be common.1 If a person suspects they have flu, the health advice is to rest and isolate, especially from vulnerable populations, along with practicing handwashing and cough etiquette to stop the spread. According to Dr Elvy, the recommended testing modality for influenza for more severely unwell, hospitalised patients is a molecular test such as multiplex PCR due to its ability to test for a number of infections at once, including other respiratory infections such as RSV and COVID-19 which can present in a similar way. She added, “Specific antiviral treatments, such as Tamiflu, can limit the severity of influenza and are available to severely unwell patients admitted to hospital.” The influenza vaccine is free in New Zealand for people who are 65 and over, pregnant, have a mental illness or addiction, have a long-term condition such as asthma, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, and those under four years who have been hospitalised due to a respiratory illness in the past.4 Kiwis who do not qualify for the funded vaccine have the option to pay a fee for the flu vaccine through GPs, pharmacists, and other private immunisation providers. Dr Elvy said, “I’m concerned that Aotearoa could have quite a big flu season this year if vaccination isn’t high enough, particularly among vulnerable groups, in addition to having lower immunity across our communities because we've had less influenza circulating over the last couple of years. "Our hospitals and healthcare systems will struggle to cope with a big flu season. Steps such as early vaccination and adhering to respiratory illness best practices, should be followed by all to keep our vulnerable communities safe. Flu season is already here.” International studies indicate that large influenza seasons are predicted in the coming years following the lighter flu seasons experienced when isolation measures were taken against COVID-19. Therefore higher influenza vaccination is necessary to reduce the projected increase in disease burden.5 You can capture your thoughts, and the time to Read, Watch, Listen or Delve, against your account but first you'll need to be logged in.

Photo: Supplied/St Jude Hospital If the latest mutation of bird flu currently infecting cows in the United States figures out human-to-human transmission, the timing could not be worse, a prominent Kiwi flu researcher says. H5N1 has made the jump to cattle, showing up in herds across the US in recent weeks. Scientists believe the virus might be passing from cow to cow, not relying on transmission from infected birds. There are reports of cats on farms getting infected after drinking the cows' milk, and one case of a human in the US contracting the disease after contact with cattle. Dr Richard Webby is an infectious diseases researcher at Saint Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and the director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Influenza Studies. He told RNZ's Sunday Morning the virus' sudden jump into cows and its fast spread took experts by surprise. "It's almost like the Crusaders losing five in a row. Had you asked me six weeks ago what the chance [was] of finding this virus in cows, I would have said none. So it's a completely new event for us. "We think we know this virus, and then something happens next week that teaches us that we didn't really know anything about it." There have been hundreds of human H5N1 cases reported since the virus was discovered in the late 1990s - about half of those fatal, making it potentially far deadlier than Covid-19, even before we had vaccines. A recent international survey of senior disease experts revealed 57 percent think a strain of flu will be the cause of the next global outbreak of deadly infectious illness. "Influenza is always at the top of the list," Webby said. "We don't need to know exactly what the next agent is going to be, but you know, preparing for one may very well give us a leg up [in] preparing for the other." While humans can be infected with H5N1, there is only limited evidence of human-to-human transmission. "It still would rather be inside a bird replicating than anywhere else," Webby said. "But any time it does get into a mammal, that at least theoretically gives that virus a little bit more opportunity to change and perhaps be a little bit more mammal, like a little bit more able to infect mammals, including humans. "So, from that perspective, any time we see it in a mammal it's of concern, but we're now going into this a little bit blind, to be honest with you - we don't know what is likely going to happen here. We don't know what the virus is going to do in terms of changing."

A lot of them are actually viruses that we humans have given them and they've managed to be maintained. "But when we look at what we do know about the different hosts, we do know that when these avian viruses, if they get into pigs, then growth in the pig can actually make those viruses more infectious for humans. So, yeah, that's why we absolutely don't want this virus in that host." It it unlikely we will get any advance warning from scientists if it did start spreading between people, he warned. "If all of a sudden the virologic stars align and what's a bird virus in a cow one day suddenly gets all of the mutations it needs to be a human virus, then the chances of us picking that up in advance are pretty slim. We're going to find that when we start to see accumulation of human cases." As for New Zealand's sizeable dairy industry, Webb said the risk - for now - was low. "I think if I was a cow in New Zealand, to be honest, I'd be feeling pretty safe from this virus. If I was a chicken, maybe I'd be feeling a little less safe. But what I mean by that is this episode in cows, this is the first time we've even seen it over the 25-odd years that we've been tracing. "The great, great, great, great, great granddaddy and grandmothers of this virus started in Southeast Asia back in the late 1990s. We haven't seen it in cows before. So, even though this virus has been there for that long, it's transitioned to cows, it's been pretty rare. "So, put yourself in a New Zealand situation. If you're a cow in New Zealand, it's not just the fact that this virus doesn't seem to get into cows very much, but you don't even have the virus there yet. So it's a pretty safe place to be." The Ministry for Primary Industries and Department of Conservation have been preparing a contingency plan for an inevitable "tsunami" of bird flu coming to New Zealand. It has already been found in Antarctica. There are some migrating birds that visit New Zealand. "Just because New Zealand doesn't have it yet, I don't think, I wouldn't say that's going to be a true statement forever. But the chance of it, one, getting into New Zealand and then two, getting into a New Zealand cow, I think that the chances are pretty slim." Coming so soon after the world-changing Covid-19 pandemic, the biggest of its kind in a century, Webby feared the public would not take the threat seriously. SARS-CoV-2 - the virus behind Covid-19 - made the leap to humans from an animal host sometime in late 2019, scientists believe. "This is a bad time for this to be happening - 'It's those scientists again, they're going to worry us about a virus that's going to come and kill us all tomorrow:'...People don't want to hear about this. "They don't want to hear about being vaccinated against a new virus again. So yeah, [the] timing is not good, for sure." If an outbreak in humans did happen, Webby also feared officials - despite lessons learned from Covid-19 - would not be ready. "It may not be this virus, but something is absolutely going to do that. It's going to jump from an animal into humans and we're going to be Covid pandemic all over again, or it could be Covid pandemic sort of supercharged as well. "There's clearly not enough resources going into this preparedness of pandemics, and that's not a New Zealand-centric issue, it's not a US-centric issue, it's a global issue. You know, it's almost like we're not willing to sort of put those resources into the insurance we really need."

There are reportedly four active cases of patients in Cachar while in Hailakandi, there has been one reported death of a 1.5-year-old due to swine flu. Swine flu outbreak in Assam: Symptoms and precautions (HT File Photo) In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Subrata Das, HOD, Internal Medicine and Diabetology at Sakra World Hospital in Bengaluru, shared, “The swine flu outbreak in Assam has raised concerns, as symptoms resemble those of the common flu, including fever, sore throat, cough, runny or stuffy nose, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe cases may lead to breathlessness and complications such as pneumonia and low oxygen levels." He advised, “Precautions against swine flu are similar to those for Covid-19, emphasising the importance of wearing masks, frequent hand washing, disinfecting surfaces and maintaining overall hygiene. Additionally, individuals are advised to cover their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, avoid touching their face, and steer clear of sick individuals. If feeling unwell, it's recommended to stay home to prevent further spread of the virus. Adults need to receive the annual flu vaccine, which shields them against severe complications of flu.” H1N1 is simply one of the strains of the influenza virus, that causes H1N1 flu, also commonly called “swine flu” as it was originally found in pigs. The virus is quite contagious and spreads between humans quickly and effectively, causing symptoms similar to those of the regular human flu. Key precautions to avoid swine flu or H1N1:1. Being informed – it is critical to rely on credible medical information for awareness, when it comes to infectious diseases 2. Covering the nose and mouth with a tissue when one coughs or sneezes. Be sure to dispose the tissue immediately after use, in a safe manner 3. Frequent handwashing with soap and water or use of hand sanitizers 4. Avoiding close contact with those who are obviously or suspected to be sick 5. Isolation to prevent spreading it to others 6. Most importantly, getting an annual influenza vaccine helps reduce the risk and severity of H1N1. Catch every big hit,...

a seasonal spike in sickness when more Kiwis die than at any other time of the year.Now, an analysis of nearly 150 years of data has shed new light on how this winter jump in deaths has changed over time.Over the four coldest months, the Otago University research found mortality rates to be 22 per cent higher than the rest of the year.Before Covid-19, this “excess winter mortality” accounted for about 1450 deaths per year – or about four times the national road toll.While the cold months now aren’t as much a killer as they were a century ago – excess winter deaths made up nearly 8 per cent of annual deaths in 1920, compared with 4.5 per cent in the 2010s – some of the biggest drivers remain.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“The things that are more likely to kill people in winter, compared to other seasons, are respiratory illnesses,” study author Dr Lucy Telfar-Barnard said.That notably included influenza – pre-Covid modelling attributed the flu to 500 deaths in New Zealand each year – and others like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).The study didn’t include recent years in which coronavirus – responsible for more than 1300 deaths last year – has been widely circulating, although Telfar-Barnard noted Covid-19 still wasn’t following a seasonal pattern like flu.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.But the analysis did highlight sharp spikes in deaths over bad flu years - including the 1957 pandemic, 1996′s severe season and a period following the disastrous 1918 pandemic.Telfar-Barnard added respiratory nasties weren’t the only known killers over winter.“We also see more circulatory system deaths, like heart attack and stroke, but the reasons for that are a bit more complex.”One was circulating viruses putting pressure on our immune system, and in turn our cardiovascular system; another was our blood thickening to cope with the cold, which could cause clotting.“There are a range of other factors [behind winter deaths] that are a bit harder to interpret, but respiratory illness seems to be the big one.”Ultimately, she said the analysis couldn’t pin-point any single factor behind the gradual drop in winter deaths over the last century – like the flu vaccine or healthier housing – so the study team simply put it down to higher quality of life.Along with the long-term toll of Covid-19, the researchers were interested to tease out the impact of climate change, which meant milder winters, but more deaths from summer heatwaves.Jamie Morton is a specialist in science and environmental reporting. He joined the Herald in 2011 and writes about everything from conservation and climate change to natural hazards and new technology.SaveShareShare this articleCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitter/XLinkedInRedditLatest from New ZealandNew ZealandCeremony marks opening of 11 relocatable homes at Ōmāhu Marae12 Nov 05:30 AMNew ZealandUpdatedEmergency services responding to fire in Auckland suburb of Ōtara12 Nov 05:26 AMNew ZealandUrgent search under way for missing 9yo girl in Hamilton12 Nov 05:08 AMSponsored: Make sure your valuables are coveredsponsoredAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandCeremony marks opening of 11 relocatable homes at Ōmāhu Marae12 Nov 05:30 AMDreams and aspirations were realised as 11 new homes opened at Ōmāhu.Emergency services responding to fire in Auckland suburb of Ōtara12 Nov 05:26 AMUrgent search under way for missing 9yo girl in Hamilton12 Nov 05:08 AMPharmac to disestablish its Māori advisory group12 Nov 05:01 AMsponsoredOtago pinot leads NZ wine resurgenceNZ HeraldAbout NZ HeraldMeet the journalistsNewslettersClassifiedsHelp & supportContact usHouse rulesPrivacy PolicyTerms of useCompetition terms & conditionsOur use of AISubscriber ServicesNZ Herald e-editionsDaily puzzles & quizzesManage your digital subscriptionManage your print subscriptionSubscribe to the NZ Herald newspaperSubscribe to Herald PremiumGift a subscriptionSubscriber FAQsSubscription terms & conditionsPromotions and subscriber benefitsNZME NetworkThe New Zealand HeraldThe Northland AgeThe Northern AdvocateWaikato HeraldBay of Plenty TimesRotorua Daily PostHawke's Bay TodayWhanganui ChronicleVivaNZ ListenerWhat the ActualNewstalk ZBBusinessDeskOneRoofDriven CarGuideiHeart RadioRestaurant HubNZMEAbout NZMENZME careersAdvertise with NZMEDigital self-service advertisingBook your classified adPhoto salesNZME Events© Copyright 2024 NZME Publishing LimitedTOPBlackpink's Jisoo Receives Bunny-Themed Coffee Truck From Snowdrop Co-Star Jung Hae-In On Influenza Sets.

Based on 889 human infections since 2003, the disease has a 52 per cent mortality rate.“For some reason, in the last five years [avian flu] has become supercharged,” Professor Michael Ward, chair of Veterinary Public Health at the University of Sydney, said. “It’s exponentially increased in terms of these spillover events and the dynamics of it have certainly shifted up a gear.”A devastating ‘panzootic’Spillover events refer to when a virus leaps between species.A mild form of bird flu circulates naturally in waterfowl, mostly ducks and geese. But when this low pathogenic form of the virus infects domestic poultry flocks it can mutate into a deadly, highly pathogenic version of the virus and spill back over into wild birds.A bald eagle that tested positive to avian influenza receives treatment at rehabilitation centre in Milwaukee.Credit: APClade 2.3.4.4b probably emerged in this way in 2021 and now the world is in the grip of a bird flu panzootic – an animal pandemic.AdvertisementScientists have reported horrific scenes of South American beaches littered with the bodies of 17,400 elephant seal pups. The virus has killed polar and grizzly bears, decimated Peruvian pelican populations and infected bottlenose dolphins, lions and skunks.The virus has ripped through the world’s largest northern gannet colony in the UK, killing 70 per cent of the population and turning survivors’ eyes from blue-white to black. Scientists don’t know why.In northern gannets, the birds that survive avian influenza are left with blacked-out eyes.Credit: GettyAnd, for the first time, bird flu has spread to Antarctica, where it could have a catastrophic effect on penguins and seals.“These viruses seem to now be jumping into mammals and back into birds, which we haven’t really seen before,” Ward said. “The more often that happens, the more likely it is that at some point, these viruses are going to start picking up undesirable characteristics that then would allow them to transmit from human to human. The cattle example in the US is sort of going down that path.”First infection in cows leads to latest human caseLoadingOn March 25, US officials announced the virus had infected a herd of dairy cows in Texas, the first cases of avian flu in cattle. A month later, at least 34 herds across nine states were sick with the flu.New genomic analysis shows the strain was circulating undetected in cows since early January and may have gained at least one adaption linked to viral spread in mammals.Amid the cow outbreak, a dairy farmworker fell ill with the virus which, unusually, manifested as conjunctivitis. The strain was not one that could pass on to another person and the man recovered.But the incident prompted WHO’s chief scientist, Dr Jeremy Farrar, to say he held enormous concern about a scenario in which the virus “evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then, critically, the ability to go from human to human”.Avian flu jumped into cattle for the first time in Texas earlier this year and may have been spreading from cow to cow.Credit: APInfection in pigs could be particularly dangerous because they’re “mixing vessels” that can catch strains of human and bird flu, Ward said.In a coinfected pig, “one virus could pick out characteristics from the other,” Ward said. “That sort of situation can set up one of these super viruses that has that ability to transmit much more easily.”Why does Australia remain virus-free?Despite the concern, humans are still a “dead end” host for bird flu. The virus has never achieved sustained transmission between humans and it remains a bird-adapted disease, said Dr Frank Wong, a bird flu expert for WHO from the CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness.“There’s still no conclusive evidence that cattle were spreading it to each other through a respiratory infection,” Wong said. “When you sample the cattle, the viral load is mainly in mammary glands, the udders and in milk, and not in the respiratory tract of cows.”The virus may have spread between cows through unsterilised milking equipment or feed, not in an airborne manner like COVID-19, limiting its potential to take off as a human pandemic.Australia remains a hold-out for the disease, Wong said, because of strict biosecurity laws and the fact the continent isn’t a major stopover for the species of migrating ducks and geese that carry the virus. But a Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry report recently upgraded the risk of highly pathogenic bird flu arriving in Australia to high. The report said migratory shorebirds, shearwaters and nomadic waterfowl were species that could bring the virus to Australia.LoadingThe first sign of the disease here, Wong said, would probably come from a mass die-off of wild birds or from a suddenly ill backyard chicken flock. Detection of the virus in poultry would trigger a swift “stamping out” measure, or culling of affected flocks, which is how authorities stamped out eight previous outbreaks of the disease.DAFF investigates mass bird die-offs and also conducts general surveillance of wild bird faeces to test for the virus’s presence. Wong’s lab checks if positive samples are of the exotic, problem variant or the low pathogenic strain that naturally circulates.The clade behind the latest worldwide outbreak has never been detected in Australia.The Examine newsletter explains and analyses science with a rigorous focus on the evidence.
