MARCH8 has been reported to inhibit the infection of HIV-1 and a few other viruses, thus plays an important role in host antiviral defense. However, the antiviral spectrum and the underlying mechanisms of MARCH8 are incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that MARCH8 profoundly inhibits influenza A virus (IAV) replication both in vitro and in mice. Mechanistically, MARCH8 suppresses IAV release through redirecting viral M2 protein from the plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. Specifically, MARCH8 catalyzes the K63-linked polyubiquitination of M2 at lysine residue 78 (K78). A recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus carrying the K78R M2 protein shows greater replication and more severe pathogenicity in cells and mice. More importantly, we found that the M2 protein of the H1N1 IAV has evolved to acquire non-lysine amino acids at positions 78/79 to resist MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Together, our data support the important role of MARCH8 in host anti-IAV intrinsic immune defense by targeting M2, and suggest the inhibitory pressure of MARCH8 on H1N1 IAV transmission in the human population.

MARCH8, one of 11 members of the MARCH family, was first identified as cellular modulators of immune recognitions (c-MIR)9,10,11,12. It constitutively poly-ubiquitinates conserved lysine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the MHC II chain. The ubiquitinated MHC II is recognized by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and delivered to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation13. Non-ubiquitinated MHC II is also endocytosed, but recycles to the plasma membrane12. In thymic epithelial cells, MARCH8 restricts cell surface expression of MHC II, thus modulates CD4+ T cell selection14,15.MARCH E3 ligases have been shown to limit viral replication and attenuate viral pathogenesis. MARCH8 reduces HIV-1 replication by downregulating viral envelope glycoprotein which is blocked from incorporating into virions16,17. Similar antiviral functions have been reported for human MARCH1 and MARCH218,19. MARCH5 interacts with hepatitis B viral X (HBX) protein, which is mainly accumulated in mitochondria, and targets it for degradation, thus alleviating HBV-mediated liver disease. Furthermore, MARCH8 has very broad antiviral activity by inhibiting Ebola virus glycoprotein, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein, and avian influenza virus H5N1 hemagglutinin maturation20. On the other hand, some viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue virus, and Zika viruses recruit MARCH8 to ubiquitinate viral proteins and promote viral replication21. It appears that MARCH proteins have complex interactions with different viruses.Influenza A virus (IAV) is an enveloped, segmented, negative-strand RNA virus, belonging to the Orthomyxoviriae Family. As an important human viral pathogen, IAV has caused severe pandemics in history, and causes seasonal flu every year22. IAV entry is mediated by its hemagglutinin (HA) protein23. Neuraminidase (NA) and the M2 protein are also incorporated into IAV viral membrane24,25. NA is important for the release of IAV particles from cell surface by cleaving the sialic acid, the receptor of IAV26,27. M2 has a role in both the assembly of IAV and the uncoating of viral core during entry28,29. While a number of cellular proteins have been reported to restrict IAV infection, the effect of MARCH proteins has not been examined.In this study, we report that MARCH8 limits IAV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Instead of targeting IAV envelope glycoprotein HA, MARCH8 catalyzes ubiquitination of M2 protein at position K78, leading to M2 degradation in lysosomes. Importantly, a recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) H1N1 IAV carrying the K78R M2 protein becomes resistant to MARCH8 and exhibits greater virulence in mice.ResultsMARCH8 downregulates viral M2 protein from the cell surfaceGiven that MARCH8 has been shown to downregulate the expression of several viral envelope proteins, we asked whether MARCH8 also affects HA incorporation into IAV particles. The efficiency of IAV HA protein incorporation into pseudovirions was evaluated by viral transduction assay and western blot analysis. MARCH8 did not affect viral transduction efficiency of viruses carrying IAV HA/NA, or IAV HA/NA/M2 (Fig. 1a). However, MARCH8 strongly inhibited the infectivity of the reporter viruses that were pseudotyped with VSV glycoprotein, which is consistent with previous report17 (Fig. 1a). In agreement with the infectivity data, MARCH8 profoundly reduced the level of VSV-G protein both in whole-cell lysate and in virions, whereas the expression of IAV HA and NA proteins was not affected (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b). Unexpectedly, we observed a marked decrease in the level of IAV M2 protein in cells expressing MARCH8 (Fig. 1b), which was further confirmed when only M2 and MARCH8 were expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1c). This inhibition was lost for the E3 ligase-null mutant of MARCH8 (W114A) (Fig. 1d), suggesting that MARCH8 reduces M2 expression through its E3 ligase function.Fig. 1: MARCH8 downregulates M2 from the cell surface.a Infection of HEK293T cells with Lenti-GFP reporter viruses pseudotyped with VSV-G, IAV HA and NA or IAV HA, NA and M2 that were produced in control or MARCH8-expressing HEK293T cells. GFP-positive cells were scored with flow cytometry. b Production of Lenti-GFP reporter viruses pseudotyped with IAV HA and NA or IAV HA, NA and M2 in HEK293T cells without or with MARCH8, followed by western blot. c HEK293T cells were co-transfected with M2, Flag-tagged-GST, and increasing amounts of MARCH8, followed by western blot. d HEK293T cells were transfected with M2 and 50 or 100 ng of wild-type MARCH8 (WT) or the W114A mutant MARCH8 (W114A), followed by western blot. e–h HEK293T cells transfected with either a control vector or the MARCH8 were infected with WSN virus (MOI = 2). The cells were lysed for western blotting (e). M2 expressed on the non-permeabilized cell surface was measured by flow cytometry (f), and relative MFIs of surface M2 were shown in (g). Immunostaining of M2 and MARCH8 was shown in (h). M2 localization in control cells is indicated with arrows and in MARCH8-expression cells is indicated with stars. i–k HEK293T cells transfected with control siRNA or siRNAs against MARCH8 (siMARCH8 #1 and siMARCH8 #2) were cultured for 72 h, then infected with WSN virus (MOI = 2) for 6 h. The cells were lysed for western blotting (i). M2 expressed on the non-permeabilized cell surface was measured by flow cytometry (j), and relative MFIs of surface M2 were shown in (k). In a, g, and k, the values shown are normalized mean ± SD (n = 3), **P < 0.001, n.s., not significant, unpaired two-tailed Student t-test.Full size imageWe next examined whether MARCH8 also decreased M2 expression during IAV infection. HEK293T cells were transfected with the MARCH8 plasmid DNA before exposure to the infection by influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (WSN) at MOI of 2. MARCH8 decreased M2 markedly without affecting viral proteins HA, NA, NP, PB1, and PB2 (Fig. 1e). We further examined cell-surface expression of M2 by immune-staining and flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of M2 in MARCH8-expressing cells was twofold lower than in the control cells, whereas the W114A MARCH8 mutant did not exert a significant effect (Fig. 1f, g). This observation is supported by data of confocal imaging showing that MARCH8 prevented the localization of M2 protein to the cell periphery, but did not affect NP trafficking (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1b). We then knocked down endogenous MARCH8 in HEK293T cells with siRNA, and found that MARCH8 deficiency supported a boost in M2 protein following IAV infection, while did not affect HA, NA, NP, PB1, PB2, and M1 accumulation (Fig. 1i). Cell-surface M2 was twofold higher in MARCH8-knockdown cells than that in the control cells, as shown by the results of flow cytometry (Fig. 1j, k and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Collectively, these results demonstrate that MARCH8 downregulates viral M2 protein from the cell surface.MARCH8 inhibits IAV replication in respiratory epithelial cellsWe then investigated whether MARCH8 affects IAV replication in respiratory epithelial cells. A549 cell clone was generated to stably express exogenous MARCH8 (Fig. 2a). The control and MARCH8-overexpressing A549 cells were challenged with IAV. Production of IAV from the infected A549 cells was monitored over different time intervals. The results showed that MARCH8 significantly reduced progeny virus titer at each time point tested with either high MOI = 1.0 or low MOI = 0.002 of IAV (Fig. 2b, c). Next, we used siRNA to deplete the endogenous MARCH8 in A549 cells (Fig. 2d). We found that cells lacking MARCH8 allowed greater IAV replication than control cells (Fig. 2e, f). We also generated knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9, which was verified by western blot and further genotyped with PCR (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 2a). IAV replication significantly increased in MARCH8-depleted A549 cells (Fig. 2h, i). The replication of IAV, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2j and Supplementary Fig. 2b) and immune fluorescence staining of viral NP-positive cells (Fig. 2k), was increased in MARCH8-knockout cells than in control cells. These results suggest that endogenous MARCH8 in respiratory epithelial cells substantially inhibits IAV replication.Fig. 2: MARCH8 inhibits IAV replication in vitro.a A549—Vector and A549—MARCH8 cells were constructed and MARCH8 expression determined by western blotting. b, c A549—Vector and A549—MARCH8 cells were infected with WSN virus for indicated times. Viral titers of supernatants were quantified by plaque assay. d A549 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting MARCH8. MARCH8 expression was examined by western blotting. e, f A549 cells transfected with siNC or siMARCH8 were infected with WSN virus. Viral titers of supernatants were quantified by plaque assay. g The endogenous MARCH8 in A549 cells was knocked out through the use of lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9. MARCH8 expression was determined by western blotting. h, i Control (Ctrl) or MARCH8-knockout (KO MARCH8) A549 cells were infected with WSN virus. Supernatants were harvested and viral titers were detected at indicated times. b, e, h MOI = 1. c, f, i MOI = 0.002. j, k Ctrl and KO MARCH8 A549 cells were infected with WSN virus. At 24 h post infection, viral NP protein expression was measured by flow cytometry (j) and confocal microscopy (k). Scale bar, 200 μm. Data represent averages of independent biological replicates and are presented as means ± SD (b, e, and h, n = 4, c, f, i, and j, n = 3). **P < 0.001, n.s., not significant, unpaired two-tailed Student t-test, without any adjustments for multiple comparisons.Full size imageMARCH8 inhibits IAV replication in vivoTo investigate the role of MARCH8 in IAV infection in vivo, we used peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) to deplete MARCH8 in mouse lungs and then evaluated the effect on IAV infection and viral pathogenesis30,31. PBS, the control (PPMO-NC), or MARCH8-targeting PPMOs (PPMO-M8) were administered intranasally in mice for 2 days, before mice were either sacrificed as the baseline or challenged with 200 PFU of PR8 virus on day 0 (Fig. 3a). Depletion of MARCH8 expression in mouse lungs was observed on day 0 (before infection) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Following infection, the PPMO-M8 treated mice lost more weight compared with the PBS or PPMO-NC treated mice (Fig. 3b). Concurrently, much greater titers of IAV were detected in the lungs of MARCH8-knockdown mice on day 3 and day 6 post infection, compared to PBS or PPMO-NC treated mice (Fig. 3c). Histological analysis of lung slices showed PPMO treatment itself did not induce any marked damage to the lung epithelium prior to infection (Fig. 3d, day 0). PPMO-M8 treated mice showed obvious inflammatory cell infiltration at day 3 after IAV infection and showed bronchiolitis reducing the alveolar airspace, and leukocyte infiltration at day 5 after infection. In contrast, PBS or PPMO-NC treated mice showed mild pathogenic changes at day 3 after IAV infection and the extent of bronchiolitis was markedly reduced compared with PPMO-M8 treated mice at day 5 after infection (Fig. 3d, day 3, and day 5). Overall, these results indicate an important role of MARCH8 in protecting mice from IAV infection and in mitigating IAV pathogenicity in mice.Fig. 3: MARCH8 inhibits IAV replication in vivo.Six-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were administered PBS, control (PPMO-NC), or MARCH8 targeting PPMO (PPMO-M8) intranasally for 2 consecutive days. On day 0, two or three mice per group were killed before infection. Fifteen mice per group were infected with PR8 virus (200 PFU) intranasally on day 0. Five mice per group were euthanized on days 3 and 6 post infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected to determine virus titer, and lungs were harvested to histopathology. In five mice per group, survival was studied until day 14 post infection. a Diagram shows experimental plan. b Graph shows mouse body weight ± SD (n = 5 mice) up to 10 days post infection, for at least five mice per group. c Graph shows mean lung virus titer ±SD (n = 5 mice) on days 3 and 6 post infection. d Mouse lungs were isolated on day 0 (before infection), day 3, and day 6 post infection. H&E staining was performed on lung sections. Scale bars represent 200 μm. Histological scoring is shown as mean ± SD (n = 4 mice), *P < 0.01, **P < 0.001, n.s., not significant, unpaired two-tailed Student t-test, without any adjustments for multiple comparisons.Full size imageMARCH8 restricts IAV releaseM2 is an ion channel protein, and promotes IAV replication by modulating cellular homeostasis32. To dissect the role of MARCH8 in viral life cycle, we first examined whether MARCH8 affects virus binding or entry. Cells were incubated with WSN virus for 1 h at 4 °C to allow virus binding, followed by incubation with pre-warmed DMEM at 37 °C to allow virus entry. Quantitative RT-PCR data showed that MARCH8 did not affect virus binding or entry (Fig. 4a, b). We next investigated whether MARCH8 affects IAV RNA transcription and replication using a well-established minireplicon assay. The reporter pPolI-Luc produces a modified influenza virus vRNA in which the coding region is replaced with the firefly luciferase gene. Thus, the firefly luciferase activity reports the overall transcription and replication activities of the viral RNA polymerase complex. We observed similar RdRp activity in MARCH8-knockdown or -overexpressing cells compared to the control cells (Fig. 4c, d). Taken together, these data suggest that MARCH8 does not affect the early stages of the viral replication including virus binding, virus entry, and viral RNA transcription, replication, and translation.Fig. 4: MARCH8 reduces IAV release.a, b HEK293T cells were transfected with vector, MARCH8 or W114A. Cells were incubated with WSN virus (MOI = 5) at 4 °C for 1 h (a) or then allowed to internalize bound IAV by incubation at 37 °C for another 30 min before adding exogenous NA to remove cell-surface virions. Viral binding or entry was assessed by determining the viral copy number in cell lysates by quantitative real-time PCR. c, d HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pPolI-Luc and expression plasmids containing viral PB1, PB2, PA, or NP of H1N1 along with control (NC) or MARCH8 siRNAs (c), MARCH8 or vector (d). Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control. Luciferase activity was determined at 24 h post transfection. e HEK293T cells transfected with MARCH8 or vector were infected with an MOI of 5 of WSN virus for 10 h and thin sections were analyzed by electron microscopy. The scale bars indicate 200 nm. f–h HEK293T cells were transfected with vector, MARCH8 or W114A. Cells were infected with WSN virus at a MOI of 0.2. At 24 h post infection, HA in the supernatants was determined by ELISA (f), and viral protein expression in cell lysates and the released virus particles were detected by western blotting (g). Quantitation of released NP was shown in (h). Data shown are the mean ± SD (n = three independent experiments). **P < 0.001, n.s., nonsignificant, unpaired two-tailed Student t-test, without any adjustments for multiple comparisons.Full size imageIn IAV infection, an important function of M2 protein is to facilitate viral membrane scission, thus allowing the formation and release of progeny IAV virions28,29,33. We thus examined the budding of influenza viruses in HEK293T cells by transmission electron microscopy. In control cells, the budding of IAV virions could be observed at the cell surface. The MARCH8 overexpressing cells presented many IAV virions in the process of budding but impaired in membrane scission and virus particle release (Fig. 4e). Virions on the surface of MARCH8-overexpressing cells remain attached to the plasma membrane as opposed to the completely released IAV particles in the control cells, which suggests a virus budding defect phenotype associated with MARCH8 expression (Fig. 4e). We further measured the level of released IAV particles in the culture supernatants by performing the IAV HA antigen-capture ELISA. Indeed, a 60% reduction in IAV production was observed for the infection of MARCH8-expressing cells (Fig. 4f). We also harvested the IAV particles by ultracentrifugation and observed a 75% decrease in IAV production by MARCH8-expression cells, as shown in Fig. 4g. We did not observe any decrease in the infectivity of pseudovirions carrying IAV HA/NA/M2 (Fig. 1a), which is likely because the viral membrane fission and virus release are carried out by HIV-1 Gag in the pseudovirus system. Together, we conclude that MARCH8 diminishes the expression of IAV M2 protein, inhibits the release and production of IAV particles.MARCH8 ubiquitinates the M2 protein and causes M2 degradation in lysosomesWe then explored the mechanism by which MARCH8 decreases M2. Since MARCH8 associates with endosomes and lysosomes, and targets its substrates to lysosomes for degradation, we tested whether MARCH8 also diminishes M2 levels via the lysosomal pathway. We thus used the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) or bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) in the co-transfection experiments, and observed an increase in M2 expression in MARCH8-expressing cells, whereas did not observe any effect with proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment (Fig. 5a, b). Results of immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that CQ treatment led to cytoplasmic sequestration of M2 and MARCH8 (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Using endosome marker EEA1, lyso-tracker, and lysosome marker LAMP1, we were able to show that MARCH8 redistributed M2 from the plasma membrane to endosomes (Fig. 5d) and lysosomes (Fig. 5e, f). We also assessed the effect of MARCH8 overexpression on the intracellular distribution of M2 along with well-characterized markers of intracellular compartments, including Rab5-EGFP for early endosomes, Rab7-EGFP for late endosomes/MVB, in HeLa cells. In agreement with previous studies, co-localization of M2 with Rab5-EGFP or Rab7-EGFP was detected in MARCH8-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). These data suggest that MARCH8 targets M2 to lysosomes for degradation.Fig. 5: MARCH8 ubiquitinates and leads to M2 degradation in lysosomes.a, b Rescue of M2 expression from MARCH8-induced degradation by lysosome inhibitors. HeLa cells were co-transfected with the M2 plus Vector (−), MARCH8 ( + ), or W114A ( + ). Cells were treated with DMSO, lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ, 50 μm) or proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μm) (a), DMSO or a vacuolar H+ translocating ATPase inhibitor (Balf A1, 100 nM) (b), followed by western blot. c HeLa cells co-transfected with M2 and MARCH8 plasmid were treated with DMSO or CQ and processed for immunofluorescence staining with anti-M2 (green) and anti-MARCH8 antibodies (red). Scale bars represent 10 μm. d, e HeLa cells transfected with EGFP fused M2 and vector, MARCH8 or W114A were permeabilized, then co-stained with MARCH8 (white) and EEA1 (red) antibodies (d) or with MARCH8 (white) and LAMP1 (red) antibodies (e). Scale bars represent 10 μm. f HeLa cells were co-transfected with M2 plus Vector, MARCH8 or W114A. The lyso-Tracker (red) was added to cells 30 min before fixation. M2 (green) and MARCH8 (white) were detected by immunostaining. Scale bars represent 10 µm. Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis was based on multiple sight fields each group (n = 6 fields). *P < 0.01; **P < 0.001; n.s., nonsignificant, unpaired two-tailed Student t-test. g Co-immunoprecipitation of M2 and Flag-MARCH8 in HEK293T cells. h, i MARCH8 ubiquitinates IAV M2. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub, M2 and Vector, MARCH8 or W114A (h). HEK293T cells transfected with HA-Ub and Vector, MARCH8 or W114A were infected with WSN virus (MOI = 2) for 12 h (i). Whole-cell lysates were subjected to IP with anti-M2 antibody, and the IP and input were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against the indicated targets.Full size imageTo test whether MARCH8 causes M2 degradation by ubiquitinating M2, we first confirmed that MARCH8 associated with M2 by performing transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5g). We next examined potential ubiquitination of M2 by MARCH8 in cells which were transiently transfected with M2 plasmid DNA or infected with IAV. We used CQ to slow down M2 degradation so that sufficient amount of potentially ubiquitinated M2 can be recovered for immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. The results showed a significant increase in M2 ubiquitination when MARCH8 was overexpressed, while the W114A mutant did not affect the level of M2 ubiquitination (Fig. 5h, i). We next knocked down (KD) MARCH8 in HEK293T cells and measured the level of M2 ubiquitination. Remarkably, less ubiquitination of M2 was observed in MARCH8 KD cells (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e). Overall, these results demonstrate that MARCH8 ubiquitinates M2, which leads to M2 degradation.MARCH8 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of M2 at position K78The cytoplasmic domain of M2 contains four conserved lysine residues, K49, K56, K60, and K78, which are potential ubiquitination sites. We therefore substitute each of these four lysines for arginine (Fig. 6a), and examined the expression of these mutated M2 in MARCH8-expressing cells. MARCH8 decreased the expression of the K49R, K56R, K60R mutants to the same extent as that of the WT M2, but did not significantly affect the expression of the K78R mutant and the K/R mutant which has all the above four lysine residues mutated (Fig. 6b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5). Importantly, MARCH8 did not enhance ubiquitination of the K78R and K/R mutants (Fig. 6d). Results of immunofluorescence microscopy further showed that in contrast to the wild-type M2, the cell-surface expression of K78R mutant was not diminished by MARCH8 (Fig. 6e). To determine which type of polyubiquitin linkage to M2 is catalyzed by MARCH8, we transfected M2 and MARCH8 DNA into HEK293T cells together with each of the ubiquitin mutants K6O, K11O, K27O, K29O, K33O, K48O, and K63O, each of which contains only one lysine available for polyubiquitination. The results of co-immunoprecipitation and western blot showed that only K63-ubiquitin promoted polyubiquitination of M2 as efficiently as the wild-type ubiquitin (Fig. 6f).Fig. 6: MARCH8 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of M2 at position K78.a Illustration of IAV M2 domain-organization and the cytoplasmic tail amino-acid sequence of WSN virus M2 and the indicated mutants. Lysine residues (K) are marked as red, and the K > R mutants are marked as blue. b, c HEK293T cells were transfected with M2 mutants and vector or MARCH8.

HEK293T cells were transfected with M2 mutants and vector or MARCH8. Cell lysates were subject to IP with anti-M2 antibody, and the IP and input were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against the indicated targets. e HeLa cells were co-transfected with WT or the K78R mutant M2 and vector or MARCH8. M2 and MARCH8 were detected with specific antibodies in confocal microscopy. Scale bars represent 10 µm. f HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin mutants, M2 and MARCH8. Cell lysates were subject to IP with anti-M2 antibody, and the IP and input were analyzed by western blot with antibodies against the indicated targets.Full size imageThe K78R mutant is more virulent than the wild-type IAV while infecting miceTo demonstrate how mutation of K78 in M2 affects IAV replication, we generated recombinant WSN and PR8 that bear the K78R M2 mutant and infected the control or MARCH8-expressing A549 cells with the wild-type or the K78R viruses. Indeed, the K78R viruses showed complete resistance to MARCH8 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 6a). And levels of the K78R M2 protein were not decreased by MARCH8 (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These results suggest that the K78 amino acid in M2 renders IAV sensitivity to MARCH8 inhibition.We next examined the effect of the K78R mutation in M2 on the virulence of IAV in the mouse model (Fig. 7a). Different doses of IAV, from 20 to 1600 PFU, were used to challenge mice. The median lethal dose (MLD50) was fourfold lower for K78R virus (47.7 PFU) than for WT virus (204.1 PFU) (Supplementary Table 1), indicating a marked increase of virulence due to the K78R mutation in M2. At the dose of 200 PFU, K78R IAV-infected mice lost weight more quickly than the wild-type IAV (Fig. 7b), and all of the K78R IAV-infected mice had to be euthanized by day 8, whereas only 40% of the WT virus-infected mice succumbed (Fig. 7c). Associated with the high pathogenicity, much higher titers of K78R IAV were detected in the lungs of the infected mice compared to those of the wild-type IAV (Fig. 7d). Histopathological assessment of lungs from the infected mice showed that K78R IAV caused more serious bronchiolitis and bronchitis and lumen debris accumulation by 3 days post infection. By day 6, mice infected with K78R virus all progressed to bronchopneumonia, as opposed to mice infected with WT virus which showed moderate lung inflammation, and only 3 out of 5 mice displayed evidence of bronchopneumonia (Fig. 7e). These results suggest that K78 in M2 is a determinant of IAV virulence.Fig. 7: Replication of WT and the K78R M2 IAVs in mice.Six-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice (15 per group) were infected with PR8 virus (WT) or recombinant virus having the K78R M2 mutant (K78R) (200 PFU) intranasally. Five mice per group were euthanized on days 3 and 6 post infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were collected to measure IAV titers. Lungs were harvested for histopathology. Survival of mice (five per group) was monitored until day 14. a Experimental plan. b Mouse body weight curves ± SD (n = 5 mice) up to day 14 post infection. c Mouse survival curves for 14 days (n = 5 mice). d Mean lung virus titer ± SD (n = 5 mice) on day 3 and 6 post infection. e Mouse lungs were isolated on day 3 and day 6 post infection.

Since the M2 protein of pdm09 cannot be detected with M2 monoclonal antibody (C7), we attached the flag tag to the C-terminus of M2 to facilitate detection by western blot (Fig. 8a). When the M2 DNA from each of the above IAV strains was transfected into HEK293T cells together with the MARCH8 DNA, the M2 proteins of WSN, PR8, and H3N2 were ubiquitinated and degraded by MARCH8, while M2 of the pdm09 was resistant to MARCH8 (Fig. 8b, c). We next examined the effect of MARCH8 on the replication of different IAV strains. Replication of the seasonal H3N2 and the two laboratory-adapted IAV strains was markedly inhibited by MARCH8, while the pdm09 strain was not affected (Fig. 8d). These data suggest that different IAV strains have different sensitivity to MARCH8 inhibition.Fig. 8: Evolution of H1N1 virus to escape MARCH8 restriction.a HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged-M2 from different IAV strains. Expression of M2 was examined in western blots. b Effect of MARCH8 on the expression of M2 proteins from different IAV strains.

The K78 residues are marked as red. M2 sequences were downloaded from GenBank using the “collapse identical sequences” option. Logos were generated using the WebLogo3 online tool.Full size imageSince the 1918 H1N1 flu pandemic, the causative H1N1 IAV drifted and reassorted with influenza viruses of other species over time, and has caused several flu pandemics and epidemics in history. We aligned M2 sequences of the IAV epidemics from 1918 until the most recent 2019. Clearly, from 1918 to 1957, human H1N1 IAV strains tended to have K78 in M2, although IAV strains containing non-lysine residues at position 78 slowly emerged over time. This evolving trend became clear in 1979 and 1980 when position 78 in M2 was completely occupied by non-lysine amino acids. While MARCH8 target sites (K78) evolved in H1N1 viruses, this site was persisted in H2N2 and H3N2 viruses (Fig. 8e). Having evolved independently of the former H1N1 virus, the M2 gene of pdm09 H1N1 virus was originated from a Eurasian avian-like swine virus. Historically, swine H1N1 IAV strains have a glutamine at position 78 and a lysine at position 79 in the M2 protein. Starting from 1979, K79 began to change to E79, which dominates the circulating swine H1N1 since 2010. The pdm09 H1N1 M2 also has Q78 and E79 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Mutagenesis analysis of 78Q to 78 K or 79E to 79 K showed that K79 functions as the receptor site of ubiquitination in the M2 proteins of pdm09 H1N1 virus (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Overall, these data suggest that in the course of circulating in humans, the H1N1 IAV has gradually changed the K78/K79 sites in the M2 protein to non-lysine amino acids, at least partially to evade MARCH8 restriction.DiscussionIn contrast to many other enveloped viruses, the viral membrane scission and virion budding of IAV are independent of cellular ESCRT, rather are mediated by viral protein M234,35. Both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that the amphipathic helix region (residues 45–62) of M2 plays pivotal roles in this function36,37. A member of the Ca2+ dependent membrane-binding proteins, annexin A6, has been shown to interact with the M2 C-terminal region and interfere with the M2-mediated IAV budding, indicating the presence of cellular mechanisms antagonizing M2 protein38. Our study further shows that IAV M2 protein is a substrate of the MARCH8 E3 ligase, and the polyubiquitinated M2 is targeted to lysosome for degradation. Through this mechanism, MARCH8 profoundly inhibits IAV infection both in cultured cells and in mice.MARCH8 has been reported to inhibit VSV, HIV-1, and other retroviruses by ubiquitinating viral envelope proteins and targeting these key viral proteins for degradation16. Interestingly, we did not observe any marked effect of MARCH8 on the levels of IAV HA and NA proteins in both co-transfection and viral infection experiments. Rather, MARCH8 decreased the expression of viral M2 protein. HA, NA, and M2 are all membrane-bound viral proteins, incorporated into IAV particles, perform different yet essential functions for IAV infection. While HA and NA proteins associate with lipid raft microdomains and initiate viral budding, M2 protein localizes at the neck of the incompletely formed virus particle and mediates membrane scission28,36. During IAV infection, M2 has been shown to localize in Golgi during early infection, then be incorporated into the apical vesicles and travels to the plasma membrane31,39. Our results suggest that in addition to viral envelope glycoproteins, MARCH8 is also able to target other viral membrane-bound proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, and as a result, restrict viral infection.M2 protein plays several key roles in IAV replication. First, it is located at the assembly site of IAV and facilitates the scission of viral membrane and subsequent release of the newly formed IAV particles. Indeed, we observed drastic reduction of IAV production in MARCH8-expressing cells, and a marked increase in IAV production when MARCH8 was depleted with siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. Second, M2 protein can form an ion channel in viral membrane and primes the infectious entry of viral RNAucleocapsid complex into the cytoplasm. In addition, when present in cellular membranes, M2 interferes with the pH levels in early endosomes and trans-Golgi network of the secretory pathways40, thus affecting apical membrane protein trafficking33, which is believed to be one of the mechanisms leading to rhinorrhea and lung edema, causing exacerbation of respiratory pathology41. By restricting the levels of M2 protein in IAV producing cells, MARCH8 may help to mitigate and prevent the cellular pathology associated with M2. Therefore, MARCH8 protects mice from IAV infection not only through direct reduction of IAV replication but also through mitigation of M2-casued damage to cells and tissues.Each E3 ubiquitin ligase has its specific group of substrate proteins, which often underlies the function of the E3 ligase in cells including antiviral defense. Our study revealed IAV protein M2 as a viral protein substrate of MARCH8, thus rendering MARCH8 the role of restricting IAV infection and pathogenesis. We also determined the K78, not the other lysine residues in M2, as the main acceptor of polyubiquitin catalyzed by MARCH8. This finding allowed us to examine how IAV evolves over time to evade MARCH8 restriction through changing K78 to other amino acids. Indeed, while K78 in M2 dominated the IAV strains that were isolated in the flu pandemics from 1918 to 1957, this 78 position in M2 was slowly changed to glutamic acid (E78) in M2 prevailed the H1N1 IAV strains since 1978. The H1N1 virus disappeared in the human population in 1957, was replaced by the H2N2 virus, but returned at 20 years later, in 197742,43. Our study reveals one of the mutations, the K78E mutation, that underlies the adaption of the H1N1 IAV to humans and causes its reemergence in 1977.In our study, the M2-K78R mutation in the PR8 background promotes viral replication in cultured cells and in mice. We further showed that the M2-K78R mutant virus increases M2 accumulation at the cell surface, which was believed to enhance IAV replication based on the previous study reporting that M2 interacts with autophagy factor LC3 at cell surface and augments IAV budding and release44,45. We noted that our results are not in agreement with the deleterious effect of M2-K78R mutation on IAV (WSN strain) replication reported by another group46. How M2-K78R mutation effect on IAV multiple cycle replication still needs further study.A number of innate restriction mechanisms have been discovered that protect mice from lethal IAV infection. One of the first findings in this regard is the interferon-induced myxovirus resistance (Mx) genes that are often defective in mice which are commonly used in laboratories and succumb to IAV infection47. In addition to Mx proteins that target IAV nucleocapsid and inhibit viral RNA transcription48,49,50, IFITM proteins provide another layer of defense against IAV infection by deterring viral entry49,51,52. MARCH genes are not induced by interferon, though Mx and IFITM genes are interferon-stimulated genes. Results of our study demonstrated that deletion of MARCH8 renders mice to succumb to otherwise non-lethal dose of IAV infection, thus uncovering a distinct key intrinsic immune mechanism protecting mice from lethal IAV infection.In summary, our data support the potent restriction of IAV infection by MARCH8 both in tissue culture and in the mouse model. In contrast to other known anti-IAV innate immune factors, MARCH8 acts by targeting IAV M2 protein for ubiquitination-mediated degradation in lysosomes, thus profoundly inhibiting IAV release and production. The inhibitory pressure of MARCH8 on IAV is further supported by evasion of IAV from MARCH8 over the prolonged period of circulation in humans.MethodsPlasmids and reagentsHuman MARCH8-expression plasmids pQCXIP-MARCH8 and its RING-CH domain mutant pQCXIP-MARCH8-W114A were constructed by inserting the MARCH8 cDNA into the Not I/BamH I sites in the pQCXIP retroviral vector (Clontech). The pcDNA3.1 vectors encoding HA, NA and M2 of A/WSN/33(H1N1) were generated as previously described53. M2 DNA sequences from laboratory-adapted influenza virus A/WSN/33(H1N1) (CAA30883.1) and A/PR/8/1934(H1N1) (NP_040979.2), pandemic influenza virus A/Hamburg/4/2009(H1N1) (ACR10231.2) and seasonal influenza virus A/Panama/2007/1999(H3N2) (ABE73112.1) were synthesized and subcloned into the pCMV-Tag 2B vector.Antibodies used for western blot are as follows: MARCH8 (Proteintech; Cat# 14119-1-AP; 1:1000), M2 (Santa Cruz; Cat# SC-32238; 1:2000), H1N1 HA (Sino Bio.; Cat# 11684-RP01; 1:2000), P24 (Sino Bio.; Cat# 11651-RP01; 1:5000), VSV-G (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# V5507; 1:2000), Flag (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# F7425; 1:2000), Myc (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# C3956; 1:2000), NP (Millipore; Cat# MAB8251; 1:1000), NA, NS1, PA, PB1, PB2 (GeneTex, Cat#629696, 1:2000; Cat# GTX125990, 1:2000; Cat# GTX125932, 1:2000; Cat# GTX125923, 1:2000; Cat# GTX125926, 1:2000, respectively), HA.11 Epitope Tag (BioLegend, Cat# 901501 or Cat# 902301; 1:1000), and actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# A1978).Cells, viruses, and animalsHuman embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549), human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS 10% v/v, HyClone) and penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific).To generate respiratory epithelial cell lines that stably express MARCH8, A549 cells were transduced with pQCXIP (Clontech)-based pseudovirus according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To generate MARCH8-knockout cell lines, a lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 expression plasmid pCRISPR-MARCH8 was created by inserting DNA fragments that contain a target sequence of MARCH8 (1#: 5′-GTAAGACCAAAGAAAAGGAG-3′ or 2#: GAGCTCGCAGCAGCGCGTGT) into lentiCRISPR-v2 (Addgene). Cells were transduced with pseudo-viruses expressing ctrl CRISPR-Cas9 or CRISPR-Cas9 targeting MARCH8. Stably transduced cell lines were selected with puromycin, and cell clones were generated with limited dilution. Single clonal cell lines were screened via western blot.The M2-K78R mutant viruses mutPR8 and mutWSN were generated via the reverse genetic system as described previously54. The M segment of PR8 or WSN virus with M2-K78R mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the vRNA-mRNA bidirectional transcription vector pBD. Viruses were generated by transfecting HEK293T and MDCK co-cultured cells with the 8 plasmids. WSN, mutWSN, pdm09 H1N1 (A/Beijing/01/2009) and H3N2 (A/Beijing/30/95) viruses were propagated in MDCK cells in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the presence of 1 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. Supernatants from the virus cultures were harvested 3 days post infection. Virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Viral titers were calculated using plaque assays. The PR8 and mutPR8 viruses were inoculated into and propagated in 9-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos for 3 days and then harvested and stored at −80 °C until use.Six-week-old C57Bl/6 background male mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). Animal studies were carried out in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities. Facilities were maintained at an acceptable range of 20–26 °C humidity of 30–70% on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle.IAV binding, entry assayHEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells per well and cultured for 24 h. Cells were transfected with the vector, MARCH8 or W114A expression plasmids. After 24 h, cells were infected with IAV (MOI = 5) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. For the virus binding assay, cells were washed with cold PBS (at 4 °C) twice to remove unbound virus and cell lysates were harvested, the amount of viral RNA was determined by RT-PCR. For virus entry assay, after incubation at 4 °C for 1 h to allow for viral binding, infected cells were washed with cold PBS (at 4 °C) twice to remove unbound virus, followed by incubation with pre-warmed DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were treated with neuraminidase (Merck) for another 30 min at 37 °C and rinsed three times with PBS to remove the attached but not yet internalized virions. Total cellular RNA was extracted and quantified by RT-PCR.IAV minigenome system for polymerase activityHEK293T cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at 5 × 105 cells per well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PB1, -PB2, -PA (100 ng each) and -NP (300 ng), luciferase reporter pPolI-NP-Luc (100 ng), and pTK-RL (10 ng), and vector or MARCH8-expression plasmids or control or MARCH8 siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed and analyzed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega).Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysisTotal cellular RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa). A NP vRNA specific primer was used for reverse transcription of vRNA of NP. An oligo(dT)20 primer was used for reverse transcription of cellular mRNA. β-actin mRNA was used as an internal control. The sequences of primers used in qPCR reactions were provided in Supplementary Table 1. Real-time qPCR assays were further analyzed by Bio-Rad CFX Manager.Electron microscopyFor thin-section electron microscopy, WSN IAV-infected HEK293T cells were scraped off the plates. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to form a pellet. Cell pellets were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde–2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for at least 4 h and then fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h. Specimens were subsequently dehydrated in gradient ethanol. The cells were further embedded in epoxy resin PON812 and polymerized at 60 °C for 24 h. Eighty-nanometer-thickness sections were obtained from the resin blocks and were placed on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The negative stained ultrathin sections were observed under the transmission electron microscope.VLP production and purificationVLPs were produced as previously described53. Briefly, cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes in complete DMEM for 24 h. Then, cells were co-transfected with indicated viral protein expression plasmids for 48 h. The culture supernatants were collected and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. VLPs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (200,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C, Beckman SW41Ti rotor).IAV infection and purificationFor virus infection, cells were first washed twice with PBS (Gibco) before inoculated with diluted virus at indicated MOI for 1 h at RT. After washing twice with PBS, cells were cultured in DMEM-BSA containing 0.5 μg/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. To harvest IAV particles, the culture supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and virus particles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (200,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C, Beckman SW41Ti rotor).HA protein ELISAThe concentration of released HA protein was measured in clarified cell culture supernatants by ELISA (Sino Biological) against standard curves of recombinant PR8 virus HA antigen, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Plaque assayTo determine the plaque-forming unit, viral supernatants were collected and plaque titers were determined by the plaque assay. Briefly, monolayer MDCK cells in 12-well plates were incubated with serial dilutions (10 times) of viral supernatants in 0.25 ml at room temperature (RT) for 1 h with swirling every 15 min. One milliliter of 1% agarose with 0.25% fetal bovine serum was then added to the cells and left at RT until it set. Then the dishes were turned upside down and incubated at 37 °C. At 72 h post infection, the agarose layer was removed and the plaques were visualized with 0.1% crystal violet solution.Flow cytometryFlow cytometry analysis was performed as previously described55. In brief, cells were detached and resuspended in complete growth media. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 30 min on ice with an anti-Influenza A M2 antibody (Santa Cruz; Cat# SC-32238; 1:100), followed by staining for 30 min on ice with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher; A21446; 1:1000). Cells were analyzed for the expression of surface M2 using BD FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer. The data were collected and analyzed with BD FACSDiva™ Software v8.0 software and Flowjo v10.Ethics statementThe animal experiments were performed according to the Chinese Regulations of Laboratory Animals-The Guidelines for the Care of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology of People’s Republic of China) and Laboratory Animal-Requirements of Environment and Housing Facilities (GB 14925 ± 2010, National Laboratory Animal Standardization Technical Committee). The license number associated with this research protocol was CAU 20190611, which was approved by the Institute of Animal Use and Care Committee of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking Union Medical College.Infection of miceThe mouse-adapted strain of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) was propagated in 10-day embryonated eggs and titered with a plaque assay. C57Bl/6 background male mice aged 6–8 weeks were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing). Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Ketamine and Xylazine (100 and 5 μg per gram of body weight). Mice were infected intranasally with 200 pfu of viruses in 40 μL PBS and monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs. Mice were euthanized if they had ≥30% loss of initial body weight. To analyze viral release, bronchiolar alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected and processed from infected and uninfected mice by postmortem lavage with 2 × 300 μL ice-cold PBS as described31. For histopathologic analysis, lungs were removed on day 3 of day 6 post infection and fixed with 4% PFA. Lung samples were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm-thick sections, followed by staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For the lung histology score, images were evaluated by an investigator in a blinded manner following a standardized score system as previously described56. Lung injury scoring system included five different parameters: neutrophils in alveolar airspace, neutrophils in the interstitial space, hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris filling the airspace, and alveolar septal thickening.MARCH8 knockdown by PPMOsPPMOs were purchased from Gene Tools. PPMO targeting mouse MARCH8 gene (PPMO-M8) was designed as CATGCTCATCCCAGCCTCCGAC. A nontargeting PPMO control sequence (PPMO-NC) (CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA), having little homology to mouse transcripts or influenza viral sequences, was used as control. Six to eight weeks C57Bl/6 male mice were inoculated intranasally with 100 μg of PPMOs in 40 μl PBS for 2 days continuously. Lung homogenates were prepared using a FastPrep24 system (MP Biomedicals). After addition of 800 μl of PBS containing 0.3% BSA, lungs were subjected to two rounds of mechanical treatment for 10 s each at 6.5 m/s. Tissue debris was removed by low-speed centrifugation, and virus titers in supernatants were determined by plaque assay.Immunofluorescence microscopyIF was performed with HeLa cells 24 h post transfection with IAV M2 and MARCH8 plasmid DNA. For lysosome labeling, lyso-Tracker-Red99 (Invitrogen) was used to treat cells 24 h post transfection of M2 DNA and incubated for 30 min prior to IF staining. Early or late endosomes were labeled by anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences; Cat# 610456; 1:50) or anti-LAMP-1 (BioLegend; Cat# 328602; 1:250) antibody or via transfection of a plasmid encoding Rab5-GFP or Rab7-GFP. Confocal images were collected with Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, and analyzed by LAS AF Lite v3.0 and ImageJ v1.44.Detection of ubiquitination by IPCells transfected with IAV M2 or infected with IAV and control cells were treated with CQ (50 μM) for 4 h and lysed in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, DUB inhibitors (100 mM PR619, 5 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 mM NEM), and a protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min. 300 μl reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) was added to 300 μl lysis buffer. Anti-M2 or IgG antibodies were then added to the clarified supernatants for 2 h followed by A/G Dynabeads and 16 h incubation at 4 °C. Beads were washed with catch and release IP wash buffer (Invitrogen), and eluted in 2xSDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE, then wet transferred to a 0.45 μm PVDF membrane (Millipore). The western blot images were collected and analyzed with LICOR Odyssey CLx with ImageStudio lite v5.2 software.Selection of M2 sequences for alignmentThe sequences of M2 proteins from human IAVs circulating during different times were selected from the Influenza Research Database (IRD). The strain selection was refined, discarding M2 sequences that were identical and only considering fully sequenced M2. In addition, HA/NA subtype and year were also defined. Following these definitions, lists of the most representative M2 were created. Then, aligned M2 protein sequences were uploaded to the WebLogo3 online tool, and sequence logo was generated.Statistical analysisAll data were plotted and statistical analyses performed with GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad). Unless otherwise indicated, graphs display mean ± standard deviation (SD) and represent data from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was analyzed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Significance indicated by asterisks is designated as follows: *p < 0.01; **p < 0.001; n.s., nonsignificant.Statistics and reproducibilityFor in vitro experiments, phenotypic analyses including immunofluorescence, western blot, and FASC were performed in at least three independent experiments, using biological replicates.

Many of the comparisons addressed overall cases which, given the lack of a confirmatory lab test in 1918 and no meaningful case definitions for both pandemics, make such comparisons patently invalid. Overall mortality comparisons, although methodologically flawed as well, do offer a reasonably comparative outcome measure and offers a greater degree of validity. This measure is further enhanced when adjusted for population and average life years lost (see accompanying table for mortality comparisons presented 3 ways). The resulting value(s) can also be used to assess and better quantify the cumulative health impacts of our interventions and give a more objective base for our decision-making. A concluding observation is presented on the impact of a rapidly developed vaccine on a 1918 type event. ### Journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness DOI 10.1017/dmp.2021.230 Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

A barrier to the development of effective therapeutics is the absence of a robust and predictive preclinical model, with most studies relying on a combination of in vitro screening with immortalized cell lines and low-throughput animal models. Here, we integrate human primary airway epithelial cells into a custom-engineered 96-device platform (PREDICT96-ALI) in which tissues are cultured in an array of microchannel-based culture chambers at an air–liquid interface, in a configuration compatible with high resolution in-situ imaging and real-time sensing. We apply this platform to influenza A virus and coronavirus infections, evaluating viral infection kinetics and antiviral agent dosing across multiple strains and donor populations of human primary cells. Human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming, and we confirm their expression, demonstrate infection across a range of multiplicities of infection, and evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesylate, a known inhibitor of HCoV-NL63 infection. This new capability can be used to address a major gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.

For influenza, the development of efficacious, long-lasting, and seasonally-consistent vaccinations has been challenged by the occurrence of both antigenic drift and shift3. Currently, four antivirals are in wide use for treatment of influenza, three neuraminidase inhibitors and more recently, a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil4. These treatments are generally effective, but genetic changes to endemic viruses present challenges similar to those encountered during the development of vaccines5. These challenges are exacerbated by the long developmental timelines typically associated with manufacturing, scale up, and regulatory approval for novel antivirals or vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred aggressive vaccine development efforts, but even with this accelerated timeline, the current wave of infection is projected to yield significant morbidity and mortality6. Therefore, a critical element of medical treatment strategy is the application of FDA-approved antiviral medications originally developed for other diseases7.Several preclinical research tools are available to model respiratory viruses, but due to both the complexity of the human lung and the need to accurately model species-specific viral infections, these systems are limited in their ability to serve as a basis for guiding clinical strategy8. For example, a standard approach used to investigate influenza A viruses (IAV) typically begins with the inoculation of immortalized cell lines in conventional culture well plates, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) or Calu-3 cells9,10. While these cells infect easily and provide a rapid early assessment of the potential efficacy of a therapeutic for IAV, they lack the critical mechanisms and signaling pathways that healthy human airway tissues provide in response to viral infection. Therefore, although these systems are easy to use, they are not often accurate predictors of human clinical efficacy11. For coronaviruses, Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells are often used for similar reasons, but again differ by species, cell source, disease state, and innate antiviral signaling pathways12,13 compared to normal, healthy human conducting airway and alveolar epithelium14, thus providing an insufficient and unreliable model. Unfortunately, challenges also exist with animal models of IAV, not only in mice, rats, and guinea pigs, but even in more human-relevant options for evaluation, such as ferrets and macaques15,16. These models often require species-adapted viral strains, and fail to recapitulate features of human innate antiviral responses and clinical signs of infection8,17. Similar challenges exist for coronavirus infection studies, where the low-throughput and limited availability of appropriate animal models, combined with concerns about their predictive power, force early and often high-risk testing in humans. While many experimental studies are underway to identify drugs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-218, the discovery pipeline would benefit significantly from rapid and accurate preclinical models based on human primary cell culture.Challenges with preclinical models and tools have spurred the development of cell culture platforms comprising human primary cells in a microfluidic environment, commonly known as microphysiological systems or organs-on-chips19,20. Over the past two decades, these devices have evolved from early toxicology platforms21 to today’s wide range of technologies including multi-organ systems22,23,24 and a variety of organ-specific models including airway or alveolar tissue systems25,26. While the integration of human primary cells or stem cell-derived populations in a physiologically-relevant microenvironment represents a tremendous advance over the use of immortalized cell lines in principle, in practice the application of these systems in pharmacological research and development has been gated by several factors. These limitations include low-throughput (ranging from single microchamber devices to 6 – 24-device configurations) and complex operation, a lack of relevant metrics for system assessment, the use of research-grade materials and components for platform construction, the lack of critical aspects of tissue or organ structure required to replicate infection, and most critically, an absence of confidence in the in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for these technologies.Our group has previously reported on systems that offer higher throughput, compatibility with existing pharmaceutical laboratory infrastructure, convenient readouts for quality control and physiological monitoring, and applicability for preclinical studies across many disease areas and application domains27,28. These platforms represent a significant advance over current organ-on-chip systems in several ways, including increased throughput (96 independent microtissues), dynamic perfusion of each independent chamber, real-time sensing of barrier function, compatibility with in-situ imaging during operation of the plate, and a reduced media volume that minimizes utilization of cells and reagents for operational efficiency. Here we build on that work from our group28 and the work of others29 to establish an in vitro model with an ALI capability sufficient to support physiologically relevant epithelial differentiation such as that in airway, gut or kidney models. For functional proximal airway or alveolar models, human primary cells should be cultured at an ALI, representing a suitable analogue for the respiratory barrier tissues that mimics mucus formation, mucociliary flow, and a range of physiologically relevant responses25,26,30. Our airway model provides this ALI and supports IAV and coronavirus infection, while enabling high-throughput, real-time studies across various viral strains, multiplicities of infection (MOI), human donors, time points, and statistically significant numbers of replicates on a single 96-device engineered platform. Viral infection kinetics are evaluated for two strains of IAV, A/California/04/09 H1N1, and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2, as well as the response of infection with the A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 strain to dosing with oseltamivir, demonstrating application of the system toward evaluation of efficacy of antiviral therapeutic compounds.Currently, in vitro systems for evaluation of therapeutics for COVID-19 rely upon high throughput well plate-based systems cultured with immortalized cell lines such as Vero E6, Calu-3 and A549. More recent developments include the use of genetic modification techniques to confer physiologically relevant properties to various immortalized cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSc)–based systems, and the development of human primary epithelial cell-based technologies including organoids and various lung on a chip systems. While these latter approaches provide a more physiologically relevant microenvironment for investigating key mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they are generally limited in throughput and in the ability to fully integrate into the laboratory infrastructure and pharmaceutical development pipelines. Here we report on the first application of a high throughput organ-on-chip system capable of evaluating coronavirus infection across multiple viral strains and human primary cell donors on a single plate. First we confirm expression of the receptor ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2 in human primary airway epithelial tissues cultured in the PREDICT96-ALI system, a key attribute toward modeling infection with HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate viral propagation and infection kinetics of HCoV-NL63, which, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, utilizes ACE2 as its target receptor. We also evaluate HCoV-OC43 infection in the system across MOI and human donors, providing evidence of the extensibility of the system. Finally, as a proof-of-concept demonstration toward future use of the system in evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in the model, we present data on the treatment of HCoV-NL63-infected tissues with camostat mesylate, a protease inhibitor that blocks coronavirus entry.MethodsMicrofluidic platformThe PREDICT96 organ-on-chip platform consists of a microfluidic culture plate with 96 individual microchannel-based culture chambers (or devices) and a perfusion system driven by 192 microfluidic pumps integrated into the plate lid28. The standard configuration comprises individual pumps independently addressing the apical and basal chambers of each of the 96 devices on the platform. Here the platform is adapted to support culture of barrier tissues, such as airway tissues, by establishment and maintenance of an ALI, where only the basal compartments are pumped with circulating media.Each device in the PREDICT96-ALI culture plate was formed from a 2 × 2 array within a standard 384-well plate, with the wall between the top two wells removed to create a 3-well cluster. This configuration is shown in Fig. 1A. A slotted hard plastic microwell (0.864 mm height, 1 mm width, 2.5 mm length) was positioned in the center of the large well, with a microfluidic channel (0.25 mm height, 1 mm width) aligned underneath that was linked to the two remaining wells in each culture chamber. The channel was capped from below with a thin optically clear layer. A microporous membrane was used to separate the top microwell chamber from the bottom microchannel culture chamber to permit the establishment of an ALI.Figure 1PREDICT96-ALI platform.

(C) Photographs of the upright view (left), inverted view (right) and overhead view (bottom), with magnified view of an individual model within the PREDICT96-ALI platform configuration.Full size imageTo fabricate the PREDICT96-ALI culture plate, a UV laser system (Protolaser U4: LPKF Laser and Electronics, Garbsen, Germany) was used to laser-cut thin films of cyclic olefin polymer (COP) (ZF14-188: Zeon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and cyclic olefin copolymer (8007 COC: Tekni-plex, Wayne, PA, USA). The COP layers were adhered together using low-glass transition temperature COC in a heated hydraulic press (Carver Inc., Wabash, IN, USA), and were separated with a 24 µm-thick track-etched polycarbonate membrane with pore diameter of 0.4 or 1 µm (It4ip S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) patterned with an array of holes to provide fluidic access ports to the bottom channel. The microfluidic stack is attached to a modified 384-well COP plate (Aurora Microplates, Whitefish, MT, USA) using a 0.135 mm thick pressure sensitive adhesive consisting of a 25.4 µm polyester carrier film with MA-69 acrylic medical grade adhesive ARcare 90106 (Adhesives Research, Inc., Glen Rock, PA, USA), which had been previously laser-cut in the pattern of the well plate grid and laminated with a hydraulic press at 1.0 MPa for 2 min. Further details on the fabrication process are found elsewhere28.Integrated micropumpsAs described in our previous work28, in order to establish recirculating flow in the microchannels, we incorporate a self-priming micropump array into the lid that serves as the fluidic interface with the culture plate via stainless steel tubes. The PREDICT96 pumping system has 192 individual pneumatically-actuated micropumps embedded in the plate lid: two per culture device, one for the culture chamber above the membrane and one for below. However, since the upper chamber is at ALI, only the 96 pumps serving the bottom microchannel are in use during these experiments. Actuation of the pumps transfer media between the microplate wells linked by the bottom channel and establishes a hydrostatic pressure differential, inducing flow through each microchannel.The pneumatic and fluidic manifolds of the micropump array were constructed with laser-micromachined Ultem polyetherimide and Kapton polyimide films (McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, Illinois USA) laminated in a heated hydraulic press with phenolic butyral thermosetting adhesive film (R/flex 1000, Rogers Corp., Chandler, Arizona, USA). Fluidic tubing (21G 316L stainless steel hypodermic tubes: New England Small Tube Corp., Litchfield, NH, USA) were glued into the assembly using 353NDPK Hi-Temp Epoxy (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA).Trans-epithelial electrical resistance measurementIn order to quantify barrier function, trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was periodically measured during the ALI differentiation of the PREDICT96-ALI normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) tissues. TEER was measured using an Epithelial Volt/Ohm Meter (World Precision Instruments). Blank TEER values were established for each device prior to seeding of NHBEs in each device by adding 100 µL of NHBE proliferation media to each channel. Prior to reading tissue TEER, tissues were incubated at 37 °C for one hour in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Sigma) in order to wash away secreted mucus to avoid its interference with TEER reading. After reading TEER values from each device at each time point (generally, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, and 28 days of culture), TEER in ohms cm2 was calculated by subtracting the blank read for each device from the raw reading, and then multiplying this resistance value by the membrane surface area.Collection and preparation of human primary bronchial epithelial cells from healthy controlsParticipants were recruited via advertisement in the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) outpatient clinics and around the Boston metropolitan area. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years old were screened for eligibility with a full medical history. Subjects gave their written informed consent before testing and sample collection. The study was approved by the MGH Institutional Review Board. Volunteers underwent bronchoscopy with conscious sedation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 4 × 30-ml (mL) aliquots of normal saline. The bronchial mucosa was then sampled using a 4 mm sterile nylon cytology brush. Brush samples were placed in ice-cold RPMI media with 2% human serum and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Tocris Bioscience) and cells were gently removed from the brush using a P1000 pipette tip and serially washed with media. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 µm filter and centrifuged.Culture, cryopreservation, and PREDICT96-ALI seeding and differentiation of NHBEsNHBEs were purchased from Lifeline Cell Technology and Lonza (Table 1). To maintain stocks of each NHBE donor, cells were thawed and plated at 2500 cells/cm2 on 804G media-coated tissue culture flasks (804G media made as described elsewhere31), cultured in Bronchialife (Lifeline Cell Technology), and passaged using Accutase (Sigma). After two passages, NHBEs were cryopreserved using 65% FBS (Thermo Fisher), 25% Bronchialife (Lifeline Cell Technology), and 10% DMSO (Sigma). Prior to seeding, PREDICT96-ALI plates were sterilized overnight with ethylene oxide gas followed by 1 week of outgassing in a vacuum chamber. PREDICT96-ALI plates were subsequently treated with plasma for 120 s and washed briefly with 70% ethanol, rinsed three times in distilled water, and coated overnight in 804G media. To seed PREDICT96-ALI plates, NHBEs were thawed, counted, re-suspended in complete small airway epithelial cell growth media (SAGM; Lonza), 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher), 5 μM ROCKi (Tocris), 1 μM A-83-01 (Tocris), 0.2 μM DMH-1 (Tocris), 0.5 μM CHIR99021 (Tocris) as described elsewhere32 (hereafter referred to as SAGM + 4i), and plated at 10,000 cells per device in a 3 μL volume directly onto the membrane. After 48 h of growth in SAGM + 4i media, differentiation was initiated using fresh HBTEC-ALI media (Lifeline Cell Technology) plus 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. After 48 h of submerged differentiation, the ALI was initiated by aspirating media from the apical surface of the tissue in the top chamber, while 60 μL of fresh HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media was added to the bottom chamber. Pumping was initiated at 1 μL/min in the bottom microchannel, and the media in the bottom microchannel was changed daily thereafter. Tissues were matured over the course of 3–5 weeks in ALI culture prior to viral infection experiments. At the end of ALI differentiation, the total number of cells per well averages 40,000 (data not shown), and can be determined by enzymatic generation of single cell suspension from mature microtissue and/or by quantification methods of microtissue DNA (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit, Invitrogen) using sacrificial PREDICT96-ALI devices. To remove accumulated mucus from the apical surface of the maturing tissue, 100 µL of 1 × Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was added to the apical surface of each tissue and incubated on the tissues for 1 h at 37 °C with rocking, subsequently followed by an additional 5 min wash with 100 µL of 1 × HBSS at room temperature every 7 days (d). Mucus washings were pooled, collected and stored at – 80 °C until processed. Tissue maturity and quality control was scored by a combination of metrics including barrier function, percent ciliated cells, ciliary beat, mucus secretion, and global tissue morphology, and this score was used to determine if individual devices of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue were suitable for downstream experimentation and viral inoculation. Downstream processing of tissues following viral inoculation was generally conducted at 4–6 weeks of ALI and included tissue apical wash collections, basal media collection, measurement of barrier function, harvest of tissue for RNA extraction, and fixation for immunofluorescence (IF) imaging.Table 1 Summary detailing the primary normal human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) used to grow human airway tissue within the PREDICT96-ALI platform.Full size tableImmunofluorescence and confocal imagingTo prepare PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues for IF staining, tissues were fixed in situ using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature rocking and washed three times with 1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Tissues were subsequently permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-100 (Sigma) for 30 min and blocked with 3% normal goat serum (NGS, Thermo Fisher) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies for basal cells (CK5, Thermo Fisher), goblet cells (Muc5AC, Thermo), ciliated cells (acetylated-tubulin, Abcam and beta-tubulin, Sigma), cellular proliferation (Ki67, Abcam), influenza A nucleoprotein (IAV-NP, Abcam), and ACE2 (R&D Systems) were diluted 1:50 (ACE2 only) or 1:100 in 3% NGS including 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Devices were washed twice with PBS followed by one rinse with 3% NGS plus 0.1% Tween-20 for 5 min each with rocking and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher) were diluted 1:300 and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with rocking. Secondary antibodies were removed by washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, and tissues were incubated with rocking at room temperature for 30 min with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Thermo Fisher, 10 mg/mL stock) at a 1:800 dilution and Phalloidin-iFluor 647 Reagent (Abcam) at 1:1000. After 30 min, the PREDICT96-ALI tissues were washed at least three times for 5 min with PBS prior to imaging. Stained PREDICT96-ALI devices were imaged using a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscope and Zen Black software. Tile scans and z-stacks of the tissue at 40 × magnification were acquired. Quantification of mean fluorescence intensity was done using ImageJ, version 1.5.2e (Wayne Rashband, National Institutes of Health, USA).Viral stocks, propagation, and titerInfluenza A viral strains A/California/04/09 H1N1 (ATCC), and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 (Charles River) were used for experiments. IAV strains were propagated in MDCK cells (ATCC), harvested in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher) containing 7.5% bovine serum album (BSA, Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 µg/mL N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (TPCK-trypsin, Sigma) and titered by viral plaque assay using MDCK cells as previously reported33. Viral infection experiments in PREDICT96-ALI tissue used A/California/04/09 H1N1 at passage 3, and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 at passage 2.Human coronavirus strain (HCoV) NL63 was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, Human Coronavirus NL63, NR-470) and propagated two times in Lilly Laboratories Cell-Monkey Kidney 2 (LLC-MK2) using a method adapted from Herzog34. In brief, HCoV-NL63 was grown using LLC-MK2 cells in a limiting dilution series. Recovered virus was harvested from the last well of the dilution series showing diffuse cytopathic effect (CPE) at 4–5 d post-infection (p.i.). Subsequently, confluent LLC-MK2 monolayers were inoculated in 25 cm2 flasks with a 1:10 dilution of viral supernatant from the prior viral passage. The flasks were incubated at 34 °C, 5% CO2, and harvested on day 4 when diffuse CPE was observed. To harvest the virus, flasks were frozen at − 80 °C and thawed at 37 °C twice, and cells and supernatant were pooled and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 3000 rpm. Cleared supernatant was aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C, and is referred to henceforth as passage 2 virus. HCoV-NL63 was harvested in EMEM (ATCC) containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma) and 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). Viral infection experiments with PREDICT96-ALI tissue used HCoV-NL63 at passage 2.Viral plaque assay using LLC-MK2 cells were used to titer propagated HCoV-NL63. A tenfold serial dilution was performed using the propagated virus, followed by 1 h of viral binding (100 µL of appropriate viral dilution per well of 12-well plate) with rocking at 34 °C on confluent LLC-MK2 cells. After unbound virus was removed with one wash of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were overlaid with agar (0.3%) in EMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin. After the agar solidified at room temperature, the plates were incubated for 6 d at 34 °C until diffuse CPE was observed. The gel overlay was removed and the wells washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) in 4% ethanol (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Stained cells were washed in PBS and imaged, and plaque counts were determined using images analyzed using a customized MATLAB script to determine the plaque forming units (PFU) per mL.Oseltamivir dosingOseltamivir carboxylate (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) was used in anti-viral screens performed on PREDICT96-ALI tissue. Oseltamivir in distilled water was diluted to 0 (vehicle control), 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 µM in complete HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media and applied to the bottom channel of PREDICT-ALI airway tissues subject to anti-viral evaluation following the standard apical wash of the tissue and 2 h prior to IAV-inoculation. Upon and after IAV-inoculation of the apical side of the PREDICT96-ALI tissue, 0 (vehicle control), 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 µM oseltamivir was maintained in the basal media for the duration of the study. Basal media changes including oseltamivir occurred every 24 h.Camostat mesylate treatment methodsCamostat mesylate (R&D Systems, BioTechne Corp., Minneapolis, MN) was used on PREDICT96-ALI tissue infected with coronavirus strain HCoV-NL63. Camostat mesylate in DMSO was diluted to 0 (vehicle control) or 20 µM in complete HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media and applied to the bottom channel of PREDICT-ALI airway tissues subject to anti-viral evaluation following the standard apical wash of the tissue, and 2 h prior to HCoV-NL63 inoculation. Upon and after HCoV-NL63 inoculation of the apical side of the PREDICT96-ALI tissue, 0 (vehicle control) or 20 µM camostat mesylate was maintained in the basal media for the duration of the study. Basal media changes including camostat mesylate occurred every 24 h.Infection of PREDICT96-ALI tissues with viral strainsTo prepare PREDICT96-ALI tissues for influenza and coronavirus infection, a mucus wash with 1 × HBSS was performed as described above. Viral strains were thawed on ice and individually diluted in viral infection media to reach the relevant MOI. Influenza virus infection media was composed of a single IAV strain diluted to the appropriate MOI in HBSS including 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) for A/California/04/09 and A/Hong Kong/8/68. Coronavirus infection media was composed of HCoV-NL63 diluted to the appropriate MOI in HBSS. When the mucus wash was completed, viral inoculum was added to the apical side of the tissues. Each experiment included both an untreated control in which ALI was maintained and an untreated control that was submerged in HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media for comparison to the viral inoculum-treated groups. The time of incubation varied by viral strain, with HCoV-NL63 incubated on the PREDICT96-ALI tissues for 6 h with rocking and A/California/04/09 and A/Hong Kong/8/68 each individually incubated for 1 h with rocking. Following incubation, both the top chamber and the bottom channel were aspirated, the apical surface of the tissue washed three times with 1 × HBSS with the final wash collected for reference, and the top chamber was completely aspirated to resume ALI culture. A volume of 60 μL of HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media was added to the bottom channel to resume normal culture conditions, with 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin maintained in the media of devices that had been inoculated with A/California/04/09 and A/Hong Kong/8/68. At 24 or 48 h intervals p.i., an apical wash using 1 × HBSS was performed at 34–37 °C for 1.5 h with rocking to collect both mucus and virus. Specifically, 100 µL of 1 × HBSS was added to the apical surface of each tissue and incubated on the tissues for 45 min at 34–37 °C with rocking, subsequently followed by an additional 50 µL wash with 1 × HBSS for 45 min at 34–37 °C with rocking and a final 50 µL wash with 1 × HBSS for 5 min at room temperature. Apical washings were pooled, collected and stored at − 80 °C until processed. Basal media was collected at time points p.i. that correspond to mucus and virus wash collections, and stored at − 80 °C. Following apical wash and basal media collections, 60 μL of HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media (including 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin for devices that had been inoculated with either A/California/04/09 or A/Hong Kong/8/68) was added to the bottom channel, and complete aspiration of the top chamber to resume ALI culture was performed to re-establish normal culture conditions.RNA extraction and RT-qPCRSupernatant viral RNA was collected from the apical side of PREDICT96-ALI tissues and isolated using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s specifications. Supernatant volumes of 100 μL were brought to 140 μL using HBSS. In order to collect bulk tissue RNA from devices, RLT buffer (Qiagen) with 0.01% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) was added to both the top chamber and bottom channel to disrupt the differentiated tissue. Tissue RNA was extracted from PREDICT96-ALI devices using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. One-step quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was then performed on extracted RNA samples using a QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) following the standard protocol for a QuantStudio 7 Flex RT-PCR system. Briefly, 7.8 μL of the extracted supernatant viral RNA was used in a 20 μL reaction volume and 3.8 μL tissue RNA was used in a 20 μL reaction volume, and samples were run in duplicate. The reaction was run in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex System (Thermo Scientific) using the following condition: 50 °C for 20 min, 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 45 s. TaqMan primers and probe targeting IAV-M were ordered from Thermo Scientific with the following sequences: FLUAM-7-F: CTTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACGTA, FLUAM-161-R: GGTGACAGGATTGGTCTTGTCTTTA, FLUAM-49-P6: TCAGGCCCCCTCAAAGCCGAG, and TaqMan primers and probe targeting HCoV-NL63 (Assay ID: Vi06439673_s1) were ordered from Thermo Scientific. TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Scientific) were used to target the following proteins in lung tissue: ACE2 (Hs01085333_m1), TMPRSS2 (Hs01122322_m1), TUBB6 (Hs00603164_m1), and Muc5AC (Hs01365616_m1). Absolute quantification (copies/mL) of supernatant viral RNA was calculated using a standard curve generated from serial dilutions of A/PR/8/34 viral RNA (Charles River Laboratories) or linearized HCoV-NL63 viral RNA (ATCC). Comparative cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined using the method described by Schmittgen and Livak35 using normalization to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean ± standard deviation and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.3.1 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was determined using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s or Sidak’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, where appropriate. A p value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and is indicated in figures as follows: *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, and ****p ≤ 0.0001.Ethics statementAll research involving human subjects was approved by the MGH Institutional Review Board, and adheres to all applicable institutional and sponsor ethical guidelines. All methods are in adherence with applicable safety and laboratory practice guidelines.ResultsCreation of a high-throughput ALI platform for dynamic culture of human airway tissue: PREDICT96-ALIThe adaptation of the PREDICT96 platform28 for the ALI model allows for inoculation of cultured tissues in each channel apically or basally, sampling of the basal media at regular intervals, and examination of the tissues at the completion of each study, as shown in Fig. 1A. The schematic (left) illustrates the 384 well standard structure upon which each of the individual airway models is situated. At the right, the detailed view shows access to the top chamber (top two wells of the 2 × 2 array) and the bottom channel (accessed by an inlet and outlet from the bottom two elements of the 2 × 2 array, respectively). An exploded-view schematic (Fig. 1B) of this configuration depicts the assembly of the material layers required to establish the microfluidic structure of the PREDICT96-ALI platform. Photographs in Fig. 1C depict the PREDICT96-ALI platform from an upright view (left), inverted view (right) and overhead view (bottom), with a higher magnification detail of an individual airway model.PREDICT96-ALI recapitulates healthy human airway structure and compositionFirst, the PREDICT96-ALI system was used to establish the healthy baseline airway model, prepared as described in the Methods section, and morphology and cell populations were evaluated using high resolution confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. An illustration depicts the development of a healthy airway model within PREDICT96-ALI (Fig. 2A). The experimental timeline and setup for the system is outlined in Fig. 2B. Fluorescent staining of ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells (Fig. 2C), as well as a cross-section of the pseudostratified epithelial layer (Fig. 2D) are shown for a typical airway tissue within a single device of PREDICT96-ALI. Our observations for airway tissues in the PREDICT96-ALI platform regarding the relative populations of ciliated cells, basal cells, and goblet cells are consistent with our previously reported observations in earlier generations of our airway models as well as with in vivo observations26. We also evaluated TransEpithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) for the airway tissues over time during establishment of the ALI, observing varying kinetics of barrier resistance across different human donor populations but ultimately the same final level of TEER for a given media formulation and protocol (Fig. 2E). Note that the Lonza donor (donor A) exhibited a rapid increase in TEER, while the two Lifeline donors (donors B and C) showed a slow rise to approximately the same final value; the reasons for these differences are unclear, but the ability of this platform to assess these donor-to-donor differences within a single plate is potentially quite useful. We have also observed that the behavior of TEER is strongly dependent upon media formulation, which can shift the baseline TEER behavior between different conditions.Figure 2Healthy PREDICT96-ALI airway model. (A) Schematic illustrating the configuration of the biomimetic airway model within the PREDICT96-ALI platform with associated microenvironmental features including differentiated cell populations (ciliated, goblet, basal and club cells) of the mature tissue, apical mucus and periciliary fluid present on mature human airway, and basolateral fluid flow to recirculate nutrients, remove waste products, and oxygenate the media. (B) Timeline detailing proliferation, differentiation, inoculation and processing (sample collection, fixation, imaging, etc.) of the PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue over 4–6 weeks. (C) Stains of ciliated (acetylated-tubulin, green; β-tubulin, red), basal (CK5, green), and goblet (Muc5ac, green) cells counterstained for nucleic acids (DAPI, blue) and actin (phalloidin, grey) at ×40 magnification shown, with a 50 µm scale bar. Donor B is featured as representative. (D) High-resolution confocal microscopy ×40 z-stack orthogonal image of the pseudostratified epithelium with approximately 4 cell layers and 50 µm thickness established after culture at 28 days at an ALI. Donor B is featured as representative. (E) Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) plotted over time for three human primary epithelial cell donor populations, showing that the same ultimate level of barrier function is reached, although the kinetics of barrier resistance are different.Full size imageWe explored the formation of a pseudostratified epithelium at an ALI using freshly harvested human bronchial epithelial cells from living research bronchoscopies, labeled DH01, observing robust establishment of airway tissues over periods of 5 weeks or longer in culture in the PREDICT96-ALI plates. Panels illustrating the establishment of mature tissue with a pseudostratified morphology, approximately 30–50 μm thick, are provided in Fig. 3A–D. Here we show ×40 images of IF staining of cell populations as described above, including basal cell populations (CK5), goblet cells (Muc5AC), ciliated cells (acetylated tubulin, beta-tubulin), and club cells (scgb1a1, scgb3a2), all with scale bar 100 μm. We observed that club cells are clearly visible in IF staining with this donor; their presence varies between donors and assays, and there are reports suggesting a key role club cells play in the immunopathology of IAV36. Also shown is the morphology of mature tissue cultured in the PREDICT96-ALI, shown en face at 10 × magnification (Fig. 3E), and the presence of mucus droplets formed on the surface of the mature tissue at ×40 (Fig. 3F); we also observe robust ciliary beating (see supplementary video 1) and mucociliary flow.Figure 3Healthy PREDICT96-ALI airway model with freshly harvested epithelial cells from research bronchoscopies. Panels illustrating establishment of mature tissue with pseudostratified morphology, approximately 30–50 µm, thick from freshly harvested airway epithelial cells obtained from living research bronchoscopy donor D. (A–D) ×40 images showing basal cell populations (CK5, green), goblet cells (Muc5AC, green), ciliated cells (acetylated tubulin, green; β-tubulin, red), and club cells (Scgb1a1, red; Scgb3a2, red) counterstained with nucleic acid (DAPI, blue) and actin (phalloidin, grey) with scale bar 100 µm, (E) ×10 phase contrast image of mature tissue at 28 days at an ALI with scale bar 100 µm, and (F) ×40 phase contrast image of mucus droplets (black arrows) on surface of mature tissue at 28 days at an ALI with scale bar 50 µm. Cells are characterized by robust ciliary beat (see supplementary video) and mucociliary flow.Full size imagePREDICT96-ALI airway model supports infection with IAVNext, we examined the effect of inoculation of airway ALI cultures with various strains of IAV, including A/California/04/09 H1N1 and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2. In Fig. 4, IF staining of ALI culture devices seeded with living donor D cells and inoculated with various MOIs of A/California/04/09 H1N1 are shown, demonstrating greater abundance of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) as the MOI increases. The 40 × images at the apical plane show IAV-NP staining across the range of 0 (mock control)–1 MOI, with levels increasing substantially relative to mock control. We also saw an observeable but non-significant increase in IAV-NP staining between 0.1 and 1 MOIs. Donors exhibited varied cytopathic response to increasing MOIs, with the living research bronchoscopy donor D cells showing the strongest cytopathic response at higher MOI, and the commercial vendor-derived donors A, B, and C displaying the greatest resilience to MOIs ≥ 1 (data not shown). The earlier observations regarding the presence of club cells in certain donor lots may be relevant to the cellular tropism of IAV strains such as A/California/04/09 H1N1 and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2, potentially impacting donor-specific cytopathic response and susceptibility to IAV.Figure 4Immunofluorescence staining and quantification of IAV-infected PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue. (A) Staining of the nucleoprotein (NP, green) for IAV, actin (phalloidin, grey), β-tubulin (red) and nucleic acids (DAPI, blue), including merged panels for all four stains, within PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue developed using freshly harvested epithelial cells from donor D at 48 h p.i., after 5 weeks ALI culture and following inoculation with A/California/04/09 H1N1 (MOI 0 [mock control], 0.1 or 1). Strong expression of IAV-NP is seen at 48 h p.i. at both MOI 0.1 and 1; noted here is that this is one field of view (FOV), and that there is more cytopathic effect at MOI = 1. Images captured are ×40, z-stacks, slice 25 of 48. Scale bar 50 µm. (B) Quantification of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the IAV-NP stain (green) or Alexa Fluor 488 signal, indicating significant increase in IAV replication at both 0.1 and 1 MOIs. N = 2 independent experiments with data presented from donor D as representative. Per experiment, N = 3 tissue replicates per donor, time-point and condition (MOI, anti-viral dose). One FOV was analyzed at N = 7 slices (at 5 slice intervals) for each condition. Statistical significance: **p ≤ 0.01 and ***p ≤ 0.001.Full size imageMeasurements of supernatant viral RNA were obtained using RT-qPCR, and are provided in the two panels in Fig. 5. Viral copy numbers after inoculation at MOIs of 0.1 and 1 (including mock control, MOI 0) were measured at 24 and 48 h p.i. for the A/California/04/09 H1N1 strain of IAV (Fig. 5A). In Fig. 5B, companion results for A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 are shown. For the H1N1 and H3N2 strains, viral copies per mL tend to increase with MOI, and continue to rise between 24 and 48 h p.i. The RT-qPCR measurements are a useful readout of infection but are prone to error due to a positive signal arising from dead virus, and therefore the IF data from the previous section, as well as plaque assays planned for future studies, represent key additional metrics.Figure 5Infection kinetics of IAV-inoculated PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue. RT-qPCR analyses for viral copies in the apical wash of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue at 24 and 48 h p.i. (A) PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue inoculated with A/California/04/09 H1N1 and monitored for an increase in viral load at 24 h intervals with a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 48 h p.i. compared to 24 h p.i. for the MOI 1 condition. (B) PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue inoculated with A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 and monitored for an increase in viral load at 24 h intervals with a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 48 h p.i. compared to 24 h p.i. for the MOI 1 condition.

The active form of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, was introduced 2 h before viral inoculation and maintained in the bottom channel of the PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues during the course of infection with A/HongKong/8/68 H3N2 virus at various MOIs. Oseltamivir (> 0.1 μM) significantly reduced influenza replication up to 48 h p.i. (Fig. 6, Supplemental Fig. 1) relative to control tissue devices for the A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 strain at MOI 0.1 and prevented virus-induced disruption to barrier function and epithelial tight junction formation (data not shown). An MOI of 0.1 was selected for the oseltamivir dosing study to remain well below the threshold for significant cytopathic effects at MOI 1, an observation often seen at higher MOI in IAV inoculation studies. Although oseltamivir was able to reduce IAV replication in the donors investigated, donor-specific behaviors were observed in response to viral infection. Fabrication-related parameters associated with the platform may represent an additional source of variability beyond potential biological variability from donor-to-donor. Measurements for viral copies in the PREDICT96-ALI airway model reflect those achieved in clinical settings among patients exposed to influenza and treated with oseltamivir37,38,39,40, suggesting that the PREDICT96-ALI airway model can serve as a preclinical tool to evaluate potential therapies for combating respiratory infections of the human airway.Figure 6Infection Kinetics of IAV-inoculated PREDICT96-ALI Airway Tissue in Response to Oseltamivir. RT-qPCR analyses for viral copies of the apical wash of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue at 24 and 48 h p.i. in absence (blue, vehicle control) or presence (red = 0.01 µM, green = 0.1 µM, violet = 1 µM, black = 10 µM) of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for two donors labeled donor B (A) and donor C (B). PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue inoculated with A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 at MOI = 0.1, and monitored for viral load over 24 h intervals up to 48 h p.i. with a marked decrease in viral copies in response to oseltamivir dose at both time points. N = 2 independent experiments with data presented from one representative experiment. Per experiment, N = 3–4 tissue replicates per donor, time-point and condition. Replicates that did not meet the minimum signal intensity after 45 PCR cycles are displayed along the x-axis.Full size imageACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is confirmed in PREDICT96-ALI airway modelIn preparation for testing the viral respiratory infection model with coronaviruses, we probed for transcript and protein expression of cell surface proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2, known to play central roles in facilitating viral infection by SARS-CoV-241. Both HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 gain entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor, while TMPRSS2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection via cleavage mechanisms, and thus its presence is an important aspect of the model. Data for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts for cell populations derived from two different donors are plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale in Fig. 7A, and data for ACE2 protein expression on the apical surface of the tissue derived from donor B in Fig. 7B. Consistent with other reports of ACE2 expression in human donor airway tissue, ACE2 is localized to the apical surface of the microtissues and displays punctate appearance, indicating possible association with the motile cilia of multiciliated airway epithelial cells42. Data from each donor evaluated show consistent transcript expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and protein expression for ACE2 between donors (data not shown). The consistency between these key cellular factors among different donors is encouraging, as it suggests that the platform is capable of supporting proliferation and maturation of tissues derived from numerous donors. Thus, evaluation of many donors can be accommodated in the PREDICT96-ALI system both as a healthy model and in the presence of pathogenic challenge. Evaluation of protein expression by IF or western blot of TMPRSS2 and other cell surface proteins known to play key roles in facilitating coronavirus infection would further inform donor assessment and viral entry mechanisms.Figure 7Characterization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues. (A) Transcripts of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, both critical for establishing HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected by RT-qPCR from PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue. (B) ACE2 protein expression was detected (left panel) on the apical surface of the tissue by in-situ IF in PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues (donor D). Representative ×40, confocal image (mean fluorescence intensity) showing ACE2 (green, red arrows) counterstained with nucleic acid (DAPI, blue) and actin (phalloidin, grey) compared to secondary-only control (right panel) with scale bar 100 µm. PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue from donors A and B were matured to 4 weeks ALI and shown to have a non-significant (ns) difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene transcript levels and ACE2 protein levels (data not shown) when compared to one another. Comparative CT values were determined using the method described by Schmittgen and Livak35 and used to determine the relative quantification of gene expression using GAPDH as a reference gene. N = 3–4 tissue replicates per donor for both RT-q-PCR and IF.Full size imagePREDICT96-ALI airway model supports infection with HCoV-NL63We have also investigated viral infection with HCoV-NL63 in the PREDICT96-ALI culture system with primary NHBEs, as shown in Fig. 8A,B for two different donor cell populations. In each case, viral copies in the supernatant were measured with RT-qPCR over periods extending to 96 h p.i. and across a range of MOIs, include a mock condition (0 MOI). We observed a clear increase in viral load over these time periods for both donors, indicating viral propagation in the airway tissues. Viral copies rose sharply from 0 to 48 h for each MOI tested, while from 48 to 96 h the rate of viral propagation decreased and differed between the two donors. We believe that the positive detection of viral particles in some of the PREDICT96-ALI devices exposed to mock condition (0 MOI) was likely associated with user-introduced technical error, and the transience of the positive detection was likely the result of non-productive infection, as indicated by the elimination of the positive signal at later time points in the experimental time-course. These observations may also be associated with thresholding error, since the increases by approximately 1 log around the 2–6 day p.i. time points are small enough that the data are within potential measurement noise.Figure 8Infection kinetics of HCoV-NL63-inoculated PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue. RT-qPCR analyses for viral copies in the apical wash of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue at 0, 48 and 96 h p.i. for two human donors showing unique infection kinetic profiles. (A) PREDICT96-ALI donor A airway tissue inoculated with HCoV-NL63 and monitored for an increase in viral load at 48 h intervals with a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 48 and 96 h p.i compared to 0 h p.i. for the MOI 0.1 and 0.5 conditions. Statistical significance: ****p ≤ 0.0001. (B) PREDICT96-ALI donor B airway tissue inoculated with HCoV-NL63 and monitored for an increase in viral load at 48 h intervals with a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 96 h p.i compared to 48 and 0 h p.i. for MOI 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5, as well as a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 48 h p.i. compared to 0 h p.i. for MOI 0.1 and 0.5 conditions. Transient, non-productive viral infection detected at 48 h p.i. in mock condition (0 MOI), is likely the result of technical handling by the experimental operator. Statistical significance: **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, and ****p ≤ 0.0001. N = 2 independent experiments with data presented from one representative experiment. Per experiment, N = 3–4 tissue replicates per donor, time-point and condition. Replicates that did not meet the minimum signal intensity after 45 PCR cycles are displayed along the x-axis.Full size imageViral infections kinetics are modeled for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43The coronavirus HCoV-NL63 enters host cells through the same ACE2 receptor pathway as SARS-CoV-243, and utilizes protein priming via the protease TMPRSS2, and therefore NL63 represents a useful model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection in a BSL-2 laboratory environment. HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 both belong to the betacoronavirus genus, and share common spike protein properties. In Fig. 9, we show infection kinetics determined by RT-qPCR for each of HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 9A,C) and HCoV-OC43 (Fig. 9B,D) across 12 d p.i. and across a range of MOIs, and we observe a strong increase in viral load versus MOI with distinct rates of infection for each strain. As discussed earlier, we believe that the positive detection of viral particles in some of the PREDICT96-ALI devices exposed to mock condition (0 MOI) was likely associated with user-introduced technical error or thresholding error.Figure 9Infection of coronavirus strains in PREDICT96-ALI model. RT-qPCR analyses for viral copies of HCoV-NL63 (A,C) and HCoV-OC43 (B,D) in the apical wash of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue model from a single donor, measured over 12 days across three different MOIs (0, 0.05, 0.5). (A) PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue inoculated with HCoV-NL63 and monitored for an increase in viral load at 48 h intervals with a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 48 and 96 h p.i. compared to 0 h p.i. for the MOI 0.05 condition, as well as a statistically significant increase at 48 h p.i. compared to 0 h p.i. for the MOI 0.5 condition. (B) PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue inoculated with HCoV-OC43 and monitored for an increase in viral load at 48 h intervals with a statistically significant increase in viral copies at 48 and 96 h p.i. compared to 0 h p.i. for the MOI 0.5 condition. Statistical significance: *p ≤ 0.05 and **p ≤ 0.01. N = 4–5 tissue replicates per donor, time-point and condition. Replicates that did not meet the minimum signal intensity after 45 PCR cycles are displayed along the x-axis. Viral copy number versus day post-infection shown for HCoV-NL63 (C) and HCoV-OC43 (D) shown for each MOI as indicated in the legends. Transient, non-productive viral infection detected as early as 48 h p.i. and as late as 144 h p.i. in mock condition (0 MOI), is likely the result of technical handling by the experimental operator.Full size imageTreatment of HCoV-NL63 with camostat mesylate versus viral copy numbersCamostat mesylate (CM) is a serine protease inhibitor reported to partially block infection by HCoV-NL63 in Calu-3 cells44 and IAV in human primary bronchial epithelial cells45 and is under investigation as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 in an ongoing clinical trial46. Here we evaluate the effect of CM administered to PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues cultured with human primary epithelial airway cells and inoculated with HCoV-NL63 across a range of MOIs (including mock control, 0 MOI). In Fig. 10, we show infection kinetics for the HCoV-NL63 strain across a range of MOIs for vehicle control versus 20 μM CM-treated cultures in PREDICT96-ALI. While the scatter limits statistical significance, we observe that CM treatment of airway tissues infected with HCoV-NL63 reduces viral copy number at both the 48 and 96 h time points, particularly for the MOI = 0.005 condition.Figure 10Efficacy of camostat mesylate against hCOV-NL63-inoculated PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue. RT-qPCR analyses for viral copies in the apical wash of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue at 0, 48 and 96 h p.i. with HCoV-NL63 across multiple MOIs. Solid lines show viral copies for MOI 0 (red, mock control), MOI 0.005 (blue) and MOI 0.05 (green) when treated with vehicle (DMSO), and dashed lines show corresponding viral copies when treated with 20 µM camostat mesylate. N = 2–4 tissue replicates per donor, time-point and condition. Replicates that did not meet the minimum signal intensity after 45 PCR cycles are displayed along the x-axis.Full size imageDiscussionIn this work, we leverage the PREDICT96-ALI platform to create a high-throughput airway infection model to assist in the development of therapeutics to treat respiratory viral infections. To do so, we developed a barrier tissue model at an ALI with human primary tracheobronchial cells, establishing a pseudostratified epithelium, and cultured atop a semipermeable membrane with independent flow control for each device in the bottom microchannel culture chamber. The data presented demonstrate a robust model for the human tracheobronchial airway comprising of ciliated, basal, club, and goblet cell populations in a physiologically representative distribution and epithelial layer architecture. Human primary epithelial airway cultures established using commercial sources of cadaver tissues were evaluated, as well as fresh bronchial epithelial cells obtained from healthy control subjects via research bronchoscopy. The latter approach represents a potential pathway toward in vitro investigation of respiratory infections as a function of gender, age and co-morbidities using tailored sources of patient specimens that would be difficult to access from commercial vendors.This airway model was applied to the study of respiratory viral infections including IAV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63, and infection kinetics were evaluated across multiple viral strains, donor populations, MOIs, and time points. Experiments conducted with multiple donor populations of NHBE cells suggest the potential of this system for conducting studies of donor-dependent mechanisms of infection and responses to therapeutic interventions. Key advantages of this platform over existing in vitro platforms include the use of human primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells cultured at an ALI, a more physiologically relevant cell-to-media ratio with smaller, more convenient cell culture area than current standard Transwell™ cultures, integrated pumping of basal media to maintain precision control over solute concentration and to avoid the development of non-physiological gradients, and compatibility with in situ, high resolution and real-time imaging. While certain existing organ-on-chip models possess some of these advantages, they are typically low-throughput systems designed for research environments, and are often incompatible with workflows and standard instrumentation in pharmaceutical laboratories. Considering the throughput limitations of the competing organ-on-chip models, the PREDICT96-ALI platform offers an unmatched capacity that enables large combinations of conditions, such as evaluation of three therapeutics across four MOIs and time points with two viral strains and four replicates for each condition simultaneously on a single plate. The PREDICT96-ALI platform combines the high throughput, precision control and physiological relevance necessary to serve as a powerful tool for applications in disease modeling, drug development, and screening. While the throughput of the 96-device platform with integrated pumping and automated, multiplexed TEER measurements represents an important step forward, further automation of the processes described herein would be necessary to establish a high efficiency workflow for pharmaceutical development.A critically important need in the field of respiratory virus research is the establishment of robust in vitro disease models that provide the precision, validation, throughput, and utility necessary for routine operation in drug development laboratories. Until recently, in vitro models suitable for the study of respiratory viral infections have been either high-throughput but simplistic 2D culture plate-based systems utilizing cell lines, or low-throughput and complex organ-on-chip models that are difficult to accommodate in the workflow of many laboratories. The PREDICT96 platform has been reported previously, and represents the first high-throughput organ-on-a-chip platform with integrated precision flow control in a standard ANSI SLAS (American National Standards Institute/Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening) well plate format28. Here, we deployed the airway tissue model successfully in the PREDICT96-ALI platform to investigate infections of two pandemic strains of IAV (A/California/04/09 H1N1 and A/HongKong8/68 H3N2). Infections were monitored using a combination of IF and RT-qPCR, across a range of MOIs and time points, providing a strong foundation for evaluation of therapeutic interventions. As a proof of concept, oseltamivir dosing of the PREDICT96-ALI airway model was shown to reduce viral copies of A/HongKong8/68 H3N2 across two donors, demonstrating the potential of this system for screening therapeutic compounds for respiratory viruses. Finally, infection kinetics were established for human primary bronchial epithelial cells with two different human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43), and treatment with the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate resulted in an observed reduction in viral copies, consistent with activity of CM against the TMPRSS2-mediated viral entry41.Our human airway tissue model has applicability to the study of respiratory viruses including coronaviruses, and we have demonstrated the relevance of this model to monitoring pathogen infection kinetics. To investigate the relevance of our model to novel viral pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, we examined the ability of HCoV-NL63, an alphacoronavirus sharing the same host entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2, to infect and replicate within PREDICT96-ALI. To do so, we first confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts, as well as ACE2 protein expression, in the primary human cells within our model and successfully inoculated the PREDICT96-ALI airway model with HCoV-NL63 across a range of MOIs and for two different human donor primary epithelial cell populations. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in various human tissues, and their relationship with mechanisms of coronavirus infections, remain a subject of intense study47,48,49,50,51. Evaluation of the relative expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across tissue types and across donors represents a vitally important direction for further understanding mechanisms of COVID-19 infection. For instance, questions surrounding the occurrence of COVID-19-related anosmia52, and the reduced incidence of infection in young children53, have been associated with relative levels of ACE2 across nasal versus airway tissues and across various age groups. In a comprehensive study involving the Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression across nasal, airway and lung tissues were evaluated, across age, sex and smoking status54. These studies not only shed light on critical questions related to COVID-19 pathogenesis, but also suggest avenues and strategies for therapeutic intervention. In our analysis, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression were evaluated across two donors and levels were relatively similar. Relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH, the ACE2 levels we observed were of a similar order of magnitude as those reported elsewhere55, but expression is heavily dependent on several variables as described above. The number of recent lethal outbreaks of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the on-going outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the need for human airway models that can be tailored to support and replicate a broad range of respiratory viruses and strains and enable screens for therapeutic treatment discovery. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of our model to support the study of multiple coronavirus genera and species, many of which target unique and sometimes unknown human host cell surface receptors, we directly compared inoculation of HCoV-NL63 with HCoV-OC43, a betacoronavirus targeting the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid receptor56. PREDICT96-ALI experiments explored the differences in infection kinetics between these two strains of coronavirus, indicating that the model is permissive to different coronavirus genera and facilitates replication of these viruses. In addition to the adaptability of the model, we also demonstrated the efficacy of a known antiviral agent in our high-throughput human primary cell-based airway platform, investigating the effect of the compound across various MOI in a single 96-device experiment. This new platform model for infection with coronaviruses represents an important new capability for studying coronavirus infections in human primary lung tissue and evaluating therapeutics, improving upon prior approaches that use immortalized cell lines in high-throughput systems57,58,59 or human primary lung cells in standard Transwell™ formats29,60.In light of current challenges in identifying and developing therapeutic agents in response to emerging respiratory viral diseases, the ability to rapidly assess efficacy in a human relevant platform and to efficiently evaluate donor-to-donor variability via a high throughput system such as PREDICT96 is critical. These data demonstrate the promise of the PREDICT96-ALI airway model as a new capability for preclinical evaluation of therapeutics for respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2 in an efficient, robust, and high-throughput manner. A key question relates to the suitability of this platform technology for operation in facilities required for experimentation with SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens restricted to BSL-3/4 laboratory environments. The PREDICT96-ALI airway platform presents several critical features that render it suitable for use in high-containment facilities, including compact size and an absence of large off-chip laboratory pumps, as well as its ability to interface with standard laboratory infrastructure. These features allow for ease of handling of the system in personal protective equipment (PPE) such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) and pressurized, full-body safety suits associated with high containment work. Further, the ability to adjust the precision controlled perfusion flow and to conduct biophysical sensing and detection in real-time, remotely (by way of Bluetooth), and multiplexed is critically important. Adaptation of the workflow and operational protocols for the PREDICT96-ALI system for use in high containment is underway, toward application of this platform for SARS-CoV-2 research.

McKeirnan, PharmD, BCACP+1 More Since the advent of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the health care community has experienced an increased demand on services. In the United States, the health care system continues to be pushed to its breaking point with rising workload demands on health care providers. These demands include preparing for the implementation of pandemic-related services and delivering those services (eg, point-of-care testing, vaccinations, increased inpatient census, triaging of care).1As essential businesses on the front lines, pharmacies have continued to demonstrate their value during the pandemic by remaining open to the community for vital prescription services, evolving into COVID-19 point-of-care testing sites, and becoming COVID-19 vaccine administration sites. Pharmacies are essential in achieving the end goal of herd immunity2 in the global battle against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Now pharmacies will have the opportunity to take the lessons learned during the COVID-19 vaccination rollout to prepare for the 2021-2022 influenza season.3 On February 26, 2021, the World Health Organization released the recommendations for the 2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine.4 (Also see Equal But Not the Same—2021 Update on Influenza Vaccines on page 6).With many people remaining to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and everyone 6 months and older needing an annual influenza vaccine for the 2021-2022 season, many pharmacies are turning to pharmacy technicians to assist in the process.5,6Federal Vs State Regulation: Advances in the Pharmacy Technician's Ability to VaccinateHistorically, the role of pharmacy technicians in administering vaccinations has been primarily administrative, devoted to tasks such as billing and documentation.7 Due to state-specific scope-of-practice rules and regulations, the technicians’ role has traditionally been limited to assisting pharmacists, rather than physically administering vaccines. However, this changed in 2017, when Idaho became the first state to allow pharmacy technicians to administer vaccinations as part of a statewide initiative toward “relieving the burden that pharmacists typically carry.” Since that time, pharmacy technicians have administered over 25,000 vaccinations in Idaho. Michigan, Washington, Rhode Island, Utah, and Nevada have since followed suit and have granted approval for pharmacy technicians to administer vaccinations.8On August 19, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an amendment to the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, allowing pharmacy technicians to administer immunizations in all US states, regardless of state-specific rules, as long as specific requirements are met (see Table 1).9Technicians interested in learning how to administer immunizations can access an accredited technician-specific training from the National Healthcareer Association,10 the American Pharmacists Association (APhA),11 the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,12 or the Coalition for the Advancement of Pharmacy Technician Practice.13 They can also peruse the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board directory for training programs on immunization administration from other organizations.14 Additionally, information on advanced accreditation for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in the PREP Act, which states where laws allow for the vaccination of children as young as 3 years, is also available from APhA.15The federal government, states, territories, and 21 national pharmacy partners and independent pharmacy networks also are coming together to form the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. This program will increase patients’ access to the vaccines16 through pharmacists as the most trained and accessible health care providers.ACIP, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; ACPE, Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education; PREP, Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness.Additional Ways Pharmacy Technicians Will Assist In Vaccination EffortsPharmacy technicians are critical team members who facilitate a variety of pharmacy services. Just as they perform many roles in the medication-dispensing workflow process, they will assume multiple roles in the delivery of clinical services such as immunizations.Whereas clinical service delivery roles include actual delivery of a service (eg, administering vaccinations), clinical support roles include helping with a clinical service (eg, documentation and billing) but do not include performing the service itself. Technician involvement in clinical service delivery and support roles are vital elements for the sustainability of the services.The results of a 2011 scoping review article identified the following clinical service support roles for pharmacy-based vaccination programs7:DocumentationBillingReporting adverse eventsFacilitating communicationObtaining training and certificationSince that time, pharmacy technicians also have become increasingly involved in screening for vaccine eligibility, making vaccination recommendations, and administering vaccinations under the supervision of a pharmacist.17,18Which role and to what extent it is served will vary from pharmacy to pharmacy. An open dialogue between the entire pharmacy team surrounding each of these roles will be key to successful vaccine implementation. (A sample vaccination role checklist is provided in Table 2.)Questions a pharmacy team should consider when contemplating expanding the role of pharmacy technicians include the following:What roles will technicians serve at this pharmacy?19Which technicians will serve those roles?What training or credentials will they need to serve in this role?19How often and when will technicians serve in these roles?Will they be dedicated to this role or flex (move in and out of the role) within normal pharmacy workflow?It is also critical to gauge technicians’ willingness to expand their role within a pharmacy as comfortability with advanced pharmacy technician roles varies.20 Notably, comfortability increases with increased training and experience. Therefore, if a technician is motivated to serve in one of these new roles but feels uncomfortable, a pharmacy may find that providing additional training, shadowing, and hands-on experience may improve technician willingness to take on additional responsibilities beyond their comfort zone.19-21ConclusionsOverall, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a major toll on the US health care system by significantly increasing the workloaddemands on health care providers. These heightened demands include preparation for pandemic-related services and the resultant delivery of those services. Although many individuals have been asked to remain at home for their health and the health of their community, essential health care workers such as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians have remained on the front lines from the pandemic’s outset.In addition, they were asked to expand public health efforts initially with COVID-19 testing, which was followed by the nationwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout and further opportunities to administer other vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine. Pharmacy technicians are critical to the increasing role pharmacies play in patient care, whether administering the vaccine themselves or supporting the workflow for other pharmacy team members involved in administration. Notably, on February 2, 2021, APhA asked the Biden administration to “include recently retired pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in its campaign to vaccinate 100 million Americans against COVID-19 during the administration’s first 100 days.”22 Following Biden’s inauguration, 100 million Americans had been vaccinated by day 58.23 The Biden administration's latest goal is 70% of American's vaccinated with at least 1 dose by July 4th.24 Sixteen states have already hit that goal, and as of June 24, 2021, 65.7% of US adults have received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.24,25During this unprecedented time, the message is still the same: Pharmacy technician heroes work here.Kenneth C Hohmeier, PharmD, is an associate professor in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Translational Science and director of community affairs at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Pharmacy in Nashville.Kimberly C.

Video Ad Feedback The Tokyo Olympics: A Summer Games like no other 03:44 - Source: CNN CNN — Covid-19 has thrown more than a few curve balls at Tokyo Olympic organizers – but this isn’t the first Games to battle a pandemic. A century ago, the 1920Antwerp Olympics were held only a few months after the Spanish flu ravaged the world, killingat least 50 million people. In 2010, the Vancouver Olympics were threatened by an outbreak of H1N1. In 2016, the Zika virus prompted calls to cancel the Rio Games. And most recently in 2018, officials in Pyeongchang wrestled with an outbreak of the norovirus. Mass gatherings like the Olympics, that bring together people from all over the world, have always posed a huge infectious disease risk. Visitors bring viruses which may not be endemic to the host country and maytake viral souvenirs home to their own communities. “The opportunities for the movement of infectious diseases are accelerated. We’ve seen this across Olympic Games, we’ve seen this in large gatherings like the Hajj or the World Cup,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School. To manage the risk, all Olympic host cities must have a public health plan. Preparations begin several years earlier when officials start working with the Olympic Organizing Committee to form pandemic preparedness and epidemic surveillance plans. They start monitoring local infections to set a baseline and track viruses or any irregular infection patterns that could pose a threat. But few Olympic organizers have had to contend with an outbreak of the size and severity of Covid-19. If nothing else, Tokyo 2020 will enter the record books as the Games that came closest to a last-minute cancellation due to rising case numbers. Here’s how other cities have fared. The Spanish flu, Antwerp 1920 The world was still reeling from the deaths of tens of millions of people from the Spanish flu when some 2,600 athletes gathered in Antwerp to contest the 1920 Summer Olympics. It was just two years after World War I and Belgium was still suffering food shortages. The country couldn’t afford to build a pool so officials set up a wooden frame in a canal to host the swimming competitions. Athletes complained of poor conditions at the 1920 Antwerp Games which followed World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. Getty Images/file Despite the less than desirable conditions, the Games went on without any major problems or outbreaks – they were seen as a symbol of hope and unity in the post-war, post-pandemic world. There is always the risk of diseases spreading as people travel, but another concern is the strain an outbreak could put on local health care systems, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). A community could be prepared to manage an outbreak within its population, but may struggle if that population has ballooned exponentially. In 2012, more than 8 million people attended the London Summer Games, doubling the city’spopulation. Foreseeing the risks, authorities began public health planning more than seven years ahead of the Games, according to a report published in the Lancet medical journal. Together, they developed a public risk health assessment that would become the foundation of Olympic planning.

Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images The UK already had a strong healthcare monitoring system, but extra surveillance was added for the Games, giving officials daily rather than weekly reports of illnesses and mortality across the country. The report said officials had realized the urgency of reassuring the public at such a large event. Workers monitored social media to quickly counter rumors of illness with facts. Public health surveillance methods were improved based on this analysis and would go on to become a legacy of London 2012. Similar risk analysis methods were also used in the planning of Rio 2016. Zika, Rio 2016 Ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics, talk was dominated by the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Symptoms include fever, rash and joint pain, though a Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. Several high level athletes, such as pro golfer Rory McIlroy, dropped out of the competition due to concerns about the illness. Before the Games, Brownstein’s team created a map to model the potential transmission of the Zika virus from the Olympics – Brazil was a hotspot and had declared a national public health emergency in 2015. “We do mining of all these articles and social media posts looking for clues about disease events and different populations across many different languages,” Brownstein said. “We use machine learning and AI to go through all that data, filter it, tag it, and then make it available to like WHO and CDC and others.” A cleaner at Rio's Olympic Tennis Center wears a shirt with an anti-Zika slogan, August 2016. Michael Reynolds/EPA/Shutterstock Researchers mapped areas highly susceptible to the virus, such as parts of Asia and Africa that have dengue outbreaks, countries sending the most athletes, as well as countries with the most travelers from Brazil. Though the WHO said there were no confirmed cases of Zika among Olympics athletes or travelers, maps like this can help predict and prevent viral transmission ahead of mass gatherings. Though there were no confirmed cases of Zika at Rio, that doesn’t mean there were no infections at all since most people don’t show symptoms. While Zika did not have an impact on the Olympics, it continued to torment poorer local communities for months to come. Researchers at UC Berkeley argued the seasonal patterns of diseases similar to Zika predicted Zika’s decline ahead of the Games and the diversion of scarce resources to a relatively low-risk population – wealthy tourists and athletes – instead of those who were in dire need of them, could have been avoided. Swine flu, Vancouver 2010 In June 2009, seven months before the start of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games, the WHO declared H1N1 – also known as swine flu – a pandemic. There were more than 33,000 cases of H1N1 and 428 deaths in Canada during the 2009-2010 flu season, according to Infection Prevention and Control Canada. “It seems so long ago now, but I remember in the fall of 2009 there were high level discussions about the impact this might have on the Games, and it doesn’t seem real now, but at the time, it was very real,” said Rob Stewart, Medical Services Operations Manager of Vancouver 2010. Though the pandemic had largely subsided by the start of the Games, officials were still on high alert.

Bruce Bennett/Getty Images/File Public health was considered in every part of the planning process from venue design, setting up hand washing facilities and proper sanitation, to public messaging on cough etiquette and social distancing. Spectators and athletes who weren’t able to get vaccinated at home were given free H1N1 jabs on site. “Every day we could communicate with public health at about 11 o’clock at night and we’d get the stats for the day and then we would go over them,” said Dr. Mike Wilkinson, Director of Medical Services at Vancouver 2010. Daily briefing documents included everything from immunization levels to air quality to any infectious disease outbreaks in the region. “Influenza activity throughout the region remains well below historical norms. Other respiratory viruses predominate. Drinking water quality data supports tap water as the best choice for visitors and residents,” reads a Health Watch report from February 2, 2010, 10 days before the start of the Games. Ultimately no athletes caught H1N1 at the Vancouver Games. “It’s always said of the Games, if I’m the chief medical officer and I’m the one looking around as if I’m not doing anything that means that I’ve done a good job,” said Wilkinson. Norovirus, Pyeongchang 2018 Similar precautions were taken in the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, where officials battled a norovirus outbreak. Just days before the opening ceremony, norovirus – an extremely contagious stomach bug – spread among security staff at an Olympic accommodation facility, infecting 41 guards.

Heikki Saukkoma/Shutterstock A total of 1,200 security guards were put in quarantine to limit the spread while testing was conducted. “That’s the trick, to catch it early enough,” said Stewart, from Vancouver 2010.“Isolate the people that are sick and they stay there. By the time you’re looking at a whole team, you’re probably quite far down the road. The trick is to catch it right away.” The quarantined staff were quickly replaced with 900 military personnel from South Korea’s conscripted army, who had been on standby with extra manpower as part of the contingency plans. “That is the key of this success, communication among different interest groups is the essential part of the success of the prevention of epidemic outbreak,” said Dr. Young-Hee Lee, Chief Medical Officer of Pyeongchang 2018. Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, medical officers from previous Games have been sharing their experiences and advice with the current organizing committee, though they admit it’s a completely different ball game this time around. “Everything pales in comparison to what they are having to do now in Tokyo,” said Wilkinson, but he said virus surveillance and containment methods remain largely the same. “We know what works, what historically has worked,” he said – personal hygiene, social distancing, masking, cough etiquette and vaccinations are the foundation of that. Stewart added: “You plan for the worst and hope for the best.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Sports Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

We and other groups have reported that immunopathological damage induced by excessive pulmonary inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of severe pneumonia and provides novel strategies for the treatment of severe influenza infection [1,2,3]. The complement system plays critical roles in both innate and adaptive immunity by activating the classical, alternative and lectin pathways [4]. As soluble pattern recognition lectin molecules, ficolins are enriched in the lungs and are essential for protecting the host from invading pathogens [5]. In our previous report, low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inoculation simulated bacterial infection-induced mild pneumonia without death in mice. We found that intranasal LPS administration induced local pulmonary inflammation and increased the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and the expression of ficolin A and ficolin B. LPS-challenged ficolin A-knockout (Fcna−/−) mice showed more severe lung injury than LPS-challenged wild-type (WT) mice. These results suggest that the protective effect of ficolin A may be associated with complement activation, as well as the neutralization of LPS [6]. However, complement is a double-edged sword. Complement activation also triggers potent detrimental hyperinflammatory responses that cause tissue damage and organ failure when these responses are dysregulated or overactivated [7]. Therefore, whether ficolins play protective or detrimental roles in severe pH1N1 infection and their mechanisms need to be investigated. Our results demonstrated that ficolin A-mediated excessive complement activation exacerbates pulmonary proinflammatory responses and contributes to lung immunopathological injury. Targeting ficolin A may be a potential adjunctive therapeutic strategy for alleviating severe influenza-induced viral pneumonia.To explore the dynamic changes of ficolins during pH1N1 infection-induced severe pneumonia, we initially measured the mRNA and protein levels of ficolins in the lung. Severe infection significantly increased the transcription of ficolin A at 3, 5 and 7 dpi and ficolin B at 1 dpi (Fig. S1a). Moreover, severe infection also gradually increased the expression of ficolin A and significantly increased ficolin B at 3 dpi (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, ficolin A was mainly expressed in neutrophils (Fig. S1b), while ficolin B was expressed in neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and inflammatory monocytes (Fig. S1c). Similar results were also confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. S1d).Fig. 1Ficolin A exacerbates pH1N1-induced acute lung injury and the overall dysregulation of inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine secretion by mediating complement activation. a Western blot analysis of ficolin A and ficolin B expression in the lungs after pH1N1 infection. b Survival rates and body weight change ratios in Fcna−/−, Fcnb−/−, and WT mice after pH1N1 infection (n = 8 in each group). c Representative lung tissue injury was assessed by H&E staining at the indicated dpi.

The data are representative of two independent experiments and are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 5 mice/group in each experiment). *, ** and *** represent p < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, compared with the 0 dpi (uninfected) group. #, ## and ### represent p < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. ns = not significantFull size imageFcna−/− and Ficolin B-knockout (Fcnb−/−) mice were further used to assess the roles of these genes in pH1N1-induced severe pneumonia. Notably, compared with WT and Fcnb−/− mice, Fcna−/− mice showed significant improvements in survival rates (62.5% in Fcna−/− mice vs 25% in WT and Fcnb−/− mice), less weight loss and faster weight recovery (Fig. 1b). Moreover, lung histopathological injury [the total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung bronchial and parenchymal destruction, including hemorrhage, alveolar edema, alveolar fusion, and bronchiolar epithelial sloughing] was significantly ameliorated, and inflammatory cell infiltration was attenuated in Fcna−/− mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 1c,d and S2a). These results suggested that ficolin A but not ficolin B could exacerbate pH1N1-induced lung injury and decrease the survival rate.Direct destruction of infected cells by viruses or overactivated immune systems are related to lung histopathological injury. We found that Fcna−/− and Fcnb−/− mice showed similar levels of viral replication by immunohistochemical or Western blot analysis of hemagglutinin protein in the lung (Fig. S2b–d). These results suggested that the detrimental effects of ficolin A were independent of viral replication.The stimulation of excessive inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storms are also critical pathogeneses [8, 9]. After severe pH1N1 infection in WT mice, alveolar macrophages were progressively decreased, and a large number of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes and pulmonary interstitial macrophages were rapidly recruited to the lung, peaking at 3 dpi (Fig. S3a). However, severe pH1N1-infected Fcna−/− mice but not Fcnb−/− mice showed significantly decreased percentages and numbers of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes and interstitial macrophages compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 1e,f). Moreover, the proportions and numbers of alveolar macrophages in Fcna−/− mice were similar to those in WT and Fcnb−/− mice (Fig. S3b). We also examined whether the amelioration of lung injury in Fcna−/− mice was associated with the alleviation of cytokine storms. Severe pH1N1 infection in WT mice induced the release of large amounts of cytokines and chemokines, including TNFα, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, G-CSF, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL1 (Fig. S3c). Compared with those of WT and Fcnb−/− mice, the concentrations of TNFα, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL1, and G-CSF in the BALF of Fcna−/− mice were markedly suppressed at 3, 5, and 7 dpi (Fig. 1g). These results suggested that ficolin A but not ficolin B exacerbated lung injury and mortality by enhancing inflammatory cell recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine release during severe pH1N1 infection.Ficolins can activate the complement lectin pathway to produce the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a [5]. We observed increased levels of C3a and C5a in BALF. However, compared with those of WT mice, the concentrations of C3a and C5a were significantly decreased in Fcna−/− but not Fcnb−/− mice (Fig. 1h). These results demonstrated that ficolin A-mediated complement activation was involved in severe infection-induced lung immunopathological damage.In conclusion, our results demonstrated that pulmonary myeloid-derived ficolin A may be linked to proinflammatory mediators, which contribute to complement activation and boost the inflammatory response in severe pH1N1 infection-induced acute lung immunopathological injury (Fig. 1i). Preventing the stimulation of dysregulated host innate immune response may abrogate the immunopathological damage caused by severe influenza infection.

A twindemic One reason to get more serious about flu is its cost, both economically and in human terms. Annual costs of treating influenza (routinely in excess of $10 billion in the U.S.) are significant, even when you just look at hospital outlays for those most severely affected. Telegram Facebook Copy Link Bloomberg Updated On Jul 23, 2021 at 02:13 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals AP Photo/Dita Alangkara/FileOn the list of things to worry about in the age of SARS-CoV-2, boring, old winter flu probably doesn’t rank highly. Especially not in the middle of a summer heat wave. And yet it should.Humanity has grown so accustomed to annual waves of influenza that it was the baseline comparison when Covid first arrived. (It’ll be just another flu, we said.) The implication was that levels of influenza sickness, hospitalization and death were acceptable, even inevitable.I was certainly guilty of that thinking. Although my employer offers an annual flu shot, I sometimes didn’t bother to get it. But the pandemic has exposed the weakness of our attitudes and policies toward influenza. We now have an opportunity to do things differently. This isn’t an argument for flu-driven lockdowns or a national paranoia about any bug. But we can build better defenses against influenza at relatively little cost, and for a gain in lives and health-care capacity. Advt One reason to get more serious about flu is its cost, both economically and in human terms. Annual costs of treating influenza (routinely in excess of $10 billion in the U.S.) are significant, even when you just look at hospital outlays for those most severely affected. Influenza epidemics in the northern hemisphere affect anywhere from 5% to 15% of the population every year. On average, about 8% of the U.S. population get sick from flu each season. For most, it’s usually a mild, if unpleasant experience. But for some, it can be deadly.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that, on average, 36,000 people have died of flu each year over the last decade, with 61,000 deaths in the 2017-2018 flu season. In the U.K., the average is about 17,000 annual deaths. Obviously, Covid is a different order of magnitude, but the costs to the health-care system from flu are not trivial.The elderly are most vulnerable to flu, but so are pregnant women, very young children and those with other medical conditions and weakened immune systems. Some who contract and recover from flu end up with post-viral symptoms that drag on. Long Covid has showed us just how debilitating these can be. What happens when you layer flu on top of Covid-19? We don’t really know, since last winter saw an incredibly mild flu season, mostly due to measures such as lockdowns, social distancing and masking. Infections rates for flu were two-thirds lower than during the 2011-2012 season, which had record low rates. Advt We can’t count on a repeat. The low prevalence of flu last year makes it harder to predict which strains to include in this winter’s vaccine. We could get lucky again, or things could get worse: Lowered levels of natural immunity after a few low-flu seasons could make it easier for new variants to take hold.Britain, with its overstretched national health-care system and gargantuan backlog of surgeries and other procedures, can scarcely afford a bad flu season. Consultations for influenza-like illnesses take up substantial GP time and hospital capacity in a normal year. High rates of flu on top of Covid would be a strain too far, requiring substantial new government resources and leaving many people without treatment.But it’s not just the compounded health burden that should make us rethink influenza. The fact is, we have been far too complacent about flu for too long. Many flu deaths are preventable with jabs and the kinds of behavioral modifications we’ve grown accustomed to from Covid.Not only did the social-distancing measures imposed during the pandemic decrease the spread of flu, they’re also estimated to have led to a 20% drop in the common respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the U.S. RSV accounts for 5% of the deaths in children under five globally. The problem now, however, is that the recent lifting of Covid restrictions has coincided with unseasonably high RSV cases in the U.S. Higher levels of flu vaccination would be a game-changer. Last winter, flu vaccine uptake in Britain reached record levels, with the National Health Service vaccinating more than 80% of those over 65 — 10% higher than the previous year and ahead of the World Health Organization goal of 75% for the first time.But the vaccination rate drops off with the young. Less than 45% of those under 65 with one or more underlying risk factors gets vaccinated. Although more than 2.5 million children were vaccinated through school programs, that’s still well under half (47.5%) of all kids. Uptake also varies across ethnic groups, with some minorities lagging in getting vaccines. In the U.S., Black communities (where vaccine rates are around 41%) had the highest flu-related hospitalization rate of any ethnicity.A study at the University of Bristol is currently seeking to determine what side effects people get when given the recommended flu vaccine along with either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Getting a joint Covid-19 booster shot and flu shot could ensure that there is more flu vaccine coverage. Of course, the effectiveness of flu vaccines can vary from one season to the next and from person to person. They are normally between 40% and 60% effective when they match up well with the variants circulating.So we’d be well served to also apply our Covid habits to illnesses like flu. That might mean more hybrid working during peak flu months or if there’s an outbreak. Masking at certain times, even if not compulsory, makes a lot of sense too.If Covid-19, like flu, is going to be a recurrent seasonal affliction — as seems probable — we will need to better manage the pressure on the health systems during the winter. That means being prepared to finance higher levels of care during these crunch periods or doing more to reduce the strain on the system. We’ll most likely never eliminate influenza and other viruses, but we can make winters less costly and less miserable by raising the bar on an illness that many of us treated too casually.

This article was originally published on our sister site, Freethink.“I was intrigued,” says Ron Fouchier, in his rich, Dutch-accented English, “in how little things could kill large animals and humans.”It’s late evening in Rotterdam as darkness slowly drapes our Skype conversation.This fascination led the silver-haired virologist to venture into controversial gain-of-function mutation research — work by scientists that adds abilities to pathogens, including experiments that focus on SARS and MERS, the coronavirus cousins of the COVID-19 agent.If we are to avoid another influenza pandemic, we will need to understand the kinds of flu viruses that could cause it. Gain-of-function mutation research can help us with that, says Fouchier, by telling us what kind of mutations might allow a virus to jump across species or evolve into more virulent strains. It could help us prepare and, in doing so, save lives.Many of his scientific peers, however, disagree; they say his experiments are not worth the risks they pose to society.A virus and a firestormThe Dutch virologist, based at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, caused a firestorm of controversy about a decade ago, when he and Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin-Madison announced that they had successfully mutated H5N1, a strain of bird flu, to pass through the air between ferrets, in two separate experiments. Ferrets are considered the best flu models because their respiratory systems react to the flu much like humans.The mutations that gave the virus its ability to be airborne transmissible are gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. GOF research is when scientists purposefully cause mutations that give viruses new abilities in an attempt to better understand the pathogen. In Fouchier’s experiments, they wanted to see if it could be made airborne transmissible so that they could catch potentially dangerous strains early and develop new treatments and vaccines ahead of time.The problem is: their mutated H5N1 could also cause a pandemic if it ever left the lab. In Science magazine, Fouchier himself called it “probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make.”Just three special traits Recreated 1918 influenza virionsCredit: Cynthia Goldsmith / CDC / Dr. Terrence Tumpey / Public domain via WikipediaFor H5N1, Fouchier identified five mutations that could cause three special traits needed to trigger an avian flu to become airborne in mammals. Those traits are (1) the ability to attach to cells of the throat and nose, (2) the ability to survive the colder temperatures found in those places, and (3) the ability to survive in adverse environments.A minimum of three mutations may be all that’s needed for a virus in the wild to make the leap through the air in mammals. If it does, it could spread. Fast.Fouchier calculates the odds of this happening to be fairly low, for any given virus. Each mutation has the potential to cripple the virus on its own. They need to be perfectly aligned for the flu to jump. But these mutations can — and do — happen.“In 2013, a new virus popped up in China,” says Fouchier. “H7N9.”H7N9 is another kind of avian flu, like H5N1. The CDC considers it the most likely flu strain to cause a pandemic. In the human outbreaks that occurred between 2013 and 2015, it killed a staggering 39% of known cases; if H7N9 were to have all five of the gain-of-function mutations Fouchier had identified in his work with H5N1, it could make COVID-19 look like a kitten in comparison.H7N9 had three of those mutations in 2013.Gain-of-function mutation: creating our fears to (possibly) prevent themFlu viruses are basically eight pieces of RNA wrapped up in a ball. To create the gain-of-function mutations, the research used a DNA template for each piece, called a plasmid. Making a single mutation in the plasmid is easy, Fouchier says, and it’s commonly done in genetics labs.If you insert all eight plasmids into a mammalian cell, they hijack the cell’s machinery to create flu virus RNA.“Now you can start to assemble a new virus particle in that cell,” Fouchier says.One infected cell is enough to grow many new virus particles — from one to a thousand to a million; viruses are replication machines. And because they mutate so readily during their replication, the new viruses have to be checked to make sure it only has the mutations the lab caused.The virus then goes into the ferrets, passing through them to generate new viruses until, on the 10th generation, it infected ferrets through the air. By analyzing the virus’s genes in each generation, they can figure out what exact five mutations lead to H5N1 bird flu being airborne between ferrets.And, potentially, people.“This work should never have been done”The potential for the modified H5N1 strain to cause a human pandemic if it ever slipped out of containment has sparked sharp criticism and no shortage of controversy. Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright summed up the far end of the opposition when he told Science that the research “should never have been done.”“When I first heard about the experiments that make highly pathogenic avian influenza transmissible,” says Philip Dormitzer, vice president and chief scientific officer of viral vaccines at Pfizer, “I was interested in the science but concerned about the risks of both the viruses themselves and of the consequences of the reaction to the experiments.”In 2014, in response to researchers’ fears and some lab incidents, the federal government imposed a moratorium on all GOF research, freezing the work.Some scientists believe gain-of-function mutation experiments could be extremely valuable in understanding the potential risks we face from wild influenza strains, but only if they are done right. Dormitzer says that a careful and thoughtful examination of the issue could lead to processes that make gain-of-function mutation research with viruses safer.But in the meantime, the moratorium stifled some research into influenzas — and coronaviruses.The National Academy of Science whipped up some new guidelines, and in December of 2017, the call went out: GOF studies could apply to be funded again. A panel formed by Health and Human Services (HHS) would review applications and make the decision of which studies to fund.As of right now, only Kawaoka and Fouchier’s studies have been approved, getting the green light last winter. They are resuming where they left off.Pandora’s locks: how to contain gain-of-function fluHere’s the thing: the work is indeed potentially dangerous. But there are layers upon layers of safety measures at both Fouchier’s and Kawaoka’s labs.“You really need to think about it like an onion,” says Rebecca Moritz of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Moritz is the select agent responsible for Kawaoka’s lab. Her job is to ensure that all safety standards are met and that protocols are created and drilled; basically, she’s there to prevent viruses from escaping. And this virus has some extra-special considerations.The specific H5N1 strain Kawaoka’s lab uses is on a list called the Federal Select Agent Program. Pathogens on this list need to meet special safety considerations. The GOF experiments have even more stringent guidelines because the research is deemed “dual-use research of concern.”There was debate over whether Fouchier and Kawaoka’s work should even be published.“Dual-use research of concern is legitimate research that could potentially be used for nefarious purposes,” Moritz says. At one time, there was debate over whether Fouchier and Kawaoka’s work should even be published.While the insights they found would help scientists, they could also be used to create bioweapons. The papers had to pass through a review by the U.S. National Science Board for Biosecurity, but they were eventually published.Intentional biowarfare and terrorism aside, the gain-of-function mutation flu must be contained even from accidents. At Wisconsin, that begins with the building itself. The labs are specially designed to be able to contain pathogens (BSL-3 agricultural, for you Inside Baseball types).They are essentially an airtight cement bunker, negatively pressurized so that air will only flow into the lab in case of any breach — keeping the viruses pushed in. And all air in and out of the lap passes through multiple HEPA filters.Inside the lab, researchers wear special protective equipment, including respirators. Anyone coming or going into the lab must go through an intricate dance involving stripping and putting on various articles of clothing and passing through showers and decontamination.And the most dangerous parts of the experiment are performed inside primary containment. For example, a biocontainment cabinet, which acts like an extra high-security box, inside the already highly-secure lab (kind of like the radiation glove box Homer Simpson is working in during the opening credits).“Many people behind the institution are working to make sure this research can be done safely and securely.” — REBECCA MORITZThe Federal Select Agent program can come and inspect you at any time with no warning, Moritz says. At the bare minimum, the whole thing gets shaken down every three years.There are numerous potential dangers — a vial of virus gets dropped; a needle prick; a ferret bite — but Moritz is confident that the safety measures and guidelines will prevent any catastrophe.“The institution and many people behind the institution are working to make sure this research can be done safely and securely,” Moritz says.No human harm has come of the work yet, but the potential for it is real.“Nature will continue to do this”They were dead on the beaches.In the spring of 2014, another type of bird flu, H10N7, swept through the harbor seal population of northern Europe. Starting in Sweden, the virus moved south and west, across Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. It is estimated that 10% of the entire seal population was killed.The virus’s evolution could be tracked through time and space, Fouchier says, as it progressed down the coast. Natural selection pushed through gain-of-function mutations in the seals, similarly to how H5N1 evolved to better jump between ferrets in his lab — his lab which, at the time, was shuttered.“We did our work in the lab,” Fouchier says, with a high level of safety and security. “But the same thing was happening on the beach here in the Netherlands. And so you can tell me to stop doing this research, but nature will continue to do this day in, day out.”Critics argue that the knowledge gained from the experiments is either non-existent or not worth the risk; Fouchier argues that GOF experiments are the only way to learn crucial information on what makes a flu virus a pandemic candidate.“If these three traits could be caused by hundreds of combinations of five mutations, then that increases the risk of these things happening in nature immensely,” Fouchier says.“With something as crucial as flu, we need to investigate everything that we can,” Fouchier says, hoping to find “a new Achilles’ heel of the flu that we can use to stop the impact of it.” Tags biotechCOVID-19EthicsmicrobesResearch In this article biotechCOVID-19EthicsmicrobesResearch Sign up for the Smarter Faster newsletter A weekly newsletter featuring the biggest ideas from the smartest people Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.

The boy was admitted to New Delhi’s premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences on July 2. He died on Tuesday after a multiorgan failure, a government statement said late on Wednesday. Health workers treating the patient and the boy’s family have been kept in isolation, and authorities have launched contact tracing, the statement said. In Haryana, the boy’s home state in India’s north, the Animal Husbandry Department has not found any suspected case of bird flu but has stepped up surveillance, it said. Genome sequencing and virus isolation is in process and an epidemiological investigation has been initiated, the health ministry said. The boy lived in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of capital New Delhi, and was also suffering from leukaemia and pneumonia, a report by the AFP news agency said on Thursday. The death from the bird flu virus of the H5N1 strain highlights a potential new risk for the world’s second-most populous nation battling the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 31 million people and killed over 400,000. India has seen more than half a dozen bird flu outbreaks in poultry in the past 20 years, all of which were brought under control, with no human cases reported in the country previously. Avian influenza occurs mainly in birds and poultry. In 2008, millions of poultry were culled in India. But cases of transmission between humans are extremely rare. H5N1 first broke out in 1997, then spread between 2003 and 2011, while H7N9 was first detected in 2013. Two strains of bird flu, H5N1 and H7N9, first found in 2013, led to human contamination in Asia through infected birds. H7N9 has infected 1,668 people and killed 616 since 2013, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. In the Indian case, the ministry said, the virus belonged to the H5Nx subtype, considered worrying as they have proven to evolve into highly dangerous strains. Last month, China revealed its first human case of bird flu and in February, Russia detected the disease among workers at a poultry factory.

Written by Guest July 22, 2021 11:19 IST Follow Us People with diabetes can protect themselves by staying in regular contact with their physicians through telemedicine. (Photo source: Reuters) By Dr. Hemant P Thacker,As the Covid-19 outbreak continues to evolve, the comparisons have been drawn to other respiratory diseases like Flu, Pneumonia and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV in elderly). Covid-19 and influenza viruses have a similar symptomatic presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease and certain other similar outcomes. Older people, and adults with pre-existing medical conditions specially Diabetes are more vulnerable to become severely ill due to Influenza or Covid-19. However, people with diabetes, by virtue of a fragile immune response have a 5 in 1 chance of contracting respiratory diseases as compared to the population in general, making vaccination the most effective way to prevent seasonal and respiratory infections like flu. This is undoubtedly the right time for vaccination since India is a southern hemispheric country where respiratory diseases take a peak in monsoon.According to various research, people of all ages can be infected with respiratory diseases. It has been estimated that influenza causes 2.9 – 6.5 lakhs respiratory deaths annually worldwide. However, in many cases of influenza, the respiratory illness is mild due to adoption of early preventive measures but in case of covid-19, almost 15% of cases are severe with critical illness.Also Read 23-year-old US woman goes blind after swimming with contact lenses-Know all about this shocking case EXPLAINER | Why census worries are legitimate How effective are flu shots in protecting you from seasonal coughs and colds? Doctors explain Enhanced Enforcement on OIDAR Services Even WHO recommends that the Influenza vaccination must be prioritized for pregnant women, children?(special precaution must be taken for the age group of 6 months to 5 years), elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions like diabetes, heart conditions, and healthcare workers.?Vaccines: Aids prevention and allows protectionVaccination helps the immune system develop and boost protection shields in any-body against diseases. An influenza vaccine has been around for over 2 decades now and despite the pandemic, it is indeed advisable to immunize oneself as a safe precaution to reduce burden on the healthcare system. An influenza vaccine potentially prevents the symptoms from disrupting our daily lives, saving thousands of trips to the doctor each year. Besides, vaccines are not only important for your personal wellbeing but also for the safety of others, especially the loved ones around us.Certainly, immunization is a process which allows protection and prevention and must not be limited to children. Adult immunization is equally important to strengthen primary healthcare systems. Amidst Covid-19, there is a rise in the number of adults proactively taking regular vaccination and that could be a great start towards building herd immunity.Health management amidst Covid-19With the ongoing lockdown and fear of going to the hospital, managing health during the pandemic has been quite a task. While getting the Covid-19 vaccine is critical, one must also get an influenza vaccine as primary protection against H1N1 and other circulating types. Other safety measures must be followed by staying at home and maintaining social distancing, stepping out only when necessary and wearing a mask while stepping out. Similarly, people with diabetes can protect themselves by staying in regular contact with their physicians through telemedicine, keeping a track on proper recommended diet and blood sugar, staying hydrated and most importantly adhering to all prescribed medications.(The author is Consultant Physician & Cardiometabolic Specialist and Director & HOD Medicine at Bhatia Hospital.

Experts have flagged the emergence and re-emergence of zoonosis — disease that passes into human population from an animal source directly or through an intermediary species — a concern in the last two decades. “This has become a regular phenomenon and and is a call to develop mechanisms to respond to such eventualities,” Chandrakant Lahariya, public policy and health systems expert, told Down to Earth.Several instances of bird flu have already been reported this year: More than 2,000 birds died at Pong Lake in Himachal Pradesh. The disease has been found in bar-headed geese, black and brown headed gulls and the Eurasian teal among migratory birds.This zoonotic disease is generally found in wild birds. Waterfowl such as ducks and geese are affected but do not show any symptoms. Migratory birds too are reservoirs of the virus. These birds put farmed poultry as well the people who handle them at risk. Bird flu is caused by influenza A viruses, which have 18 H subtypes and 11 N subtypes. Only viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes are known to cause the highly pathogenic form of the disease. Since January 2021, H5N8 strain and H5N1 have been reported in India. The strain that killed the 11-year-old is yet to be identified. The viral strain, H5N1, has a history of spreading over to humans from birds. The disease has a high mortality rate and can kill as many as 60 per cent of infected people, according to the World Health Organization. In humans, bird flu symptoms range from fever, cough, sore throat, headaches, red eyes and difficulty in breathing. Pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and adults over the age of 65 years are at risk.The disease has spread despite active surveillance in the country. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying released the revised action plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza in 2021.India developed systems for surveillance since its first outbreak in 2006, when birds were reported dead in the village of Navapur in Maharashtra’s Nandurbar district. This was caused by the H5N1 strain.Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme under National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi, is supposed to keep tabs on the avian influenza in India. All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are reportable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). The WHO has been pointing to a flu pandemic for some time now. Swine flu is also a zoonotic disease of concern. The World Health Organization formed a high-level expert panel ‘One Health’ to study the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases such as H5N1, avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, Zika and possibly the novel coronavirus disease in May this year.Lahariya added: “We know what needs to be done, but there is no action. There is a need to strengthen disease surveillance across the country, including in rural areas. We need to provide sufficient government funding, train the workforce, strengthen laboratories, prepare rapid response teams and establish collaboration between states.” He said the system needs to be woven in the foundation of India’s primary healthcare system. “That is how we will be prepared for future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics,” he said.IndiaHealthThe World Health Organization (WHO)Avian Flubird fluH5N1 viruszoonotic diseasesdisease surveillancebird flu deathIntegrated Disease Surveillance ProgramShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

This is the first bird flu death recorded in the country since the beginning of this year.The entire staff at AIIMS, New Delhi, has been placed in isolation as a preventative measure.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), human cases of bird flu (Avian Influenza) occur " occasionally" but when they do happen, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent.advertisementREAD: Bird flu: Gravity, threat to humans and economic impact explainedBird flu outbreaks were reported across the country earlier this year, including in Haryana where experts detected the H5N8 subtype of the Avian Influenza virus. This strain is not known to infect humans.The central government had sounded an alert when cases of bird flu were confirmed in Delhi and at least ten states, including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana. Culling of birds was carried out in large numbers across the country in a bid to counter the spread of infection. File photo of an expert collecting samples from ducks at Manda Zoo Park in Jammu to check for bird flu (Photo Credits: PTI) In Delhi, samples collected from the Red Fort had tested positive for bird flu in January. The Delhi government had then ordered the closure of the Ghazipur poultry market.More samples collected from the National Zoological Park in Delhi had returned positive for Avian Influenza in February.Avian Influenza had resurfaced in March when 261 poultry birds were found dead in Maharashtra's Amravati and Nandurbar districts. Fear of infection peaked again in April when as many as 100 migratory birds were found dead in the Pong Dam lake in Himachal Pradesh.

(AAP Image/Paul Miller) NO ARCHIVING Onion and sugar flu ‘remedy’ is more a recipe for bad teeth AAP FactCheck July 21, 2021 The Statement Multiple Facebook posts claim that a homemade medicine of raw onion and sugar can cure colds and flu in children – even newborns. The recipe was posted to Facebook by a user in Australia along with the text: “Obviously there’s still a lot of people who don’t know about this simple and effective home remedy … it works better than any over the counter prescriptions that are out there and best of all your (sic) not giving your kids unknown chemicals or whatever poisons they put into meds these days”. According to the post, the concoction is made by soaking sliced brown onions in sugar, before placing the mixture in the fridge overnight. “The next morning you will end up with liquid or onion juice on the plate. The liquid is what you take or give to your child,” it says. At the time of writing, the July 6 post had been viewed more than 500,000 times and shared more than 3400 times. Other Facebook users in Australia and New Zealand have posted the same recipe, see here, here, and here. The purported remedy is made by soaking sliced onions in sugar and placing the mix in the fridge. The Analysis Dousing onions in sugar is a great way to make caramelised onions – but it’s not a good way to stop kids from getting colds and flu. Paediatric respiratory health experts told AAP FactCheck that the mixture will do absolutely nothing to cure children of respiratory health problems and is more likely to result in a trip to the dentist. Professor Anne Chang, the head of child health at the Menzies School of Health Research, told AAP FactCheck in an email that there is “no published scientific evidence whatsoever in reputable journals” to back up the claims made in the social media posts. “Anything soaked in sugar is likely to be unhealthy,” she added. Professor Sarath Ranganathan, a paediatric respiratory medicine from the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, also told AAP FactCheck that the supposed remedy will do nothing to cure respiratory problems in children. “There is no cure for colds, flu and bronchitis (or bronchiolitis),” he said in an email. “Occasionally wheezy children benefit with bronchodilators. Paracetamol can occasionally be given for high fever with distress (and) risk of influenza can be mitigated with seasonal vaccination.” Prof Ranganathan said the most likely outcome from drinking sugary onion juice is that it would “rot the teeth”. The myth that onions prevent colds and flu goes back many centuries. In the first century AD, Roman emperor Nero reportedly swore by onions as a cure for colds, while the claim that onions can treat influenza goes back to at least the 1500s, according to the US National Onion Association. However, despite some anecdotal stories of success, the idea that mixing onions with sugar will prevent colds, flu and bronchitis is not supported by medical science. Some studies have found that onion extracts can prevent respiratory disease in animals, such as this Japanese study showing that fructan (sugar molecules) extracted from Welsh onions could reduce influenza in mice. A 2019 study found red onion extract could help prevent lung lesions in chickens. Onions also have nutritional benefits for humans, while some studies have found that their extracts could potentially improve wellbeing in a range of ways, such as reducing cholesterol, treating fungal diseases or lowering blood pressure. Other studies – see here, here, here, here and here – suggest onions may even help prevent some types of cancer, although further research is needed. Despite these benefits, no credible research has concluded that onions or onion juice will stop humans from contracting a cold, influenza or bronchitis. Mixing onions with sugar to prevent colds and flu is not supported by medical science, experts say. The Verdict There is no scientific basis for the post’s purported remedy, experts told AAP FactCheck. Studies have found onions may provide some health benefits to humans, however there is no evidence they will cure colds, flu or bronchitis. False – Content has no basis in fact.

Immune response to the vaccine is measured at D49, D56, D63, and D146 by serum levels of IAV-specific IgG and assays of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). Analysis of the pre-vaccination microbiota characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal DNA reveals a higher vaccine response in piglets with a richer microbiota, and shows that 23 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are differentially abundant between high and low IAV-specific IgG producers at D63. A stronger immune response is linked with OTUs assigned to the genus Prevotella and family Muribaculaceae, and a weaker response is linked with OTUs assigned to the genera Helicobacter and Escherichia-Shigella. A set of 81 OTUs accurately predicts IAV-specific IgG and HAI titer levels at all time points, highlighting early and late associations between pre-vaccination fecal microbiota composition and immune response to the vaccine.

One of the main sanitary measures to defend animals against infections is vaccination, which aims to limit an individual’s susceptibility to infection and resulting infectiousness. By preventing disease at the level of the individual, vaccination subsequently protects herds and farms against widespread infections that can lead to high mortality and morbidity, and the potential of massive losses in production1. Thus, vaccination promotes animal welfare and helps to stabilize animal production costs. Furthermore, by preventing disease before it occurs, vaccination enables a reduction in antibiotic usage on farms, which mitigates the risk of promoting antibiotic-resistant bacteria2.The swine flu is widespread around the world, affecting one out of every two farms in France3, and has a worldwide seroprevalence that ranges from 32% in Africa to 88% in South America4. The disease is usually benign but is highly contagious, with morbidity rates up to 100% on farms. Infected pigs have a fever and exhibit depression, coughing, sneezing, breathing difficulties, eye inflammation, and a lack of interest in feeding5. While mortality rates are generally low compared to other diseases (1–4%), swine flu leads to delayed weight gain, suboptimal reproductive performance, secondary infections, and thus economic losses. The etiologic agent is the Influenza A virus (IAV), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to family Orthomyxoviridae. The virus is characterized by its surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin enables the virus to enter into host cells, and neuraminidase leads to the release of virions from infected cells6. The main circulating strains of IAV are serotypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N27,8. In 2009, nucleic reassortment between the viral surface proteins of avian and porcine strains generated viruses that were also pathogenic to humans, leading to zoonosis and a pandemic9. Limiting outbreaks of swine flu is thus a global concern, with vaccination one of the best sanitary measures available4.For most swine diseases for which a vaccine exists, there is variability in the response to vaccination within animal populations10,11. In order to increase the efficiency of vaccination, it is crucial to better understand the interactions between hosts and pathogens as well as the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity that are involved in the vaccine response. Likewise, it is important to investigate how these processes can vary among individuals, by deciphering the biological factors that explain why individuals within a single population differ in their ability to mount an immune response. Thus far, most genetic studies that have been conducted in pigs have shown that the host genetics influences the antibody response to vaccines against various pathogens12,13,14,15.There is also growing evidence that the gut microbiota can play a role in the immune response to vaccines, at least in humans16,17, and these commensal and symbiotic microbial communities are currently the focus of research to improve vaccine design and efficiency16,17,18,19. The first advances in this field were obtained for oral vaccination and harnessed the adjuvant properties of specific types of intestinal bacteria. In humans and mice, it has been shown that the stability and survival of certain viruses in the gut are enhanced when the viral particles are attached to bacterial components. For instance, gut bacteria that express histo-blood group antigens stabilize norovirus in humans20, while bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have a similar effect for poliovirus in mice21,22. Furthermore, the gut microbiota can have effects on remote parts of the body, and, for example, can act on the respiratory system to influence the disease severity of influenza or the vaccine response. Specifically, disequilibrium in the gut microbiota composition often referred to as dysbiosis, predisposes mice to severe influenza through changes in type I and II interferon and toll-like receptor signaling23,24; in humans, it alters the vaccine response of individuals with no pre-existing immunity to the flu virus25. Some of the underlying mechanisms have already been described. In the case of flu vaccination in humans, bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids26 or desaminotyrosine27,28, and specific components of the bacterial cell wall such as flagellin29,30, were shown to improve vaccine response. As a result of these findings, bacterial components are being increasingly considered as potential adjuvants to enhance the antigen persistence of inactivated vaccines31.In pigs, our group has previously reported associations between pre-vaccination fecal microbiota and the response to vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. A small set of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly assigned to genus Prevotella, was differentially abundant between individuals that demonstrated strong and weak responses to the vaccine32,33.The main aims of our study were to analyse the following: (i) whether fecal microbiota composition before vaccination was associated with vaccine response intensity and (ii) whether vaccination induced differences in microbiota evolution between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs. To achieve these objectives, we investigated the links between the fecal microbiota and the individual humoral vaccine response of Large White pigs vaccinated against IAV. Animals were studied from just before vaccination until slaughter, and we followed the community dynamics of the fecal microbiota and the evolution of the immune response to the vaccine, measured by serum levels of IAV-specific IgG and assays of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI).ResultsAn experimental design to follow both fecal microbiota composition and response to IAV vaccine over a period of four monthsWe analyzed the association between fecal microbiota composition and vaccine response to IAV in a cohort of 98 pigs without passive immunization against IAV via the mother’s colostrum. The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the vaccine response was assessed by measuring both seric levels of IAV-specific IgG and HAI titers (Fig. 1). The IAV-specific IgG levels follow the response to the overall influenza epitopes, and the HAI titers follow the response restricted to hemagglutinin that is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. As summarized in Fig. 1a, the pigs were vaccinated at 28 days of age (D28), with a booster three weeks later (D49). Stools and blood were collected at D28 before vaccination and at four time points corresponding to the early antibody response (D49), the maximum intensity antibody response (D56 and D63), and the persistence of antibody response until slaughtering (D146). Based on the range of variations for the vaccine responses measured by either seric IgG levels (Fig. 1b) or HAI titers (Fig. 1c), we identified at each time point groups of extreme responders (Table 1) that we defined as low and high responders (LR vs HR) as described in the Methods section. Due to the criteria chosen to set up the groups of high and low responders, the animals and their number per group vary according to time points and dosage. Despite a limited animal sharing across groups of extreme responders (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1), we did not observe discordance for animals harboring high or low response at the three main periods of the response (early at D49, the maximum intensity at D56 or D63 and Ab persistence at D146). Then, depending on analyses, we studied either the whole population or groups of extreme responders based on IAV-specific IgG and HAI titers at D49, D56, D63, and D146.Fig. 1: Experimental design and timeline of the Ab response after vaccination against IAV.a Summary of the protocol design, animal sampling, and data production. The timeline represents the mean age of the animals both from birth (above the line) and from the vaccine day (below the line). Animal parameters included body weight (gray stars) and fecal score at weaning on the vaccine day (red star). Stool samples were collected at three time points for 16S rRNA sequencing (green stars). In order to follow the vaccine response dynamics over time, blood was collected at five time points from the vaccine day until slaughtering (blue stars) for further seric dosage of IAV-specific IgG and measurement of HAI titers. b Box plot representation of IAV-specific IgG seric levels from vaccinated animals at D28 (before vaccination), D49, D56, D63, and D146.

Gene sequencing of 16S rRNA from fecal DNA provided 4,182,259 reads, which, following processing by FROGS, yielded 2,402,310 sequences. We obtained an average of 26,992 sequences per sample, with a range from 11,693 to 48,357. From these, we identified 1172 OTUs that were assigned to 10 phyla, 41 families, and 152 genera. An alignment of OTU sequences with the SILV132 16S rRNA sequence database provided annotation of the 10 phyla (100%), 37 of the 41 families (90.2%), 129 of the 152 genera (84.9%), and 40 out of 1172 OTUs (3.4%) (Supplementary Data 2). Eight OTUs — assigned to the families Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Lachnospiraceae — were detected in all fecal samples. These may represent a core community at D28, and their cumulative average abundance reached 11.3% (Supplementary Data 2).The two most dominant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with average relative abundances of 54.8% and 30.5%, respectively; these were followed by Fusobacteria (6%), Spirochaetes (4.6%), and Proteobacteria (3.2%) (Supplementary Data 3). In phylum Firmicutes, the main families were Ruminococcaceae (25.5%), Lachnospiraceae (13.9%), and to a lesser extent, Christensenellaceae (6.2%) and Clostridiales vadinBB60 group (4.2%). In phylum Bacteroidetes, the main families were Prevotellaceae (12.4%), Rikenellaceae (6.2%), and to a lesser extent, Muribaculaceae (3.7%) and Bacteroidaceae (2.9%) (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Composition of fecal microbiota of vaccinated piglets at D28 and visualization of sample dispersion by NMDS.a Relative abundance of OTUs in the fecal microbiota of 89 vaccinated pigs, annotated to the family level for families with a mean abundance over 2.5% and extended further for family Enterobacteriaceae. Each column represents a sample. Family annotation is color-coded and the corresponding phylum is indicated above the list of family names. The relative abundances of families are available in Supplementary Table 2. b–e NMDS representations of fecal microbiota sample dispersion considering the effect of b sex, c age at weaning in days, d batch, or e diarrhea score at D28. The corresponding p-values of the Adonis test are indicated. The 12 animals in which the relative abundance of Fusobacteriaceae was higher than 12% are surrounded with a red dotted circle on the NMDS representation in (e) and are highlighted by a red star on the abundance bar plot in (a). All corresponding data are available in Supplementary Table 1 and in Supplementary Data 3.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 2b, there were no differences between the fecal microbiota of females and males at D28 (Adonis analysis on Bray Curtis distance, p-value = 0.55) (Supplementary Table 1). Body weight at weaning was the only parameter that displayed significant associations with alpha diversity. Animal batch, age at weaning, and weight at weaning were linked with dissimilarity in microbial community composition, as characterized with Bray Curtis distances (respective Adonis p-values: 1.6 × 10−3, 1 × 10−4, and 9.6 × 10−3) (Fig. 2c, d), with more homogeneity among the microbiota of animals that were older at weaning. The weaning age and body weight at weaning were not identified as confounding effects, as no significant correlation was observed between those two parameters (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.15, p-value = 0.15). When we examined the community composition of the samples, we found that the 89 samples clustered in two unbalanced groups, which mainly differed in the relative abundance of Fusobacteria. Specifically, 12 samples had an abundance of Fusobacteria that was higher than 12%, while in the remaining 77 samples this phylum represented less than 0.55% of OTUs (Fig. 2e). Animals with a higher abundance of Fusobacteria displayed more diarrhea at D28 (Kruskall Wallis test, p-value = 6.8 × 10−7), but we did not have additional explanations for the presence of more Fusobacteria in this subset of 12 piglets.Fecal microbiota composition changes after weaning and vaccination, with no detectable differences on alpha and beta diversity between groups of vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigsWe compared the fecal microbiota of vaccinated (n = 89) versus non-vaccinated (n = 29) animals at all time points by analyzing patterns of alpha and beta diversity. Our results did not show significant effects of vaccination on alpha diversity (Richness and Shannon) or on beta diversity (Adonis analysis on Bray-Curtis distance) at any time point after vaccination (D49, D63, D146) (alpha diversity: all nominal p-values > 0.3, and FDR > 0.5; beta diversity: all nominal p-values > 0.2, and FDR > 0.9). Nevertheless, we were able to identify OTUs with differential abundance in vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs at D28 (113 OTUs), D49 (74 OTUs), D63 (11 OTUs), and D146 (21 OTUs) (Supplementary Data 4). Almost all differentially abundant OTUs were rare (below 0.1%), except 2 OTUs out of 113 from D28 microbiota and 2 OTUs out of 74 from D49 microbiota that displayed a relative abundance between 1 and 2%. Because we detected such patterns of differential abundance between vaccinated and control animals even at D28 (Supplementary Data 4), it seemed that any differences between the two groups mostly arose from the wide range of inter-individual variability in fecal microbiota at weaning, and their overall effect was negligible. We were thus more focused on the differences in the pre-vaccination microbiota composition between high and low responders.Of the original 98 vaccinated animals, we were able to obtain data at every time point for 74, meaning that we were able to follow the composition of their fecal microbiota from D28 to D146 (until slaughter). We identified 1258, 1207, and 1238 OTUs at D49, D63, and D146, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Phylum Bacteroidetes was dominant at all ages post-weaning, with a mean relative abundance that declined with time from 64% to 48% (Supplementary Data 3). This group was mainly composed of Prevotellaceae. The next-most dominant phylum was Firmicutes, with a mean relative abundance that increased with time from 28 to 46%. This group was mainly composed of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and to a lesser extent Christensenellaceae. Compared with the microbiota at D28, there was a large increase post-vaccination in the prevalence of the genus Prevotella 9, which reached a mean relative abundance of 44% at D63 and remained dominant until D146 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Of the other genera within family Prevotellaceae, five demonstrated more moderate increases after weaning (Prevotella 7, Prevotella 2, Prevotellaceae NK3B31 group, Prevotella 1, and an unknown genus), while Dialister and Roseburia also increased dramatically, from less than 0.6% to close to 5%. Conversely, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Fusobacterium, Ruminococcaceae UCG-005 and 002, and Bacteroides, which were all among the ten most abundant genera in the D28 fecal microbiota, decreased to abundances of less than 5% after vaccination. We detected a stratification of the population into two enterotypes at D63 (Supplementary Fig. 3a-b, Supplementary Table 2), one with higher abundances of Prevotella and Mitsuokella (55 pigs) and the other with a higher abundance of Treponema (43 pigs).Alpha diversity of the pre-vaccination fecal microbiota at D28 is associated with the maximum intensity of the vaccine response at D56 and D63Individual vaccine responses were evaluated at D49, D56, D63, and D146 by measuring IAV-specific IgG levels and HAI titers for the total population. Average responses are reported in Fig. 1b–c, and in Table 1. We then constructed a linear regression model between each alpha diversity index and the IAV-specific IgG and HAI responses from the total population of vaccinated animals. Based on this, we observed that fecal microbiota richness before vaccination displayed associations with vaccine response at D56 and D63 with a suggestive significance (nominal p-value < 0.05, FDR < 0.1). This was observed for both IAV-specific IgG and HAI: the higher the microbial richness, the higher the maximum vaccine response (Table 2, Supplementary Data 5).Table 2 Association between the alpha and beta diversity of the D28 fecal microbiota and the IAV vaccine response at D49, D56, D63, and D146.Full size tableGroups of high and low producers of IAV-specific IgG at D63 differ by beta diversity and OTU content of their pre-vaccination fecal microbiota at D28Based on their IAV-specific IgG levels or HAI titers at D49, D56, D63, and D146, pigs were classified as high vaccine responders (HR) or low vaccine responders (LR). The average vaccine responses for those groups are reported in Table 1. We then investigated potential links with their microbiota by calculating the microbial dissimilarity at D28 between HR and LR pigs (Table 2). The only significant difference in community composition was found between HR and LR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG levels at D63, as revealed by the presence of two clusters in an NMDS ordination (Fig. 3a, Adonis p-value = 0.014). Of the two outliers, one represented HR and the other LR, and both corresponded to piglets harboring a high abundance of Fusobacteria. Although we detected five differentially abundant OTUs between HR and LR groups defined by HAI response at D56, there was only a trend toward dissimilarity between these groups based on Bray-Curtis distances (p-value = 0.079).Fig. 3: Links between the composition of pre-vaccination fecal microbiota at D28 and vaccine response levels at different time points.a NMDS representation of individuals corresponding to high (red dots) and low (blue dots) producers of IAV-specific IgG at D63. b Number of OTUs that were differentially abundant between high and low responders defined by IAV-specific IgG or HAI at D49 (blue), D56 (red), D63 (red), and D146 (purple). Arrows connect the number of differentially abundant OTUs with the NMDS representation of the corresponding high and low groups used for the differential abundance analysis. NMDS ordination is based on Bray-Curtis distance. The p-values of the Adonis test between high and low groups are indicated (corresponding data available in Table 2 and Supplementary Data 6).Full size imageWe carried out an analysis of D28 fecal microbiota to identify OTUs that were differentially abundant between the groups that would later demonstrate extreme responses. As shown in Fig. 3b, we found 23 differentially abundant OTUs between the HR and LR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG at D63, 5 differentially abundant OTUs between the groups defined by HAI at D56, and 1 differentially abundant OTU for the groups defined by HAI at D49 (Supplementary Data 6). No differentially abundant OTUs were observed at any other time point.When we examined the set of 23 OTUs that were differentially abundant in the D28 microbiota of extreme responders for IAV-specific IgG at D63, 8 were more abundant in the future HR group and 15 were more abundant in the future LR group (Fig. 4). Among the eight OTUs that were overabundant in the HR group, three corresponded to unknown species assigned to the genus Prevotella 2: Cluster_520 (FDR 0.04), Cluster_11 (FDR 0.004), and Cluster_75 (FDR 0.03) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Cluster_11 was present in all piglets, with average abundances of 2.05% and 1.38% in HR and LR groups, respectively. An unknown species from family Paludibacteraceae had the most significant and largest-magnitude change between the two groups of extreme responders, with a mean abundance of 2% among HR animals and 0.01% among LR animals (Cluster_199, FDR = 0.0008, Log2FC = −5.07). An OTU assigned to order Bradymonadales was found with an average abundance of 1.07% in the HR group and 0.03% in the LR group (Cluster_55, FDR = 0.004). Three other OTUs from the genera Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Ruminococcus 1, and CAG-873 were specific to the HR animals, but with mean relative abundances below 1% (Cluster_220, Cluster_115, and Cluster_53, respectively).Fig. 4: Summary of taxonomic annotation and quantitative analysis of the 23 OTUs that were differentially abundant in the D28 fecal microbiota of pigs that demonstrated extreme IAV-specific IgG responses at D63.OTUs are ordered according to their phylogeny. Taxonomic classification is indicated at the genus level except for two OTUs annotated at the levels of family (f) and order (o). The cluster identifier for each OTU is indicated in parentheses after the taxonomic annotation. The Log2 fold change (Log2 FC) between high (red) and low (blue) responders is represented by horizontal histograms together with the mean relative abundance, in percentage (%), per group. The respective occurrence of each OTU in high (red) and low (blue) responder groups is indicated on the right hand of the figure and indicates the percentage of individuals per group that contained that OTU. All data are available in Supplementary Data 6.Full size imageAmong the 15 OTUs that were more abundant in the LR group, two were annotated to genus Helicobacter (Cluster_230 FDR = 0.02, Cluster_492 FDR = 0.03), two to genus Bacteroides (Cluster_44 FDR = 0.03, Cluster_330 FDR = 0.02), two to Christensenellaceae R-7 group (Cluster_169 FDR = 0.004, Cluster_165 FDR = 0.03), one to Succinivibrio, and one to Escherichia-Shigella. The mean relative abundance of the OTU assigned to Escherichia-Shigella reached 3.3% in the LR group, and no other OTU from this genus was identified in the dataset (Cluster_60, FDR = 0.03) (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This OTU was found in all piglets (HR and LR groups), meaning that the difference between the two groups was due to differential abundance, and was not biased by the absence of this OTU in the HR group.A network analysis with the 23 differentially abundant OTUs (Fig. 5) allowed us to evaluate if there were groups of co-abundant OTUs that could act together or share similar ecological niches. For the OTUs that were more abundant in the HR animals, we observed that the relative abundances of the three OTUs annotated to Prevotella 2 were highly correlated (p-value = 0.02, rho estimator Cluster_75-Cluster_520 = 0.55, Cluster_75-Cluster_11 = 0.68, Cluster_520-Cluster_11 = 0.68) (Supplementary Data 7). Cluster_55, which was assigned to order Bradymonodales, and Cluster_199, assigned to family Paludibacteraceae, were also co-abundant (p-value = 0.02, rho estimator = 0.45). For those that were more abundant in the LR group, at the genus level, we observed co-abundance between two OTUs annotated to the Christensenellaceae R-7 group, and between two OTUs annotated to genus Bacteroides. When we investigated associations among OTUs with close phylogenetic relationships, we observed that an OTU from Christensenellaceae R-7 group (Cluster_165) was co-abundant with three other Clostridia (Cluster_169, 14, and 152), and that three OTUs from genus Prevotella 2 were all co-abundant, with high correlation coefficients (Cluster_75, 11, and 520).Fig. 5: Co-abundance network of OTUs that were differentially abundant in the D28 fecal microbiota of pigs that demonstrated extreme IAV-specific IgG responses at D63.Only intermediate (fastsparr correlation > 0.4) or high (fastsparr correlation > 0.5) correlations of statistically significant effect (p-value < 0.05) are represented, reducing the initial number of 23 differentially abundant OTUs to 15 in the figure. OTUs that were more abundant in high or low responders are surrounded by pale orange or pale blue ovoids, respectively. Each OTU is represented by a node with a color that corresponds to its class affiliation (blue for Bacteroidia, brown for Clostridia, and gray for Gammaproteobacteria). Each OTU is named with its corresponding sequence cluster identifier with annotation at the genus (g) or family (f) level. Co-abundance between two OTUs is represented by a connecting line, green or red for positive and negative correlations, respectively. The thickness of the connecting lines is proportional to the strength of the correlation, either between 0.4 and 0.5 or above 0.5. Correlation was calculated on the whole population of 89 vaccinated piglets and their associated p-values are available in Supplementary Data 7.Full size imageIdentification of a set of 81 OTUs from D28 fecal microbiota that predicts the vaccination response levelWe applied sPLS-DA discriminant analyses to study whether OTUs identified in the D28 fecal microbiota could serve as predictors of the LR and HR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG and HAI at D49, D56, D63, and D146 (Supplementary Data 8).We identified sets of 7, 9, 3, and 23 OTUs that best predicted high or low levels of IAV-specific IgG at D49 (AUC = 0.952, p-value of 0.007), D56 (AUC = 0.959, p-value of 8 × 10−4), D63 (AUC = 0.982, p-value of 2 × 10−4), and D146 (AUC = 1, p-value of 6 × 10−5), respectively (Fig. 6a–d, Supplementary Data 8). Among the seven OTUs that best-discriminated vaccine response at D49, five were annotated to family Prevotellaceae, of which three were assigned to the genus Prevotella 2 and the remaining two to the genera Prevotella 1 and 9. This was consistent with our finding that OTUs assigned to Prevotella 2 were found to be differentially abundant in the HR group defined by IAV-specific IgG at D63 (Fig. 4). One OTU annotated to family Prevotellaceae was also identified among the three OTUs that best discriminated among the extreme responders at D63. Two OTUs assigned to Prevotella 9 were also found to be highly predictive of IAV-specific IgG response at D146. However, 10 of the 23 most-discriminant OTUs were assigned to family Ruminococcaceae. One OTU (Cluster_622) from genus Bacteroides was also identified through sPLS-DA among the nine bacteria that distinguished the extreme IAV-specific IgG responders at D56.Fig. 6: Loading plots representing the specific contribution of OTUs to the prediction of vaccine response.The OTUs were selected by sPLS-DA (data available in Supplementary Data 8). The color of each bar indicates the group of pigs in which that OTU had a higher mean relative abundance: orange for high responders and blue for low responders. a–d Contributions of OTUs to the first component are displayed for the analysis of IAV-specific IgG levels at a D49, b D56, c D63, and d D146. e–h Contributions of OTUs to the first component are displayed for the analysis of HAI titers at e D49, f D56, g D63, and h D146. OTU annotation is indicated at the genus level and, where not available, at the family (f) or order (o) levels. Asterisks indicate the few OTU that were differentially abundant between high and low responders at the same time points post-vaccination.Full size imageBy sPLS-DA analysis, we also identified sets of 5, 16, 22, and 3 OTUs that best predicted high or low levels of HAI at D49 (AUC = 1, p-value of 1 × 10−4), D56 (AUC = 0.923, p-value of 4 × 10−7), D63 (AUC = 0.953, p-value of 5 × 10−9), and D146 (AUC = 0.821, p-value of 7 × 10−4) (Fig. 6e-h, Supplementary Data 8). In predicting the response at D49, the two strongest contributors were OTUs from the genera Mailhella and Lactobacillus. At D56 and D63, the five most-predictive taxa were the families Lachnospiraceae (4 and 5 OTUs) and Ruminococcaceae (4 and 2 OTUs), followed by Muribaculaceae (2 and 3 OTUs), Prevotellaceae (2 and 5 OTUs), and Spirochaetaceae (1 and 4 OTUs). All OTUs annotated to family Spirochaetaceae were assigned to the genus Treponema 2. Interestingly, the OTU defined by Cluster_53 (Muribaculaceae), which contributed to the prediction of the response at both D56 and D63, was also present in the set of five OTUs that were differentially abundant between HR and LR groups at D56. For prediction of the response at D146, the three OTUs highlighted were annotated to the families Lactobacillaceae, Muribaculaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae.Three OTUs were found to be predictive of both IAV-specific IgG and HAI. Cluster_1094, annotated to family Erysipelotrichaceae, was predictive of HAI response at D56 and IAV-specific IgG response at D63. Cluster_1045, annotated to genus Butyricimonas, was predictive of HAI response at D56 and IAV-specific IgG response at D56, and Cluster_418, from family Lachnospiraceae, was predictive of HAI response at D63 and IAV-specific IgG response at D56.We gathered all predictive OTUs that were highlighted by sPLS-DA for the four response time points to create a list of 81 unique OTUs. With these, we performed a PLS-DA analysis between the LR and HR groups for IAV-specific IgG and HAI at D49, D56, D63, and D146 (Supplementary Data 9). In comparison with the initial sPLS-DA, this analysis improved the predictions of the two types of the immune response at each time point (Fig. 7a). The best prediction scores were obtained, at all time points, for IAV-specific IgG levels compared to HAI titers. Specifically, the highest prediction scores were observed for IAV-specific IgG levels at D146 (AUC = 1, BER + 2 SD = 0.22) (Fig. 7d) and at D63 (AUC = 1, BER + 2 SD = 0.29) (Fig. 7c), and to a lesser extent for IAV-specific IgG levels at D49 (AUC = 1, BER + 2 SD = 0.41) (Fig. 7b) and HAI at D49 (AUC = 1, BER + 2 SD = 0.40) (Fig. 7e).Fig. 7: Predictive capacity of OTUs in pre-vaccination D28 fecal microbiota for vaccine response measured by IAV-specific IgG and HAI.a Comparison of the prediction yielded by the OTU subsets found at each time point for each vaccine response phenotype (sPLS-DA, dark green line, indication of the number of OTUs selected for each prediction) and by the combined set of 81 OTUs (PLS-DA, light green line). The BER estimations are represented by their 95% confidence intervals, with their means ± 2 standard deviations. b–e Projection of the groups of extreme responders to the influenza vaccine as measured by IAV-specific IgG at b D49, c D63, d D146, and e HAI titers at D49, obtained with a PLS-DA implemented with the combined set of 81 candidate predictive OTUs. Samples are classified as low responders (blue dots) or high responders (red dots). Corresponding sPLS-DA and PLS-DA data are available in Supplementary Table 4 and in Supplementary Data 1. f Plot of measured vs. predicted IAV-specific IgG titers at D63 from a regression model. Predicted values were estimated with PLS analysis based on the counts of the combined set of 81 OTUs applied to the population of all vaccinated piglets that had both a characterized fecal microbiota at D28 and a measured titer of IAV-specific IgG at D63 (n = 86). Low vs. high responders for IAV-specific IgG at D63 are represented with blue and red dots, respectively; all other animals are represented by gray dots.Full size imageFinally, by applying a PLS to the entire population (n = 89) using this set of 81 predictive OTUs (Fig. 7f), we were able to predict the IAV-specific IgG response at D63; the observed Q2 value (goodness of prediction) was 0.095, below the recommended limit of 0.0975. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between the predicted and measured values (Pearson correlation = 0.70, p-value = 6.5 × 10−14), and verified the normality of their residuals through a Shapiro-Wilcoxon test (p-value > 0.05).No detection of an OTU signature specific of high and low vaccine responses maintained overtimeWe analyzed whether the fecal microbiota at D49, D63, and D146 also contained OTUs that were differentially abundant between extreme vaccine responders at D49, D56, D63, and D146 (Supplementary Table 3). We found no association between the enterotypes at D63 and extreme vaccine response at D63 or D146 (chi test, p-value < 0.05). Figure 8 provides a global overview of the entire set of 102 OTUs that were differentially abundant, at any time point, in the fecal microbiota of HR and LR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG or HAI. The figure also includes the OTUs from the D28 microbiota that were identified by sPLS as candidate predictors of vaccine response levels. From D49 fecal microbiota data, there were 13 differentially abundant OTUs between the extreme responders defined by IAV-specific IgG at D49, and 28 and 7 OTUs differentially abundant between extreme responders defined by HAI at D56 and D63, respectively. From D63 fecal microbiota data, we did not detect any OTUs that were differentially abundant between HR and LR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG at D63 and D146. However, when HR and LR groups were defined by HAI levels, we found 7 and 3 differentially abundant OTUs at D63 and D146, respectively. Finally, from D146 fecal microbiota data, we identified 10 and 11 differentially abundant OTUs between HR and LR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG levels and HAI titers, respectively. Most of these OTUs had relative abundances below 0.1%, which stood in contrast with the differentially abundant OTUs from the D28 fecal microbiota of extreme responders for IAV-specific IgG at D63.Fig. 8: Representation of the 102 OTUs identified as differentially abundant in the fecal microbiota of 28, 49, 63, and 146-day-old pigs between groups of high and low responders for IAV-specific IgG and HAI at all time points post-vaccination.The mean OTU relative abundance per group is represented with a color gradient. OTUs that were more abundant within the high responder groups are represented with a red gradient, and OTUs that were more abundant within low responder groups are represented with a blue gradient. Asterisks highlight the three OTUs that were also identified by sPLS-DA as predictors of vaccine response at the same time point for the same vaccine phenotype. Taxonomic annotation is given at the genus level. All corresponding data are available in Supplementary Table 3 and in Supplementary Data 6.Full size imageThere was no overlap between OTUs that were differentially abundant at D28 and at later time points; we observed two OTUs that remained present in later microbial assemblages, but the later patterns of abundance contrasted with those detected at D28 (Cluster_115, Cluster_18). For time points later than D28, seven OTUs were shared between two analyses, and a single OTU (Cluster_113, Ruminococcaceae family) was identified in three analyses: it was overabundant in the D49 microbiota of HR for HAI at D56 and D63, and in the D63 microbiota of HR for HAI at D63. Finally, from the list of 81 predictors of vaccine response based on their abundance in the D28 microbiota, three OTUs (Cluster_462 from genus Anaerobiospirillum, Cluster_53 from family Muribaculaceae, and Cluster_330 from genus Bacteroides) were also differentially abundant in the D28 fecal microbiota between HR and LR groups for IAV-specific IgG level at D63 or HAI titer at D56.DiscussionThe efficiency of vaccination is a major concern in efforts to ensure individual- and herd-level protection against specific pathogens. If too many individuals produce low vaccine responses with limited protection, herd immunity may not be achieved, leading to disease outbreaks. Research on vaccine response has implicated many factors, including host genetics, age, and the environment34. Here, we explored the role of the gut microbiota, which in humans and mice has been shown to influence immune responses to vaccination and the inter-individual variability thereof16,35. We confirmed a relationship between the pre-vaccination gut microbiota in young pigs and their later immune responses to the IAV vaccine; overall, these findings were similar to those of our previous work on piglets vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae32,33. Specifically, the current study observed links between the pre-vaccination fecal microbiota of 28-day-old piglets and their response to vaccination against IAV, as assessed by serum levels of anti-IAV IgG and HAI. Our main findings highlighted the beneficial association of OTUs assigned to genus Prevotella and family Muribaculaceae with a stronger individual vaccine response, and allowed us to identify candidate OTUs to predict the strength of that response.In addition to the analysis of pre-vaccination fecal microbiota, we also investigated possible links between vaccination and fecal microbiota dynamics from D28 until slaughter at D146, and followed the evolution of the fecal microbiota in individuals that demonstrated extreme responses to IAV vaccination. From D49 to D146, we did not observe any significant associations between the alpha or beta diversity of the fecal microbial assemblages and the level of vaccine responses based on the analysis of HR and LR groups. We did, however, identify OTUs in the fecal microbiota at D49, D63, and D146 that were differentially abundant between the two extremes of vaccine response, but almost all these OTUs differed according to each time point. These data did not allow us to characterize a microbial signature that might follow a high or low response to vaccination over life. We did not either observe any association between enterotypes at D63 and vaccine response (HR versus LR) at D63 or D146, despite previous reports that enterotypes at 70 days of age are associated with levels of luminal secretory IgA36. In our study, the vaccine was first injected at D28 on the weaning day at a time when the gut microbiota is shifting due to the transition from milk feeding to a solid cereal-based diet. As already shown in Large White pigs bred in the same environment32,36, our data set confirmed such a shift before and after weaning. Nevertheless, the set of 81 predictive OTUs identified in the D28 fecal microbiota provided consistency over time for associations between OTU abundances at D28 and further vaccine responses.A comparison of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups showed that 74, 11, and 21 OTUs were differentially abundant in the microbiota at D49, D63, and D146, respectively. However, their relative rarity provides evidence that intramuscular vaccination against IAV at D28 did not modify the overall dynamics of the microbiota in the long term. Based on this, we conclude that vaccination may have a slight effect on the fecal microbiota, but one that is mainly visible early after vaccination and barely detectable at slaughter.Interestingly, our results revealed associations between the pre-vaccination fecal microbiota at D28 and the maximum intensity of the vaccine immune response measured at D56 and D63, two and three weeks after the vaccine booster, respectively. Specifically, we found that the higher the fecal microbiota richness, the higher the levels of IAV-specific IgG and HAI at D56 and D63. These results thus extend to pigs a hypothesis that has been proposed for various species: higher microbial richness and diversity, which are often linked to eubiosis and host homeostasis, favor a more efficient immune response to vaccination17. For example, in a clinical study of human adults vaccinated against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, a more diverse microbial community was observed in individuals who displayed an early and persistent cell-mediated immune response to the vaccine, while individuals with less diverse microbiota instead displayed a late cell-mediated immune response37. Similarly, macaques whose gut microbiota were characterized by higher Shannon diversity also demonstrated higher vaccine effectiveness against Shigella dysenteriae38, and infant mice with artificially depressed intestinal bacterial diversity subsequently displayed a lower IgG response to several vaccines directed against diverse bacterial pathogens39. A richer and more diverse microbiota has been frequently linked with health benefits for hosts, and many authors have explained this effect as an enhanced capacity for resilience. Increased resilience means that minor or even moderate stresses are less likely to result in a shift of the bacterial community, and in case of perturbation, these communities return to their initial basal composition more quickly40. A higher capacity for resilience may also have beneficial effects on immunological efficiency. Thus, optimization of gut microbiota richness could be an interesting tactic for strengthening the overall immune system and the vaccine response in particular.We found a significant association between the beta diversity of fecal microbiota at D28 and serum levels of IAV-specific IgG at D63; this relationship was further reinforced by the identification of 23 OTUs that were differentially abundant between HR and LR groups defined by IAV-specific IgG at this time point. Among the eight OTUs that were more abundant in the HR group, three were assigned to the genus Prevotella 2, which suggests a role for this bacterium in the improvement of the immune response to the IAV vaccine. Similarly, among a set of seven OTUs identified as good predictors of high levels of IAV-specific IgG at D49 (sPLS-DA, component 1), three were assigned to Prevotella 2, one to Prevotella 1, and one to Prevotella 9. Interestingly, though, among the 20 OTUs identified as good predictors of low levels of IAV-specific IgG at D146 (sPLS-DA, components 1 and 2), two were also assigned to Prevotella 9. This pattern of results — on the one hand, indication of a beneficial role for Prevotella but on the other, show that a few OTUs assigned to the same genus might have the opposite associations — is similar to previously published data from a study of immune responses to vaccination against M. hyopneumoniae32,33. In the work of Munyaka et al.32, the piglets vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae were from the same families as in the present study, and were vaccinated simultaneously. In these two vaccination studies, all piglets were Large White, shared the same environment, and were fed a similar diet. By contrast, in the earlier study of Munyaka et al.33, the animals were (Large White x Landrace) x Duroc piglets that were bred and vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae in Canada, and thus differed from the two latter studies in animal genetics, country, and the rearing environment. Despite these differences, however, the data from this earlier work also revealed links between a higher abundance of OTUs assigned to Prevotella and a higher immune response to the M. hyopneumoniae vaccine. Notably, sequence alignment revealed that the OTUs identified in Munyaka et al.32 were likely distinct from the OTUs identified in this study despite being assigned to the same genus. Taken together, all of these results suggest a generally beneficial role of bacteria from genus Prevotella for the vaccine response to two different pathogens (IAV and M. hyopneumoniae). However, it will be necessary to characterize these bacteria in pigs at the level of the species or even the strains in order to enable fine-scale discrimination between more- and less-favorable species/strains from the same genus. This becomes all the more important given our observation of up to 312 OTUs annotated to a Prevotella-type genus in pig fecal microbiota, and our finding of a stark contrast between the relative abundances of OTUs assigned to the genera Prevotella 2 and Prevotella 9. The relative abundance of Prevotella 2 increased slightly after weaning, but remained more stable over pigs’ lifespans than that of Prevotella 9, which became by far the most abundant genus until slaughter. There are already many reports that implicate Prevotella bacteria in the vaccine response in other species. In humans, nasal abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica was found to correlate with influenza antibody titers41, while another study reported that genus Prevotella drives the Th17 immune responses through the activation of Toll-like receptor 242. In mice vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus, bacteria in the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella generated lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) that demonstrated adjuvant properties43. In pigs, it is already known that Prevotella bacteria produce butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that favors the development of the immune system, plasma cell differentiation, and antibody response44. Thus, although the underlying functionalities remain to be elucidated in pigs, it seems possible that bacteria belonging to genus Prevotella might also have a role in modulating innate immunity.The OTU Cluster_53, which was annotated to the genus CAG 873 within family Muribaculaceae, was also of interest for its potential benefits. This OTU was significantly more abundant in the D28 fecal microbiota of piglets that had high levels of IAV-specific IgG at D63 and HAI at D56, and was in the list of OTUs that best predicted a strong HAI response at D56. As a result of constant improvement in bacterial annotation in the 16S rRNA reference sequence databases, family Muribaculaceae was recently renamed; depending on the database and report in question, OTUs in this family had previously been assigned to one of four other families: ‘S24-7’ in release 128 of the SILVA database, ‘Porphyromonadaceae’ in the RDP release, and ‘MIB’ (mouse intestinal bacteria) or Homeothermaceae in the literature45. Interestingly, bacteria from the S24-7 family were also reported to be more abundant in piglets with a stronger vaccine response to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae32. This family is similarly associated with good health in mice, and was reported to be significantly depleted in individuals with colitis46. Previous predictions using PICRUSt, which infers the functional metagenome of a bacterial community based on its taxonomic composition as assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have suggested that the S24-7 family contains peptidases known for their immunomodulatory activity47,48. Like Prevotella, S24-7 bacteria are Gram-negative (LPS is a main component of the bacterial wall) and produce butyrate. Thus, it would be interesting to further explore their possible role as promoters of good health, and even consider them as new probiotic candidates in pigs, especially since bacteria from the Muribaculaceae have recently been successfully cultured45.Among the 15 OTUs that were more abundant in the D28 fecal microbiota of pigs with weak IAV-specific IgG responses at D63, we identified the genera Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Christenellaceae R7 group. Two OTUs corresponded to the species Helicobacter trogontum, while seven others were annotated to the genera Escherichia-Shigella, Succinivibrio, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Ruminiclostridium 9, Ruminococcus 1, coprostanoligenes group, gauvreauii group, or Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group. Many bacteria from this list are known to cause pathogenic disorders, and have been associated either with clinical illness or with a perturbation of the immune system. Helicobacter trogontum can cause colitis in immune-compromised patients49, invade human enterocytes, and induce hepatic inflammation in mice50. Genus Helicobacter also contains other pathogenic bacteria, and its worldwide prevalence in the stomachs of pigs at the age of slaughter has been reported to be, on average, higher than 60%51. Pigs are commonly infected with the species Helicobacter suis or Helicobacter pylori52, which both lead to gastric inflammation and decrease daily weight gain53. Although the animals in the present study did not show any clinical signs of infection, our results suggest that the two OTUs annotated to Helicobacter might have induced low levels of inflammation in the digestive tract and thus impaired the strength of the immune response to vaccination. With respect to Bacteroides, another predictor of weak IAV-specific IgG response at D63, our results were consistent with evidence from the literature demonstrating a role for these bacteria in immune inhibition. Bacteria from this genus were more abundant in the fecal microbiota of babies that displayed a weak response to Rotavirus vaccination54, and this taxon is the main culprit behind bacteraemia and systemic blood infections in adult patients55. Since Bacteroides have less immunogenic LPS than other Gram-negative bacteria, it has been suggested that a higher abundance of this genus could lead to reduced stimulation of the innate immune system56. Thus, we can hypothesize that the two OTUs from genus Bacteroides that were identified in our study may have hampered the maturation of the immune system, with consequences for vaccine efficacy. An OTU from Clostridium sensu stricto 1 was also present in the list of best predictors of a weak IAV-specific IgG response at D146; in a previous study, the relative abundance of this genus was positively correlated with diarrhea and negatively correlated with lymphocyte numbers in piglets57. High levels of Enterobacteriales were also reported to be negatively associated with neutrophilia and to induce a depressed immune response to many common vaccines in infants, including the oral polio virus vaccine, the bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine against tuberculosis, the tetanus toxoid vaccine, and the hepatitis B vaccine58. Thus, it is not surprising that in our study the OTUs annotated to genus Escherichia-Shigella and family Enterobacteriaceae were observed with higher relative abundance in individuals that demonstrated weak responses to the IAV vaccine.Our data enabled us to create a list of 81 OTUs found in the pre-vaccination D28 fecal microbiota that predicted extreme vaccine responders at early (D49), maximum (D56 and D63), and persistent (D146) response stages, based on both HAI titers and IAV-specific IgG levels. In general, predictions were better for IAV-specific IgG response at D63 and D146. This analysis exploited the extent of inter-individual variability in the fecal microbiota before vaccination to explain variations in the intensity of immune response post-vaccination. This variability was observed early in life, and had a significant association with vaccine response throughout their life: from certain combinations of OTUs in the D28 microbiota, we were able to predict the persistence of the IAV-specific IgG response over 100 days later. Although the idea of predicting vaccine response is more often explored in human medicine59, our work on the microbiota of pigs suggests that predictions should also be possible in this species. The relevance and feasibility of such an approach in veterinary medicine remain to be discussed and evaluated. Many vaccines are often administered early in life at a time when neither the immune system nor the gut microbiota are very mature60. In pigs, the gut microbiota has been shown to stabilize, after an initial phase of diversification, at 40 days of age36, but vaccines are often administered at weaning, together with other farm practices that can include the administration of antibiotics to avoid morbidity post-weaning. The importance of the early gut microbiome in the acquisition of an individual’s immune competence led to this period being defined in mice as a ‘critical window’. The present study suggests the likely existence of a similar critical window in pigs, with possible long-term effects, as shown here by the links we observed with the persistence of the vaccine response. At weaning, bacteria from genus Prevotella or family Muribaculaceae might favor a strong vaccine response, while some bacteria from the genera Helicobacter and Bacteroides genus might impair it. The contribution to immune-system maturation or the immunogenicity of bacterial metabolites (e.g., flagellin) or microbe-associated molecular patterns (e.g., LPSs) could be addressed by further study of the bacterial molecular patterns involved.In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of interactions between the gut microbiota and the immune response to vaccination in pigs. We identified several candidate OTUs present early in life, before vaccination, that may influence the immune response to the IAV vaccine either positively, such as bacteria from genus Prevotella or family Muribaculaceae, or negatively, as with bacteria from the genera Helicobacter or Bacteroides. Our OTU analysis highlighted the need to implement whole-metagenome sequencing to characterize microbial communities to the levels of species and functions. Our results revealed links between bacterial richness in the fecal microbiota and vaccine response, and suggest that farm and breeding practices that support gut bacterial richness should yield benefits for optimizing vaccine efficacy. Our results enabled us to identify associations, but not causalities, between microbiota composition before vaccination and the vaccine response. More investigations are needed to deepen our understanding of this relationship, and specific experimental designs such as fecal microbiota transplantation have to be set up for biological validation. However, our results provide initial insights that might be applied to the identification of candidates for both predicting and improving vaccine efficiency.MethodsAnimals and biological samplingAll animal procedures were performed according to guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals (permission for animal experimentation to C. Rogel-Gaillard: A78-172; agreement for experimentation from the Centre de Recherche INRA Poitou-Charentes - Site expérimental du Magneraud: A17661; protocol approved by the French Ministry of Research with authorization ID APAFIS#4295-2016022615583351 v4 after review by ethics committee No. 084).The experiment was conducted on the INRAE experimental farm at le Magneraud (GenESI, Pig Phenotyping and Innovative Breeding Facility, (https://doi.org/10.15454/1.5572415481185847E12). We produced 26 litters of Large White pigs (Supplementary Data 1) by mating 26 different boars with 25 sows, one sow having been inseminated twice. The animals were born in five batches over a period of six months and were grown indoors. Piglets were weaned at D28 on average (D24 to D30). The animals were raised under standard conditions in pens of 20 to 30 animals during the post-weaning period (D28 to D68) and in pens of 10 to 12 animals during the growth period (from around D68 to D146). After weaning, the pigs were fed ad libitum with a commercial diet (GUSTI PRIM, NUTRICIAB®) up to D34, then with a post-weaning diet up to D68, and finally with a growth diet until slaughter (see Supplementary Table 4 for details on diets). No antibiotic treatment was administered at any time during the experiment. At weaning, all animals were weighed (Supplementary Data 1) and classified according to three fecal scores: “no diarrhea” (0-regular stool), “intermediate” (1-soft stool), or “diarrhea” (2-liquid stool). On the day of weaning, two males and two females per litter were vaccinated with a commercial inactivated IAV vaccine directed against subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 (Respiporc Flu3, IDT Biologika). Three weeks later, at D49, all vaccinated pigs received a booster vaccination. In each litter, one male and one female were not vaccinated and were used as control animals. In total, 131 piglets were included in the study, comprising 98 vaccinated pigs (48 females and 50 males) and 33 non-vaccinated control pigs (17 females and 16 males). Except transitory diarrhea at weaning for eight animals (Supplementary Data 1), no disease outcome was recorded and growth curves were consistent with good health. All pigs were also followed-up with blood cell counts (data not shown) that revealed no obvious health problems either.Blood was collected at D28, D49, D56, D63, and D146 from the jugular vein of pigs in dry tubes in order to determine humoral vaccine responses in serum. Stool samples were collected at D28, D49, D63, and D146 directly from rectal ampulla, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (200 mg per cryotube), and stored at −80 °C until use for microbial DNA extraction. All biological samples were stored at the Biological Resources Center of the @BRIDGe core facility that is a member of the CRB-Anim infrastructure (https://doi.org/10.15454/1.5613785622827378E12, CRB-Anim, INRA, 2018. Biological Resource Centers for domestic animals of AgroBRC). A summary of all samples collected at each time is available in Supplementary Table 5.Characterization of the vaccine response and identification of groups of high and low respondersVaccine response was assessed at D28, D49 (21 days post-vaccination; dpv), D56 (28 dpv), D63 (35 dpv), and D146 (118 dpv) by measuring levels of IAV-specific IgG in the serum and performing HAI assays. D49 corresponded to the early vaccine response, D56 and D63 represented the maximum response, and D146 qualified the persistent response.Briefly, IAV-specific IgG levels were measured with a semi-quantitative ELISA on plates coated with inactivated virus strains that were homologous to the three subtypes targeted by the vaccine: avian-like swine H1avN1 (A/Sw/Cotes d’Armor/0388/09); human-like reassortant swine H3N2 (A/Sw/Spain/SF32071/07); and human-like reassortant swine H1huN2 (A/Sw/Spain/SF12091/07). Sera were diluted 1/100, 1/1000, or 1/10,000 in duplicate. In parallel, a standard curve was constructed using anti-pig IgG–coated plates and a pig reference serum. For detection, HRP-conjugated anti-pig IgG was used in combination with a tetramethylbenzidine substrate. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured, and levels of IAV-specific IgG in sera were extrapolated using the standard curve and expressed in µg/mL or pg/mL.HAI assays were performed according to standardized procedures61. Briefly, 25 µL of two-fold serial dilutions (starting from 1:10) of RDE-inactivated sera (receptor-destroying enzyme, Denka Seiken) were incubated with 25 μL of 4 hemagglutination (HA) assay units of virus inoculum, constituted of a mix of the three strains. Then, 50 µL of Turkey red blood cells (RBC) (0.5% final dilution, Tebu-bio) were added. Wells were examined visually for HA inhibition, as indicated by the appearance of well-defined RBC “buttons” or teardrop formation upon plate tilting. The final HAI titer was the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely prevented HA.Animals were identified as high (HR) or low responders (LR) at each time-point post-vaccination according to the ranking of their response levels within the entire population of vaccinated pigs (n = 98). At each time point, HR and LR pigs were identified as individuals with IAV-specific IgG levels that were higher than the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD) or less than the mean − 1 SD, respectively (Fig. 1b). For HAI titers, HR and LR groups were defined as follows: at 21 dpv, LR pigs had HAI ≤ 20 and HR pigs had HAI ≥ 160; at 28 and 35 dpv, LR pigs had HAI ≤ 160 and HR pigs had HAI ≥ 640; at 118 dpv, LR pigs had HAI ≤ 10 and HR pigs had HAI ≥ 80 (Fig. 1c). The composition of HR and LR groups is reported in Supplementary Data 1. It differed among post-vaccination time points in order to maintain the selection criteria as defined above.Fecal DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencingDNA extraction was performed as previously described62. In brief, 200 mg of frozen fecal sample were resuspended with 250 μL of guanidine thiocyanate buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate–0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5), 40 μL of 10% N-lauroyl sarcosine–0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and 500 μL of 5% N-lauroyl sarcosine; the mixture was then incubated at 70 °C for 1 h. After the addition of one volume of 0.1-mm-diameter silica beads (Sigma), tubes were shaken for 10 min at the maximum speed on a Vibrobroyeur MM200 (Retsch, Germany). After shaking, tubes were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After recovery of the supernatant, 30 μL of Proteinase K (Chemagic STAR DNA BTS kit, Perkin Elmer, USA) were added; samples were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C at 250 rpm in a Multi-Therm shaker (Benchmark Scientific, USA) and then for 5 min at 95 °C for enzyme inactivation. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, DNA extraction was performed on the supernatant using the Chemagic STAR DNA BTS kit (Perkin Elmer, USA) and the Chemagic STAR platform (Hamilton, Perkin Elmer, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Amplicon libraries of the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were constructed; amplification was performed using the PCR1F_343 (5′-CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3′) and PCR1R_784 (5′-GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCT-3’) primers following the Illumina 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol. Paired-end sequencing of the pooled library was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using the Miseq Reagent kit v3 (2 × 300 cycles, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), as previously described32,62. FastQ files were generated after the run was completed (MiSeq Reporter software, Illumina, USA). The raw sequences are available through accession PRJNA647267 on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.Sequence analysis: identification and quantification of OTUsWe used the FROGS pipeline (v3.0)63 to assemble read pairs, to trim the PCR1F_343 and PCR1R_784 primers, and to filter sequences based on length, keeping only amplicons with a length between 300 and 490 base pairs. Unique sequences, with data on their relative abundance per sample, were clustered with FROGS using Swarm (v 1.4.1)64, first with an aggregation distance of 1 and then of 3. FROGS removes chimeras using the Vsearch algorithm (v2.6.0)65. Rare OTUs were filtered out (abundance <0.005% of total)66 and the remaining sequences were annotated via NCBI Blast + (2.6.0)67 alignment with 16S rRNA reference sequences from the SILVA database (version 132 from the 2017 update)68. Using these data, we obtained an abundance table and a phylogenetic tree (FROGS Tree tool using Mafft (v7.310)69 and Fasttree (2.1.10)70). Based on the sequencing depth and the rarefaction curves, we rarefied counts for alpha and beta diversity analyses at 10,000 counts per sample. After this rarefaction step, a few samples were excluded; the final dataset contained 89 animals at D28 (nD28 = 89), 97 animals at D49 (nD49 = 97), 98 animals at D63 (nD49 = 98), and 83 animals at D146 (nD49 = 83) (Supplementary Table 5). Overall, there were 74 animals with data available at all four sampling time points (D28, D49, D63, and D146), with which we studied the evolution of the fecal microbiota from the day of vaccination until slaughter.Analysis of fecal microbiota composition and diversity, and association with animal phenotypesBio-statistical analyses were performed in R 3.5.271. Using the distributions of OTU counts, we inferred taxonomic composition at the levels of phylum, family, and genus with the package Phyloseq 1.26.172. Alpha diversity was evaluated through calculations of species richness, evenness, Shannon index values, and inverse Simpson index values with the package Vegan 2.5.573. Beta diversity was calculated using Bray-Curtis distances. Vegan was also used to create a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) representation of Bray-Curtis distances between each extreme response group (defined by IAV-specific IgG or HAI titer).We first investigated the effects of body weight at weaning, age at weaning, sex, and batch on alpha diversity using maximum-likelihood ratio tests. We then investigated the association of these factors with beta diversity using Adonis model based on Bray-Curtis distances (package Vegan).To investigate the association between alpha diversity at D28, D49, and D63 on the contemporaneous and subsequent vaccine responses, we implemented a linear mixed-effect model of each alpha-diversity indicator (Richness, Shannon) and the numerical value of Log10 IAV-specific IgG and Log2 HAI titers, considering all available data at each time point (nlme package, 3.1-142)74. In these models, the weaning age, sex, and batch were set as co-variables because they all had a significant association with the vaccine response. The litter was set as a random effect.We also investigated the association between fecal microbiota composition at D28, D49, and D63 and the subsequent vaccine response, by considering only the extreme responders for each phenotype (IAV-specific IgG or HAI titers). At D28, D49, and D63, we applied Adonis models to test dissimilarites between the fecal microbiota of pigs classified as HR or LR for IAV-specific IgG or HAI titers at later times points (package Vegan). For these models, sex, batch, and weaning age were set as co-variables.Previous research identified two enterotypes in 60-day-old Large White pigs, each driven by two genera (Prevotella and Mitsuokella or Treponema and Ruminococcus)75. Following a similar approach, we determined individual enterotypes with the Jensen-Shannon divergence distance calculated from the genus abundance table76. To determine whether the enterotypes we observed were associated with vaccine response levels (measured either by IAV-specific IgG levels or HAI titers), we performed a chi-squared test that considered the number of pigs in each enterotype group and in each extreme responder group.Comparisons of HR and LR groups: differential abundance of OTUs and pairwise correlationsFor the animals that demonstrated extreme vaccine responses (HR or LR for IAV-specific IgG levels or HAI titers) at D49, D56, D63, and D146, we analyzed the pre-vaccination microbiota (D28) with the R package metagenomeSeq 1.24.177 to identify OTUs that displayed differential abundance among groups. This package enables the normalization of raw sequence counts through a cumulative-sum scaling method to reduce biases due to uneven sequencing depth78. We used a zero-inflated Gaussian mixture model with vaccine response as the main effect, and sex, weaning age, and batch as co-variables, and applied an FDR adjustment of 0.05. MetagenomeSeq was also used to study whether the set of OTUs that were differentially abundant at D28 between groups that later demonstrated high or low vaccine response (at D56 and D63) maintained these same patterns of differential abundance in the fecal microbiota of the same animals at older ages (D49 and D63). For the same set of OTUs, we also determined the occurrence of each at D28, D49, D63, and D146 in the fecal microbiota of each member of the larger population (n = 89). For each OTU, we also counted all other OTUs that were annotated to the same genus in the D28 fecal microbiota of the 89 vaccinated piglets.To identify mutually excluding or co-abundant OTUs, we calculated pairwise correlations between all OTUs in the overall dataset at D28 (n = 89), using the bootstrap method from fastspar software79. We specifically looked at correlations between the 23 OTUs that were identified as differentially abundant between the high and low extreme responders for IAV-specific IgG at D63. Moderate and high correlations were included in a network representation, using a cutoff of 0.4 and 0.5 for the correlation coefficient and of 0.05 for the p-value, with the R packages igraph and network80.Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA), PLS-DA, and PLS analysisWe searched for OTUs that were predictive of extreme responses for IAV-specific IgG and HAI titers (LR versus HR) at the different time points using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA). OTUs were normalized using cumulative sum square normalization with the metagenomeSeq package, and sPLS-DA was performed using the MixOmics package81. Prediction accuracy was estimated through calculations of the balanced error rate (BER), which measures the rate of overall sample misclassification; the lower the BER, the more reliable the prediction. The minimal number of components to keep was chosen based on barplots of eigenvalues. We then tuned each sPLS-DA, in two steps, to determine the number of OTUs to keep for each component. We first estimated this number by considering a set of OTUs that varied from 1 to 200 in steps of 5, using a fivefold validation process repeated 100 times. From the plot of BER evolution, we recorded the optimum number of OTUs to retain for each component. We then tuned the sPLS-DA again, but this time considered a set of OTUs that varied from 1 up to this first optimum number, in steps of 1. The final number of OTUs retained corresponded to the number observed just before the BER prediction reached a plateau. We then searched for the OTU with the largest contribution to each type of extreme vaccine response. To evaluate the ability of each sPLS-DA classification to predict the vaccine response level, we calculated their corresponding BER, p-value, and area under the curve (AUC). Then, in an attempt to improve the prediction performance, we merged all OTUs identified by sPLS-DA and applied a PLS-DA to the two groups of extreme responders. Finally, we carried out a PLS analysis on the IAV-specific IgG levels and HAI titers from the whole population of 89 piglets for which we had fecal microbiota data at D28. We assessed the confidence of the prediction and calculated the Q2 (‘goodness of prediction’) parameter to determine whether it was below the recommended limit of 0.0975. We measured the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and measured levels of IAV-specific IgG, and we performed a Shapiro-Wilcoxon test to assess the normality of the residuals of the differences between predicted and measured values.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Written by FE Online July 22, 2021 18:07 IST Follow Us Fever, cough, body ache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea are some of the most prominent symptoms of the disease. Severe respiratory problems can also arise in severe cases of the disease. An 11-year old boy became the first casualty of H5N1 avian influenza in the national capital on Wednesday sparking fear among people. While the avian influenza or bird flu has been found to be present among a large number of birds, migratory species across different parts of the country, this is the first recorded human death related to the disease in the country, the Indian Express reported. Thousands of birds in zoos and in their natural habitat were found to be infected with the avian influenza in January this year.What is bird flu?The disease which is caused by the presence of avian influenza Type A viruses are prevalent among wild birds in all parts of the world. While mostly the infection remains confined to the wild birds, sometimes the virus percolates to the poultry birds including chicken, ducks, turkeys causing fear as the poultry birds are in direct contact with humans. On the basis of variations in the protein constituents, different types of bird flu or avian influenza has been found prevalent among the birds including H5N1, H7N2, H9N6, H17N10.Bird flu among humansWhile the spread of bird flu to humans is possible, the spread has remained limited in the human population. It was in the year 1997 when the first case of H5N1 infection was reported. Currently, more than 700 cases of Asian Highly Pathogenic Asian Avian Influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus have been traced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) across 16 countries. While the spread of the virus has remained limited, the mortality among bird flu patients is as high as 60 percent which is many times the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients.Also Read 23-year-old US woman goes blind after swimming with contact lenses-Know all about this shocking case Weather Update: Air quality remains in ‘very poor’ category in Delhi-NCR; IMD predicts heavy rainfall in THESE regions – Check forecast How effective are flu shots in protecting you from seasonal coughs and colds? Doctors explain MapmyIndia stays competitive as Google cuts prices in the mapping API market How does bird flu spread to humans?The chances of the spread of the disease to humans increase among people who are in direct contact with the infected birds dead or alive. There are slight chances of contracting the disease even by coming in contact with the contaminated surfaces and breathing the polluted air of poultry. While the fear related to consumption of non-vegetarian food is understandable, scientists have not found any evidence of the disease spreading from a properly cooked meat dish.AIIMS chief Dr. Randeep Guleria was quoted as saying by PTI that there are very rare chances of human-to-human spread of the disease. However he cautioned that people working closely with the poultry work must maintain personal hygiene.Symptoms of avian influenza and Risk groupsFever, cough, body ache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea are some of the most prominent symptoms of the disease. Severe respiratory problems can also arise in severe cases of the disease. Most cases of bird flu have been reported among children and those below the age of 40. Mortality rate was also slightly higher in case of infected children. Get live Share Market updates, Stock Market Quotes, and the latest India News … Read More and business news on Financial Express.

An 11-year-old boy, admitted to AIIMS on July 2, was confirmed dead due to bird flu on Tuesday. Contact tracing to identify people who might have been in close proximity with the boy is being undertaken. NEW DELHI: India has reported the first case of human death due to bird flu, the strain of influenza virus that primarily affects birds. An 11-year-old boy, admitted to AIIMS on July 2, was confirmed dead due to bird flu on Tuesday. Contact tracing to identify people who might have been in close proximity with the boy is being undertaken.Sources told TOI that the Haryana resident was admitted to AIIMS with high fever and cough on July 2.Top Picks For YouFirst bird flu death at AIIMS in India: All you want to know about influenza virusâWe thought he had Covid-19,â said a hospital source. âBut when the tests proved negative, further investigation established that the boy was suffering from an infection caused by the influenza virus of avian or bird origin.âIndia has experienced multiple outbreaks of avian influenza in the last 15 years, mainly affecting poultry. However, there has been no known case of human death due to the disease. Not surprisingly, public health specialists are alarmed at the development.Docs, family members in isolationSources said the National Centre for Disease Control â the countryâs leading agency for controlling and mitigating pandemics â has been roped in for contact tracing of anyone who may have come in touch with the deceased boy. The doctors, nurses and healthcare workers involved in the boyâs treatment have been advised to isolate themselves and report symptoms such as sore throat, sneezing and runny nose.Efforts are also being made to confirm the strain of the influenza virus. âThere are many strains of the virus and while some may cause mild symptoms, others are lethal,â said an AIIMS doctor. âNCDC is trying to ascertain the strain of the influenza virus that led to the death.â The doctor added that bird flu was rare in humans but if it affects someone, the risk of death was very high. âStudies show the mortality rate of bird flu in humans is as high as 60%,â he said.Bird flu can spread to humans through the droppings, saliva and secretion of the infected bird. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid contaminated surfaces. âThe risk of bird flu spreading to humans is extremely rare, but we must take precautions. People involved in the handling poultry birds should clean and disinfect any suspected areas and wear protective gear such as gloves,â advised a doctor.Public health experts added that people should be alert about birds dying in their localities. âDonât venture near bird carcasses and immediately report any death to the authorities,â instructed an expert.According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, US, bird flu viruses can infect people if enough of them got into a personâs eyes, nose or mouth or were inhaled. âThis might happen when a virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and is inhaled or when people touch something having the virus and then touch their mouth, eyes or nose,â said CDC, adding that most bird flu infection in people resulted from unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces.Bird-flu illness in people, CDC said, can range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, fatigue, headaches, eye redness (or conjunctivitis) and difficulty in breathing.As with seasonal flu, some people are at high risk of getting sick from bird flu, among them pregnant women, those with weakened immune systems and people 65 years and older. More than 700 human infections with highly pathogenic Asian avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses have been reported to WHO from 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Near East since November 2003. Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt have reported the highest number of human HPAI-Asian H5N1 cases to date, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousHow to make vrat-friendly Coconut Peanut Chutney at homeFoodHow to make your 'Curry patta' plant grow fasterLifestyle10 plants that can be grown without soil (you only need water!)Lifestyle10 countries known for their wildlifetravelâ10 things you should never say to an older personâLifestyleâ10 stunningly beautiful parrots in the worldâLifestyle10 most iconic animals from the world of fiction and literatureLifestyle10 animals that live in waterLifestyle10 types of vegetable-based cheela for healthy breakfastFood8 signs a child is smarter than averageLifestyle Next123 Photostories From earning Rs 500 per month to making it to the Forbes list, having a net worth of approximately Rs 300 crores and more: Rags to riches story of Kapil SharmaBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection rates8 animals that help Earth heal and howFrom keeping his second marriage under wraps to converting to Islam; A look at Bigg Boss 18 contestant Vivian Dsena's Personal Life revelations5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationshipsWeekly Horoscope: October 14th to 20th, 20245 most valuable stamps in the world6 mantras that are believed to help students develop focus and concentrationFrom Nidhi Shah to Kunwar Amarjeet Singh: Famous stars exit 'Anupamaa''Petta' to 'Vettaiyan': Opening day box office collection of Rajinikanth's last five films123Hot PicksPakistan SCO SummitAir India Bomb ThreatUS Election Timeline 2024Christopher ColumbusSpaceX Starship LaunchDonald Trump Assassination AttemptStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGSpaceX Starship LaunchLawrence BishnoiPapankusha EkadashiBarron TrumpPopular School in MumbaiDiddy ListTaylor SwiftBaba Siddique MurderDonald TrumpHassan NasrallahTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteBaba Siddique News Live Updates: State funeral accorded to late NCP leaderPM Internship Scheme records more than 1.55 lakh applications in a day: Which are the top companies you can apply for?Farewell to Goddess: Stunning visuals of Durga idol immersions from across India as Puja festivities concludeTamil Nadu Class 10, 12 Board Exam Time Table 2024-25 released: Check complete schedule herePapankusha Ekadashi 2024: Date, Parana Time, Puja Rituals and SignificanceThird assassination attempt on Donald Trump?

A statement from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture confirmed the outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza disease in the three regions.The Ministry, therefore, declared a total ban on the importation of poultry and poultry products from neighbouring countries where the prevalence of the disease had been confirmed.It has also placed a ban on the movement of poultry and poultry products within and from the affected regions and districts to other parts of the country, and strict inspection and issuance of permits to cover the movement of all poultry and poultry products from unaffected parts of the country.“The zoonotic nature of the disease calls for public alert and vigilance to mitigate the possible impact on the poultry industry and public health, in general,” the statement cautioned.It advised citizens to report any unusual deaths of domestic poultry and wild birds to the nearest Veterinary Office and public authorities for public safety.The public should also avoid the handling of dead birds with bare hands and consume only well-cooked poultry meat and poultry products.“The outbreak of the disease follows the detection of similar cases in neighbouring countries since January 2021,” it said.“Through effective surveillance and disease control management, the Veterinary Services Directorate has prevented the extension of the disease into Ghana until now,” it said.It noted that cases of the Bird Flu disease were previously recorded in 2007, 2015, 2016 and 2018, with a significant economic impact on affected poultry farmers.The statement said the Ministry was also intensifying public awareness and sensitisation through the Regional Coordinating Councils and District Assemblies, especially in the affected areas.It, however, urged the public not to panic because the Veterinary Services Directorate was taking all the necessary steps to contain the outbreak and spread of the disease.It urged the public to contact Dr Abakeh on phone number 020-8240734 for further information.The Center for Disease Control explained that the disease was caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses.These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds and animal species.Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans.However, sporadic human infections with avian flu viruses have occurred.FacebookWhatsAppTwitterTelegramEmailPinterestPrint Previous articleOil producing nations agree deal to control pricesNext articleNPP laments campaigning for NPP flagbearer

Mr. Ampem also stressed the need for better vigilance of the affected regions.“We are going to encourage that some of these things are really monitored so that we do not transfer the flu from one region to another, but it is contained in the districts and regions where they are found.”According to the Veterinary Services Directorate, the Bird Flu was detected in the Greater Accra, Central, and Volta Regions.The outbreak of the disease follows the detection of similar cases in neighbouring countries since January 2021.Cases of the Bird Flu disease were previously recorded in Ghana in 2007, 2015, 2016, and 2018.Following the recent outbreak, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture announced a total ban on the importation of poultry and poultry products from neighbouring countries where the prevalence of the disease has been confirmed.A ban on the movement of poultry and poultry products within and from the affected regions and districts to other parts of the country, and strict inspection and issuance of permits to cover the movement of all poultry and poultry products from unaffected parts of the country, has also been put in place.In addition, the Ministry said it has intensified public awareness and sensitisation by Regional Coordinating Councils and District Assemblies, especially in the affected areas.Tags: Bird fluGhana NewsGreater Accra Poultry Farmers AssociationPoultry ShareTweetSendSend Previous PostMid-year budget review: Hotels association calls for measures to reduce cost of living Next PostCiti Breakfast Show, Monday 19th July 2021 Related Posts Featured Techiman bound OA bus catches fire at Nsawam November 11, 2024 Election 2024 Vacant seats case: Supreme Court to deliver verdict today November 11, 2024 Election 2024 Asiedu Nketia accuses House of Chiefs president of campaigning for NPP November 11, 2024 News Nankese Health Centre workers lament inadequate equipment, space November 11, 2024 Featured Commuters lament deplorable state of Aplaku-Bortianor road November 11, 2024 Opinion Why the American electorate shifted more red than blue: A reflection – Prof. Evans Kwesi Mensah writes November 10, 2024 Next Post Citi Breakfast Show, Monday 19th July 2021 ADVERTISEMENT CitiNewsroom.com is Ghana's leading news website that delivers high quality innovative, alternative news that challenges the status quo.Archives Archives Select Month November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 May 2024 April 2024 March 2024 February 2024 January 2024 December 2023 November 2023 October 2023 September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 May 2023 April 2023 March 2023 February 2023 January 2023 December 2022 November 2022 October 2022 September 2022 August 2022 July 2022 June 2022 May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 August 2017 July 2017 January 2017 August 2016 October 2013 August 6 Download AppAbout UsContact UsPhoto GalleryPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseChannelOne TV © 2024 All Rights Reserved Citi Newsroom.

Speaking to Citi News, the President of the Greater Accra Poultry Farmers Association, Michael Nyarko-Ampem, urged poultry farmers across the country to corporate with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to control and eradicate the bird flu disease.“There is compensation that is given to farmers who suffer such calamities. But, we haven’t been informed yet about the modalities, but that has been the norm. Generally, that is what we are going to push. Anybody who has been affected must be given compensation because if that is not done, people will go underground to do all sorts of things, so we will ensure that it is done,” he said.The Ministry of Food and Agriculture has confirmed the outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza disease, also known as Bird Flu, in parts of the country.The Ministry said its Veterinary Services Directorate detected the Flu in the Greater Accra, Central, and Volta Regions.It has therefore placed a total ban on the importation of poultry and poultry products from neighbouring countries where the prevalence of the disease has been confirmed, as well as a ban on the movement of poultry and poultry products within and from the affected regions and districts to other parts of the country.Fears over the possible collapse of poultry businessesAlready, farmers have expressed fears that the outbreak of the Bird Flu will have a negative impact on their businesses and could collapse their farms.According to them, the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected their businesses and the outbreak of the infectious disease presents a precarious situation.“It is a double blow because we are reeling under the unavailability of maize and other resources for production, and then this [outbreak] comes in. It is a big blow, and it is really going to affect the way we do things because the government said importation of day-old chicks from neighbouring countries that have been affected has been banned, so it is going to affect the already precarious situation and make it worse. It is a not pleasant time for poultry farmers,” Michael Nyarko Ampem said.While urging the public to report any unusual deaths of domestic poultry and wild birds to the authorities, Michael Nyarko Ampem requested of the government, a quick solution to the shortage of poultry feed.Tags: Bird fluGhana NewsPoultry farmers ShareTweetSendSend Previous PostFirst Lady commissions First Atlantic Bank’s lounge at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital Next PostAirtelTigo introduces Morning Rush Data Bundles Related Posts Featured Techiman bound OA bus catches fire at Nsawam November 11, 2024 Election 2024 Vacant seats case: Supreme Court to deliver verdict today November 11, 2024 Election 2024 Asiedu Nketia accuses House of Chiefs president of campaigning for NPP November 11, 2024 News Nankese Health Centre workers lament inadequate equipment, space November 11, 2024 Featured Commuters lament deplorable state of Aplaku-Bortianor road November 11, 2024 Opinion Why the American electorate shifted more red than blue: A reflection – Prof. Evans Kwesi Mensah writes November 10, 2024 Next Post AirtelTigo introduces Morning Rush Data Bundles ADVERTISEMENT CitiNewsroom.com is Ghana's leading news website that delivers high quality innovative, alternative news that challenges the status quo.Archives Archives Select Month November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 May 2024 April 2024 March 2024 February 2024 January 2024 December 2023 November 2023 October 2023 September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 May 2023 April 2023 March 2023 February 2023 January 2023 December 2022 November 2022 October 2022 September 2022 August 2022 July 2022 June 2022 May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 August 2017 July 2017 January 2017 August 2016 October 2013 August 6 Download AppAbout UsContact UsPhoto GalleryPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseChannelOne TV © 2024 All Rights Reserved Citi Newsroom.
