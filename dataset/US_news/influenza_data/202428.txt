Heterologous sequential immunization may synergize diverse vaccine formulations and routes to improve vaccine potency and breadth. Here we investigate the effects of immunization strategies on the generation of cross-protective immune responses in female Balb/c mice, utilizing mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and protein-based PHC nanoparticle vaccines targeting influenza hemagglutinin. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of priming vaccination in shaping Th bias and immunodominance hierarchies. mRNA LNP prime favors Th1-leaning responses, while PHC prime elicits Th2-skewing responses. We demonstrate that cellular and mucosal immune responses are pivotal correlates of cross-protection against influenza. Notably, intranasal PHC immunization outperforms its intramuscular counterpart in inducing mucosal immunity and conferring cross-protection. Sequential mRNA LNP prime and intranasal PHC boost demonstrate optimal cross-protection against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza strains. Our study offers valuable insights into tailoring immunization strategies to optimize influenza vaccine effectiveness.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States recommends annual influenza vaccination as the most cost-effective and important prevention measure for individuals aged ≥6 months. Despite this, current seasonal influenza vaccines typically elicit strain-specific and short-lived immunity1, offer limited cross-protection against antigenically diverse virus variants, and provide no defense against sporadic influenza pandemics. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) has been suboptimal, ranging from 19% to 60%, depending on the degrees of antigenic divergence and prediction accuracy in different flu seasons2. Developing effective influenza vaccines or vaccination strategies that can confer cross-protection against variant influenza viruses becomes a high priority to mitigate the public health consequences of influenza.Including conserved antigens is a common strategy in the development of universal influenza vaccines3,4, and some pioneering candidates have advanced to clinical trials5. However, the protection efficacy of these vaccines is not ideal due to the inherently poor immunogenicity of the highly conserved antigens. To date, no universal influenza vaccine has been approved for human use6. Mounting evidence suggests that heterologous sequential immunization strategies represent a promising alternative to inducing broad immunity. Heterologous sequential immunization may synergize diverse vaccine formulations and administration routes to induce multifaceted immune responses, thereby enhancing the protection potency and breadth7,8.Different vaccine formulations can elicit distinct immune responses depending on antigen types, delivery platforms, and administration routes4,9. Protein-based subunit vaccines typically evoke strong antibody responses but poor cellular responses10. In contrast, mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNP) can trigger robust T-cell responses owing to an endogenous antigen production mechanism11. Additionally, mucosal immunity can be efficiently provoked by mucosal immunization but rarely by systemic vaccination like the intramuscular or intravenous routes12,13. As the first line of defense at the virus entry portal to prevent infections and transmissions, mucosal immunity has been recognized to be essential for preventing respiratory diseases and immune correlates of cross-protection against influenza14,15. Recent studies suggest that heterologous sequential immunization involving diverse routes holds promise in boosting both systemic and mucosal immunity. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or adenoviral vector-based mucosal vaccine boosters following mRNA vaccination showed promising results in augmenting mucosal responses and combatting SARS-CoV-2 infections13,16. Nonetheless, many questions remain regarding the potential of tuning immunization strategies to broaden influenza vaccine protection and the identification of the immune correlates of cross-protection against influenza.Here, we investigate if and how various prime-boost immunization strategies affect cross-protection efficacy against influenza using mRNA LNP and protein-based PHC nanoparticle vaccines targeting hemagglutinin (HA). In contrast to prior studies that utilized heterologous immunization to bolster homologous protection against SARS-CoV-212,13,16, our research delves into tailoring immunization strategies for influenza vaccines. Specifically, we emphasize achieving cross-protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic influenza strains and innovatively examine the impacts of various immunization combinations and sequences. Our findings underscore the importance of immunization orders and the crucial role of priming vaccination in shaping Th bias and immunodominance hierarchies of the immune responses. We also demonstrate that cellular and mucosal immune responses are important correlates of cross-protection against influenza in the absence of serum antibody cross-neutralization. Moreover, mucosal PHC nanoparticle immunization significantly outperforms its intramuscular counterpart in inducing mucosal immune responses and conferring cross-protection. Heterologous sequential mRNA LNP priming followed by intranasal protein nanoparticle boosting immunization confers optimal cross-protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenges. Our study offers valuable insights into customizing heterologous sequential immunization strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy and broaden protection.ResultsPriming vaccination plays critical roles in shaping Th bias and immunodominance hierarchiesPreviously, we reported two influenza vaccines targeting full-length A/Aichi/2/1968 (Aic, H3N2) HA (H3) but in different formats—a recombinant protein-based polyethyleneimine-HA/CpG (PHC) nanoparticle and an HA mRNA LNP vaccine17,18. Here we fabricated H3-based PHC and mRNA LNP nanoparticles, with respective hydrodynamic sizes of 128.5 ± 2.207 nm and 86.59 ± 1.808 nm, along with polydispersity index values of 0.097 ± 0.073 and 0.111 ± 0.023, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We immunized mice and compared the serum antibody responses induced by one-dose PHC or mRNA LNP administered via intranasal (IN) and intramuscular (IM) routes, respectively. The two vaccines generated comparable H3-specific total IgG levels, indicating comparable antigen doses. However, they exhibited distinct antibody subtype profiles, suggesting different immunogenic properties (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d). mRNA LNP IM vaccination generated Th1-dominant antibody responses characterized by significantly higher levels of IgG2a compared to IgG1. In contrast, PHC IN immunization generated Th2-skewing antibody responses (IgG1 > IgG2a) (Supplementary Fig. 1e).To compare the vaccine immunogenicity through different immunization strategies, we primed and boosted mice with either PHC IN or mRNA LNP IM vaccination (Fig. 1a). Compared with single-dose PHC, mRNA LNP- and PHC-primed groups showed significant increases in H3-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody titers following the PHC booster (Fig. 1b). Notably, both the one- and two-dose PHC immunization groups showed a Th2-leaning antibody response (IgG1 > IgG2a), while the heterologous sequential IM mRNA priming-IN PHC boosting immunization, defined as IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC), displayed a Th1-leaning antibody profile (IgG1 < IgG2a), resembling the pattern observed with mRNA vaccination (Fig. 1c). Similar results were observed regarding how priming vaccination influenced mRNA LNP vaccination. Both mRNA- or PHC-primed groups displayed significantly higher antibody levels following the mRNA booster compared to single-dose mRNA vaccination (Fig. 1d). The sole mRNA immunization induced Th1-skewing responses, while sequential IN PHC priming-IM mRNA boosting immunization, defined as IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA), facilitated Th2-leaning responses, resembling the PHC vaccination pattern (Fig. 1e). Therefore, priming vaccination plays a significant role in shaping Th1/Th2 immune responses and antibody isotype production.Fig. 1: The influence of priming vaccination on the antigen-specific IgG1/IgG2a antibody responses and antibody cross-reactivity.a Schematic diagram of immunization and sera collection. Mice were immunized twice with either IM (mRNA) or IN (PHC) vaccines at an interval of 4 weeks. Sera were collected 3 weeks post-prime for one-dose IN (PHC) and IM (mRNA) groups or 3 weeks post-boost for two-dose groups. b, c Comparison of the antigen-specific total IgG, IgG subtype (IgG1 and IgG2a) levels, and IgG1/IgG2a ratio in IN (PHC), IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC), and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) groups. d, e Comparison of the antigen-specific total IgG, IgG subtype (IgG1 and IgG2a), and IgG1/IgG2a ratio in IM (mRNA), IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA), and IM (mRNA)+IM (mRNA) groups. f, g Cross-reactive IgG antibody levels against heterologous Phi and heterosubtypic rSH viruses.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 5). Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s multiple comparison tests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe further evaluated serum antibody cross-reactivity in different immunization groups. H3-specific IgG antibody responses were shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a as a comparison. Notably, serology using the vaccine antigen Aic H3 did not reflect cross-reactive antibody levels against variant influenza strains or trimeric full-length HAs. Diverse immunization strategies led to distinct immunodominance hierarchies, related to the Th1/Th2 antibody balance. Groups with Th2-skewing responses tended to have better IgG antibody cross-reactivity against distant strains. Among all groups, IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) induced the highest IgG levels against H3 and homologous Aic (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). However, two-dose IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) elicited the highest cross-reactive antibody levels against heterologous A/Philippines/2/1982 (Phi, H3N2) (Fig. 1f), A/Wisconsin/15/2009 (Wis, H3N2) (Supplementary Fig. 2c), heterosubtypic reassortant A/Shanghai/2/2013 (rSH, H7N9) (Fig. 1g) and A/Anhui/1/2013 (Anh, H7N9) HA (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Additionally, IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) produced higher cross-reactive IgG against Wis, rSH, and Anh H7, despite lower H3- and Aic-specific IgG levels compared to the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) regimen. These results implied a possible correlation between the IgG subtype and cross-reactivity.Heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization conferred optimal cross-protectionFollowing the analysis of antibody responses, we assessed the cross-protection efficacies in these groups against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza viruses. Previously, we have demonstrated that both PHC and mRNA vaccines conferred complete homologous protection in a two-dose regimen in mice, yielding 100% survival rates and no discernible bodyweight loss, even under high challenge doses of 15 ~ 30× LD50 Aic17,18.Mouse-adapted heterologous Phi (H3N2) was employed to evaluate protection against antigenically drifted viruses four weeks post-boost. Upon infection, naive mice lost body weight rapidly and succumbed within 8 days (Fig. 2a, b). Both the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN (PHC)+IN(PHC) groups demonstrated 100% survival rates and complete protection against bodyweight loss. However, the IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) and IM (mRNA)+IM (mRNA) groups experienced significant bodyweight losses of up to 12.1% and 11.2%, respectively. One out of the five mice in the IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) group approached the humane endpoint on day 5 post-challenge. Moreover, the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN(PHC)+IN(PHC) groups exhibited significantly higher 8-day body weight under the curve (AUC) than IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) and IM (mRNA)+IM (mRNA) groups. We further determined Phi-specific IgG isotype levels by ELISA assay and observed similar results with that of H3 (Fig. 2c, d). PHC-primed groups showed significantly higher IgG1/IgG2a ratios versus mRNA-primed groups. The IN(PHC)+IN(PHC) displayed the highest IgG1, while IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) exhibited the highest IgG2a levels among all groups. However, no neutralization activity against Phi was observed across all groups (Supplementary Fig. 2e).Fig. 2: Cross-protection efficacies against heterologous and heterosubtypic strains.a Mouse body weight changes and 8-day body weight AUC post heterologous Phi H3N2 challenge. b Mouse mortality post-Phi challenge. c Phi-specific IgG1 and IgG2a levels post-boosting immunization. d The calculated IgG1/IgG2a ratios (log10) in immune sera. e, f Mice body weight changes, and 8-, and 14-day body weight AUC post heterosubtypic rSH H7N9 virus challenge. g Mouse mortality post-rSH challenge.

Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s multiple comparison tests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe SH (H7N9), a strain within influenza A phylogenetic group 2 like Aic, originates from poultry and carries pandemic potential. It has caused high-mortality human infections in eastern China since 2013. We challenged mice with the heterosubtypic mouse-adapted rSH to evaluate protection efficacies against antigenically shifted viruses. We excluded the IM (mRNA)+IM (mRNA) group due to its unsatisfactory heterologous protection but retained the IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) group for comparison with the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group. Among all groups, the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group exhibited the best protection along with the least bodyweight loss post-rSH infection (Fig. 2e, f), despite suboptimal levels of rSH-specific antibodies (Fig. 1g). This group displayed significantly higher 8-day and 14-day bodyweight AUC than all the other groups. The IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) showed a higher 14-day bodyweight AUC than the naive and IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) groups. All immunized mouse groups showed 100% survival rates (Fig. 2g). Further analysis revealed no serum neutralization activity against rSH, with an IgG1-dominant H7-specific antibody profile consistently observed across all groups (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). This antibody profile provides additional support for the hypothesis regarding the correlation between IgG subtype and cross-reactivity against distant strains.Therefore, two-dose Aic H3 mRNA LNP IM vaccination proves inadequate for heterologous protection against Phi. The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization demonstrated the most robust cross-protection against both heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenges. Moreover, despite lower serum antibody cross-reactivity, IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) surpassed the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) in conferring cross-protection. This underscores the importance of immunization orders and the potential contributions of immune responses beyond serum antibodies.IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization elicited the most robust and balanced T-cell responsesCellular immune responses play important roles in controlling viral infection by producing effector cytokines and eliminating virus-infected cells19,20. We evaluated cytokine-secreting splenocytes by cytokine ELISpot assay 5 weeks post-boosting immunization. One-dose IN (PHC) immunization was included for comparison. IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor essential for T-cell proliferation and the generation of effector and memory cells21. IFN-γ and IL-4, potent inducers and indicators of Th1 and Th2 immune responses, respectively, are associated with distinct IgG antibody subclasses and cellular responses22,23. We found that two-dose vaccination induced significantly more IL-2-, IFN-γ-, and IL-4-secreting splenocytes than naive and one-dose PHC group (Fig. 3a–c), aligning with the elevated antibody levels in two-dose versus one-dose groups (Fig. 1). Moreover, among all groups, the heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization demonstrated the largest IL-2- and IFN-γ-secreting splenocyte populations. However, no significant difference was observed in IL-4-secreting cell frequencies among the two-dose groups. Therefore, the heterologous IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) elicited the most robust and balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses.Fig. 3: Cellular immune responses.a–c IL-2-, IFN-γ and IL-4-secreting splenocytes. d, e IgG and IgG1 antibody-secreting cells in mouse spleens. f, g IgG2a and IgA ASCs in mouse spleens and bone marrow, respectively. h, i Downregulation of CD127 on CD8+ T cells in mouse spleens after 2-day antigen-re-stimulation.

Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s multiple comparison tests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe also evaluated antibody-secreting cell (ASC) frequencies in mouse spleens. Naive mice did not have any antigen-specific ASCs. Two-dose vaccinations induced significantly more antigen-specific IgG and IgG1 ASCs than the one-dose PHC group (Fig. 3d, e). Specifically, the heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization generated IgG and IgG1 ASC frequencies comparable to IN (PHC)+IN (PHC), but significantly higher than the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) immunization, underscoring the effects of immunization orders. The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization elicited the most abundant IgG2a ASCs in both spleens and bone marrows (Fig. 3f), while the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) and homologous IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) produced low IgG2a ASC levels, consistent with the Th-leaning of the antibody responses. Additionally, IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) produced more IgA ASCs than other groups (Fig. 3g).We detected antigen-responsive T cells using an ex vitro antigenic re-stimulation method. The IL-7/IL-7R (CD127) pathway plays an important role in regulating T-cell homeostasis by modulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell generation24,25. In addition to the existence on naive T cells, CD127 has been identified as a selective characteristic marker for long-lived memory T cells and undergoes down-regulation upon contact with antigens26, distinguishing long-living memory T cells from effector T cells. After a 2-day re-stimulation, the immunized groups displayed a significant down-regulation of CD127 on both CD8+ (Fig. 3h, i) and CD4+ (Supplementary Fig. 3) T cells compared to the naive group. Besides, IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) exhibited enhanced CD127 down-regulation on CD8+ T cells versus the one-dose PHC group.Therefore, two-dose sequential immunizations not only enhanced antibody responses but also bolstered cellular responses, including cytokine-secreting T cells and antibody-secreting B cell populations, compared to a single-dose PHC. Notably, the heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) regimen elicited the most robust and balanced T-cell responses, particularly with significantly stronger IFN-γ-mediated cellular responses than all other groups.Adaptive immune responses at mucosal surfaces and in pulmonary tissuesMucosal vaccination can evoke adaptive mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA (sIgA) and tissue-resident memory T and B-cell responses. sIgA, the principal antibody subtype at respiratory mucosal surfaces, typically exhibits superior cross-reactivity compared to systemic IgA antibodies owing to their polymeric structure27. sIgA has been demonstrated protective against many respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV and influenza28,29.We collected nasal washes and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 5 weeks post-boost immunization and determined cross-reactive sIgA antibody levels. The two-dose immunization groups showed hierarchical H3-specific sIgA levels in mucosal washes depending on the immunization routes and orders: IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) > IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) > IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA), consistent with the IgA levels in the boost sera (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) group showed optimal performance in producing cross-reactive sIgA antibodies in both nasal washes and BALF. The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization generated higher sIgA levels against H3, Aic, Phi, Wis, and A/mallard/Netherlands/1/1999 HA (Net H4) than the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) regimen (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). However, minimal differences were observed in sIgA levels against rSH (Fig. 4b) and Anh H7 (Supplementary Fig. 4e) between these two groups, probably attributed to the low sIgA levels resulting from substantial genetic divergence between these strains and Aic. Additionally, two-dose IN (PHC) immunization induced significantly higher sIgA levels against all tested viruses or HAs in nasal washes than one-dose PHC, underscoring the enhancing effects of boosting vaccinations on sIgA production at mucosal surfaces. A separate study displayed similar boosting effects in BALF (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Therefore, intranasal immunization can effectively evoke sIgA production at mucosal surfaces, and two-dose IN (PHC) outperformed the one-dose regimen. In heterologous immunization strategies, the sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) regimen demonstrated superiority over the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) regimen.Fig. 4: Adaptive immune responses at mucosal surfaces and in pulmonary tissues.a, b Cross-reactive sIgA antibody levels against Phi and rSH in nasal washes and BALF, respectively. c Comparison of CD4+CD44+ populations in BALF. d Comparison of CD4+CD44+CD69+ T-cell populations in mouse lung. e Comparison of CD8+CD44+CD69+ T-cell populations in mouse lung.

Statistical significance in d and e was analyzed by Student’s t test (IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) vs. IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA)) or one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s multiple comparison tests (between other groups). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageIt has been reported that sIgA dominates the antibody response in the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, IgG is the major antibody isotype in the lower respiratory tract. Therefore, we further analyzed the antigen-specific IgG in BALF. No significant difference was observed in H3- and Phi-specific IgG titers among the indicated two-dose immunization groups (Supplementary Fig. 4g, h). However, the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group exhibited Th1-leaning subtype profiles, whereas IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) displayed Th2-leaning profiles. Meanwhile, the IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) group elicited the most robust Anh H7-specific IgG responses in BALF, dominated by IgG1, among all groups (Supplementary Fig. 4i). These results were consistent with our observations in sera. Additionally, no discernible neutralization activity against either Phi or rSH viruses was detected in BALF (Supplementary Fig. 4j, k).Growing evidence indicates that memory T and B cells resident along the respiratory tract are highly effective at providing rapid and potent protection against respiratory viral infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-212,30. We collected BALF 5 weeks post-boost immunization and analyzed airway T-cell populations. Few immune cells were detected in the BALF from naive mice. A marked increase of CD45+ and antigen-experienced (CD44+) CD4+ lymphocytes was observed in the immunized versus naive group (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 5a). The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization group displayed CD45+ and CD4+CD44+ cell populations comparable to the IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) group but significantly higher than the IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) group. Thus, intranasal boosting immunization can substantially promote airway CD45+ and CD4+CD44+ T lymphocyte accumulation which may act immediately upon virus infection. The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization outperformed the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) regimen in the induction of these crucial cells and elicited responses comparable to those of two-dose IN (PHC) immunizations.Studies suggested that not all memory T-cell subsets are equally protective. Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are particularly potent in protecting against subsequent heterologous influenza infections31,32. CD69 is an important distinguishing cell-surface marker constitutively expressed on CD4 and CD8 TRM cells under steady-state conditions in mouse lung tissues. It functions as a critical antagonist of S1PR1 (CD363), limiting cell egress into the bloodstream30,33. CD69, along with CD44, are useful for studying mouse TRM. We analyzed tissue-resident memory cells in mouse lungs and observed significantly boosted CD4+CD44+CD69+ and CD8+CD44+CD69+ cells from the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) groups versus the naive and IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) groups (Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary Fig. 5b). Moreover, we studied lung-resident B memory cells (BRM) by analyzing the expression of classical memory B cell marker CD38 and tissue retention marker CD69. The IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunized mice displayed a significant increase in CD19+IgD−CD38+CD69+ BRM cell populations compared to naive mice (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Hence, the heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) regimen facilitated the generation of lung-resident memory T and B cells, potentially shielding the mice from diverse virus infections.Mucosal immunization outperformed intramuscular immunization in cross-protection potencyMucosal immunity likely plays a crucial role in cross-protection, as indicated by our analysis results of diverse immune responses. To evaluate the contributions of mucosal immune responses to cross-protection, we compared the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) to the IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) group. Upon heterologous Phi challenge, all mice from the IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) group displayed noticeable body weight drops, while IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) mice did not show apparent body weight loss, although both groups survived Phi challenges (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization group demonstrated significantly higher body weight AUC than IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) in 8 (Fig. 5b) and 14 days (Supplementary Fig. 6a) post-Phi infection.Fig. 5: Intranasal immunization outperformed intramuscular regimens in cross-protection efficacy.a, b Mouse body weight changes and 8-day bodyweight AUC post-Phi challenge in IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) groups. c Phi-specific sIgA levels in nasal washes and BALF. d, e Mouse body weight changes and 14-day bodyweight AUC post-rSH challenge in IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) groups. f rSH-specific sIgA levels in nasal washes and BALF. g, h The localized CD44+CD69+ T-cell populations in mouse lungs. i Lung-resident memory B cell populations. j Mouse body weight changes and 14-day bodyweight AUC post-Phi challenge in PBS+IN(PHC), IN (PHC)+IN (PHC), and IM (PHC)+IM (PHC) groups.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAnalysis of the immune sera indicated that IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization induced significant Phi-specific sIgA in nasal washes and BALF, whereas IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) did not induce this response (Fig. 5c). However, comparable Phi- and/or H3-specific IgG antibody profiles were observed in immune sera and BALF between these two groups (Supplementary Fig. 6c–f). We compared the antigen-specific IgG1/IgG2a ratios to assess whether the immunization routes impacted the Th1/Th2 immune balance depicted in Fig. 1. Our results indicated comparable Phi- and H3-specific IgG1/IgG2a ratios between the two groups. Furthermore, no neutralization activity against Phi was detected in either sera or BALF in both groups (Supplementary Fig. 6g).Also, upon heterosubtypic rSH challenge, the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group showed better protection than the IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) group, as evidenced by less body weight loss and quicker recovery (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 6h, i) and significantly higher body weight AUC (Fig. 5e) in 14 days post-infection, despite comparable rSH-specific IgG levels in immune sera (Supplementary Fig. 6j). Similarly, no neutralizing activity against rSH was detected (Supplementary Fig. 6k). Significantly boosted rSH-specific mucosal sIgA were observed in the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group compared to the naive and IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) groups (Fig. 5f). Although IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) induced a low-level H3-specific serum IgA, it failed to elicit mucosal sIgA against H3, Aic, Wis, Net H4, or A/mallard/Sweden/51/2002 HA (Swe H10) (Supplementary Fig. 7a–f). Thus, intranasal, rather than intramuscular, PHC-boosting immunization in a sequential immunization strategy effectively induces sIgA at mucosal surfaces.Moreover, IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) elicited higher levels of airway CD45+ lymphocytes, CD4+CD44+T cells, CD8+CD44+ T cells, lung-resident CD4+CD44+CD69+ and CD8+CD44+CD69+ TRM cells, and CD19+IgD−CD38+CD69+ BRM cells than naive and IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) groups, while no significant difference was observed between IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) and naive group (Fig. 5g–i, Supplementary Fig. 7g).We further compared the homologous IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) versus IM (PHC)+IM (PHC) regimen upon 3× LD50 Phi challenge. The IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) group showed robust protection with no noticeable body weight loss post-infection, while IM (PHC)+IM (PHC) displayed body weight drops of up to 9.4% (Fig. 5j, Supplementary Fig. 8a). The IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) group displayed significantly higher 14-day body weight AUC than the IM (PHC)+IM (PHC) group. However, no difference in antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a levels, as well as IgG1/IgG2a ratios was observed in immune sera between these two groups (Supplementary Fig. 8b–e). The comparable IgG1/IgG2a ratios indicated that it was the priming vaccine itself that significantly shaped the Th immune balance and the production of antibody isotypes, rather than the administration routes.Meanwhile, we observed that one-dose IN (PHC) protected mice with a 100% survival rate but suffered from severe body weight loss (Fig. 5j, Supplementary Fig. 8a). Thus, two vaccination doses are required for optimal cross-protection. Therefore, despite comparable capability to induce systemic antibody responses, intranasal immunization outperformed its intramuscular counterparts, whether in homologous or heterologous immunization regimens, in providing influenza cross-protection.mRNA-LNP vaccine serves as an excellent priming modality for intranasal protein-based vaccine boostersWe have demonstrated that IM (mRNA) priming played critical roles in modulating the immune responses. The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) exhibited the highest efficacy in cross-protection. To further assess the significance of mRNA-LNP vaccine priming, we conducted a group involving intramuscular mRNA-LNP priming followed by an intranasal soluble HA booster. It is worth noting that soluble HA is poorly immunogenic when administered intranasally and cannot confer cross-protection against heterologous Phi in a two-dose immunization regimen17.We compared the protective efficacies of the IM (mRNA)+IN (H3) and IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) groups against a 3× LD50 heterologous Phi challenge (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Our findings revealed that administering a soluble H3 intranasal booster following mRNA priming also provided robust heterologous protection. Moreover, we observed no significant difference in the 14-day body weight AUC between these two groups. This result further strengthens the importance of mRNA as the priming vaccination modality. Additionally, the IM (mRNA)+IN (H3) group induced Th1-leaning antibody responses (IgG1 < IgG2a) comparable to those of the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group. These responses differed from those observed with H3 immunization17 but were similar to mRNA-LNP, further affirming the importance of priming vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 9c–f).DiscussionInfluenza poses a substantial burden on public health, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity worldwide annually. Seasonal influenza VE fluctuates and is often unsatisfactory, notably dropping to as low as 19% for the 2014–2015 flu season due to the significant drift of circulating A/H3N2 influenza viruses34. Enhancing the potency of influenza vaccine cross-protection has become an imperative task. Heterologous immunizations with diverse vaccine types have the potential to bolster vaccine cross-protection by eliciting more diverse and multifaceted immune responses. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, advances in mRNA-LNP vaccine development have diversified heterologous vaccination formats.HA, the most abundant influenza virus surface glycoprotein, serves as the most potent immunogen and primary target for influenza vaccine development. Previously, we reported two vaccines targeting Aic HA: an mRNA LNP or a PHC protein nanoparticle vaccine, both demonstrating robust homologous protection17,18. Here, we compared the immunogenicity of IM mRNA LNP and IN PHC vaccines. It’s important to note that a direct comparison between mRNA and protein immunization requires caution. In the present study, we observed comparable levels of antigen-specific IgG antibodies with the indicated dose, suggesting comparable antigen doses. Additionally, the distinct Th1- and Th2-leaning immune characteristics reflected their separate mRNA or protein vaccine features. Then, we investigated how different immunization strategies—homologous or heterologous—impact the ultimate cross-protection efficacy using these two vaccines. We utilized Phi and rSH as challenge strains to assess the cross-protection efficacies against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza viruses. The heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization demonstrated the best cross-protection against both Phi and rSH infections, resulting in the least bodyweight loss among all groups. Two-dose PHC vaccination conferred good protection against Phi, consistent with our prior findings17, but showed less efficacy against rSH. By contrast, the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) and two-dose IM mRNA groups experienced severe body weight loss. We also observed similar suboptimal heterologous protection against Phi in two-dose mRNA vaccination even when adjuvanted by α-GC or cGAMP18.To determine the key correlates of cross-protection, we thoroughly investigated the antibody, cellular, and mucosal responses. Despite superior cross-protection and significant IgG against homologous Aic or H3, the heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization generated fewer cross-reactive antibodies, particularly those against rSH, when compared with the reversed IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA) or the homologous two-dose IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) regimen. Hence, cross-reactive serum antibodies were not the primary correlates of the cross-protection. Further analysis revealed the absence of cross-neutralizing activity in the immune sera against Phi17 and rSH. Our findings also indicated the crucial role of priming vaccination in shaping Th bias and immunodominance hierarchies of the immune responses. In a sequential immunization, PHC prime promoted Th2-leaning responses, while mRNA LNP prime facilitated Th1-leaning responses. Further analysis indicated that variations in the administration route (IM or IN) for PHC immunization did not lead to a significant change in the IgG1/IgG2a ratios. Therefore, it appears that the vaccine itself, administered during the priming vaccination, significantly shapes the Th immune balance and antibody isotype production, rather than the administration routes. Potential underlying mechanisms may involve the immune milieu, such as Th1/Th2 CD4 T cells and the cytokine environment following priming immunization35.Our results also revealed a potential correlation between antibody Th profiles and cross-reactivity contingent upon the antigenic divergence distance. We observed similar Th profiles against homologous H3 and drifted Phi virus. In a sequential vaccination, PHC prime facilitated significantly higher Phi-specific IgG1/IgG2a ratios than mRNA prime, consistent with observations against H3. Heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization elicited balanced Phi-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies. However, all immunization groups displayed IgG1-dominant profiles against antigenically shifted Anh H7. Enhanced IgG antibody cross-reactivity against distant rSH and Anh H7 was noted in groups with Th2-skewing responses. Nonetheless, further evidence is needed to confirm this speculation. Considering the IgG subtype profiles, IgG2a-mediated effector functions36,37, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCC, ADCP), may play some roles in protection against Phi, albeit to a lesser extent against rSH.Cellular immunity plays a vital role in limiting disease severity and has been recognized as an important correlate of cross-protection against influenza due to its broad cross-reactivity38,39. Surprisingly, significant CD127 down-regulation on splenic T cells upon antigen-re-stimulation in vitro was observed across all immunization groups compared to the naive group, including the one-dose PHC immunization. Multiple markers may be required for the precise characterization of long-lived memory T cells in the future. However, our results indicated that heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization elicited the most robust and balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine-secreting cell and IgG1/IgG2a ASC responses. IFN-γ plays an essential role in protective cellular immunity40. Effector CD8 T cells produce cytokines such as IFN-γ to limit early virus replication and directly kill target cells, promoting efficient virus elimination41,42. Effector CD4 cells expressing IFN-γ and perforin were reported to have cytolytic activity and mediate quick recovery from influenza infection43. Heterologous sequential IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) immunization induced the highest IFN-γ- and IL-2-secreting but comparable IL-4-secreting splenocyte frequencies versus other immunization groups. Moreover, cytokine expression was reported to influence the avidity of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)—Th1 cytokine IL-2 facilitates high-avidity CTL generation, while Th2 cytokine IL-4 negatively affects CTL functional avidity44,45. Considering the distinct cytokine secretion profiles, IFN-γ-mediated effector functions and the avidity of T cells probably contribute to the high cross-protection efficacy in the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group.Mucosal immunity including sIgA and TRM also correlates with cross-protection. Our findings revealed elevated mucosal sIgA levels in nasal washes and BALF from groups receiving mucosal boosters compared to those undergoing the mucosal prime-systemic boost regimen. However, the IgG profiles in BALF mirrored those in the serum, consistent with the previous report1. Moreover, no evident neutralization activity was detected in BALF across all groups. Meanwhile, IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) elicited enhanced airway CD45+ and antigen-experienced CD4+CD44+ T lymphocyte accumulation, along with more robust localized lung-resident CD4+CD44+CD69+ and CD8+CD44+CD69+ TRM versus IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA). A recent study suggests that systemic immunity can transition into local immunity following a mucosal booster16, potentially explaining the robust mucosal and cellular immunity observed in the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) group. We further compared the different immunization routes to evaluate the contribution of mucosal immunity. Our results demonstrated that the induction of mucosal immune responses was primarily determined by the immunization route rather than the type of vaccine. Repeated intramuscular vaccination did not stimulate effective mucosal immunity despite high serum antibody responses and mice receiving two-dose IM mRNA LNP or PHC vaccine formulations experienced severe bodyweight loss post-Phi or rSH infection. Mucosal immunization outperformed intramuscular immunization in conferring cross-protection. Therefore, the robust protective mucosal immunity accounts for the significant cross-protection in the IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC) groups observed in our study.To sum up, our study highlights the importance of immunization orders and the crucial role of priming vaccination in steering antibody Th1/Th2 bias and shaping immunodominance hierarchies in a sequential immunization. We further showed that cross-reactive antibodies without cross-neutralization activity in immune sera are not a predictive correlate of cross-protection. By contrast, cellular and mucosal immune responses are more important correlates of cross-protection. Our findings emphasize the pivotal role of mucosal immunity in influenza cross-protection. Mucosal immunity can act as the first line of defense to immediately recognize and eliminate viruses at the site of entry, potentially preventing virus infections and transmissions16,46. In contrast, circulating memory cells require time to proliferate, migrate, and mediate effector function47. While serum antibodies remain the most accessible and convenient indicators for predicting protection, they may not capture the full picture and complexity of immunity or accurately reflect the breadth of protection against variant strains. Evaluating influenza vaccine cross-protection should involve mucosal and cellular immunity, along with profiling antibody subtypes. However, the challenge of detecting these responses in human populations, especially localized T cell and antibody responses, remains a significant limitation. Consequently, more effective detection or analysis methods are warranted.Despite the lipid toxicity of current mRNA-LNP vaccines hindering their application in mucosal routes to achieve effective mucosal immunity48, in our study, the mRNA-LNP vaccine proved its worth as an excellent priming vaccination modality, particularly when followed by intranasal boosters, eliciting comprehensive correlates of cross-protection. Soluble HA intranasal booster following HA mRNA priming also offered good heterologous protection, which was consistent with earlier results of COVID-19 vaccines from the Iwasaki Group16. We assume that seasonal influenza vaccines are probably applicable as mucosal boosters, and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), viral vector-based, and mRNA vaccine platforms that can induce robust Th1 immunity are potentially promising priming modalities.Our findings underscore the advantages of heterologous sequential immunizations combining diverse vaccine formulations and administration routes, along with customized immunization sequences. A tailored immunization strategy can improve the magnitude, quality, and diversity of the adaptive immune responses in several aspects: (1) synergizing different immunization routes and vaccine types to elicit multifaceted immune responses; (2) customizing priming modality to influence the Th bias and promote robust Th1-skewing cross-protective cellular responses; (3) leveraging systemic responses during priming to bolster mucosal responses following booster immunizations. These enhanced cross-protective cellular and mucosal immune responses contributed to influenza cross-protection in the absence of antibody neutralization. Tailoring the immunization strategy to elicit multifaceted cross-protective cellular and mucosal immune responses with diverse vaccine formulations appears to be a viable alternative to the development of broad-spectrum influenza vaccines.We have presented that the sequential mRNA LNP prime plus mucosal PHC nanoparticle boost strategy achieved robust systemic and mucosal immunity and provided potent cross-protection against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza variants within phylogenetic Group 2, with Aic HA as the target antigen. Quadrivalent vaccine formulations containing two influenza A and two influenza B strains hold promise for universal protection against recurring flu epidemics and preparedness against future pandemics. Our research contributes valuable insights into customizing immunization strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy and expand the scope of protection. These findings are instrumental in advancing the clinical translation and adoption of more effective sequential immunization strategies. Leveraging the expedited progress of vaccine development, future investigations should prioritize cross-protective influenza vaccines or vaccination strategies to combat consistent influenza viral mutations49.MethodsStudy designThe main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of immunization strategies on the induction of cross-protective immune responses and identify the most effective strategy for robust and broad influenza protection. To this end, we conducted various homologous or heterologous prime-boost immunizations utilizing mRNA LNP and protein-based PHC influenza vaccines, examined their induced antibody, cellular, and mucosal responses, and investigated how they correlate with the cross-protection efficacies against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza strains in mice. We further evaluated the contributions of mucosal responses to cross-protection. The number of mice per experimental group was indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were conducted when applicable.Ethics statementThe entire study was approved by Georgia State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All mouse experiments were performed in strict compliance with the IACUC guidelines of Georgia State University under IACUC protocol A22029. Female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Envigo and housed at Georgia State University at 20–23 °C, 45–55% relative humidity with 12-hour light/dark cycles, free food, and water supplies. Female animals were chosen because males are aggressive and often fight and get injured, which interferes with data collection. Mice were adapted for no less than one week before experiments and were grouped randomly.Proteins and virusesThe recombinant GCN4-stabilized trimeric full-length influenza HA ectodomains (Aic H3, Net H4, and Swe H10) composing both the head and the stalk regions were expressed by the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified from the baculovirus-infected Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-1711) cell cultures using HisPur Ni-NTA resins (Catalog No.: 88223, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacture’s instructions. The recombinant H3 derived from the HA gene of A/Aichi/2/1968(H3N2) (GenBank No: CY121117.1) was designed as previously described50,51. The Net H4 and Swe H10 constructs were generated using the full-length HA plasmids derived from A/mallard/Netherlands/1/1999 (H4N6) (Catalog No.: NR-28996) and A/mallard/Sweden/51/2002 (H10N2) (Catalog No.: NR-29002) obtained from BEI resources. The purified protein purity was verified by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue staining and visualization with ChemiDoc Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA). The A/Anhui/1/2013 HA (Anh H7, NR-44365, and NR-44081) was obtained from BEI resources.The Aic, Phi, Wis, and reassortant rSH H7N9 influenza viruses were expanded in embryonated chicken eggs52. The reassortant rSH viruses were generated as previously described51. The Phi and rSH virus strains used for challenge studies were mouse-adapted. The LD50 (median lethal dose) of influenza viruses was determined by the standard Reed and Muench method.mRNA-LNP and PHC nanoparticle vaccine productionThe H3 mRNA production and mRNA-LNP fabrication processes have been described in our previous study18. The H3 coding sequence was derived from the HA gene of A/Aichi/2/1968(H3N2) (GenBank No: CY121117.1) and provided in the Supplementary text. Briefly, mRNAs were produced using a MEGAscript™ T7 Transcription Kit and purified using a MEGAclear™ Transcription Clean-Up Kit from Invitrogen. To prepare the mRNA-LNP nanoparticles, mRNA in 25 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0) was formulated with a lipid mixture in ethanol at a mass ratio of 1:20, and a volume ratio of 3:1 using a microfluidic mixer (Precision Nanosystems). The lipids contain DOTMA, DOPE, cholesterol, and DMG-PEG 2000 at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5. The PHC (PEI-H3/CpG) nanoparticles were prepared as described previously17. The recombinant H3 generated in our lab was formulated with PEI (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and CpG ODN1826 (InvivoGen, USA) by a facile vortex-mixing method. The particle size was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Panalytical).Vaccination and sample collectionsTo compare the immunogenicity of the mRNA-LNP and PHC, female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 5 per group) were intramuscularly (IM) injected with 50 μL of mRNA-LNPs containing 5 µg of Aic H3 mRNA in DPBS, or intranasally (IN) immunized with 30 μL of PHC nanoparticles containing 5 µg of H3 protein in DPBS once, respectively. Sera samples were collected three weeks after a single dose of immunization, referred to as prime sera, for antibody evaluation. Naive mice were used as controls.To study the influence of immunization strategies, female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 5 per group) were immunized twice with either IM mRNA LNP or IN PHC vaccines in a typical ‘prime+boost’ regimen at an interval of 4 weeks (Fig. 1a). Four sequential immunization strategies were included, including homologous IM (mRNA)+IM (mRNA) and IN (PHC)+IN (PHC), and heterologous IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) and IN (PHC)+IM (mRNA). Sera samples were collected three weeks after the booster immunization, referred to as boost sera.To evaluate the induction of cellular and mucosal immune responses, female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 3 per group) were sacrificed five weeks post-boosting immunization. Spleens, bone marrow, and lungs were collected, processed into single-cell suspensions, treated with RBC Lysing Buffer Hybri-Max (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and finally resuspended in complete RPMI medium (cRPMI, RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FCS (v/v), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 1× non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol). Mouse nasal washes and BALF were collected with 200 μl and 1.5 mL of ice-cold DPBS supplemented with 0.5 % BSA, respectively. The mucosal washes were centrifuged at 550 g for 5 minutes, and the resulting supernatant was stored at −20 °C until analysis. The cells in BALFs were pelleted down followed by treatment with RBC Lysing Buffer Hybri-Max and resuspension in complete RPMI medium.Challenge studies in Balb/c miceTo study the cross-protection efficacy of the indicated four sequential immunization strategies, the immunized female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 5 per group) were intranasally infected with either mouse-adapted heterologous A/Philippines/2/1982 (Phi, H3N2, challenge dose: 2× LD50) or heterosubtypic A/Shanghai/2/2013 (rSH, H7N9, challenge dose: 3× LD50) viruses, at 4 weeks post-boosting immunization. Naive mice were used as controls. Mouse body weight changes were recorded daily for 2 weeks post-infection. A weight loss of >20% was used as a humane endpoint. The body weight area under the curve (AUC) for each group was calculated from the body weight curve by GraphPad Prism v8.0.We further evaluated the cross-protection efficacies of the same vaccine formulations administered through different routes. The vaccination doses remain consistent with the amount mentioned above. 50 or 30 μL of vaccine suspensions were used for intramuscular injection or intranasal instillation, respectively. For the comparison of IM (mRNA)+IM (PHC) versus IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC), female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 5 per group) were primed with IM (mRNA) and subsequently boosted with either IM (PHC) or IN (PHC) following the same immunization schedules as mentioned above. Mice were then challenged with 2× LD50 of Phi or 3× LD50 of rSH viruses 4 weeks post-boost immunization. For the comparison of IM (PHC)+IM (PHC) versus IN (PHC)+IN (PHC), female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 5 per group) were immunized intramuscularly or intranasally with two doses of PHC nanoparticles at an interval of 4 weeks. Mice were then challenged with 3× LD50 of Phi viruses 4 weeks post-boost immunization. One-dose IN (PHC) vaccination was included for comparison.To assess the significance of mRNA-LNP vaccine priming, we compared the protective efficacies of the IM (mRNA)+IN (H3) and IM (mRNA)+IN (PHC) groups. Female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks, n = 5 per group) were primed intramuscularly with 5 µg of mRNA LNPs and subsequently boosted with either IN (H3) or IN (PHC) containing 5 µg of H3. Mice were then challenged with 3× LD50 of Phi viruses as described above.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assayELISA assay was performed to evaluate antigen-specific antibody responses in immune sera and mucosal washes, as previously described53. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific, USA) were coated with purified recombinant proteins or whole formalin-inactivated viruses (4 μg/mL, 50 μL/well) overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), and blocked with PBST supplemented with 2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Serial dilutions of immune serum, nasal washes, or BALF were added to the plates followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. After three washes with PBST, 50 μL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat: 1033-05, Lot: J3316-P623D, SouthernBiotech, USA), IgG1 (Cat: 1071-05, Lot: K1619-N733, SouthernBiotech, USA), IgG2a (Cat: 1080-05, Lot: B4520-RC63B, SouthernBiotech, USA), or IgA (Cat:1040-05, Lot: J4416-M729, SouthernBiotech, USA) antibodies were added to the plates at a dilution ranging from 1:2000 to 1:4000 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed, and 50 μL of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added to the plates as chromogenic substrates, followed by the addition of 50 μL of 1 M H2SO4 as the stop solution. The absorbance values at 450 nm were recorded using Biotek Epoch Microplate Reader (Agilent). The highest dilution with an optical density at 450 nm (OD450) twice that of the naive mouse sample was used as the endpoint antibody titer. The IgG isotype (IgG1 and IgG2a) levels were evaluated to calculate the ratio of IgG1/IgG2a titers and determine the Th1/Th2 bias of the antibody responses.To study the vaccine immunogenicity, the antibody levels against the vaccine antigen (H3) and homologous Aic virus were determined. To evaluate the antibody cross-reactivity, Phi H3N2, A/Wisconsin/15/2009 (Wis, H3N2), rSH H7N9, Anh H7, Net H4, and Swe H10 were used as coating antigens to determine the specific IgG levels. To evaluate the mucosal antibody responses, sIgA levels in nasal washes and BALF were determined.Microneutralization assayMicroneutralization assays were performed to evaluate antibody neutralization activity against Phi and rSH in immune sera and BALF according to the WHO protocol for Serological Diagnosis of Influenza. The TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose) of Phi and rSH virus was determined in Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK (NBL-2), ATCC CCL-34) cells by the Reed and Muench method. MDCK cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in the lab as recommended by the vendor. Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of BALF or receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd)-treated and heat-inactivated immune sera were mixed with 100 TCID50 of Phi or rSH virus in the presence of 2 μg/mL of TBCK-trypsin for 1 h incubation at 37 °C. The mixture was added to MDCK cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well) and incubated overnight. A standard influenza nucleoprotein-based ELISA assay was used to determine virus inhibition. Mouse anti-influenza A virus NP antibody (Clone: C43, Ab128193, abcam) was used at a dilution of 1:2000. Immune sera from 5 mice were pooled, and then triplicate samples were tested.B cell enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assayB cell ELISpot assays were performed to evaluate antigen-specific ASC frequencies as previously described28. Briefly, purified H3 (4 μg/mL, 50 μL/well) was pre-coated on sterile 96-well ELISpot filtration plates (Millipore, USA) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBS, blocked with culture medium for 2 h at 37 °C, and then 5 × 105 splenocytes or bone marrow cells were seeded per well and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. After removing cells and washing, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, or IgA antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:1000 to the plates followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes, KPL True Blue Peroxidase substrate (SeraCare) was added to develop spots. The reaction was terminated with rinsing water. Results were recorded with BIOSYS Bioreader-6000-E (BioSystem).T-cell ELISpot assayT-cell ELISpot assays were performed to analyze antigen-specific cytokine (IL-2, IFN-γ, or IL-4)-secreting cell frequencies in mouse spleens collected 5 weeks post-boosting immunization. Briefly, sterile 96-well ELISpot filtration plates (Millipore, USA) were pretreated with anti-mouse IL-2 (Clone: JES6-1A12, Cat: 503704, Biolegend), IFN-γ (Clone: R4-6A2, Cat: 551216, BD Biosciences), or IL-4 (Clone: 11B11, Cat: 504102, Biolegend) capture antibodies (4 μg/mL, 50 μL/well) overnight at 4 °C. After washing and blocking, 5 × 105 splenocytes were seeded per well and cultured for 2 days at 37 °C with 4 μg/mL of H3 as stimuli. After removing cells, plates were incubated with 50 μL of biotin-conjugated detection antibodies, anti-mouse IL-2 (Clone: JES6-5H4, Cat: 503804, Biolegend), IFN-γ (Clone: XMG1.2, Cat: 554410, BD Biosciences), or IL-4 (Clone: BVD6-24G2, Cat: 504202, Biolegend), at a dilution of 1:500 at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, streptavidin-HRP (Cat: 554066, BD Biosciences) was added for another 1 h incubation. KPL True Blue Peroxidase substrate was used to develop spots, and spots were recorded with BIOSYS Bioreader-6000-E.Flow cytometryFlow cytometry was used to analyze the lymphocyte populations within immunized mouse spleens, BALF, and lungs collected 5 weeks post-boosting immunization. Antibodies were diluted at a dilution of 1:150 for cell staining.Antigen-responsive T cells in immunized mouse spleens were evaluated by an ex-vitro antigenic re-stimulation experiment. 1 × 106 splenocytes were cultured in cRPMI medium in the presence of 4 μg/mL of H3 and 1ug/mL of anti-CD28 at 37 °C for 2 days for re-stimulation. The re-stimulated splenocytes were pelleted down and washed with FACS buffer (DPBS supplemented with 2% FCS). Then the cells were stained with an antibody cocktail containing anti-mouse CD3e-PE (Clone: 145-2c11, eBioscience, Cat: 12-0031-82), CD4-Percp/Cy5.5 (Clone: RM4-5, BD Pharmingen™, Cat:550954), CD8α-FITC (Clone: 53-6.7, Biolegend, Cat:100712), CD127-APC (Clone: A7R34, Biolegend, Cat:135011), CD16/32 (Clone: 2.4G2, BD Pharmingen™, Cat:553142) antibodies, and Zombie NIR viability dye (Biolegend, Cat:423105) for 30 min at 4 °C in dark. The gating strategy for the T-cell populations is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 3.For BALF T-cell staining, the cells in BALFs were washed and stained with an antibody cocktail containing anti-mouse anti-mouse CD45-PE (Clone: 30-F11, Biolegend, Cat:103105), CD4-Percp/Cy5.5, CD8α-FITC, CD44-BV421 (Clone: IM7, Biolegend, Cat:103040), CD16/32 antibodies, and Zombie NIR viability dye for 30 min at 4 °C. The gating strategy for the T-cell populations is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 5a.Mouse lung tissues were cut into small pieces and treated with 1 mg/mL Collagenase D (Roche) and 30 μg/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 media for 30 min at 37 °C followed by grinding through a 70 μm cell strainer. The cells were pelleted down and then treated by RBC Lysing Buffer Hybri-Max to remove the red blood cells. After washing with the FACS buffer, one-third of the cells were stained with the T-cell antibody cocktail or the B-cell antibody cocktail in FACS buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The lung T-cell antibody cocktail contains the following antibodies: anti-mouse CD45-PE, CD4-Percp/Cy5.5, CD8α-FITC, CD44-BV421, CD69-PE/Cy7 (Clone: H1.2F3, Biolegend, Cat:104511), CD16/32 antibodies, and Zombie NIR viability dye.

Yellowed particles of avian influenza A H5N1 virus particles.CDC & NIAID What A series of experiments with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) viruses circulating in infected U.S. dairy cattle found that viruses derived from lactating dairy cattle induced severe disease in mice and ferrets when administered via intranasal inoculation. The virus from the H5N1-infected cows bound to both avian (bird) and human-type cellular receptors, but, importantly, did not transmit efficiently among ferrets exposed via respiratory droplets. The findings, published in Nature, suggest that bovine (cow) HPAI H5N1 viruses may differ from previous HPAI H5N1 viruses and that these viruses may possess features that could facilitate infection and transmission among mammals. However, they currently do not appear capable of efficient respiratory transmission between animals or people. In March 2024, an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was reported among U.S. dairy cattle which spread across herds and led to fatal infections among some cats on affected farms, spillover into poultry, and four reported infections among dairy workers. The HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from affected cattle are closely related to H5N1 viruses that have circulated in North American wild birds since late 2021. Over time, those avian viruses have undergone genetic changes and have spread throughout the continent causing outbreaks in wild birds and mammals—sometimes with mortality rates and suspected transmission within species. To better understand the characteristics of the bovine H5N1 viruses, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Japan’s Shizuoka and Tokyo Universities, and Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory conducted experiments to determine the ability of bovine HPAI H5N1 to replicate and cause disease in mice and ferrets, which are routinely used for influenza A virus studies. Ferrets are thought to be a good model for understanding potential influenza transmission patterns in people because they exhibit similar clinical symptoms, immune responses and develop respiratory tract infections like humans. The researchers intranasally administered to mice doses of bovine HPAI H5N1 influenza of increasing strength (5 mice per dosage group), and then monitored the animals for body weight changes and survival for 15 days. All the mice that received the higher doses died of infection. Some of the mice that received lower doses survived, and those that received the lowest dose experienced no body weight loss and survived. The researchers also compared the effects of the bovine HPAI H5N1 virus to a Vietnamese H5N1 strain that is typical of H5N1 avian influenza virus in humans and to an H1N1 influenza virus, both delivered intranasally to mice. The mice that received either the bovine HPAI H5N1 virus or the Vietnamese avian H5N1 virus experienced high virus levels in respiratory and non-respiratory organs, including in the mammary glands and muscle tissues, and sporadic detection in the eyes. The H1N1 virus was found only in the respiratory tissues of the animals. Ferrets intranasally infected with the bovine HPAI H5N1 virus experienced elevated temperatures and loss of body weight. As with the mice, the scientists discovered high virus levels in the ferrets’ upper and lower respiratory tracts and other organs. Unlike the mice, however, no virus was found in the ferrets’ blood or muscle tissues. “Together, our pathogenicity studies in mice and ferrets revealed that HPAI H5N1 derived from lactating dairy cattle may induce severe disease after oral ingestion or respiratory infection, and infection by either the oral or respiratory route can lead to systemic spread of virus to non-respiratory tissues including the eye, mammary gland, teat and/or muscle,” the authors write. To test whether bovine H5N1 viruses transmit among mammals via respiratory droplets, such as emitted by coughs and sneezes, the researchers infected groups of ferrets (four animals per group) with either bovine HPAI H5N1 virus or H1N1 influenza, which is known to transmit efficiently via respiratory droplets. One day later, uninfected ferrets were housed in cages next to the infected animals. Ferrets infected with either of the influenza viruses showed clinical signs of disease and high virus levels in nasal swabs collected over multiple days. However, only ferrets exposed to the H1N1-infected group showed signs of clinical disease, indicating that the cow influenza virus does not transmit efficiently via respiratory droplets in ferrets. Typically, avian and human influenza A viruses do not attach to the same receptors on cell surfaces to initiate infection. The researchers found, however, that the bovine HPAI H5N1 viruses can bind to both, raising the possibility that the virus may have the ability to bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract of humans. “Collectively, our study demonstrates that bovine H5N1 viruses may differ from previously circulating HPAI H5N1 viruses by possessing dual human/avian-type receptor-binding specificity with limited respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets,” the authors said.

CDC has issued updated guidance to help prevent the spread of flu between animals and between animals and people at fairs. Taking preventive actions at fairs can help protect exhibitors, visitors, and livestock from flu. Summary What CDC knows An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu among poultry and dairy cows continues to spread in the United States. Four human cases with exposures to sick cows have been reported. What CDC is doing CDC has issued updated guidance to help prevent the spread of flu, including from cattle to people, at livestock fairs or exhibitions across the country. CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the multistate outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in cows and other animals in the United States. With agricultural and livestock fairs happening all around the country this summer and fall, the chances for people to be in close contact with pigs, poultry (e.g., chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese), and cattle increase. Livestock fairs and shows are an important learning opportunity for people of all ages interested in agriculture. Background At the same time, animals exhibited at agricultural fairs and shows can carry and spread influenza A viruses that are different from the seasonal influenza A viruses that commonly spread among people. As the multistate H5N1 bird flu outbreak in poultry, cows and other animals continues to spread, CDC is recommending that fair exhibitors take actions to help prevent the spread of influenza A viruses between animals and between animals and people. Multistate bird flu outbreak is ongoing Since the first report of H5N1 bird flu in U.S. dairy cows this March, four associated human cases have been detected. All four people had direct contact with sick cows before they got sick, had mild illness, and have recovered. These are the first reported instances of cow-to-human spread of H5N1 bird flu. The number of dairy cow herds infected with H5N1 bird flu continues to grow. As of July 11, 146 dairy cow herds in 12 states have confirmed cases of A(H5N1) virus infections. CDC is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and state and local public health and animal health officials to respond to this public health challenge. The risk of H5N1 bird flu to the general public is low at this time. People with close, prolonged, or unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection. Farm workers on affected farms, for instance, are at higher risk of infection than others in the population. Influenza viruses can spread in livestock fairs While rare, influenza A viruses can spread from animals (including pigs, poultry, and cattle) to people and also from people to animals. For example, swine influenza viruses spread commonly in pigs and avian influenza viruses spread commonly in wild birds and cause outbreaks in poultry and now cows. People can be infected by swine and avian influenza viruses and vice versa. People most often get infected with animal influenza A viruses after being in close contact with infected animals. It is rare for people to get sick from these viruses, but when they do, the sickness has varied from mild to severe. In some cases, it has led to hospitalization or death. Animals commonly exhibited at agricultural fairs and shows, including pigs, poultry (e.g., chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese), and cattle, can carry and spread influenza A viruses. CDC offers guidance to fair exhibitors Livestock exhibitors can take the following actions to help protect themselves, friends and family, other visitors, and livestock and prevent the spread of flu: If you are sick with flu-like illness, stay home to avoid spreading illness to other people or animals. Plan to keep pigs, poultry, and cattle at the fair or exhibition for shorter periods of time to prevent or interrupt the spread of flu between animals (72 hours or less is ideal). Don’t take toys, pacifiers, cups, bottles, strollers, or similar items into the animal areas. Don’t eat, drink, or touch, or put anything in your mouth or touch your eyes while in animal areas (barns, show arenas). Wash your hands often with soap and running water after touching animals, animal associated equipment, or their environments (like a barn or enclosure). If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Where possible, avoid direct contact with pigs, poultry, cattle, and other animals that look or act ill. (Direct physical contact with the animal includes touching, holding, kissing, being bitten, licked, and scratched.) If you must come in contact with animals that may be ill, wear personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes protective clothing, gloves, goggles, and a respirator or well-fitting mask that covers your mouth and nose. Parents and caregivers should review considerations for specific groups of people when selecting a respirator or mask for children. Protect your animals If your animals are sick or are from herds with a recent history of respiratory disease, keep them at home to prevent further spread of illness. Watch animals for illness before and during the fair. In dairy cows, decreased milk production can be a sign of influenza virus infection. Other signs of illness include loss of appetite, fever, tiredness, eye redness, signs of discomfort, cough, or runny nose. Call the fair veterinarian and/or the fair manager right away if you suspect illness. Remove sick animals from the exhibition area right away. If possible, avoid close contact with sick animals. Clean and disinfect all tack, feeders, waterers, equipment, and show supplies before and after bringing them to the fair or show. Do not share equipment used for other animals. Other resources CDC has issued interim recommendations for preventing, monitoring and public health investigations of H5N1 bird flu in animals and people. An appendix to CDC’s interim H5N1 bird flu guidance categorizes the degree of risk by exposure. In addition, USDA also has fair guidance that focuses on reducing the risk of influenza spread between animals.

EV25 is the company’s lead drug that treats influenza. (Photo/iStock.com photo/sitox) July 9, 2024 Steve Martin Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Eradivir, a preclinical biotech company, leverages small molecule targeting technology developed in Philip Low’s lab at Purdue University to focus on a platform of immunotherapies for viral infections like influenza and other diseases. CEO Martin Low said Eradivir’s lead drug EV25 treats influenza, a disease that affects up to 40 million Americans, kills between 10,000 and 50,000, and hospitalizes 150,000 to 750,000 annually. “EV25 relies on a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug as a basis to deliver an attached immunogenic payload containing haptens, specifically to the surface of virus and virus-infected cells,” Martin Low (rhymes with “now”) said. “As a result, EV25 both inhibits viral reproduction and kills the flu virus and infected cells.” Martin Low said EV25 has demonstrated several advantages over current influenza drugs. “It promotes a quicker recovery even after delaying treatment well beyond the standard 48 hours from the appearance of symptoms,” he said. “It also reduces both the risk of drug resistance and the number of doses required to only one.” Developmental steps Eradivir has successfully completed preclinical studies required by regulatory agencies to dose EV25 in humans. “A Phase I study, designed to indicate the safety of EV25 in healthy volunteers, is scheduled to begin in Antwerp, Belgium, at the end of the year,” Martin Low said. “Also planned for 2025 are two Phase II studies that will confirm safety and indicate the efficacy of EV25.” Martin Low said because Eradivir’s overall immunological technology platform has the potential to treat multiple diseases, the company is also conducting studies on other molecules to treat dengue and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. “We have seen some early success and hope to demonstrate proof of concept for one of these molecules by the end of the year,” he said. Eradivir leadership Eradivir’s team has been very successful in developing small molecule therapies in cancer, autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases. Its board members include Philip Low and Raymond Schinazi, who have worked on several drugs that have been approved for the market. “We have built a team that understands viruses and how to develop small molecules. Many of us have worked together in the past and know how to get things done,” Martin Low said. Eradivir’s Purdue University connections Philip Low is Purdue’s Presidential Scholar for Drug Discovery and the Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry in the College of Science. He also is on the faculty of the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery and the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research. He has started seven successful companies based on his research, and three of his drugs have been approved by the FDA. “It is our goal to continue our discovery work in these areas at Purdue University,” Martin Low said. “Our investors share this vision and have to date contributed over $18 million in financing.” Philip Low disclosed the immunological technology innovations to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property. OTC licensed the innovations to Eradivir for further development and commercialization. About Eradivir Eradivir’s goal is to focus the power of the immune system to treat disease. Its small-molecule, bispecific immunotherapy tethers a patient’s immune cells specifically to a diseased cell facilitating its rapid and selective destruction. Its first drug to go into humans, EV25, is directed against influenza.

The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, offers valuable insights into tailoring immunization strategies to optimize influenza vaccine effectiveness. To alleviate the significant public health burden of influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics, it’s essential to enhance influenza vaccine cross-protection, according to the authors. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual influenza vaccination, current seasonal influenza vaccines typically provide strain-specific and short-lived immunity. Seasonal influenza vaccines offer limited cross-protection against antigenically diverse virus variants and provide no defense against sporadic influenza pandemics, the authors explained. “Developing effective influenza vaccines or vaccination strategies that can confer cross-protection against variant influenza viruses is a high priority to mitigate the public health consequences of influenza,” said Dr. Chunhong Dong, first author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. In the study, the researchers investigated the effects of immunization strategies on the generation of cross-protective immune responses in female mice using mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and protein-based polyethyleneimine-HA/CpG (PHC) nanoparticle vaccines targeting influenza hemagglutinin. The mice were immunized with either intramuscular mRNA LNP or intranasal PHC vaccines in a typical prime-plus-boost regimen. A variety of sequential immunization strategies were included in this study for parallel comparison. “We demonstrated that cellular and mucosal immune responses are pivotal correlates of cross-protection against influenza,” said Dr. Baozhong Wang, senior author of the study and a Distinguished University Professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. “Notably, intranasal PHC immunization outperforms its intramuscular counterpart in inducing mucosal immunity and conferring cross-protection. Sequential mRNA LNP prime and intranasal PHC boost demonstrated optimal cross-protection against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza strains.” The study highlights the importance of immunization orders and indicates that in a sequential immunization, an mRNA vaccine priming plays an important role in steering the Th1/Th2 immune responses. Also, the intranasal PHC boost is crucial to the induction of mucosal immunity, Wang said. Additional authors of the study include Wandi Zhu, Lai Wei, Joo Kyung Kim, Yao Ma and Sang-Moo Kang of the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. The study is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

Supported Browsers Google Chrome Safari Microsoft Edge Firefox Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Gratiot County Dairy Herd About MDARD Media Room July 09, 2024 Today, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) Director Tim Boring announced the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in another dairy herd from Gratiot County, bringing the total number of affected dairy herds in Michigan to 26. Testing through the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory initially detected this case. Samples have been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories for additional confirmatory testing. Regardless of the species, biosecurity remains the best tool available to combat HPAI. On May 1, 2024, Director Boring issued the Determination of Extraordinary Emergency HPAI Risk Reduction and Response Order (HRRRO). In addition to other protocols, the order requires all dairy operations in Michigan to adopt enhanced biosecurity measures, collectively reducing the risk of introducing this virus on to farms. The order also prohibits the exhibition of all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, until there are no new cases of HPAI in Michigan dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. No dairy cattle of any age from an infected premises may be exhibited until further notice. In addition to these requirements, following a few key steps can also be fundamental to protecting the health and vitality of Michigan's dairy cattle: Delay or stop incoming or returning animals from herds with unknown or suspect health status. Isolate all animals that are new or returning to your farm. Monitor the health of your animals daily. Contact your veterinarian if there are ever any animal health-related concerns or if you would like to develop a secure food supply plan. Sick animals should have dedicated equipment and be cared for after tending to healthy animals first. Clothing, footwear, and equipment worn/used around sick animals should not be worn/used around other animals until they are cleaned and disinfected. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant effective against avian influenza. Do not share tools, equipment, trailers, etc. with other farms. Clean and disinfect the interiors of trailers used to haul animals from other operations. Limit non-essential visitors to your farm. If individuals have recently been on a poultry farm, they should not visit a dairy operation, and vice versa. Require or provide clean clothing and footwear to those entering your farm. Use hand-washing stations and provide gloves to those working on your farm. As part of the disease response, MDARD is working with the herd veterinarian to monitor the health of the animals and conduct trace investigations. Additionally, MDARD and various federal and state partners continue to offer personal protective equipment at the request of dairy operations.

AMES, Iowa – As highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread in dairy herds across the U.S., the virus is being detected in raw milk. A new study by a broad team of researchers at Iowa State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine helps explain why. Sialic acid, a sugar molecule found on the surface of some animal cells, acts as a receptor for influenza. Without sialic acid providing an entry point to attach, invade and infect, a flu virus is unlikely to find a potential host hospitable. Before the recent HPAI outbreak in dairy herds, there was scant research into sialic acid levels in the mammary glands of cattle. Scientists had no reason to suspect the milk-producing organs would be a good target for influenza. “In livestock, we hadn’t usually looked in milk for viruses. Bacteria, sure. But not so much viruses,” said Dr. Eric Burrough, professor of veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine. A team of Iowa State researchers who examined mammary gland samples from two infected cows found a rich supply of sialic acid, which could shed light on how the virus attaches to hosts and help develop measures to slow the illness’ spread. “We need to stop transmission, and one way to potentially do that is through milking machines. We’re not sure that’s involved with how this is spreading, but it’s one hypothesis,” said Dr. Todd Bell, professor of veterinary pathology. All milk sold commercially in stores is pasteurized, and research consistently shows pasteurization neutralizes viruses such as influenza. But knowing cows are a biologically suitable home for the flu virus, particularly in their mammary glands, reiterates the dangers of consuming raw milk and raises questions about how milk from infected cows is discarded, Burrough said. “The idea that the mammary glands are being passively infected is put to rest by this paper,” he said. “They’re pumping out tons of virus, and that’s a risk.” While HPAI isn’t usually deadly for cows, it’s often fatal for birds. Since the start of the outbreak in the U.S., more than 97 million birds have been affected, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Commercial poultry flocks where the virus is detected are typically euthanized. The infected dairy cattle samples ISU researchers examined – both mammary glands and respiratory tissues – had receptors for flu strains that originate from birds as well as humans and pigs. The presence of both types of receptors poses added risks, as a single cell infected by avian and mammalian viruses could lead to potentially dangerous mutations, Bell said. The study was published in the July edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s peer-reviewed journal. Thirteen of its 14 co-authors are from Iowa State, including researchers and faculty from across the College of Veterinary Medicine. Another article in the same edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases – with a list of co-authors that includes 10 ISU researchers – describes the initial diagnosis of HPAI in dairy, a finding made at the ISU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory this spring. Speedy teamwork in the face of new public health threats is essential, said Rahul Nelli, research assistant professor of veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine. “Having different departments coming together to collaborate was key for this study and will be key for future investigations,” Nelli said. Further research could involve influenza receptors in other species and organs, including a closer look at dairy cattle, Bell said. The just-published study is based on a handful of samples. Scientists’ understanding of how influenza affects cattle will improve as more data is collected and herds are regularly screened. “Surveillance will be really important moving forward, not only through this event but in the years to come,” Burrough said.

Since the virus first emerged in dairy cattle, scientists have been closely watching for changes in the virus that would signal a greater pandemic threat and conducting experiments to gauge infectivity and transmission. New information on pathogenicity, receptor bindingIn one set of experiments, researchers dripped milk from infected cows into the noses of mice and ferrets, which caused severe disease in the animals. Ferrets are often used to examine potential influenza A transmission patterns in people, because the animals show similar clinical symptoms and immune responses. In the intranasal experiments, researchers compared the infectivity of three different viruses: H5N1 from cows, a Vietnamese H5N1 strain, and seasonal H1N1. Mice receiving the H5N1 viruses had high virus levels in respiratory and non-respiratory organs, including mammary tissues and muscles, but H1N1 was found only in respiratory tissues. The group also found that the virus can spread from mice mothers to their pups, likely via infected milk.In ferrets, H5N1 was found only in the respiratory system."Together, our pathogenicity studies in mice and ferrets revealed that HPAI H5N1 derived from lactating dairy cattle may induce severe disease after oral ingestion or respiratory infection, and infection by either the oral or respiratory route can lead to systemic spread of virus to non-respiratory tissues including the eye, mammary gland, teat and/or muscle," the group wrote.Our study demonstrates that bovine H5N1 viruses may differ from previously circulating HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 viruses by possessing dual human/avian-type receptor-binding specificity with limited respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets.The group also found that mice can become sick after drinking even a small amount of raw milk from an infected cow, a finding that some of the same researchers had reported in a May research letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.In yet another set of experiments, researchers mixed the H5N1 virus from cows with different types of receptors, which the virus uses to enter cells. They found that the virus can bind to receptors that can recognize both avian and human influenza viruses, which adds more evidence that the virus may be adapting to human hosts and that it may have the ability to bind to cells in the human upper respiratory tract.The team wrote, "Collectively, our study demonstrates that bovine H5N1 viruses may differ from previously circulating HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 viruses by possessing dual human/avian-type receptor-binding specificity with limited respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets."Ferret experiments didn't easily spread in airAnother big question about the virus is how well it can spread through the air. To gauge transmission, researchers placed H5N1-infected ferrets in cages that were near, but not touching, the cages of uninfected ferrets. None of the four exposed ferrets got sick or tested positive for the virus. However, follow-up tests found that one ferret had antibodies to H5N1.When they did the same experiment with seasonal flu, they found efficient noncontact spread.Yoshihiro Kawaoka, PhD, a group leader and professor of pathobiological sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a news release from the school, that the finding "suggests that the exposed ferret was infected, indicating some level of airborne transmissibility but not a substantial level." Experts weigh in on new findingsIan Brown, PhD, a group leader in avian virology with the UK-based Pirbright Institute, said data from mice doesn't always directly correlate to humans, but the new work on predicted cell binding offers new evidence for wider attachment, including cells lining the upper airway of humans. However, he added that more study is needed to understand the underlying factors. "Overall the study findings are not unexpected but this report provides further science insight to an evolving situation, that emphasises the need for strong monitoring and surveillance in affected or exposed populations, both animals and humans to track future risk," he said. Ed Hutchinson, PhD, senior lecturer at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said it's notable that both H5N1 viruses can spread through the bodies of infected animals, including the mammary glands. "Now that we’re looking, it seems like spreading into the mammary glands is something that any of these highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses could do," he said. The results of the ferret respiratory transmission experiments are somewhat reassuring, but he said there is still reason for concern. It seems like spreading into the mammary glands is something that any of these highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses could do.When the researchers compared bovine H5N1 with the other H5N1 strain, they saw some evidence that the bovine strain had already started to gain some of the properties linked to the ability to spread through respiratory transmission in humans. "Although it is good news that cow flu cannot yet do this, these findings reinforce the need for urgent and determined action to closely monitor this outbreak and to try and bring it under control as soon as possible," Hutchinson said.

To protect our livestock industry from the threat posed by H5N1, USDA is taking a number of actions with our federal partners—one of them being a significant update to the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-raised Fish Program (ELAP). Those of you who incur milk losses in their dairy herds due to H5N1 can now apply for financial assistance through ELAP. USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) expanded ELAP policy through the rule-making process; this expansion assists with financial losses resulting from reduced milk production when cows are removed from commercial milking in dairy herds with a confirmed positive H5N1 test. Positive tests must be confirmed through APHIS’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL).So, in this Ask the Expert, Dr. Julie Gauthier – Executive Director of Veterinary Services’ Field Operations and Policy Liaison for the dairy cattle HPAI response, answers questions about H5N1 in the United States, its current effects in our dairy industry, and the process and importance of testing your cows to help protect them, your operation, and the dairy industry as a whole. Dr. Julie Gautiher is Executive Director of Veterinary Services’ Field Operations and Policy Liaison for the dairy cattle HPAI response at APHIS. What is Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infection in Dairy Cattle?Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a contagious viral disease of domestic poultry and wild birds. HPAI is deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. HPAI is a threat to the poultry industry, animal health, trade, and the economy. An H5N1 strain of HPAI has affected wild and domestic birds in the United States since 2022. This same strain of H5N1 was first detected in dairy cattle in the United States in March 2024. Since that time, USDA has worked with states and producers to detect and investigate cases of H5N1 in cattle to learn more about the virus and how it is spreading. H5N1 causes less severe illness in cattle than in domestic birds, with most cattle recovering after supportive care. However, the disease remains of concern for all livestock and also for humans who come into contact with infected animals. USDA remains committed to learning more about this virus, and supporting producers that are impacted by it.How are the tests for H5N1 in dairy herds administered? Do I conduct the test or does someone else?In order to continue to monitor and understand the extent of this virus and reduce the risk of further spread of H5N1, APHIS issued a Federal Order, effective April 29, 2024, that requires premovement testing for lactating dairy cattle moving interstate and reporting of positive test results from all laboratories and state animal health officials. While interstate movement testing of lactating dairy cattle is required per the Federal Order, producers and veterinarians may choose to participate in the HPAI Dairy Herd Status Program, as an alternative, or to conduct additional testing to manage HPAI suspect herds or better understand the health status of their herd. The HPAI Dairy Herd Status Program offers alternatives to the premovement testing and streamlined sample collection, from the bulk milk tank rather than individual cows. Regardless of which testing route producers chose, APHIS will provide financial support for the costs of NAHLN testing and sample shipping, through producer support programs; interested producers can contact their APHIS AVIC for more details. USDA encourages individuals to work with their herd veterinarians to report cases of sick cattle or other animals with signs compatible with HPAI to State Animal Health Officials (SAHO) and their APHIS Veterinary Services Area Veterinarian in Charge (AVIC).What is the impact to my dairy operation if any of my cows test positive for H5N1?Isolate any sick cattle from the rest of your herd and closely monitor for other sick animals. Provide supportive care, as cattle have been recovering well, and divert or destroy milk from sick animals. Work closely with your SAHO and AVIC to provide epidemiological data to help understand the disease better, and to move through the herd clearance process. In general, herds are eligible for clearance when cattle show no clinical signs and undergone a 30-day waiting period or two negative weekly tests. Producers should work closely with their SAHO and AVIC to ensure they are aware of options for financial support for veterinary care, heat treatment for milk disposal, personal protective equipment and emergency assistance programs.Is HPAI in dairy cattle a food safety or human health issue?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA are confident that the food supply is safe. The pasteurization process and diversion/destruction of milk from sick cows ensures the safety of the nation’s treated commercial milk supply. The federal-state milk safety system for commercial milk, and the Grade “A” Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, have proven effective for decades against a wide range of pathogens. USDA has a rigorous meat inspection process, which includes Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) veterinarians who are present at all federal livestock slaughter facilities. FSIS has a comprehensive approach to identifying systemic disease in animals and ensuring the safety of the food supply. FDA has additional information about food safety on its website. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believes the current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses remains low. People who have job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds or animals, including cows, are at greater risk of contracting HPAI A(H5N1) virus. CDC has recommendations related to testing, treatment of HPAI A(H5N1) infection and prevention of exposure to these viruses available on its website. What can dairy producers do to prevent H5N1 in their herds?Biosecurity is the key to containing and eliminating this virus. Good biosecurity – including cleaning and disinfection of vehicles and equipment – is critical to minimizing the risk of disease spread. USDA works closely with state animal health officials, producers, and industry organizations to provide biosecurity guidance and resources not only on affected farms but for all livestock producers as a part of practicing good biosecurity. APHIS has made available a number of biosecurity documents on its landing page.Do I or anyone working at the dairy need to take personal safety precautions?APHIS has shared a list of minimum recommendations for appropriate personal protective equipment to wear and biosecurity procedures to follow for anyone who will be in contact with an HPAI (H5N1) affected herd. CDC also has many resources for personal safety precautions on its website including Protecting Yourself from H5N1 When Working With Farm Animals, Reducing Risk for People Working with or Exposed to Animals, and Considerations and Information for Fair Exhibitors to Help Prevent Influenza. A full list of CDC’s public health materials related to H5N1 is available on its website. Dr. Julie Gauthier is Executive Director of Veterinary Services’ Field Operations for APHIS.

This is a topic of significant importance as it aims to determine whether there are specific hematological parameters that can be used to distinguish between influenza and COVID-19 in children. Methodology: Two hundred thirty-one children between the ages of 1 month and 18 years who presented to the children’s outpatient clinic between June 2021 and June 2022 with similar symptoms and were tested with an influenza test and a COVID-19 PCR test were included in the study. Of the patients included in the study, 130 tested positive for COVID-19 and 101 positive for influenza. The patients were evaluated for hematological parameters. Results: Age, eosinophils and monocyte factors were shown to be statistically significantly effective in COVID-19. The risk of COVID-19 increased 1,484-fold with age, 10,708-fold with increasing eosinophil count, and 1,591-fold with increasing monocyte count. The performance of the monocyte count and eosinophil count was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. According to the performed ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) value was observed to be 0.990 for monocytes. According to the cutoff point >1.50, the sensitivity value was determined as 98.4% and the specificity value as 97.0%. AUC significance for eosinophils was found to be 0.989. According to the cutoff point >0.02, the sensitivity value was determined as 99.2% and the specificity value as 93.1%. Conclusion: In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the eosinophil count and monocyte count are easily accessible, inexpensive, and important parameters in terms of differential diagnosis and can help in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza during seasonal outbreaks of the latter. Developing parameters for clinicians to use in diagnosing COVID-19 and influenza can facilitate their work in practice. Introduction Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are droplet-borne pathogens that affect the respiratory system. Both viruses are enveloped RNA viruses. In addition, there are divisions between them in the terminology of the incubation period, the risk groups they affect, and the speed of infection. It may not always be likely to distinguish between influenza and COVID-19 just by examining the symptoms. With COVID-19 and influenza, the period from when the individual is infected until the onset of symptoms is one or more days. If the patient is infected with COVID-19, the symptoms may take longer to grow compared to influenza. While influenza symptoms last 1–4 days after infection, for COVID-19 this period can be 2–14 days. Also, in both COVID-19 and influenza, the virus can be transmitted before symptoms appear. Influenza in children is well documented and associated with serious complications, including death (1, 2). However, pediatric data on COVID-19 are still at a limited level. Compared to COVID-19 infected adults, studies have found that hospitalizations in children are less common, symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath are less perceived (3, 4) and pediatric deaths relevant to COVID-19 are rare (5). Nevertheless, publications on a clinical picture in children called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which is rare but can be fatal, keep popping up (6). Laboratory findings in children with COVID-19 demonstrate similarities to other viral respiratory infections (7). It is typically observed that the leukocyte count remains within the normal range, with a decrease in either neutrophil or lymphocyte count. Additionally, thrombocytopenia may occur. However, it is important to note that in the comparison between COVID-19 cases and influenza B cases, there was a significantly higher occurrence of leukocytosis in the COVID-19 cases (8). Testing is needed to identify the disease and ensure diagnosis in these two infections with similar symptoms. Rapid determination of the etiology of both infections is particularly important when immediate action is required. Taking isolation and quarantine measures for COVID-19 and starting influenza treatment promptly are important to halt the progression of the infections. To date, very few studies have been published directly comparing pediatric cohorts of COVID-19 patients with seasonal influenza patients. Distinguishing between influenza and COVID-19, guiding patient care, and supporting a comprehensive COVID-19 control program are important to isolating cases, quickly identifying those who have been contacted, and taking action, including quarantine. Assuming that preventing COVID-19 would be more difficult at a time when influenza and other respiratory diseases are beginning to increase in society, especially as seasonal influenza approaches, the hematological discrepancies in the instruction were considered study to distinguish these infections from others could be of practical importance. Many newer approaches are being developed today that are appreciated to provide analysis and control of blood hematological parameters as simple, effective, and rapid laboratory procedures that can be recalled by physicians charged with evaluating infectious inflammatory responses. The study aimed to determine if there is a parameter to distinguish between influenza and COVID-19 by using specific hematological parameters. Clinical methodology A total of 231 children between the ages of 1 month and 18 years who presented to the children’s outpatient clinic at Kirsehir Training and Research Hospital between June 2021 and June 2022 with comparable symptoms were included in the study. The cases with known chronic infections and hematological diseases were excluded from the study. The sample selection process involved identifying children who visited the children’s outpatient clinic during the specified time frame and had symptoms such as fever, cough, nasal discharge, fatigue, and malaise. Children meeting these criteria were considered eligible for inclusion in the study. Blood count, influenza and COVID-19 test data were retrieved and recorded by the hospital’s automation system. The cases were tested in line with the recommendations of the producers through Humasis Influenza Antigen Card Plus (Korea), SD Biosensor Standard-Q Influenza A/B (Korea) and SD Biosensor Standard-F Influenza A/B FIA (Korea) rapid antigen detection kits (sensitivity 87%/93% specificity 95%/98%). The diagnoses of the patients suspected with COVID-19 who applied to our hospital were confirmed with SARS CoV-2 PCR test. Viral RNAs extracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples through vNAT solution were studied with Bio-speedy SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kits, which are one-step reverse transcription (RT) and real-time PCR (qPCR) (RT-qPCR) kits that target ORF1ab and N gene fragments in Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch TM device [When used with vNAT isolation method, the limit of determination (LoD) of the kit is 200 genome/mL for nasopharyngeal aspirate/lavage and phlegm samples, 281 genome/mL for bronchoalveolar lavage samples, 562 genome/mL for oropharyngeal swabs, 200 genome/mL for nasopharyngeal Dacron swabs, and 89 genome/mL for nasopharyngeal polyester swabs]. The samples taken from the patients included in the study were appropriately placed in tubes that contained Bio-Speedy viral nucleic acid tampon (vNAT), and the tubes were delivered to the laboratory in the shortest time possible. Viral RNAs extracted with vNAT solution were studied with Bio-speedy SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kits in Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch TM device (In line with the kit recommendations, the threshold value for the Bio-Rad CFX 96 device was set at 200 RFU). RT-qPCR, which targeted ORF1ab and N gene fragments, was performed. The samples were studied with oligonucleotide kit (internal control), which targets human RNase P gene, in order to check nucleic acid extraction and inhibition. Internal control (IC) (RNase P) curve was marked blue, while SARS-CoV-2 (N) and SARS-CoV-2 (ORF1ab) curve were marked red. The internal control curve being a sigmoidal curve shows that there was no problem in the sampling and isolation steps. When SARS-CoV-2 curve was sigmoidal, the sample was reported as POSITIVE, and when it was not sigmoidal, the sample was reported as NEGATIVE. Ethical approval The ethical board approval for the study was obtained from Ahi Evran University Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee with decision number 2022–16/120. The study was conducted in line with the ethical principles set by Helsinki Declaration. Statıstical methodology The data were analyzed through IBM SPSS Statistics Standard Concurrent User V 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, ABD) and MedCalc® Statistical Software version 19.6 (MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend, Belgium) statistical software. Descriptive statistics were presented as number of unit (n), percentage (%), median (M), and interquartile range (IQR) values. The normal distribution of numerical variables was evaluated with Shapiro–Wilk normality test. In the comparison of groups by numerical variables, Mann–Whitney U test was employed. The groups were compared in terms of gender through Chi-square test. Factors effective on COVID-19 were analyzed through simple and multiple binary logistic regression by correcting according to age. The factors in the final model were determined through backward Wald elimination method. The performances of monocyte and eosinophil in predicting COVID-19 disease was evaluated with ROC analysis. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results In the study, a total of 231 patients, 130 COVID-19 and 101 influenza patients, were included in the study. The number of boys in the COVID-19 group was 71 (54.6%) and 57 in the influenza group (56.4%). No statistically significant difference between the groups was found with regard to gender distribution (p > 0.791). The mean age of the COVID-19 patients was 17 years old, while it was 5 years old in the influenza group, showing a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). The difference in the leukocyte counts of the groups was not statistically significant. The RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC levels of the COVID-19 patients were statistically higher than those of the influenza patients. It was found that the RDW and PLT values of the influenza patients were statistically significantly higher than those of the patients in the COVID-19 group. The neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts of the COVID-19 patients were statistically higher than those of the influenza patients. The difference between the groups in lymphocyteeutrophil and lymphocyte/monocyte rates was not statistically significant. It was found that the eosinophils, basophils, MPV and PDW levels were statistically higher in the COVID-19 patients. The difference between the groups in terms of PCT, NRBC and NRBC-I values was not statistically significant. Finally, IG and IG-I scores were determined to be statistically significantly higher in the influenza group (Table 1). Table 1 Table 1. Comparison of the variables in the study by groups. Since the comparisons in Table 1 showed a statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to age, taking into account that other variables in the study would be affected by the age factor, age-corrected factors were evaluated by a simple logistic regression analysis to determine them identify the factors effective on COVID-19 and presented in Table 2. According to the results of simple logistic regression analysis presented in Table 2, MCHC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes/monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, MPW, PDW, IG, and IG-I factors were each found to be statistically significantly effective at COVID-19 observed. Table 2 Table 2. Simple logistic regression analysis of the effect of age-corrected variables on COVID-19. To determine the final factors effective on COVID-19, variables with a value of p < 0.20 in Table 2 were included in the multiple logistic regression analysis. To determine the final model, the Backward-Wald method was used as the elimination method. The age variable was kept constant at each step until the final model. The final model included factors with a value of p < 0.05. According to Table 3, age, eosinophils and monocyte factors were statistically significantly effective in COVID-19. Table 3 Table 3. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the variables found to be effective of COVID-19. According to the results in the Table 3, the risk of COVID-19 increased 1.484-fold with age, 10.708-fold with increasing eosinophil count, and 1.591-fold with increasing monocyte count. According to Homer-Lemeshow statistics, the established model achieved a goodness of fit. The variables in the model explained the dependent variable 70.3%. In Table 4, the performances of monocytes and eosinophils in predicting COVID-19 disease were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis. Table 4 Table 4. ROC curve analysis results for age-corrected lymphocyte and lymphocyte/monocyte. According to ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) value is 0.990 for monocytes. According to the optimal cutoff point >1.50, the sensitivity value was determined as 98.4% and the specificity value as 97.0%. The AUC value for eosinophils is 0.989. According to the optimal cutoff point >0.02, the sensitivity value was determined as 99.2% and the specificity value as 93.1% (Figures 1–3). Figure 1 Figure 1. ROC Curve for age-corrected monocyte.

Discussion Influenza and COVID-19 are two different respiratory pathogens that can be found in children, cause hospitalizations, and share similarities and differences. The first difference we defined in this study was the variation in age groups. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were older than those diagnosed with influenza. In a survey conducted in China that examined 72,314 pediatric cases, COVID-19 was found in only 1% of children under the age of 10 (7), and in another survey that examined 2,135 pediatric cases, the median age for COVID-19 was 19 will definitely be 7 years (9). In a study of 11,535 pediatric cases conducted in Turkey, the median age of COVID-19 was found to be 8 years. In the present study, the median age for COVID-19 was determined as 17 (IQR 3), while the mean age of influenza-positive pediatric cases was 5 years. In 2019–2020 influenza season, the mean age for influenza was found as 3.91 ± 3.3 (10), and in yet another study, the median age was found as 6.2 years (11). The difference found in the age group distributions of children in regard to COVID-19 and influenza in the present study and in the literature can help us make a simple distinction between influenza and COVID-19 in this period when the influenza season is approaching. Data on children with COVID-19 show that it does not result in abnormal red blood cell (RBC) counts and hemoglobin (Hb) levels (12–15) and that anemia is prevalent in children with Kawasaki or related diseases (16). This is in contrast to previous studies and can be interpreted for a variety of reasons. When compared to influenza cases in our study, it was observed that RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC levels of COVID-19 patients were statistically significantly higher than those of the influenza cases. Starting in the respiratory tract, COVID-19 disease can affect numerous systems, including the hematopoietic system. It is known that changes in hematological parameters in particular affect the severity and course of the disease. There is a wealth of evidence showing that platelet counts decrease, notoriously in severe cases (17). The evaluation included a comparison between the results of this investigation and published work. It was found that many hematological parameters, especially PLT, WBC, RBC, Hb, and RDW, have changed significantly and that influenza infection has triggered an increased neutrophil count and decreased lymphocyte count (18, 19). The reason that the hemoglobin and MCV values of the COVID-19 patients included in the present study are statistically different from those of the influenza patients could be due to the higher median age of the COVID-19 patients. While the laboratory abnormalities most commonly reported in the literature are lymphopenia, eosinopenia, monocytosis, and high CRP levels (20), eosinophil and monocyte counts were quite high in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza patients in our study, particularly those Threat of COVID-19 increased 10,708-fold when eosinophil count increased and 1,591-fold when monocyte count increased. We may not be able to illustrate how a rationale for the high frequency of eosinophils in our COVID-19 patients was found, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is directly or indirectly responsible for eosinophils as a result of infection or recovery is responsible. Increases in neutrophil, lymphocyte, and neutrophil/lymphocyte rates have been reported in studies conducted on children with COVID-19 and healthy children (21). A notable feature of this research was the observation that eosinophil and monocyte determinants were statistically significantly effective in COVID-19. We found that the threat of COVID-19 increased 1,484-fold with age, 10,708-fold with increasing eosinophil count, and 1,591-fold with increasing monocyte count. In a study conducted on adults, it was observed that eosinophil counts and rates were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with critical illness than in patients with moderate and severe illness (22). In the identical study, it was shown that eosinophil counts and rates were significantly and inversely correlated with markers of infection; That is, as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PRO), and ferritin (FER) increased, eosinophil levels decreased and the progressive reduction in eosinophil counts and rates worsened the viral infection (22). Eosinopenia was noted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in early publications on COVID-19 relevant studies and this scenario has been associated with the intensity of infection or a poor prognosis (23–28). According to the literature, although abnormal and large macrophage inflammation was found in lung biopsies and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) samples from COVID-19 patients, eosinophils were absent, and thus it is complicated to say that eosinophils are a specific finding of COVID-19 infection (29–31). However, the fact that eosinophil levels were restored in patients prior to discharge suggests that this scenario may be indicative of restoration of clinical criteria of eosinophil resolution (32). Studies conducted have shown that eosinophils in the airways were subject to rapid viral clearance in allergy and influenza infection, that eosinophils in particular played a role in anti-influenza immunity, and that they provided protection against airway damage (32, 33). In addition, an increase in serum IL-5 levels and peripheral eosinophilia was found in the pediatric population with acute pneumonia relevant to influenza viruses (34). It is not known if eosinophilia is an indicator of an excessive immune response or if it is a rare immune response that occurs during an infection-induced cytokine storm. A very high frequency of eosinophilia is uncommon in non-COVID-19 patients, and such a high incidence has never been documented in other viral infections such as influenza (35). One of the very important variations in the difference between COVID-19 and influenza defined in our study was the significantly increased monocyte count in COVID-19 cases compared to children with influenza infection. In a study by Tiwari et al. (36) the monocyte count was normal in 81.8% of pediatric cases, while mild monocytosis was observed in only 18.2% of cases. There is partial information showing monocytosis in pediatric cases. On the other hand, in a study by Henry et al. (37) 3,377 adult patients were shown to have reduced monocyte counts with COVID-19 infection, and Xiong et al. (38) reported monocytosis in children with asymptomatic COVID-19 compared to children with symptomatic COVID-19. In a cohort study, in peripheral blood smear of children with COVID-19, 36.7% of neutrophils showed hypergranulation/lobulation abnormality and 13.3% of monocytes showed vacuole defects compared to COVID-19 negative cases (39). Laboratory markers for COVID-19 are not specific and their use in clinical practice is limited. Many studies have been published that identify poor prognosis with relevant lymphopenia and hypercoagulability in adults with severe disease (40). However, pediatric studies are still at a limited level. The performance of monocytes and eosinophils in predicting COVID-19 infection was assessed in this study for the first time by Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC) analysis. According to the ROC analysis performed, the area under the curve (AUC) value for monocytes was 0.990. According to the cutoff point >1.50, the sensitivity value was 98.4% and the specificity value was 97.0%. The AUC value for eosinophils was 0.989. According to the cutoff point >0.02, the sensitivity value was determined as 99.2% and the specificity value as 93.1%. Limitations of the study, the study had a limited number of participants, with a sample size of 231. Studies with larger sample sizes would provide more reliable results. The study was conducted at a single children’s outpatient clinic. Multi-center studies including children from different regions and healthcare facilities would allow for better generalizability. By addressing these limitations and implementing the suggested recommendations, future studies can contribute to a better understanding of differentiating between COVID-19 and influenza in children and improve diagnostic capabilities in clinical practice. Conclusion It is believed that this distinction can be considered an important laboratory marker when the upcoming influenza season and the potential for a recent peak in COVID-19 are taken into account. Additionally, it is expected that as the number of children tested for COVID-19 increases, the difference between the determinants of both infections will become clearer. Future research in this specific area can focus on addressing these limitations and exploring additional aspects; Comparison of the performance and sensitivity of different COVID-19 test methods, such as PCR, rapid antigen tests, and serological tests, in pediatric populations. Longitudinal studies to track the progression and outcomes of influenza and COVID-19 in children over time, considering factors such as age, underlying medical conditions, and vaccination status. Exploration of potential biomarkers or additional laboratory markers that can aid in distinguishing between influenza and COVID-19 infections in children.

ByNicole LeonardJuly 13, 2024 FILE - A line of Holstein dairy cows feed through a fence at a dairy farm in Idaho on March 11, 2009. As of April 11, 2024, a strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 24 dairy cow herds in eight U.S. states: Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Idaho, Michigan and North Carolina and South Dakota. (AP Photo/Charlie Litchfield, File) From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know! Pennsylvania health officials are directing hospitals, health offices and medical providers to test sick patients for influenza throughout the summer beyond the typical winter season. Although flu activity in the Northeast dramatically drops in the warmer months, Pennsylvania Department of Health officials say they’re on the lookout for possible human infections related to an ongoing avian influenza outbreak in wild birds, poultry, and, more recently, dairy cattle. Four dairy farm workers in Michigan, Texas and Colorado who were exposed to infected cows have been diagnosed with the H5N1 strain of bird flu. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor While there have been no reports of bird flu in dairy cows or humans in Pennsylvania so far, public health officials are ramping up surveillance efforts and asking medical providers to test for the virus in people with respiratory illness this summer. Testing is especially recommended for patients who become severely sick, have been exposed to dairy cows, raw milk, wild birds and poultry, or have attended agricultural fairs, according to a statewide health advisory. Related Content Science Avian influenza could return to Pennsylvania by fall, despite recent drop in cases New cases of avian influenza haven’t been detected in Pa. for more than a month, but that doesn’t mean the threat to poultry and wild birds has passed. 2 years ago An avian influenza outbreak has been ongoing in the U.S. since 2022, affecting more than 99 million wild, commercial and backyard birds nationwide, including millions in Pennsylvania. The virus is often fatal for birds. Many commercial flocks are euthanized for public safety and to protect other nearby flocks from further spread. Bird flu was reported in other U.S. livestock animals like dairy cattle for the first time this past spring. While the virus does not seem to be as harmful to cows, food safety and public health experts are monitoring milk products. Federal officials said the risk of infection or health effects from bird flu remains low for people and maintain that the commercial milk supply is safe. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor In an effort to prevent Pennsylvania cattle herds from becoming infected, the state Department of Agriculture earlier this year ordered that cows coming into Pennsylvania from other states with outbreaks be tested first.

Continuous virus transmission and antigenic drift are difficult to control in enzootically infected pig herds. Here, antibody-positive piglets from a herd enzootically infected with swIAV H1N2 (clade 1 A.3.3.2) were immunized using a homologous prime-boost vaccination strategy with novel live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) based on a reassortment-incompetent bat influenza-swIAV chimera or a vesicular stomatitis virus-based replicon vaccine. Challenge infection of vaccinated piglets by exposure to H1N2 swIAV-infected unvaccinated seeder pigs showed that both LAIV and replicon vaccine markedly reduced virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively, compared to piglets immunized with commercial heterologous or autologous adjuvanted whole-inactivated virus vaccines. Our novel vaccines may aid in interrupting continuous IAV transmission chains in large enzootically infected pig herds, improve the health status of the animals, and reduce the risk of zoonotic swIAV transmission.

The hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes H1 or H3 and the neuraminidase (NA) subtypes N1 or N2 are prevailing in currently circulating swIAVs. For each of the HA subtypes, multiple viral lineages exist which are classified as avian (av or 1C), human (hu or 1B), or pandemic (pdm or 1A), depending on the initial host they were isolated from and their association with phylogenetic clades2. Human seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) are closely related to swIAVs. In fact, reciprocal transmissions across the porcine-human interface play a major role in expanding swIAV diversity in pig populations3 and, in turn, bear a pandemic threat to the human population4. Pigs are also susceptible to infection by IAV of avian origin and may serve as “mixing vessels” or intermediate influenza virus hosts, which may allow the reassortment of genome segments of avian, porcine, and human IAVs creating widespread prospects for zoonotic transmissions of reassorted viruses with unpredictable pandemic potential5. Pig multiplying and fattening infrastructures have been expanding considerably in size over the last 50 years. Sizable swine herds exceeding 3000 individuals, which feature high population turnover rates, are capable of maintaining enzootic, self-sustaining swIAV infections following virus incursions6. Indeed, for several years now, an enzootic form of influenza has been described in large pig herds, which insidiously and continuously compromises pig health7. These holdings also harbor a vast and complex reservoir of swIAV with herd-specific antigenicity, zoonotic, and even pre-pandemic potential in European, Asian, and American pig populations8,9,10,11,12.Currently, there are no legal requirements in Europe for the reporting of swIAV infections in pigs, and official, coordinated monitoring plans and control measures are mostly lacking. Apart from biosecurity measures and herd management, vaccination of sows using either commercial or autologous adjuvanted whole-inactivated vaccines (WIV) is frequently used to control swIAV infections. In addition, suckling piglets might receive a certain level of immune protection through the transfer of maternally derived antibodies (MDA)13. Yet, in pig holdings that are persistently affected by swIAV, MDA-positive piglets at a young age, and even neonates during their first week of life, have been found to function as asymptomatic amplifiers of swIAV although productive infection does not induce active humoral immunity measurable as an increase of specific antibodies in the presence of MDA1,14,15,16,17. Likewise, WIV-based induction of active swIAV immunity in piglets has been shown to be hampered by interference with MDA, and, as a result, commercially licensed WIV vaccines, in Europe, are only approved for use in pigs above 56 days of age1,18. MDA interference with vaccinations in neonates and very young mammals including pigs have tentatively been traced to increased immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells triggered by maternally derived IgG19 and to hampering B cell differentiation in germinal centers20. Commercial and autologous WIV are effective in reducing viral lung loads, shedding, and the severity of clinical signs21. Their efficacy, however, is increasingly compromised by expanding virus diversity and antigenic drift which is increasing in continuously infected large herds22,23,24. WIVs, in general, induce a highly strain-specific humoral immune response; adjuvants and frequent re-vaccinations may foster the breadth of antibody and T cell responses25. Nevertheless, updates of vaccine antigens may be required in order to cover the antigenic gaps to currently circulating field viruses21,26,27,28.New swIAV vaccine candidates and vaccination concepts have been developed with the aim to induce a generally broader immunity including a strong T cell response and mucosal defense mechanisms. Many attempts focused on live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV)29,30,31. These vaccines replicate in the host but without causing disease while mimicking natural infection, stimulating a comprehensive, robust, long-lasting and, ideally, cross-protective immunity that relies on humoral and cellular immune effectors in a systemic and/or mucosal fashion31. Recently, we have shown that chimeric bat-IAV that express both the HA and NA of the desired target IAV on the backbone of either H17- or H18-derived bat-IAV represent a promising approach as they replicate in a variety of avian and mammalian hosts following intranasal inoculation. Due to incompatibilities of the bat-IAV genome segment ends, reassortment with other mammalian and avian IAV is blocked, thus, preventing reversion of virulence due to reassortment32,33,34,35.An alternative strategy employs RNA replicon particle vaccines based on propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors36. Due to the affinity of the VSV glycoprotein (G) for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, it is able to infect and replicate in a variety of tissues, thereby eliciting strong humoral and cellular immune responses37. Recent other studies have shown that a propagation-incompetent VSV vector encoding HA H7 or H5 protects chickens from challenge infection with HPAIV of subtype H7 or H538,39,40.The present study investigates the efficacy of replicon and chimeric bat-IAV vaccines matched to a homologous swIAV isolate in a prime-boost vaccination-challenge setting in young piglets from an enzootically swIAV-infected pig farm. Results are compared to age-matched syntopic piglet groups vaccinated with a commercially available heterologous or an autologous WIV.ResultsCase settingA conventional indoor piglet production farm in Western Germany of approximately 700 sows had previously been diagnosed with enzootic swIAV infections of the H1pdmN2 lineage; respiratory disease associated with continuous detection of subtype H1pdmN2 infections has been smoldering for more than one year. Piglets are produced in a 3-week batch farrowing rhythm and all sows are quarterly vaccinated against swIAV with the commercial WIV vaccines Respiporc® FLU3 and Respiporc® FLUpan H1N1 (Ceva Santé Animale, Libourne, France). In the frame of a longitudinal study in this persistently infected swine holding, a number of swIAV-positive swabs have been obtained and used for full-genome sequencing and virus isolation. The H1pdmN2 virus isolates AI03362, belonging to clade 1A.3.3.2/pdm (II-like), was dominating in this holding for several months. This strain was obtained, passaged twice in swine testicle (ST) cells, fully sequenced (accession number EPI_ISL_17646249), and titrated on MDCK II cells. This isolate was used for the generation of VSV replicon and bat-flu chimera LAIVs, autologous WIV, and also as a challenge virus.Selection, design, and application of vaccinesIn the affected holding, routine sow vaccination alone was not sufficient to interrupt continuous swIAV circulation. In order to enhance the immunity of the pigs and to silence a potentially important swIAV amplification reservoir, we pursued to induce protection in piglets from an early age on. Therefore, we designed two vaccines based on the HA and NA sequences of the H1pdmN2 AI03362 virus isolate. (i) VSV replicon vaccine: The HA and NA open reading frames were separately inserted into the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genome thereby replacing the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene. The resulting vector vaccine candidates VSVΔG(H1) and VSVΔG(N2) were propagated on helper cells providing the VSV G protein in trans. (ii) The LAIV bat-IAV carried the same HA and NA sequences in a single chimeric virus; it was successfully rescued, plaque-purified, and propagated on MDCK cells.In addition, two WIV approaches were selected. First, a combination of two commercial products registered by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), a trivalent heterologous vaccine (Respiporc FLU3, Ceva Santé Animale, Libourne, France), containing antigens of H1avN1 (clade 1C), H1huN2 (clade 1B) and H3N2, and a monovalent vaccine (Respiporc FLUpan H1N1, Ceva Santé Animale, Libourne, France) containing H1pdmN1 (clade 1A) were used simultaneously in an off-label fashion, i.e., before day 56 of life. Furthermore, an autologous WIV was produced according to good manufacturing practise (GMP) conditions featuring the abovementioned homologous H1pdmN2 isolate. The autologous vaccine was designed for a dosage of 1 ml/animal containing >256 hemagglutination units/ml (HAU/ml) before inactivation. A polymer was used as an adjuvant (Ictyolane 50®, IctyoDev, France). Under the same conditions, a polymer-adjuvanted mock vaccine was produced using the cell-culture supernatant of uninfected ST cells.A prime-boost vaccination scheme was applied starting at 35 days of age for all vaccines (Fig. 1). The booster vaccination was given at 56 days of age and the challenge infection at 63 days of age. Except for the bat-IAV chimeric vaccine, which was applied intranasally using a mucosal atomization device (Wolfe Tory Medical, USA) all other vaccines were injected intramuscularly into the neck at the highest point of the ear base. None of the vaccines induced adverse reactions at the local injection site or after nasal application (bat-IAV chimera) nor any clinical signs in the follow-up. Body temperature remained normal in all piglets prior to challenge infection (not shown).Fig. 1: Experimental study design.Pigs were vaccinated twice at 35 and 56 days of age (doa), respectively, and challenged at 63 doa. Challenge was performed by direct contact with two non-vaccinated, age-matched syntopic seeder pigs (shown in red) per group which had been inoculated intranasally with swIAV isolate H1pdmN2 (AI03362) using a dose of 106 TCID50 per animal at 61 doa. One seeder animal and four vaccinees per group were sacrificed for necropsy at day 4 post contact challenge (dpc). The remaining animals were kept until 14 dpc. Blood samples and nasal swabs were taken as indicated by the symbols. This figure was created with BioRender.com and licensed by the company under agreement number CL26YA977R.Full size imageDirect contact with infected seeder pigs ensured efficient viral transmission to vaccinees and controlsTo mimic realistic virus transmission scenarios in pig holdings, 7 days after the booster immunization vaccinees were exposed to non-vaccinated pigs which had been individually inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of swIAV isolate AI03362 of subtype H1pdmN2. These so-called “seeder pigs” developed a highly productive swIAV infection as shown by virus excretion patterns in nasal swabs (Fig. 2A). Viral RNA excretion in the seeder pigs subsided at about day 7 post-inoculation (dpi). At 2 dpi when virus excretion peaked, two seeders were assigned to each of the five vaccine groups. Judging from the fairly homogenous viral RNA loads nasally excreted by the seeders during 1–4 dpi, it can be assumed that virus exposure of the vaccinees by contact with seeders was reasonably similar across the groups. In the immunized contact animals, productive swIAV infection developed from day 2 post contact challenge (dpc) as seen by nasal excretion dynamics of viral RNA (Fig. 2B). Some animals even revealed viral RNA on 1 dpc. No clinical signs of disease attributable to H1pdmN2 infection were recorded in seeder pigs or vaccinated in-contact piglets including the mock-vaccinated group. Also, rectal temperatures remained fairly stable between 39-40°C throughout the observation period (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 2: Virus excretion in nasal swabs.Excretion of viral RNA is shown for A non-vaccinated seeder piglets that had been individually inoculated with swIAV isolate H1pdmN2 (AI03362) by the nasal route and B vaccinated piglets after contact exposure to seeders. Two seeder pigs each were assigned to eight vaccinees per group at 2 dpi; the color of the seeder pig pairs in A indicates to which vaccine group they were associated. Viral loads were measured by an M-specific RT-qPCR; Cq values are indicated on the Y-axis. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the median. Asterisks indicate highly significant differences (p < 0.01) of indicated group from Mock group (Supplementary Table 2; Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn–Bonferoni correction).Full size imageLAIV and VSV replicon vaccine efficiently reduced nasal excretion of viral RNABased on nasal virus excretion dynamics, measured by real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), all animals of the mock-vaccinated group developed a highly productive virus infection upon contact with seeder pigs. Compared to individually inoculated seeder pigs, the peak of virus excretion was delayed toward the end of the first week after contact. Clearance, however, was achieved rapidly during the second week of observation (Fig. 2B).The two WIV-vaccinated groups showed a nasal virus excretion course that was similar to the mock group until 5 dpc, but then virus shedding decreased more rapidly compared to the mock group. In contrast, nasal excretion of viral RNA in the LAIV and VSV replicon-vaccinated groups was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) by up to 10 Cq values (representing 3 orders of magnitude) at dpc 2–4 compared to all other groups. The group which had received the bat-IAV chimeric vaccine revealed the lowest excretion peaks and cleared the virus rapidly from 4 dpc onwards (Fig. 2B).Efficient inhibition of virus spread to lower respiratory tract tissues by VSV replicon vaccinesFour vaccinated and one seeder pig in each group were sacrificed at 4 dpc to examine the within-host spread of the challenge virus in tissues of the respiratory tract. On that day, all vaccines still showed nasal virus excretion (Figs. 2B, 3A). Analysis of the tissues of the upper respiratory tract tissue demonstrated lower nasal viral RNA loads in the conchae of both the bat-flu vaccine and VSV replicon groups (Fig. 3A). Viral RNA loads in tissues of the lower respiratory tract comprising trachea, the bronchial lumen (swab inserted into all large bronchial branches of the right lung lobe), lung tissues of three different lobar locations (n = 12 samples per group, left and right lung) and a bronchial lymph node mainly mirrored the results for the upper respiratory tract tissues (Fig. 3B). The highest mean viral RNA loads were observed in bronchial swabs, indicating the superior suitability of this sample for probing the tributary system of the lung as a whole. Animals of the mock group consistently showed the highest viral loads together with pigs that had received the inactivated and adjuvanted vaccines. Significantly lower virus loads were measured in the VSV replicon-vaccinated group which even remained completely negative in lung tissues (p < 0.001). Lower viral loads were also measured for the chimeric bat-flu vaccine group and for the autologous vaccine group, but only in lung and lymph node tissues. Values of the commercial multivalent WIV-vaccinated group remained indistinguishable from the mock-vaccinated one.Fig. 3: Nasal viral RNA excretion and spread of challenge virus RNA in tissues of the respiratory tract of four vaccinated piglets sacrificed at day 4 post contact challenge (dpc) with swIAV isolate H1pdmN2 (AI03362).Viral loads were measured by an M-specific RT-qPCR; Cq values are indicated on the Y-axis. A Upper respiratory tract; B Lower respiratory tract. Nasal swabs were obtained from all vaccinated group members at 4 dpc (n = 8); three separate lung locations were sampled per group member (i.e., a total of n = 12 per group). Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the median. Asterisks indicate highly significant differences (p < 0.01) of indicated group from Mock group (Supplementary Table 2; Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn–Bonferoni correction).Full size imageImmunohistochemistry largely mirrored the reduced spread of the challenge virus in respiratory tract tissues of LAIV and replicon vaccine compared to WIV-vaccinated pigletsThe extent of pulmonary atelectasis was documented for each lung lobe at 4 dpc (Supplementary Table 1). Macroscopically visible atelectases were found in 3 out of 5 seeder pigs and one bat-IAV vaccinated contact animal. The right middle lobe was consistently affected in these pigs. The changes rarely exceeded 5% per lobe, only one seeder showed 30% atelectasis.For immunohistochemistry, the nose, trachea, and three different areas of the lung were tested for the presence of the IAV matrix-1 protein. Based on RT-qPCR results, two animals with the highest viral loads in the lungs (mock, commercial multivalent WIV, autologous WIV, bat-IAV, VSV replicon), trachea or nose were selected from each group. Viral antigen was detected in all groups at variable levels. The nose and trachea were positive in all vaccinated piglets except for the VSV replicon group. Compared to that, antigen detection in the lungs differed. While viral antigen was largely absent in the lungs in the VSV replicon and autologous group, it could be detected in varying amounts in bronchial respiratory epithelial cells in at least one lung sample in the other vaccine groups. In more detail, in the bat LAIV-vaccinated animals, antigen was detected less abundantly (oligofocal) compared to the commercially multivalent WIV-vaccinated pigs or the mock group (multifocal). Histopathological results are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 2.Antibody kinetics reflect constant decay of MDA during the vaccination phase and anamnestic responses following the challengeSerum samples were examined by a generic blocking ELISA targeting the NP antigen and by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using antigen of the H1pdmN2 isolate AI03362. As shown in Fig. 4a, all piglets had NP-specific antibodies at 28 days of age when the first sample was obtained (d0). These titers declined continuously during the vaccination phase which was most evident in the mock and VSV replicon groups (since these animals received vaccines lacking the swIAV NP antigen). In the other vaccine groups, a clear-cut serological NP response following vaccination until day 27 post vaccination (27 dpv) was not evident although in the bat-flu vaccine group NP antibodies remained at a slightly elevated level. Following contact exposure onwards from 63 days of age an exponential increase of NP-specific antibodies was evident in the groups that had been immunized with WIV (Fig. 4A). In other groups, single animals seroconverted as indicated by ELISA while the median value of NP antibodies decreased further in the VSV-immunized pigs, in line with the observation that challenge virus replication was efficiently inhibited by this vaccine.Fig. 4: Influenza A virus-specific serologic immune responses.Measurements were achieved by A a nucleoprotein-specific indirect ELISA (ID-VET NP) and B by a hemagglutination inhibition assay using the swIAV H1pdmN2 isolate AI03362 as antigen. A - S/P value >0.4 is regarded as positive (dashed line), B – Titers of 3 log2 (1:20) are considered specifically positive. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the median. d0 – Serum sample obtained at day 28 of age before vaccination at day 35; 20, 27 dpv - 3 weeks after first and 1 week after booster vaccination; 4, 7, 14 dpc – days post contact challenge (1 week after the booster vaccination). Dashed line – A threshold of S/P value = 0.4, B threshold of 1:20 (log2 4,3).Full size imageA comparable picture emerged when examining the same sera by homologous HI assays (Fig. 4B). Median titers of HI antibodies decreased continuously until contact exposure. The exception are animals of the bat-IAV and replicon vaccine groups in which median titers stayed elevated. A steep increase in HI titers was evident by the end of the challenge phase (14 dpc); the exponential increase was most prominent in the bat-IAV and replicon groups but less pronounced in the two WIV groups.DiscussionVaccination remains the main tool to combat swIAV infections in pigs. Here we compared the efficacy of two WIVs with a bat flu-based LAIV and a VSV replicon vaccine in an experimental setting with piglets from the same enzootically infected pig holding and a challenge virus that has been isolated from that holding. If commercial farms vaccinate against swIAV at all, it is usually only the sows, and WIV are being used. This vaccination concept at least accomplishes the protection of sows against swIAV-related disease. While early clinical protection of piglets is achieved by WIVs, due to interference with MDA infection and shedding are not prevented1,17. Sufficient herd immunity to suppress enzootic swIAV infections yet is unlikely to be generated when vaccinating just a small sector, i.e. the sows, of the herds’ population. All swIAV vaccines currently commercially available on the European market are WIV-based. Inactivated vaccines face problems in inducing broadly protective and sustained immunity as described for human seasonal influenza vaccines. Although adjuvants in swIAV vaccines for pigs, in contrast to human seasonal subunit vaccines, have a beneficial effect in broadening protection16, novel swIAV variants are constantly emerging in the field, and enzootically infected pig holdings accelerate this risk22,41. The ultimate goal of this study, therefore, was to test the vaccines´ efficacy in piglets despite the presence of specific antibodies.As piglets constitute an important driver of sustained swIAV circulation in large holdings, we primarily aimed at this age class. Antibodies detected here in piglets most likely had a maternal origin as they rapidly declined over time, which is not expected of an actively acquired antibody response; this effect was most evident in the NP-specific ELISA in piglets receiving vaccines that did not contain NP (LAIV bat-flu and VSV replicon). Although MDAs provide clinical protection, even newborn piglets with high MDA activity are not reliably protected against infection and even represent an important amplifying host for swIAV in the herd1,17,42. Improved, and above all, actively acquired immunity in the age group of young piglets, therefore, appears desirable in order to interrupt continuous virus circulation in large herds. Yet, interference with maternally transmitted immunity poses a major obstacle when trying to induce active immunity against swIAV in very young piglets43. WIVs appear to be particularly prone to this interference, as shown previously44,45. Recent data suggested that single-dose WIV vaccination of young piglets may even foster sustained swIAV circulation in large holdings46. In addition, the role of antigenic mismatches between WIV vaccines and the circulating viruses remains to be determined: In the United States, but not in Europe, even vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease in weaned piglets with MDA has been observed upon heterologous challenge47.Since serological options are insufficient to define protection, the challenge test remains the best possible alternative to test for the presence and resilience of vaccine-induced immunity in MDA-positive piglets. In general, it has been proven to be difficult to develop a challenge model for swIAV that can essentially be based on a clinical readout. Only highly artificial systems, such as the deep intratracheal application of a high-titer challenge virus suspension or the flooding of aerosol chambers with high-titer virus aerosols yielded clinically interpretable results for some virus strains48,49. Yet, the intranasal application of high-titer virus suspensions routinely used in previous studies still represents an artificial system that potentially skews the natural way of infection. To overcome this obstacle, infected seeder pigs have been successfully used to mimic natural infection routes in challenge experiments45,50,51, and seeder pigs have been employed for the current study. Although this approach is associated with an increased risk of uneven and quantitatively undefined virus exposure52, nasal virus excretion dynamics of our challenge control group clearly indicated that all animals exposed to seeder pigs became infected simultaneously and developed a productive infection with seroconversion rates that were indistinguishable from those of intranasally inoculated seeders (Figs. 2, 3). Similar patterns were observed in the vaccinated animal groups, in particular those which were not adequately protected. As parallel, longitudinal studies in this specific pig herd showed a cluster of natural swIAV infection in piglets aged 4–8 weeks53, we attempted to recreate this situation in the herd as closely as possible and exposed the animals to a challenge at 7-8 weeks of age even at the risk that the short 7 days interval since the booster vaccination could have resulted in a still suboptimal immune response. An alternative to the short interval until the challenge would have been an earlier start of the vaccination scheme. However, piglets were not weaned before 28 days of age and application in the field (i.e., the holding of origin) of vaccines containing unlicensed replication-competent genetically modified organisms (i.e., the chimeric bat virus and the VSV replicon) is prohibited by the German genetic engineering law.Although piglets were used that had been raised until weaning in a commercial swine herd, i.e., did not have SPF status, hardly any clinically measurable changes were induced by the H1pdmN2 challenge. This also applies to the macroscopic findings, based on the fact that even not all of the seeder animals and the mock-vaccinated control group showed lesions in the lungs. Thus, protective effects had to be assessed by measuring viral RNA loads in nasal swabs and in organs of the respiratory tract.Virus loads measured here show that none of the vaccines used were capable of inducing sterile immunity in the individual animal; in contrast, each vaccine remained susceptible to some degree to infection and (limited) virus replication following seeder pig exposure. This could, in part, be due to the early challenge date just one week following the second vaccination. At that time, serological responses of the vaccinees did not show a clear booster effect (Fig. 4). However, this may be in part also related to the presence of MDA and their interference at least during primary vaccination. Compared to WIVs, LAIV can offer enhanced protection as it imitates natural infection, is administered intranasally, infects the upper respiratory tract, and stimulates both humoral and cell-mediated immunity54. As an advantage of the intranasal application of LAIV the induction of mucosa-associated specific immunity is mentioned in first place55,56,57,58. Their effectors are expected to act in the sense of an immune exclusion by immediately neutralizing or at least limiting the replication and spread of incoming pathogens. In this study, we did not investigate the presence of mucosa-based H1N2-specific antibodies (i.e., IgA) or of tissue-resident T cell populations as the amount of putative mucosal immunity would not have had an influence on the dose of challenge virus to which pigs were exposed. Instead, we put the focus on the aspect of comparing the overall efficacy of different vaccines in preventing virus excretion. In terms of reduction of nasal virus excretion the effect of the bat-IAV vaccine, which was the only intranasally applied vaccine in our study, was striking and unsurpassed by any other vaccine (Fig. 2B). This likely indicates effects of mucosal immunity as shown for other bat-IAV chimeras30. Nevertheless, virus replication was not fully abrogated even after homologous challenge and, therefore, increased excretion levels must be expected following heterologous challenge. It remains to be determined if the chimeric bat-IAV is replicating sufficiently or whether it is over-attenuated29.The intramuscular immunization of piglets with the VSV replicon vaccine also led to significantly reduced replication of swIAV in the upper respiratory tract (Fig. 3A), with consequent reduced nasal excretion of swIAV (Fig. 2B). However, the most impressive effect by vaccination with the replicon vaccine was the drastically reduced virus replication in the lower respiratory tract to almost undetectable levels (Fig. 3B), even though a single cell of one lung sample was found to be antigen positive in immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Table 2B). Numbers of animals and samples are limited and tissue locations are not fully congruent between IHC and RT-qPCR samples. This may account for observed differences in lung tissue samples of the autologous and the replicon groups. As both techniques represent different perspectives, it still can be concluded that the viral load found either via RT-qPCR or IHC in the lungs is close to the detection limits of either method.The VSV replicon vaccine was the only vaccine tested that induced significant levels of hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) serum antibodies at 27 days post vaccination (Fig. 4B). As serum IgG can be secreted into the respiratory tract, in particular into the lung tissue59, these antibodies may explain in part the protective features of this vaccine. Furthermore, the VSVΔG(N2) component of the vaccine may have also contributed to protection. We did not investigate the level of sialidase-inhibitory antibodies induced here, however, our previous studies have shown that VSV replicon-driven expression of NA antigen alone can protect animals from IAV infection38,60. Finally, VSV replicons were previously shown to induce specific T cell immune responses in vaccinated pigs, which may also contribute to protection and virus clearance36. It would be interesting to assess the use of combined simultaneous or consecutive use of the VSV replicon and the LAIV bat-IAV evaluated here. Such concepts could even be instrumental when attempting to broaden cross-protective immunity by heterologous prime-boost strategies as recently suggested for WIVs61,62,63.Regarding the putative impact of the antigenic match between vaccine and field virus strains, here only the two WIV vaccines can be compared which differed in this parameter. The autologous WIV based on the homologous antigen presented with advantages over the commercial heterologous WIV as far as reduction of challenge virus in deeper tissues of the respiratory tract was concerned (Fig. 3B). Compared to the Mock group, both WIVs shortened the time period of nasal virus excretion with similar efficacy which, nevertheless, was inferior to the effects of the replication vaccines (Fig. 2B).In conclusion, the present vaccination trial hints at a superior efficacy of bat-flu LAIV and VSV swIAV vaccines in reducing nasal virus excretion and, in particular for the replicon vaccine, limiting spread of challenge virus to lower respiratory tissues in young piglets with MDAs.These findings highlight the potential of LAIV and multiplication-incompetent replicon vaccines as a valuable tool for controlling and preventing swIAV outbreaks in pig populations, ultimately contributing to the overall health and productivity of the swine industry as well as to the “One Health” approach. Nevertheless, LAIV and RNA replicon vaccines might also require regular updates to closely match the antigens of circulating viruses. In this respect, replicon technology may prove more flexible and is affected with fewer biosafety concerns compared to bat-IAV chimeras. However, there is currently no evidence that the replacement of HA/NA in bat-associated influenza A viruses of subtype H17N10 could significantly increase the risk potential of these viruses (assuming that only HAs expressing a trypsin-sensitive cleavage site are used). Previous studies demonstrated that natural bat-IAV infections have not yet been associated with pathogenicity for humans, non-bat mammals, or other species. The distinctive advantage of bat chimeric influenza viruses is that reassortment with influenza viruses of birds and non-bat mammals is blocked, thereby preventing reversion to virulence. Another advantage of the VSV replicon vaccines is their efficacy in the presence of IAV-specific MDA, as infection by the replicon particles is mediated by the VSV G protein and not by the IAV envelope glycoproteins. A disadvantage of the replicon particles used here is that they have to be applied by injection, while a nasal/oral form of application would be ideal from an immunological perspective. From a practical point of view, individual nasal vaccine applications in the field are feasible in week-old piglets, but become challenging already in 3-week-old ones and virtually impracticable in elder pigs. Therefore, further studies are warranted also to (i) assess the long-term efficacy and safety of these vaccines in the field, (ii) compare new vaccination schemes including cross-boostering to broaden protection to heterologous virus strains, and (iii) consider adapted vaccination strategies in continuously infected holdings: Instead of vaccinating sows only, at least for some period of time, efficient vaccination of all piglets born using replication-competent vaccines might be essential to build up resilient and high-level population immunity to interrupt continuous swIAV transmission chains.MethodsSwine influenza A virusThe virus strain A/swine/Germany/2022AI03362/2022 (abbr. AI03362) of subtype H1pdmN2 has been isolated from a nasal swab of a piglet at an enzootically infected German swine herd in western Germany using a swine testicle (ST) cell line as previously described64. Following two further passages in ST cell cultures, the stock virus was generated, titrated, and kept until −80 °C until further use. The stock virus was fully sequenced (accession number EPI_ISL_17646249) and HA genotyping as clade 1A.3.3.2/pdm (II-like) confirmed. Virus titration was performed in MDCK II cells. Permission for repeated sampling in the holding was granted by an independent ethical committee (project 33.19-42502-04-22-00225).VaccinesBased on the stock virus material itself or on the genome sequences obtained from it, replication-competent experimental vaccines were produced:VSV repliconsRecombinant VSV replicons expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) of AI03362 were generated according to a previously published procedure40. Recombinant VSV replicons were approved by the Swiss Genetic Engineering Authority under license number A202815-00 and reported to the State Office for Health and Social Affairs of Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania, Germany. The recombinant VSVΔG-H1 and VSVΔG-N2 vectors were propagated on a complementing helper cell line (BHK-G43)65. The cell culture supernatant was collected at 24 h pi and cleared by low-speed centrifugation. The virus replicon particles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (105,000×g, 60 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. For determination of the infectious virus titer, an aliquot was thawed and titrated on BHK-21 cells as described40.Bat influenza chimeric virusThe chimeric bat influenza virus was approved by the Regional Council of Baden-Württemberg, Germany (license number SSI2-UNI.FRK.05.23/05.18/05.22.) and the State Office for Health and Social Affairs of Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania, Germany (LAGuS3021_4/11.5.17), and was generated as described previously33,66,67. Briefly, the HA coding region of swIAV AI03362 was flanked at the 3′- and 5′-terminal ends by the putative cis-acting terminal packaging sequences from A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/164/2009 (H17N10) (nucleotides 1 to 131 for the 3′ noncoding region and nucleotides 1621 to 1784 for the 5′ noncoding region). Similarly, the NA coding region of swIAV AI03362 was flanked by the putative cis-acting terminal packaging sequences from H17N10 at the 3′ and 5′ ends (nucleotides 1 to 122 for the 3′ noncoding region and nucleotides 1254 to 1390 for the 5′ noncoding region). To prevent premature protein synthesis, all ATG start codons located within the putative terminal packaging sequences were mutated to AAG. The six internal gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) were from A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/153/2009 (H17N10) (GenBank accession numbers CY103873, CY103874, CY103877, CY103875 [PAS550R], CY103880, and CY103879 [M1D156N and M2N31S;T70A]). The recombinant bat influenza chimera was plaque-purified on MDCK II cells and then used for stock generation. At 48 h post infection virus supernatants were collected and stock titers were determined via a plaque assay on MDCK II cells. Two bat-IAV chimera stocks were generated reaching titers of 3.8 × 107 PFU/mL (stock 1) and 8×106 PFU/mL (stock 2). Importantly, these stock titers were comparable to that of the parental swIAV on MDCK II cells (data not shown).Monovalent autologous inactivated and adjuvanted whole virus vaccineThe autologous vaccine was produced as an inactivated whole virus vaccine, containing the homologous H1pdmN2 isolate AI03362. The autologous vaccine was designed for a dosage of 1 ml/animal. The virus concentration before inactivation is >256 HAU/ml. A polymer was used as adjuvant (Ictyolane 50®, IctyoDev, France). A polymer-adjuvanted mock vaccine based on the supernatant of uninfected ST cell cultures was produced under the same conditions.Multivalent heterologous inactivated and adjuvanted whole virus vaccineThe commercial licensed vaccines used were the trivalent Respiporc FLU3 containing antigens of the subtypes H1huN2 (A/swine/Bakum/1832/2000), H3N2 (A/sw/Bakum/IDT1769/2003) and H1avN1 (A/swine/Haseluenne/IDT2617/2003) as well as the monovalent Respiporc FLUpan H1N1 containing the subtype H1pdmN1 (A/swine/A/Jena/VI5258/2009). These were provided by the producer, Ceva Santé Animale, Libourne, France.Animal experimentsEthics statementThe animal experiments were approved by an ethics committee at the State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fishery of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany by license LALFF M-V 7221.3-1-001/23. Animal numbers followed the specifications of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur., Monograph on Porcine Influenza Vaccine (inactivated; 01/2017:0963) where possible.Animals (origin)A total of 50 German landrace weaner pigs at 28 days of age were obtained from the enzootically infected pig holding in Lower Saxony, Germany, that yielded virus isolate AI03362. All purchased pigs tested negative in nasal swabs for swIAV RNA by RT-qPCR at 28 days of age at the holding and after arrival at the FLI at 35 days of age (prior to vaccination). Longitudinal studies in this pig holding gave evidence that the earliest time point of swIAV infections in piglets was at 4 weeks of age (Supplementary Table 3)53. Thus, productive swIAV infections should have been detectable but were excluded here. IAV nucleocapsid protein-specific antibodies in serum by ELISA (ID Screen® Influenza A Nucleoprotein Swine Indirect, IDVET, Germany) gave positive results for all piglets. As infections with both Porcine Circovirus-2 (PCV2) and Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) potentially exert immunosuppressive effects and might, therefore, influence the outcome of swIAV vaccination and challenge, nasal swabs and serum samples were investigated in RT-qPCRs to exclude the presence of both pathogens68,69. In none of the animals either PCV2 or PRRSV has been detected in samples at 28 days of age. After that date, the animals were reared at FLI’s BSL2 or BSL3 (bat-IAV chimeric vaccine group only) stable environments.Experimental vaccination and challengeFive groups of eight piglets each were assembled randomly and assigned to separate stable units. Eight additional pigs received no treatments and were kept separate from group 6. The animals were vaccinated according to Table 1. At day 35 of life, groups 2–5 received a different vaccine and group 1 was sham-vaccinated (control group). Group 4 received the bat-flu chimeric virus at a dose of 106 TCID50/ml intranasally using a mucosal atomization device (Wolfe Tory Medical, USA); this group was the only one kept at BSL3 stable facilities. Groups 1–3 and 5 were vaccinated by intramuscular injection of the indicated dose/volume into the upper neck region (Table 1). Animals of group 5 were immunized by separate injection of the VSVΔ-H1 and VSVΔ-N2 replicon particles into the neck muscle (2 ml of each replicon, 108 ffu/ml). The VSV replicon vaccine was used without adjuvant. Group 1 was used as control and received a vaccine similar to the autologous WIV but lacking the viral antigens. At day 56 of age, a booster application of the same vaccines was given to groups 1–5. Seven days later, i.e., at day 63 of age, pigs were exposed to the challenge virus AI03362 (H1pdmN2) isolated from the holding of origin of the piglets. In order to mimic natural infection, a contact challenge model was used. To this end, ten “seeder piglets” of the same age and origin (group 6) were individually inoculated intranasally at 61 days of age with 106 TCID50 of isolate AI03362 in 1 ml cell culture supernatant using a mucosal atomization device. After 48 h, each group of vaccinated piglets were exposed to two seeder pigs to initiate natural infection by contacts or aerosol. This day was counted as day 1 of contact (doc). At 4 days post contact challenge (dpc), four inoculated pigs and one seeder pig per group were humanely euthanized, followed by exsanguination, followed by dissection of the respiratory tract. At 14 dpc, all remaining animals were autopsied. The study design is summarized in Fig. 1.Table 1 Vaccinated groups (1–5) of piglets derived from an enzootically infected herd and challenged by exposure to seeder pigs infected with swIAV isolate H1pdmN2 (AI03362)Full size tableClinical observation and postmortem samplingClinical scores (according to parameters detailed in the Supplementary Information file) and body temperature measurements were recorded daily throughout the observation period. During post mortems, a bronchial swab of all large bronchi of the right lung and tissue samples of nasal conchae, trachea, and three lung areas (cranial and caudal part of left cranial lobe, left medial lobe), and a tracheobronchial lymph node were collected to determine viral load by RT-qPCR.Virological testingNasal swabs were taken at the indicated time points (Fig. 1) and placed into 2 ml tubes containing 1 ml of Eagle’s Minimal Essential cell culture medium (EMEM) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (sample medium). Swab samples were vortexed and centrifuged to remove debris. Tissue samples were collected from all pigs at the postmortem stage, placed in 2 ml tubes with 1 ml sample medium, and homogenized by using a 5 mm thick steel ball and a TissueLyser. The material was then centrifuged, and the supernatants were aliquoted. Automated RNA/DNA extraction was achieved with the King Fisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the NucleoMag® Vet Kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For initial IAV testing, all samples were analyzed in a modified generic Matrix RT-qPCR70. Samples yielding a cq value of ≤39.9 were considered IAV-positive. In addition to IAV testing, the presence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) as well as of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in nasal swabs and serum samples from day 0 prior to the vaccination were investigated in RT-qPCR assays. For PRRSV, a modified method based on a publication by Kleiboeker, Schommer, Lee, Watkins, Chittick, and Polson69 consisting of PCR systems for both the North American and the European genotypes was used. The detection of PCV2 was based on a publication by Brunborg, Moldal, and Jonassen68. All RT-qPCR’s reactions were prepared with the AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) by using a Biorad CFX96 Real-Time Cycler (Biorad, Germany). For the detection of PCV2, a DNA virus, the RT step was omitted.Serological testingBlood samples were collected at the indicated time points (Fig. 1) accessing the jugular vein. Blood was allowed to clot before centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, the serum then recovered, heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C and afterwards frozen at −20 °C until further use. Sera were first screened using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting generic antibodies against the nucleoprotein (NP) (ID Screen® Influenza A Nucleoprotein (NP), swine indirect ELISA; ID, Grabel, France). The cut-off values for sample to negative (S/N) ratios were interpreted as recommended by the manufacturer: S/N ≤ 0.4 negative; S/N ≥ 0.4 positive. In addition, all samples, after neuraminidase treatment, were further examined by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) using the AI03362 H1pdmN2 vaccination and challenge antigen as described elsewhere (WOAH, 2023).Histopathology and immunohistochemistryA full autopsy was performed on all animals under BSL2 or BSL3 conditions. The extent of pulmonary atelectasis was documented for each lung lobe (percentage of affected area). Tissue samples of nasal conchae, trachea, and three lung areas (cranial and caudal part of left cranial lobe, left middle lobe) were collected at 4 dpc and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. After trimming and paraffin embedding, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was applied to 2–3-μm-thick slices. As stated previously71, consecutive slides were treated for immunohistochemistry using the standardized avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The primary monoclonal antibody HB-64 targeting the M1 protein of IAV, diluted 1:200, was applied overnight at 4 °C (M21C64R3, ATCC, Manassas, VA). The secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, biotinylated; BA-9200-1.5, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), diluted 1:200, was applied for 30 min at room temperature. All sides were scanned using a Hamamatsu S60 scanner, evaluation and description was done using the NDPview.2 plus software (Version 2.8.24, Hamamatsu Photonics, K.K. Japan) by a board-certified pathologist in a blinded fashion. From each vaccine group, animals (n = 2) with the highest viral genome loads in the lungs (mock, commercial multivalent WIV, autologous WIV, bat-IAV) or nasal conchae (VSV replicon) were selected for immunohistochemistry.Statistical analyses/SoftwareGraphics and statistics were produced using R (RStudio version 2023.09.1, packages ggplot2, ggline, ggpar, etc.) and GraphPad prism version 9.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Figure 1 was created with BioRender.com and licensed by the company under agreement number CL26YA977R. Significance levels were calculated by the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn–Bonferroni corrections (Supplementary Table 2).

Sign up for Nature BriefingFatal Infection in Ferrets after Ocular Inoculation with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus - Volume 30, Number 7—July 2024 - Emerging Infectious Diseases journal - CDC Fatal Infection in Ferrets after Ocular Inoculation with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Volume 30, Number 7—July 2024 Research Letter Jessica A. Belser , Xiangjie Sun, Joanna A. Pulit-Penaloza, and Taronna R. Maines Author affiliation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA Suggested citation for this article Abstract Ocular inoculation of a clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus caused severe and fatal infection in ferrets. Virus was transmitted to ferrets in direct contact. The results highlight the potential capacity of these viruses to cause human disease after either respiratory or ocular exposure. In recent years, clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have exhibited substantial host expansion, geographic spread, and reassortment with other circulating influenza A viruses (IAVs) in birds, resulting in epornitics on all continents and virus detection in an expanding group of mammals (1). Human cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus infection have been reported, typically following direct exposure to infected animals, contaminated environments, or both (2). A 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was isolated from a human patient in Chile during 2023 (A/Chile/25945/2023 [Chile/25945]) (3) and caused severe and fatal disease in ferrets intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU of virus. Transmission of virus to animals housed in close contact was also reported (3), highlighting the pandemic potential of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. Although the eyes represent a secondary mucosal surface that is susceptible to respiratory virus exposure (4), as evidenced by recent reports of conjunctivitis in 2 dairy workers exposed to clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus (5), risk assessment approaches for clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses to date have been limited to standard intranasal inoculation (3,6) and have not evaluated the capacity of those viruses to cause disease after alternative portals of entry. To investigate relative similarities between ocular and respiratory exposure to H5N1 virus, we assessed the severity and kinetics of disease after ocular exposure of ferrets to Chile/25945 virus and compared our findings with a previously published assessment of animals intranasally inoculated with this virus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023 (3). To assess disease severity and transmissibility under different exposure concentrations, we inoculated ferrets by the ocular route with either a high (106 PFU) or low (103 PFU) dose of Chile/25945 virus (7). At either challenge dose, all ferrets inoculated by the ocular route became productively infected, reaching mean maximum weight loss of 12.7% (high dose) and 13.2% (low dose) and mean maximum rises in temperature of 2.4°C (high dose) and 2.0°C (low dose). Humane endpoints were reached on postinoculation days 5–7 in 3/3 (high dose) and 2/3 (low dose) animals (Figure 1, panel A). During necropsy, we detected infectious virus throughout the respiratory tract and in several extrapulmonary tissues (including from the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and ocular system) (Figure 1, panel C), consistent with the highly virulent phenotype observed after high-dose intranasal inoculation of ferrets (3). One ferret survived the challenge with a serologic titer of 160. To assess if ferrets inoculated by the ocular route were as capable as intranasally inoculated ferrets to transmit Chile/25945 virus in a direct contact setting (3), we cohoused a serologically naive ferret with each inoculated ferret 24 hours after inoculation. To assess virus replication within and beyond the respiratory tract, we collected nasal wash, conjunctival wash/swab, and rectal swab samples from inoculated and contact animals. All ferrets inoculated by the ocular route with a high dose of virus had detectable infectious virus in nasal wash (mean peak titer 5.3 ± 0.2 log10 PFU/mL), conjunctival wash/swab (4.4 ± 0.9 log10 PFU/mL), and rectal swab (3.6 ± 0.3 log10 PFU/mL) samples (Figure 2, panel A). The magnitude and frequency of viral titers in these specimens was reduced, but still present, in animals inoculated with a low dose of virus (Figure 2, panel B). Infectious virus was detected in either nasal or rectal wash samples in all contact animals on at least 1 day; infectious virus was not detected in conjunctival wash samples from any contact animal, possibly resulting from less overall virus shedding than in inoculated animals. Humane euthanasia because of severe disease was warranted for 4/6 contact animals (Figure 1, panel B); the other 2 survived, 1 of which exhibited a low level of seroconversion (hemagglutination inhibition titer 20). Our finding that a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus isolated from a human can exhibit a virulent and transmissible phenotype after nontraditional inoculation, even with a low dose of inoculum, underscores the public health threat posed by those IAVs. The ocular surfaces may be exposed to infectious virus from the environment by several means (e.g., airborne particles, physical transfer from contact with fomites, and splashing liquids). Furthermore, circulation of tear fluid between ocular and nasopharyngeal tissues via the lacrimal duct offers an opportunity for infectious virus to spread from the respiratory tract to the ocular system (8), in agreement with successful H5N1 viral isolation from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from a human with conjunctivitis (5). Conjunctivae may be exposed to virus by direct contact (e.g., virus-contaminated hands), indirect contact (e.g., virus-contaminated fomites), or after deposition of virus-laden droplets or aerosols onto the ocular surface (4), permitting opportunities for H5N1 virus to establish a productive infection in humans even in the absence of an ocular tropism. Considering the myriad ways humans may be exposed to IAVs, our study supports the need to consider nontraditional inoculation modalities in risk assessment activities and supports consideration of using eye protection in potentially contaminated environments (9).

An integrated One Health model was developed to estimate the likelihood of Avian Influenza (AI) introduction and transmission in Cuba, which will help inform and strengthen risk-based surveillance activities. Materials and methods: The spatial resolution used for the model was the smallest administrative district (“Consejo Popular”). The model was parameterised for transmission from wild birds to poultry and pigs (commercial and backyard) and then to humans. The model includes parameters such as risk factors for the introduction and transmission of AI into Cuba, animal and human population densities; contact intensity and a transmission parameter (β). Results: Areas with a higher risk of AI transmission were identified for each species and type of production system. Some variability was observed in the distribution of areas estimated to have a higher probability of AI introduction and transmission. In particular, the south-western and eastern regions of Cuba were highlighted as areas with the highest risk of transmission. Discussion: These results are potentially useful for refining existing criteria for the selection of farms for active surveillance, which could improve the ability to detect positive cases. The model results could contribute to the design of an integrated One Health risk-based surveillance system for AI in Cuba. In addition, the model identified geographical regions of particular importance where resources could be targeted to strengthen biosecurity and early warning surveillance. 1 Introduction From October 2021 until the time of writing, an unprecedented number of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks have been reported in different regions of the world. The disease threatens global food security and the livelihoods of households dependent on poultry (1, 2). At present, an increasing number of cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza (AI) have been reported even in several species of mammals, both terrestrial and aquatic, causing increased morbidity and mortality and raising concerns about the threat to domestic animal and wildlife health, biodiversity and potentially to public health (3). Exponential growth of the human population and its geographic expansion have increased the importance of the human-animal-environment interface. Surveillance of domestic poultry and farm workers has shown that avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are constantly evolving and are able to cross species barriers and infect mammals (1, 4–6), which raises concerns about the potential for AIVs to spark a human pandemic. Therefore, continuous improvement of surveillance and control of AI has become a global priority, and early detection of outbreaks with pandemic potential has become an important public health priority. Despite the persistence of siloed thinking in disease surveillance and control activities, collaborative One Health initiatives have emerged. These have been mainly focused on the prevention of zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance (7). One Health Surveillance Systems (OHSS) are essential for promoting a holistic, integrated approach to disease prevention and mitigation. OHSS requires that collaborative efforts between health sectors (human, animal, plant, food safety, wildlife and environment) are established during the surveillance process (8). Integrating data from multiple sources and knowledge from various disciplines in an OHSS can help to identify emerging health threats earlier, track the spread of disease, and inform evidence-based policies and interventions to promote health and wellbeing across sectors. Surveillance of poultry and livestock plays a critically important role in identifying changes in the risk of transmission of influenza viruses to humans. Disease surveillance enables the early detection of infections by AI and provides data on the evolution of AIVs, which is essential for identifying and assessing changes in virus virulence and transmissibility to humans. Surveillance data are used to understand the dynamics of virus transmission, which contributes to the development and implementation of preventive measures such as biosecurity protocols, vaccination programmes and control strategies to reduce the risk of transmission to humans, especially in areas where close human-animal contact is frequent (9). Simulation models that predict the spread of disease outbreaks play an important role in epidemic control. Understanding where a disease is most likely to spread constitutes valuable information for developing risk-based surveillance and targeted disease prevention and control strategies (10). Several models have been developed to predict the risk and spread of AIV within poultry populations (11–15). The outputs from these models can play an important role in informing surveillance activities by identifying high-risk regions and populations for targeted surveillance (16). Migratory waterfowl constitute the greatest risk for the introduction of AIV into Cuba. Infection with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses (HPAIVs) are an exotic disease of poultry in Cuba. However, HPAIVs are major threat to the Cuban poultry production sector, which plays an important role in the domestic production of protein of animal origin and, consequently, in food security. The aim of this study was to develop a model using a One Health approach to estimate the relative risk of AIVs transmission at the human-animal-environment interface, that can be used to inform risk based surveillance for an avian influenza incursion in livestock and humans. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Model summary The aim of the overall model was to estimate the relative risk of AIV spillover at the human-animal-environment interface. Two separate models were developed, one for poultry and one for swine. The models consider migratory waterfowl, the main reservoir of AIVs (17, 18), to be the most likely source for the introduction of AIVs into Cuba. The transmission pathways included were: (1) from wild birds to domestic birds and from domestic birds to farmers/agricultural workers and then to the public, and (2) from wild birds to domestic swine and from domestic swine to farmers/agricultural workers and then to the public (Figure 1). Figure 1 Figure 1. Pathways of influenza virus transmission for the domestic birds and domestic swine risk estimation models. Transmission risk was assessed by incorporating specific information about risk factors associated with virus introduction and other parameters related to disease transmission among livestock and farm workers. An epidemiological risk equation was used as a function of the spatial density of each parameter, taking into account some concepts developed by Hill et al. (18) with some modifications. It was assumed that for zoonotic transmission to occur there must be infected animals within the effective transmission range of susceptible humans, and that the number of contacts is proportional to the product of the number of infected animals and the number of susceptible humans. There must also be some transmission efficiency, which may vary depending on the extent and intensity of contact between animals and humans (e.g., commercial versus backyard poultry production). Intensity was assessed as an indicator of the level of opportunity for human exposure to influenza viruses. Other parameters used by Hill et al. (18), such as virus specific transmission components for specific influenza strains and the prevalence of specific strains in poultry, were not considered due to lack of data. The spatial resolution used for the risk assessment was the smallest administrative structure named “Consejo Popular.” The model was parameterized for poultry and swine to humans. Parameter estimates are presented in Table 1. Table 1 Table 1. Summary of parameter estimates. 2.2 Data processing and analysis The R programming software (R software version 4.3.0) was used for data processing and model development. The geographic information system (GIS) QGis version 3.28.3 in the NAD 27 (3795) projection was used to manage the spatial layers. In order to unify the format of each layer, map data were converted into vectors, with the “Consejo Popular” as the unit of spatial resolution. The parameters and results obtained in each equation of the models were normalized between zero and one using the following formula: Z =XSum(X) Where Z is the normalized value of the variable X. The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) was used to plot the data points in the sample from smallest to largest against their percentiles. The threshold for risk categorization (high or low) was chosen visually from the ECDF plot by identifying the numerical value that coincided with the point where the ECDF curve started to turn from a vertical to a horizontal direction. 2.2.1 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis (SA) was used for quantifying uncertainty in the model. Sampling-based methods using Monte Carlo simulations were used for SA. First, the scatter plots of the data were analyzed and non-linearity and non-monotonicity of the data were determined graphically. Uncertainty analysis was then carried out using the Sobol method. This is based on the decomposition of the variance of the model output and aims to determine the extent to which the variability of the model output depends on each of the input parameters, either a single parameter or an interaction between different parameters (19). 2.2.2 Probability of introduction of an AIV by wild birds (Rin) The most important risk for AIV introduction into Cuba is assumed to be through migratory waterfowl (20, 21). Previous multi-criteria analysis based on weighted criteria were carried out to identify and evaluate the different risk factors that could be associated with the introduction of avian influenza viruses into Cuba (11). The risk factors reported to be important (11, 21) were the number of permanent wetlands (Pw), rice fields (Rf) and important bird areas (IBAs), i.e. settlements areas where water birds feed in natural and artificial bodies of freshwater (22, 23) in a community. These same three risk factors were used in the models developed in our study. The National Center provided data for IBAs and Pw for each “Consejo Popular” for the Protected Areas (CNAP) in Cuba. Each risk factor was represented on an individual map consisting of one layer in vector format. Each area was assigned a density value for the risk factor present, based on the density of the factor in the “Consejo Popular”. The thematic layers produced were unified by overlay and visualized on a single map using the equation for estimating the risk of introduction of AIVs (Rin) at the “Consejo Popular” level. In the equation, a weighted sum was chosen to define which factors were more highly associated with the introduction of the AIV. In the weighted sum method, the value of each cell of the maps was multiplied by a weighting factor according to the relative importance of each risk factor. This semi-quantitative weighting is an important step in this method and it is based on a detailed analysis of each element from a literature review (11) and by consultation with experts in the field (21). The transformations, based on the area of each “Consejo Popular” and the weighting are shown below (Table 2). Table 2 Table 2. Weighting of the factors used to estimate the risk of avian influenza virus introduction into a Consejo Popular. The final equation for estimating the Risk of AIV introduction (Rin) into one “Consejo Popular” is: Rincp=(DRf× wRf)+(DIBAs× wIBAs)+(DPw× wPw) (1) Where: wRf = 0.0919, wIBAs = 0.0919, wPw = 0.0748, the values were taken from Steven et al. (11), and DRf = the density of rice fields, DIBAs = the density of important wild waterfowl areas, and DPw = the density of permanent wetlands. The distribution of the data was taken into account to determine the risk categories for monitoring. Figure 2 shows the ECDF, the distribution for the risk of introduction, areas with values ≥0.85 were classified as high risk, all other areas were classified as low risk. Figure 2 Figure 2. Empirical cumulative distribution function for risk of introduction of avian influenza virus. 2.2.3 Probability of AIV transmission to domestic animals and poultry The probability of interspecies transmission depends on the probability of contact between two animal species and the ability of the virus strain to adapt to the new host. This part of the model (Equation 2) is based on the result of the probability of introduction of an AIV by wild birds multiplied by the density of livestock or poultry, stratified by five different production types (Table 1). The analysis was done at the level of the “Consejo Popular”. The following categories were considered: Rsp,cp=nRincp× (∑ nLj1,2,cp) (2) ➢ Commercial chickens density (number of chickens/km2) ➢ Backyard chickens density (number of chickens/km2) ➢ Density of commercial ducks (number of ducks/km2) ➢ Commercial swine density (number of swine/km2) ➢ Backyard swine density (swine/km2) Where: sp, species; j, production type; cp, Consejo Popular; nRin, normalized value of Rin; nL, normalized value of Livestock A geo-referenced database of commercial farms of all identified owners in the country was available. Based on the centroid of the epidemiological quadrant (1 km2) referenced for each farm by the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVE) of the National Center for Animal Health (CENASA), the location accuracy was at least 0.75 km. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was used as the source of data for backyard swine density with a resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (~10 km at the equator). A full description of the density estimates is given in the companion paper to the ongoing FAO Gridded Livestock of the World project (24). In order to standardize the format of each geographical layer, the raster data were converted into vectors using conversion tools (polygonization and rasterization). The risk categories for monitoring have been taken into account in the ECDF distribution of the data. “Consejo Popular” with ECDF values ≥0.98 were classified as high risk and all other “Consejo Popular” were classified as low risk. 2.2.4 Probability of AIV transmission to farmers or owners For zoonotic transmission to occur, infected animals must be within the effective transmission range of susceptible humans. The efficiency of transmission will depend on the extent and intensity of contact between animals and humans (commercial or backyard production) and the innate efficacy of the AIV to infect humans (which depends on known or unknown genetic characteristics of the AIV). Both parameters, the contact ratio and the β parameter (Table 1), were obtained based on the methodology of Hill et al. (18), with some adaptations to the specific characteristics of the Cuban livestock system. In the model, the parameters were combined with the probability of transmission of an AIV to domestic animals or poultry to obtain Equation 3. The values used to define risk categories were estimated from the ECDF plot. “Consejo Popular” with ECDF values ≥0.98 were classified as higher risk, all other Consejo Popular were classified as lower risk. Rsp-fw,j,cp=nRincp× nLsp,j,cp ×Crsp,j × βsp,j (3) Where: sp, species; fw, farm worker; cp, consejo popular; j, production type system; nRin, normalized value of Rin and nL, normalized value of Livestock; Cr, contact ratio; β, transmission parameter. 2.2.4.1 Contact ratio of poultry or pigs to farmers or owners The contact ratio is an indicator of the potential for human exposure to influenza viruses. The relative value assigned to contact between production animals and humans will vary depending on the type of farming system, animal management practices, and worker safety protocols. In commercial production systems, relatively few people will be rearing a large number of animals compared to backyard production, where one or two people will be rearing a small number of animals by hand. There are various assumptions used to establish these ratios, which also vary according to the species and characteristics of the production systems, such as feeding, watering, cleaning, handling, and other tasks involved in animal care and management. Also, regarding the type of housing or confinement systems, the density of animals, and other factors that affect the safety protocols and biosecurity measures on the farm. The values for contact ratios were based on the production manuals for each species in Cuba (25). For the contact intensity model (Crj), the values were normalized, using point values derived from: Crj ~ Uniform(mincontact rate, maxcontact rate) 2.2.4.2 Parameters for the transmission of influenza virus from different livestock production types to farm workers or owners The epidemiological component of the transmission parameter (βj) was generated from published real-world reports (Table 1, Supplementary material) of AI outbreaks resulting in human infections (26–38). The methodology used to obtain βj values was taken from Hill et al. (18). The equation used to estimate βj was: βj~ gamma(IH,1SH×Ij) Where IH and SH are the number of infected and susceptible humans and Ij is the number of infected animals of production type j in an outbreak. The information needed to parameterize virus transmission was available in the literature (Table 1, Supplementary material). Humans exposed through routine contact with animals (e.g., farmers and farm workers) were included, but not those involved in post-detection interventions. The number of infected birds is usually not reported in epidemiological reports of such outbreaks, so the total number of animals on infected farms was used as a proxy, except for pig farms, where the total number of susceptible animals or the capacity of the farm was used. The β values for commercial and backyard poultry were taken from Hill et al.'s (18). For swine (Figure 1, Supplementary material), the formula above was used, informed by values from the literature (26–28). For commercial ducks, there was insufficient real data for birds and humans (susceptible and infected) in the literature to calculate the β parameter, so the average of the β values of commercial and backyard poultry were used. 2.2.5 Probability of human infection The density of the total human population in each “Consejo Popular” was multiplied by the result of “equation (3)” for each species to estimate the risk of infection for humans. The variable included the total human population divided by the geographical area (inhabitants/km2) as recorded by the National Office of Statistics and Information (ONEI) in Cuba. The values used to define risk categories were estimated from the ECDF plot. “Consejo Popular” with values greater than or equal to 0.98 were classified as higher risk, and all others as lower risk. The “Equation 4” was used to obtain the result: Rcp=nRincp×(∑( nLsp,j,cp ×Crsp,j × βsp,j)) × Hpcp (4) Where: Rcp, the risk of transmission to humans in a “Consejo Popular”; sp, species; cp, Consejo Popular; j, production type system; nRin, normalized value of Rin and nL, normalized value of Livestock; Cr, contact ratio; β, transmission parameter; Hp, human population density. 3 Results The model is based on the introduction of AIVs from wild birds into commercial and backyard poultry or swine. The risk of an AIV introduction (Figure 3) was high for 227 (15%) of the 1512 “Consejo Popular” in Cuba. The formation of geographical clusters of high risk “Consejo Popular” was observed in the western region of Cuba due to the interaction of associated risk factors and the contiguity between areas with the same high-risk categories. This region is of great importance for the poultry sector due to its high poultry population density. Figure 3 Figure 3. Areas at risk of introduction of avian influenza virus through wild birds. The total order (Ti) and first order (Si) sensitivity indices were plotted (Figure 4). Both sensitivity indices had similar values, indicating that there was no significant second order interaction between the parameters modeled to determine the risk of introduction. Values obtained from the difference between the minimum and maximum confidence intervals confirmed that rice fields were the parameter with the highest interaction and sensitivity in the model. This could be due to the geospatial characteristics of the data, for example co-location of rice and IBA areas. Figure 4 Figure 4. Sensitivity analysis for Equation 1. The high-risk “Consejo Popular” for AIV transmission from wild birds to livestock varied depending on the species (Figure 5). There were 21 (1.4%) higher-risk “Consejo Popular” for commercial ducks, 46 (3.0%) for commercial and backyard poultry and 35 (2.3%) for commercial and backyard swine. Figure 5 Figure 5. Risk of transmission from wild birds to ducks, swine and poultry. The total (Ti) and first order (Si) sensitivity indices were plotted and presented in the Supplementary material. Both the total and first order sensitivities indicated that there was no significant second order interaction between the parameters. The densities parameter was the most influential parameter (Figure 2, Supplementary material). The density parameters consist of the values of the densities by species (chickens, ducks and pigs) and type of production (commercial and backyard). Density of commercial chickens had the highest value of total order (i.e., contribution to the total variance of the model), followed by backyard swine, which was suggestive of a strong interaction with other parameters. The risk of transmission from livestock to caretakers is presented in Figure 6. There were 15 (0.99%) “Consejo Popular” with higher risk for commercial ducks, 45 (2.9%) for poultry and 39 (2.6%) for pigs. The results of the sensitivity test (Figure 3, Supplementary material) show that the Rin parameter was the most influential in the output model. In general, all parameters had similar total and first order sensitivity values, indicating that there was no strong interaction between parameters, which could imply that there was no significant second order effect. Figure 6 Figure 6. Risk of transmission from domestic livestock to farmer or farm worker. Figure 7 presents the risk of transmission of avian influenza viruses from the animal caretakers to the general population. For poultry (commercial and backyard chickens and commercial ducks), there were 39 (2.6%) “Consejo Popular” with a higher risk of transmission, while for swine (commercial and backyard) we identified 24 (1.6%) “Consejo Popular” with increased risk. Figure 7 Figure 7. Risk of transmission of avian influenza virus to humans. Total order (Ti) and first order (Si) sensitivity indices were plotted (Figure 8). The most important parameters for the model output in all simulations performed for the overall model sensitivity analysis were the human population density and the risk of introduction. In the individual sensitivity analysis for each variable included in the model (Figure 4, Supplementary material), the values corresponding to the transmission parameter β for chickens and commercial ducks were the major interaction in the model output. Among animal population densities, poultry and backyard pig populations as well as commercial ducks had the highest interaction. For the contact intensity parameter, the values corresponding to the contact rate between commercial ducks and backyard pigs with breeders were the most influential. Considering the species and type of production separately, the most influential variables for the model output were also commercial ducks and backyard pigs. The latter did not have a high total order value, which means that there is no strong interaction with other parameters. Within the species considered in the model (chickens, ducks and pigs), chickens had a greater first order sensitivity and were considered the most influential species or parameter in the output of the model, together with the aforementioned variables. Figure 8 Figure 8. Sensitivity analysis for Equation 4 by species. 4 Discussion This is the first study inspired by a One Health approach to use geospatial modeling and analysis to determine the relative risk of AIV transmission in Cuba. It uses the “Consejo Popular,” which is the smallest administrative division in Cuba, as the unit of resolution. Improving the stratification of geographical areas to identify those at higher risk of AIV transmission will provide health decision-makers with better information to improve risk management through better allocation of resources for prevention and early warning, as well as optimizing the risk-based surveillance system in place in the country. From a One Health perspective, this model allows the identification of “Consejo Popular” where interspecies spillovers may be more likely. These “Consejo Popular” should merit a higher intensity of surveillance to detect early AIV infections before AIV evolution leads to increased pathogenicity or transmissibility within and between species. Avian influence viruses are expanding their host range, particularly in mammals, often posing a threat to public health (39). Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, namely those of clade 2.3.4.4b, continue to diversify genetically and spread geographically. Since 2022, a wider range of wild bird species has been infected worldwide, with adverse ecological consequences and mass die-offs in some species (40). The situation in wild mammals is also of concern, with some species experiencing significant die-offs (41). In 2024, influenza A(H5N1) viruses were detected in neonatal goats at a single facility shared with poultry and in dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA). There have been limited reports of transmission between mammals despite the increase in mammalian infections. Although direct evidence is lacking, large die-offs of marine mammals caused by the influenza A(H5N1) virus occurred; and infections in several fur animal farms in Finland (42) and Spain (43) are consistent with mammal-to-mammal spread in these cases (39). Current evidence from the USA suggests that lateral transmission among cattle has likely occurred. To date, the routes and modes of transmission and the duration of virus shedding in cattle remain under investigation (40). The frequency of transmission from cattle to birds is also unknown. Poultry remain at risk from continued circulation and spillover of influenza A(H5N1) viruses from wild birds. One of the key advantages of this model is that it could also help to inform risk-based surveillance for individual species. An example of this is the identification of “Consejo Popular” at higher risk of AIV introduction. This information could be of value for the design and implementation of a surveillance component for wild birds, which are considered the main reservoir of AIVs and the main route of entry into Cuba. Surveillance in wild species has not had the desired effect of early detection of outbreaks in other countries, such as the USA and Canada (44). However, when molecular methods are used, it is possible to have a better understanding of which virus strains are circulating and how the disease behaves in wild bird species. This knowledge maybe relevant for risk management. This model can contribute to improving the current surveillance system by allowing some flexibility and practical adaptability according to current surveillance objectives. The model we described here represents a general framework for introduction and transmission of AIVs in Cuba, but it has the flexibility to incorporate more information. For instance, if information about the circulating AI strains in North and/ or South America are known before these strains were expected to arrive in Cuba. This information could be used to weight certain parameters (e.g., to take into account a predisposition of the virus to infect certain wild birds or certain livestock species) in order to make the model more specific to strains that are expected to arrive in Cuba. The model estimated the relative risk of transmission of AIVs between humans and commercial and backyard production systems by species, which has value for informing public health surveillance, as well as for improving the active risk-based surveillance system currently in place for commercial poultry. It can also inform the design of a risk-based surveillance system for other species, such as pigs. The identification of areas where risk communication, public education and identification of practices and attitudes of high risk for exposure to AIVs should be a priority (45). Transmission parameters such as Cr and β were constant in the model in terms of spatial distribution, but their value differed according to species and type of husbandry. The intensity of the animal-human contact is used to guide the surveillance of zoonotic diseases in different species (18). Identified areas of high chicken-human contact intensity corresponded remarkably well with HPAI H5N1 cases during the 2003-2004 outbreak in Southeast Asia. This is a clear example of the importance of contact alone (independent of the ability of the virus to infect humans). Since the beginning of 2021, 28 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) have been reported to the WHO. Of these, 2 have been associated with clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. These cases have been reported to WHO from: China, Chile, Ecuador, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States (40). All human cases, except that the one in Chile, had exposure to infected animals either through participation in outbreak control activities or direct exposure to infected animals in farm, backyard or live bird market environments. The most plausible route of transmission of the Chilean case was through environmental exposure, given the high number of deaths in marine mammals and wild birds found in the area near the patient's residence (46). Among these cases, no human-to-human transmission has been reported. WHO considers the overall public health risk posed by influenza A(H5N1) to be low, and the risk of infection for those exposed to infected birds or animals or contaminated environments is considered low to moderate (40). Sporadic zoonotic infections have occurred throughout the history of HPAI infections, but with varying risk to humans depending on the combination of genes and mutations present in specific virus variants. While some of the factors that determine higher risk for humans are known, it remains difficult to predict which viruses could trigger more widespread human disease outbreaks, and the ongoing process of viral evolution by genomic reassortment requires regular updates of risk assessment. Actions on protecting animal health and associated consequences for biodiversity is mostly focused on the early detection and control of outbreaks in poultry involving culling and/or regional poultry vaccination. However, this action does not address the fundamentally different pandemic risk to humans in the current situation arising from a panzootic wildlife infectious disease (47). This model is one of the few analyses conducted in Cuba that is specifically focused on some of the complex interactions of this disease at the human-animal-environment interface, thus providing a unique contribution to our knowledge of the occurrence and transmission of AI in Cuba and worldwide. This model is also one of the few to include pigs in the modeling of influenza virus transmission at the human-animal interface. These species are widely recognized as potential hosts for the generation of novel influenza viruses, and some of these viruses, including pandemic (A) H1N1 2009, have been shown to be readily transmissible between humans and swine (13, 39). However, very few studies have been undertaken to model the spread of influenza at the swine-human-poultry interface. The model could also be used to design and implement an integrated surveillance system as part of a One Health approach to improve early warning, avoid duplication of efforts and optimize resources for timely diagnosis and rapid response. While high animal and human population densities alone do not imply a high risk of transmission, they could be interpreted as an indicator of various epidemiological processes that are more likely to occur in densely populated areas, such as increased chances of AIV transmission through trade and agricultural activities (48). In the absence of control or prevention measures, the spread of HPAIVs and the occurrence of clinical disease outbreaks will be facilitated in regions where chicken density is particularly high (48). Studies in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China have linked human infections and poultry outbreaks to several risk factors, including human and animal demographics, i.e., human and poultry population density (49–52), and environmental factors, i.e., percentage of rice paddy area and water sources (53). The model has some limitations, such as being a density-dependent model without taking into account other factors related to the disease (e.g., prevalence of the virus, virus subtype, species affected, etc.), and some assumptions made for the parameterization of the contact intensity and β parameters. The assumptions made to measure the intensity of contact were based on the values established in the regulations of the Poultry Workers' Payment System, which takes into account the purpose of the farm, the species and the type of production. This is not the case for backyard production, where the values were taken from the literature and expert consultations, which may not be fully representative of the situation in Cuba. The value for the transmission parameter β was also extracted from the literature, and estimated arbitrarily for commercial ducks because of the lack of published data. The lack of information on other factors influencing transmission in geographical area such as transport networks, contact patterns and trade were limitations as well, because many of these factors are considered of high importance for disease transmission even at the global level. Many of these limitations are due to the lack of necessary data in Cuba, and because HPAIV infections in poultry have not been detected. However, there is evidence that the risk exists, as an AI infection was recently reported in Cuban zoo birds (54) which was successfully contained. Due to the lack of outbreak data, parameterization was done by extrapolating values from the literature or based on expert opinion. Unlike other existing spatial and temporal dynamic models of HPAIVs transmission (55), certain transmission parameters, such as subtype or viral chain characteristics or disease prevalence data, were not considered in the development of this model. These data are scarce even at the global level, which limits modeling and its benefits for the management of the associated risks. However, this limitation in terms of model applicability for epidemiological surveillance was not considered critical. The increase in the number of emerging, re-emerging and transboundary diseases has highlighted the need to establish effective early warning surveillance systems at both a larger scale and higher resolution (56). This favors real-time processing of disease data with fast dissemination of information to decision-makers, so that rapid prevention and control measures can be implemented against potential outbreaks. The development of a risk assessment model framework can help decision-makers to focus surveillance efforts on regions where pathogen introductions are most likely. It also provides information for the design of risk-based surveillance systems for other species with an integrated and/or unisectorial approach, which can improve early warning, timely diagnosis and allocation of resources for prevention through biosecurity in priority areas.

For 2024-25, ACIP recommended the updated COVID-19 and flu vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and up. ACIP simplified recommendations for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults. Vaxelis is now another preferentially recommended combination vaccine for American Indian and Alaska Native infants, based on the Hib component. ACIP also recommended a new pneumococcal vaccine for adults. Summary What CDC knows Vaccines are an effective tool for protecting Americans against the most severe effects of many infectious diseases. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is an advisory panel made up of external experts who advise CDC on the use of vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases. ACIP met June 26-28 and voted unanimously on several recommendations. What CDC is doing The CDC director adopted all the vaccine recommendations that ACIP voted on. These are now official CDC public health guidance for the safe use of the vaccines in the United States and will be published as official recommendations in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). CDC will communicate these recommendations to the public, healthcare providers, and public health professionals to ensure everyone has the information needed to protect their health from vaccine-preventable diseases. CDC Issues Updated Vaccine Recommendations for COVID-19 and Other Diseases after Expert Panel Votes CDC relies on an external advisory panel of medical experts to make recommendations that shape policy for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the United States. The group, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), typically meets in Atlanta at least three times a year. ACIP’s decisions on vaccines are important. The CDC director reviews each decision and they become official agency policy once adopted, helping protect the health of all Americans. At its most recent meeting June 26-28, 2024, ACIP reviewed data on disease burden and vaccine effectiveness and safety, among other data. ACIP voted on vaccine recommendations for the upcoming respiratory virus season, as well as for recommendations for vaccines to protect against some bacterial diseases. The following decisions have now been adopted by the CDC director. Simpler recommendations on RSV vaccines for older adults ACIP offered clearer guidance around the use of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines for older adults. RSV vaccines for older adults became available for the first time in the United States last year. Older adults are at higher risk of developing severe RSV. The initial recommendations called for adults 60 years and older to receive one dose of the RSV vaccine based on shared clinical decision making, that is, a conversation between patient and healthcare provider about whether the shot was appropriate for them based on their health conditions. In the context of new data that are now available on RSV vaccines for older adults, the recommendations were updated to be more specific and streamlined. The updated RSV vaccine recommendations for adults 60 years and older are age- and risk-based. ACIP now recommends all adults 75 years of age and older receive a single dose of RSV vaccine. Adults 60 to 74 years of age should get a single dose of RSV vaccine if they are at increased risk of severe RSV disease. Adults ages 60 to 74 are at higher risk if they have certain chronic medical conditions, such as lung or heart disease, or if they live in a nursing home or long-term care facility. RSV vaccination is currently recommended as a one-time dose. If you have already received RSV vaccination, another dose is not recommended for you at this time. RSV immunization recommendations to protect infants, either through maternal vaccination or RSV antibody given to the baby after birth, stayed the same. CDC continues to recommend RSV immunizations to protect all babies from severe RSV. An updated COVID-19 vaccine for the fall Data continue to show the importance of vaccination to protect against COVID-19. ACIP recommends new 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines as authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for everyone 6 months of age and older. FDA recently recommended that vaccine manufacturers use the KP.2 variant of the JN.1 lineage, if feasible, for fall vaccines, to more closely match circulating variants. This recommendation will take effect as soon as the new vaccines are available, which is anticipated in early September. New influenza vaccine guidance for organ transplant recipients ACIP reaffirmed its recommendation for routine annual influenza vaccination of all people ages 6 months and older who do not have contraindications. Updated 2024-2025 flu vaccines will all be trivalent and will protect against an A(H1N1), an A(H3N2), and a B/Victoria lineage virus. For solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are taking immunosuppressive medication regimens, ACIP now recommends high-dose (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted (aIIV3) inactivated influenza vaccines as acceptable options for influenza vaccination, without a preference over other age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccines. A new vaccine for pneumococcal disease As for pneumococcal disease, ACIP recommends a new vaccine that provides protection against serotypes of the bacteria that commonly cause disease in adults. A new 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV21) is now an option for adults ages 19 years and older who currently have a recommendation to receive a dose of PCV. PCV21 includes eight new pneumococcal serotypes that are not contained in currently available pneumococcal vaccines. It no longer includes certain serotypes that used to be common before the introduction of PCV but are now infrequent among the general adult population. The recommendation for the new vaccine comes at a time when an increase in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States has been reported after reduction in incidence early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Hib vaccine recommended for American Indian and Alaska Native infants Invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease is a rare but serious bacterial infection that disproportionally affects American Indian and Alaska Native infants. Until now, PedvaxHIB was the only Hib vaccine preferentially recommended over other Hib vaccine options for these infants because it provides a protective antibody response after the first dose. ACIP voted to recommend that Vaxelis be included in the preferential recommendation for American Indian and Alaska Native infants based on the Hib component. New immunogenicity data after the first dose of Vaxelis are available now and supported the recommendation. For more information on what was discussed and voted on at the ACIP meeting, click here.

Given the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant strains of IAV, currently available antiviral drugs have been reported to be inadequate to meet clinical demands. Therefore, continuous exploration of safe, effective and broad-spectrum antiviral medications is urgently required. Here, we found that the small molecule compound J1 exhibited low toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, J1 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including IAV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects and mechanism of action of J1 on IAV in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that J1 inhibited infection by IAV strains, including H1N1, H7N9, H5N1 and H3N2, as well as by oseltamivir-resistant strains. Mechanistic studies have shown that J1 blocks IAV infection mainly through specific interactions with the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2 subunit, thereby blocking membrane fusion. BALB/c mice were used to establish a model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by IAV. Treatment with J1 increased survival rates and reduced viral titers, lung index and lung inflammatory damage in virus-infected mice. In conclusion, J1 possesses significant anti-IAV effects in vitro and in vivo, providing insights into the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against future pandemics.

GanghuoQingwenGranules (GHQWG) is a common Chinese herbal formula for the treatment of influenza (flu). However, its methods of action remain unknown. We used network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the pharmacological mechanism of GHQWG in flu. TCMSP and various types of literature were used to obtain active molecules and targets of GHQWG. Flu-related targets were found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, the DisFeNET database, the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and the DrugBank database. To screen the key targets, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. DAVID was used to analyze GO and KEGG pathway enrichment. Target tissue and organ distribution was assessed. Molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between possible targets and active molecules. For the ideal core protein–compound complexes obtained using molecular docking, a molecular dynamics simulation was performed. In total, 90 active molecules and 312 GHQWG targets were discovered. The PPI network's topology highlighted six key targets. GHQWG's effects are mediated via genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, as well as the TNF and IL-17 signaling pathways, according to GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the active compounds and tested targets had strong binding capabilities. This analysis accurately predicts the effective components, possible targets, and pathways involved in GHQWG flu treatment. We proposed a novel study strategy for future studies on the molecular processes of GHQWG in flu treatment. Furthermore, the possible active components provide a dependable source for flu drug screening.

According to the antigenicity of the viral nucleoprotein NP and matrix protein M1, influenza viruses can be categorized into influenza A (IAV), B (IBV), C (ICV), and D (IDV)1, and the main types of influenza viruses that infect humans are A, B, and C. IAV has a wide range of hosts which can be hosted on humans, birds, and other mammals. It is highly sensitive to antigenic variation and able to mutate through a variety of pathways, among which the antigenic drift mechanism can disrupt the protective effect of antibodies on organisms, resulting in annual influenza epidemics; whereas antigenic shift can change the biology of viruses, producing viruses with different antigenic properties, and when new strains with significant antigenic differences emerge, they may be able to form a worldwide pandemic1,2.The clinical symptoms of influenza are dominated by acute high fever, generalized pain, malaise and other systemic toxic symptoms and respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat, and most patients with influenza can recover within 1 week. Although it is a self-limiting disease, for the elderly and frail patients and patients with other underlying diseases, it can cause a variety of complications, develop into severe influenza, induce multiple organ failure, and ultimately lead to death. The high variability, high drug resistance and strong infectivity of influenza viruses pose a great challenge to global public health3. In 2019, WHO reported that there were nearly 1 billion cases of influenza worldwide each year, of which 3 to 5 million were severe cases and 290,000–650,000 were fatal cases4. It can be seen that influenza is characterized by high contagiousness, high morbidity, and high morbidity and mortality.At present, the treatment methods of Western medicine include vaccine prevention, prompting interruption of virus transmission and symptomatic treatment after infection. However, there are shortages of vaccines, inadequate coverage, and their effectiveness is often affected by a number of factors, such as age, immune function, and the viral strain2,5. On the one hand, age and immunocompromised people are at higher risk of complications from vaccination. On the other hand, influenza viruses are highly susceptible to mutation, and it is clearly unlikely that a new vaccine can be developed in a short period of time in the face of a new influenza virus. This leads to a lag in vaccine development relative to influenza outbreaks. Current antiviral drugs are mainly neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir), cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors (baloxavir maboxir), and adamantanes (e.g., amantadine and amantadine), the former of which are active against both IAV and IBV, and the latter of which is only active against IAV and are not recommended for influenza6. In addition, antiviral drugs also face a number of other challenges, such as increased drug resistance, controversial prognostic improvement, and efficacy affected by the time of drug initiation. In summary, influenza viruses are fast-mutating and have a high potential for transmission from animal hosts to humans, so they can emerge or re-emerge as “new viruses” with the potential to spread rapidly among susceptible populations and cause global epidemics or pandemics. However, the existing means of preventing and treating influenza are extremely limited, so it is crucial to find a new drug or vaccine that can inhibit the replication and spread of the virus in a timely manner, alleviate the symptoms and minimize the occurrence of complications.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in China and some other nations for more than 2000 years to treat a variety of infectious disorders, including COVID-19 and prior malaria7. TCM has contributed to the prevention and control of significant infectious disease epidemics and has emerged as a key component and focal point in China8. The pathophysiology of influenza disease is characterized by “dampness, heat, poison, and stasis” and is referred to in TCM theory as “YI Disease,” which is produced by “YI QI9.” Zhang Zhongjing created the Shang Han hypothesis, also known as the “Treatise of Exogenous Febrile Diseases” or “Discourse on Cold-Damage Disorders,” during the Han dynasty to help cure influenza. The development of “Wen Yi Lun (Analysis of Epidemic Warm Diseases)” in the Ming and Qing Dynasties later revealed that TCM had made significant contributions to the prevention and treatment of influenza for thousands of years10,11. Previously, TCM demonstrated a positive anti-viral effect on the influenza virus and alleviated the symptoms among patients12,13. Ganghuo Qingwen Granules (20gime, 3 times/day) (GHQWG) is an empirical prescription in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and has shown significant clinical efficacy against influenza (flu), mainly comprised of Ilex asprella root (Gangmeigen, GMG), Pogostemon cablin (Guanghuoxiang, GHX), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua, JYH), Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao, LQ), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng, FF), Notopterygii Rhizoma Et Radix (Qianghuo, QH), Radix Bupleuri (Chaihu, CH), Atractylodes lancea (Cangzhu, CZ), Schizonepetae Spica (Jingjiesui, JJS) and Bovis Calculus (Niuhuang, NH), which has the efficacy of “dispersing the wind and relieving epidemiology, clearing heat and detoxifying toxins, and dispelling dampness and neutralizing the effect of wind-heat and dampness,” and it is commonly used in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the epidemic flu with the wind-heat and dampness syndrome. Previous studies have indicated that GHQWG could remarkably reduce the exudation of inflammatory mediators in mice with H1N1 (A/FM1/1/47) influenza virus pneumonia by improving anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-5, IL4)14. However, systematic studies of the mechanisms by which GHQWG achieves its anti-flu properties, including evaluations of putative targets, cellular processes, and metabolic pathways, are missing.Complex chemicals used in TCM have numerous clinical targets and pathways. For mechanistic research of TCM, conventional pharmacology methodologies are so restricted15. A novel idea known as "network pharmacology," put forth by Shao Li in 2013, offered a fresh method for figuring out how TCM formulas work16. The development of bioinformatic networks and network topology investigations are part of TCM network pharmacology, which also encompasses virtual computing, high-throughput data processing, and network database retrieval17. This method is appropriate for studying TCM because it focuses on multi-component, multi-channel, and multi-target synergy18,19. Network pharmacology, which is based on computational prediction, has recently merged with bioinformatics, making it a reliable way to systematically disclose the biological mechanisms behind complex diseases and therapeutic actions at the molecular level20,21. More research is being done using network pharmacology to determine the mechanisms underlying TCM's therapeutic benefits on diverse ailments22,23.In 2007, Hopkins, a British pharmacologist, first proposed the concept of network pharmacology (NP), which is defined as a branch of pharmacology based on the theoretical foundation of systems biology and multidirectional pharmacology, and utilizing the method of biomolecular network analysis to select specific nodes for new drug design and target analysis18,24. Molecular docking is a computer-aided drug design (CADD) method25, which is an important tool in NP to predict the binding affinity between drugs and targets. They can predict the binding affinity between a drug and its target by constructing drug–target-pathway network models and simulating drug–target interactions, which can reveal the mechanism of action and potential side effects of the drug. TCM is characterized by "multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-pathways", which coincides with the "multi-genes, multi-targets" pharmacological research characteristics of NP4,26. With the soundness of database, the maturity of CADD technology and the modernization of TCM, the research of NP and molecular docking technology in the field of TCM has become more and more extensive, including but not limited to the prediction of Chinese medicine targets, understanding of the biological basis of diseases and syndromes, the network regulation mechanism of TCM, and the identification of biomarkers of diseases and syndromes based on the biological network5,27, which has brought vigorous opportunities and has also brought new opportunities for the development of Chinese medicine pharmacology. It also provides new horizons for the search of new drugs against influenza virus.In summary, the pandemic nature of influenza, the drug resistance of the virus and the limited means currently available to Western medicine to cope with influenza have prompted researchers around the world to search for new ways to prevent and treat influenza. TCM possesses unique advantages and broad prospects in the influenza. Clinical experience has found that GHQWG can effectively inhibit the progression of the disease and improve the prognosis, but its mechanism of action still needs to be further explored. NP and molecular docking technology can be a good way to explore the mechanism of action of Chinese medicine pharmacodynamic substances and therapeutic diseases. Therefore, this research intends to search for active molecules and targets of GHQWG, influenza-related targets, construct the network system of GHQWG-influenza by NP and molecular docking techniques to predict the main bioactive substances, possible targets and signaling pathways of GHQWG in the treatment of influenza. We hope that this work will provide a scientific elucidation of GHQWG for influenza, align with the frontiers of modern science and technology, lay the foundation for further research on the mechanism of action of GHQWG for influenza, and provide new insights into the treatment of influenza by TCM for researchers around the world. The flow chart of this study is shown in Fig. 1.Figure 1Workflow of the network pharmacological investigation strategy of GHQWG in the treatment of flu.Full size imageMaterials and methodsScreening and target prediction of active components of GHQWG The active components of Ilex asprella root, Pogostemon cablin, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Forsythiae Fructus, Saposhnikoviae Radix, Notopterygii Rhizoma Et Radix, Radix Bupleuri, Atractylodes lancea, Schizonepetae Spica and Bovis Calculus in GHQWG were searched by application analysis platform and database system pharmacology of Chinese medicine (TCMSP, https:/cmspw.comcmsp.php)28 and the targets of active components were predicted. We screened the active ingredients that meet both oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30% and drug-like (DL) ≥ 0.18 by pharmacodynamics29,30. Since "Ilex asprella root" was not searched in the TCMSP database, the chemical composition of Ilex asprella root was collected by searching the chemical composition literature of Ilex asprella root, and these components were imported into SwissADME for ADME screening, with GI absorption as high and Druglikeness greater than or equal to two as Yes. The drug-likeness was greater than or equal to two as Yes as the screening criteria, and the target of the action of Ilex asprella root was predicted in the SwissTargetPrediction database, and the target with a Probability value greater than 0.1 was selected as the predicted target, and the target of the action of Ilex asprella root (GMG) was obtained.Collection of influenza-related targets and acquisition of potential therapeutic targetsThe keyword "influenza" was used to search the Genecards database (https://www.genecards.org/), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM, https://www.omim.org/31, the DisFeNET database (https://www.disgenet.org/), Therapeutic Target Database (TTD, http://db.idrblab.net/) and DrugBank database (https://go.drugbank.com/) to search and screen for disease targets of influenza. relevant targets for influenza.Acquisition of GHQWG targets in fluTo clarify the mechanism of action of drug targets and disease targets at the protein level, drug genes, and disease genes were submitted to the Venn diagram tool (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/32, it was possible to further achieve the goal of removing the repeated targets among GHQWG and flu. Then, the intersection of GHQWG-related targets and flu-related targets was then screened for common targets33.Analyses of the protein–protein interaction network and hub targetsThe protein–protein interaction (PPI) network helps to better understand the biological mechanisms involved in target-related pathogenesis at the protein level. Thus, the STRING 11.0b database (https://string-db.org/) was used to construct the PPI network and receive hub targets. The organism was set to “Homo sapiens” and the minimum required interaction score was 0.434. Subsequently, the PPI network was visualized and analyzed by Cytoscape 3.7.2 software (https://cytoscape.org/). The degree values in the PPI network were calculated by using the NetworkAnalyzer plugin of Cytoscape 3.7.2 software, calculates the degree of each target node of the PPI network through topological analysis, and selects the key target genes in the network according to the degree of the node, and the larger the degree, the greater the role of the gene in the PPI network, and then takes the top 6 proteins as the core targets. The proteins with the top 6 Degree values were selected as the core targets.Enrichment analyses for common targetsTo study the biological function of potential targets in flu, DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) database was used to collect GO analysis and KEGG data35. GO analysis is used to screen biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF)36. KEGG enrichment analysis can find important signaling pathways involved in biological processes37,38,39. Subsequently, GO and KEGG data were uploaded to the Bioinformatics (http://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/) platform for visual analysis40.Molecular dockingMolecular docking can predict the potential therapeutic effects of drug components by analyzing the binding potential between the main components and hub genes41. The specific methods were as follows: the 3D structure of the hub genes proteins and the crystal structure of the main components were obtained from the RCSB PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/) and PubChem databases42 respectively. PyMOL 1.7.x software was used to remove ligands, dehydrate, and hydrogenate the hub genes proteins43. Then, the hub genes proteins and main components were transformed into PDBQT format by AutoDock Tools 1.5.6 software. AutoDock Tools 1.5.6 was used to construct a crystal structure docking grid box for each target. Then the molecules with the lowest binding energy for each active compound in the docking conformation were allowed for semi-flexible docking by comparing with the original ligands and intermolecular interactions. Box center coordinates and size of the box were determined for evaluating the interaction and the “Number of GA Runs” was set to 5044. Finally, the docking results were visualized with PyMOL software.Molecular dynamics simulationTo analyze the binding affinities of protein targets and active compounds obtained by molecular docking, a 100 ns atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using the AMBER20 software package45,46. The ff14SB force field parameter was used for the proteins, and the general AMBER force field (gaff) was used for the active ingredients. The electrostatic potentials were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G level using Gaussian09 and the atomic partial charges were assigned using the Antechamber package in AMBER20. After loading the protein, active ingredients were uploaded to the leap module, and hydrogen atoms and antagonist ions were automatically added to neutralize the charge. The TIP3P explicit water model was selected, and periodic boundary conditions were set47. The molecular dynamics simulation workflow included four steps: energy minimization, heating, equilibrium, and production dynamics simulation. First, the heavy atoms of proteins (and small molecules) were confined, and 5000 steps (including the 2500-step steepest descent method and the 2500-step conjugate gradient method) were performed on the water molecules to minimize the energy; then, the system was slowly heated from 0 to 300 K within 60 ps. After heating, the system at 60 ps under the NPT ensemble was balanced. Finally, the system was subjected to a molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns (a total of 50,000 steps) under the NPT ensemble. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) methods were used to deal with long-range electrostatic interactions and the SHAKE algorithm was used to restrict the bond to the hydrogen atom. The time-step was set at 2 fs, and the trajectory data were saved every 1 ps. The CPPTRAJ module was used for analyses48.ResultsActive compounds and potential targets of GHQWG In total, 135 chemical compounds from ten herbs in GHQWG were obtained from TCMSP databases and the literature, including 6, 11, 23, 9, 17, 18, 8, 23, 5 and 15 compounds from GMG, GHX, JYH, CZ, CH, FF, JJS, LQ, NH and QH, respectively. After removing redundancy, 90 chemical compounds were identified (Supplementary File Table 1). 312 probable targets of GHQWG active chemicals and their related gene symbols were identified by scanning the TCMSP target module (Supplementary File Table 2). The active compounds and common targets were loaded into Cytoscape 3.7.1 to create a herb-compound-target network with 411 nodes and 2134 edges (Fig. 2). The network sheds light on the multiple complicated impacts of GHQWG active chemicals on flu. We determine the key components based on the degree ranking of the active ingredients, and identify the top eight active ingredients with degree ranking as key components. A network analysis showed that quercetin (degree: 585), Kaempferol (degree: 175), Luteolin (degree: 163), β-Sitosterol (degree: 137), wogonin (degree: 127), Stigmasterol (degree: 91), Caffeic Acid (degree: 82), and Isorhamnetin (degree: 33) were key nodes.Figure 2Herb–compound–target network. Blue arrows represent the herbs in GHQWG, yellow circles node are QH compounds, green circles node are CH compounds, orange circles node are JYH compounds, deep purple circles node are GHX compounds, light purple circles node are intersection components, pinkish purple circles node are JJS compounds, dark green circles node are GMG compounds, navy blue circles node are NH compounds, bright yellow circles node are FF compounds, red–orange circles node are CZ compounds, powdered circles node are LQ compounds. The edges represent the interaction between compounds and targets, and the node size is proportional to the degree of interaction.Full size imagePrediction of drug and disease related targetsWe collect target genes related to flu from five open-source databases, namely, GeneCards (1656), OMIM (5), DisGeNET (314), TTD (17), and DrugBank (232). After checking duplications, 1996 target genes were obtained (Supplementary File Table 3). Using the Venny online mapping tool, 1996 influenza-related targets and 331 GHQWG projected targets were loaded. Following mapping, 134 intersection targets of GHQWG and influenza were obtained (Fig. 3).Figure 3Disease–drug target Venn diagram.Full size imageConstruction and analysis of GHQWG-flu-related PPI network134 intersection targets were then imported into the STRING platform to build a PPI network, yielding 109 nodes and 397 edges. The size and color of the node denoted the size of the value. The intersection targets were screened using the double median of "Degree," that is, "Degree 24." As a result, the PPI network data from the STRING11.5 database was imported into the Cytoscape 3.9.1 software for visualization (Fig. 4). The PPI analysis revealed that the therapeutic targets of GHQWG had many networks and synergistic interactions. Topological analysis showed RELA proto-oncogene, NF-kBr (RELA), tumor protein p53 (TP53), mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), AKT serinehreonine kinase 1 (AKT1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) occupy the core position in the PPI network and are considered hub genes of GHQWG against flu (Supplementary File Table 5).Figure 4Core target PPI network. As shown in the figure, the darker color of the circle is proportional to its importance in this network.Full size imageGene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysisTo study the biological activities and pathways of GHQWG against flu, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis on common targets were done. On the Metascape platform, the GO function enrichment study of the 134 core targets yielded 888 GO items, comprising 674 "Biological Processes (BP)", 80 "Cellular Components (CC)", and 134 "Molecular Functions (MF)"(Supplementary File Table 6). Based on the P value for visual analysis, the first 15 "Biological Processes" items, 10 "Cellular Components" items, and 10 "Molecular Functions" items were chosen (Fig. 5). Representative BP terms included the response to xenobiotic stimulus, positive regulation of gene expression, cellular response to cadmium ion, inflammatory response, positive regulation of the apoptotic process, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell proliferation, etc. Representative CC terms included extracellular space, macromolecular complex, membrane raft, caveola, an integral component of the plasma membrane, extracellular region, postsynaptic membrane, plasma membrane, cytosol, presynaptic membrane, etc. Representative MF terms included enzyme binding, identical protein binding, protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, heme binding, cytokine activity, G-protein coupled acetylcholine receptor activity, protein kinase binding, transcription cofactor binding, etc. In addition, 174 signal pathways were enriched (Supplementary File Table 7) by KEGG pathway analysis of the core targets using the DAVID platform (Fig. 6) representative pathways included the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, Lipid and atherosclerosis, Fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, TNF signaling pathway, Pathways in cancer, IL- 17 signaling pathway, Chagas disease, C- type lectin receptor signaling pathway, Hepatitis B, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, Prostate cancer, Chemical carcinogenesis—reactive oxygen species, Human cytomegalovirus infection, etc. In conclusion, Go and KEGG analysis highlighted that GHQWG’s anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer properties are important targets/pathways in flu treatment.Figure 5The GO function analyzes the histogram. BP is marked in teal, CC in sienna, and MF in steel blue.

The docking targets with the 8 active components with the highest degree of Quercetin, Kaempferol, Luteolin, β-Sitosterol, Wogonin, Stigmasterol, Caffeic Acid, Isorhamnetin, and the top 6 targets of degree are RELA, TP53, MAPK3, TNF, AKT1, and MAPK1 were used for molecular docking analysis. The docking results have shown the main components and hub genes have good binding activity (affinity < − 6.00 kcal/mol) (Fig. 7) and the binding energy of quercetin and hub genes was the lowest, indicating that quercetin had the strongest binding ability. Detailed information on molecular docking is shown in Table 1.Figure 7Heat map of binding energies.Full size imageTable 1 The molecular docking results of the hub genes with the main components of GHQWG.Full size tablePyMoL-1.7.2.1 and Discovery Studio 2020 were used to depict the compound-target interactions with the greatest free binding energy scores, as well as their mechanisms of binding (Fig. 8A–L). Docking results had free binding energies ranging from − 3.505 to − 9.853 kcal/mol, indicating stable binding. The free binding energy of TNF with quercetin was − 9.853 kcal/mol. Binding affinities were attributed to hydrogen bonding with TYR-199 residues van der Waals forces with LEU-94, LEU-120, TYR-59, LEU-57, GLN-61, GLY-121, LEU-120, SER-60, TYR-119 and GLR-61 residues, as well as hydrophobic interactions with LEU-57 residues of TNF (Fig. 8I,J).Figure 8Molecular docking diagram of chemical composition to target: TNF to Quercetin (2D and 3D) (A,B); AKT1 to Kaempferol (2D and 3D) (C,D); MAPK1 to Kaempferol (2D and 3D) (E,F); MAPK3 to Kaempferol (2D and 3D) (G,H); RELA to Luteolin (2D and 3D) (I,J); TP53 to Caffeic-Acid (2D and 3D) (K,L).Full size imageMolecular dynamics simulationMolecular dynamics simulations can be used to understand the stability of protein–ligand complexes. Based on the results of molecular docking, we selected the six compounds with the highest free binding energy scores as the targets of molecular dynamics simulations, namely AKT1-Kaempferol, MAPK1-Kaempferol, MAPK3-Kaempferol, RELA-Luteolin, TNF-Quercetin, and TP53-Caffeic Acid were subjected to simulation analyses of molecular dynamics for 100 ns to assess their motion, trajectory, structural features, binding potential, and conformational changes.The root mean square deviation (RMSD), which measures the degree of atom position departure from the initial position, is a useful indicator of the conformational stability of proteins and ligands. An improved conformational stability is shown by a decreased deviation. The complexes' variations in RMSD values were examined. The RMSD of the AKT1–Kaempferol complex varied early on and stabilized after 0.4 nm, as seen in Fig. 9A. Although the MAPK1–Kaempferol complex's RMSD trajectory varied between 86,000 and 90,000 ps and was largely smooth the remainder of the period (Fig. 9B), it did so. The trajectory became steady for the MAPK3–Kaempferol complex at 1 nm (Fig. 9C). The RELA–Luteolin complex's RMSD fluctuated early on before stabilizing at 48,000 ps (Fig. 9D). RMSD of the TNF-Quercetin combination has been stabilized overall (Fig. 9E). In the beginning, the RMSD of the TP53–Caffeic Acid complex varied until stabilizing at 0.4 nm (Fig. 9F).Figure 9Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) plots during of molecular dynamics simulation.

(F) The RMSD of TP53-Caffeic Acid.Full size imageThe active pockets of small molecules and proteins were found to be in a stable condition based on the RMSD values for the ligand and pocket. This shows that the protein's structure does not change considerably following the interaction with the small molecule ligand, and the combination is reasonably stable.Together, these findings resoundingly validate the docking results. Temperature and pressure have no discernible impact on the structural conformation.The stability of the target protein at the residue levelThe vibrations of each residue following chemical binding were examined as root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) in order to investigate the local fluctuations of macromolecular proteins at the residue level. RMSF can be used in molecular dynamics simulations to depict the flexibility of proteins. The medication typically has the function of stabilizing the protein and exerting the effect of enzymatic activity by binding to the protein and causing a reduction in its flexibility. Protein amino acid flexibility and motion intensity are described by RMSF throughout the simulation. The medication attaches to the protein, stabilizing it and activating enzymes, as seen in the picture, which generally makes the protein less flexible. All compounds show the same tendency when compared to the respective reference ligand, i.e., they cause some fluctuation in the same protein region (Fig. 10A–F). However, all compounds generally have high rigidity and structural stability.Figure 10MD simulates RMSF trace values of protein–ligand complexes. (A) The RMSF of AKT1-Kaempferol.

(F) The RMSF of TP53-Caffeic Acid.Full size imageAnalysis of the radius of gyrationThe radius of gyration (Rg) represents the compactness of the embodiment and can indicate the degree of system binding. Rg, as indicated in the figure, can be used to reflect the protein structure's compactness. Throughout the simulation, the structural dynamics of AKT1–Kaempferol, MAPK1–Kaempferol, and TNF–Quercetin complexes remained relatively stable (Fig. 11A,B,E). MAPK3-Kaempferol, RELA-Luteolin, and TP53-Caffeic Acid fluctuated, and the Rg value was biased (Fig. 11C,D,F), indicating that kaempferol was strongly bound to most proteins. Meanwhile, the Rg of AKT1–Kaempferol complex, MAPK1–Kaempferol complex, MAPK3–Kaempferol complex and TNF–Quercetin complex were stabilised at 2.16–2.25 nm; that of RELA–Luteolin complex was stabilised at 2.80 nm and that of TP53-Caffeic Acid was stabilised at 1.67 nm. The Rg of the RELA–Luteolin complex eventually stabilised at 2.80 nm, and that of the TP53–Caffeic Acid complex eventually stabilised at 1.67 nm.Figure 11MD simulates Rg trace values of protein–ligand complexes.

(F) The Rg of TP53-Caffeic Acid.Full size imageHydrogen bond analysisBecause hydrogen bonding is one of the most powerful non-covalent binding interactions, understanding the binding affinity between ligands and proteins is critical. The results indicated that the hydrogen bond numbers for the AKT1–Kaempferol, MAPK1–Kaempferol, MAPK3–Kaempferol, RELA–Luteolin, TNF–Quercetin, and TP53–Caffeic Acid complexes were 0–6, 0–10, 0–8, 0–8, 0–8, and 0–6, respectively (Fig. 12A–F). The number of hydrogen bonds produced by all protein–ligand complexes remains constant throughout the simulation. Furthermore, the presence of persistent amino acid residues at the active site contributes to the complex's overall structural stability.Figure 12MD simulates the number of hydrogen bonds (HBond) of protein–ligand complexes.

Because this solvent behaves differently under different conditions, it can be used to examine protein conformational dynamics in a solvent context. The contact area between the six complexes and water is comparable, and the small molecule has little effect on the protein and water effect, the results are shown in (Fig. 13A–F). The SASA values of AKT1–Kaempferol complex, TP53–Caffeic Acid complex, MAPK3–Kaempferol complex and AKT1–Kaempferol complex remained generally unchanged during the simulation, RELA–Luteolin complex decreased from the initial 230 nm2 to 195 nm2 and TNF–Quercetin complex decreased from the initial 215 nm2 to 185 nm2 during the simulation, indicating that the protein–protein interactions have little effect on the characterisation and stability of the surface of protein molecules.Figure 13MD simulates SASA of protein–ligand complexes.

Antiviral therapy can be difficult to use because of mutations and the emergence of resistance53. According to research, symptoms of influenza virus infection range from mild upper respiratory tract infections with symptoms like fever, sore throat, runny nose, cough, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue to severe and occasionally fatal pneumonia caused by the influenza virus or secondary bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract54. In some instances, infection with the influenza virus can result in a variety of non-respiratory consequences that can affect the heart, central nervous system, and other organ systems55,56, Human mortality rates and the severity of infection are frequently correlated with a lack of pre-existing immunity57. TCM has been utilized for disease prevention and treatment based on systematic multi-target/multi-component techniques for thousands of years58. TCM has long been utilized as a treatment method for illnesses connected to the flu in particular59.Based on clinical and experimental research, GHQWG is a possible therapy for influenza. The bioactive chemical components and the underlying mechanism of GHQWG's anti-flu therapeutic actions are still unknown. As a result, we employed molecular docking and a network pharmacology technique to pinpoint possible GHQWG targets and modes of action in flu.Using the ADME criteria, we screened 90 active GHQWG molecules from the TCMSP databases. Then, through GeneCards, OMIM, DisGeNET, TTD, and DrugBank, we collected 1996 targets for influenza illness. There were 134 potential GHQWG-flu targets found in all. Based on the network pharmacology analysis, the top eight active compounds of GHQWG were screened, which were quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, beta-sitosterol, wogonin, Stigmasterol, Caffeic Acid, and isorhamnetin respectively. Previous studies have proven that these chemicals are effective at treating the flu. The initial stage of influenza virus infection, which includes viral attachment, endocytosis, and viral-cell fusion, was inhibited by quercetin60. Kaempferol can prevent the replication and autophagy caused by the influenza A virus61. Luteolin reduces influenza virus production. A virus in vitro by preventing the production of the coat protein I complex62. Strong In Vitro Antiviral Activity of β-Sitosterol Against Influenza A Viruses63. Wogonin has strong anti-influenza properties that are controlled by AMPK activation64. Treatment with isorhamnetin can minimize the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) brought on by viruses, block the acidification of cytoplasmic lysosomes and the lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-B (LC3B), and stop influenza viruses from replicating65. Studies have shown that Stigmasterol is the major anti-hemagglutinin binding component and inhibits the spread of influenza virus by inhibiting the activity of influenza virus neuraminidase and preventing the release of viral particles from infected cells66. Therefore, based on the above findings, we can find that the active ingredients of GHQWG have an inhibitory effect on influenza virus.The results of the GO functional analysis demonstrated that a variety of biological processes, including the response to xenobiotic stimulus, positive regulation of gene expression, cellular response to cadmium ion, inflammatory response, positive regulation of the apoptotic process, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell proliferation, etc., were connected to the effects of GHQWG in influenza. Influenza A virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta is vital in the host's antiviral protection by activating the expression of antiviral Mx, PKR, and oligoadenylate synthetase genes. IFN-alpha/beta increases T cell survival as well, upregulates IL-12 and IL-18 receptor gene expression and together with IL-18 stimulates NK and T cell IFN-gamma production and the development of Th1-type immune response67. The targets in this study were enriched in immune-related and inflammatory pathways, such as IL-17 signaling pathways, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways, and TNF signaling pathways. Previous research has shown that inhibiting intraepithelial TNF- signaling prevents CD8 T-cell-mediated lung injury during influenza infection68. In a clinical study, it was found that children with influenza A virus pneumonia had higher serum levels of the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17)69, which is essential for mediating the immune response to extracellular bacteria and fungus in the lung70. Results from an in vivo study revealed that compared to infected wild-type controls, H5N1-infected IL-17 knockout (KO) mice lose weight much more quickly, exhibit more pronounced lung immunopathology, and pass away much sooner. Additionally, B cell density in the lung was drastically decreased in IL-17 KO mice following viral infection. In cultured B cells from IL-17 KO mice, chemokine-mediated migration was significantly reduced. These findings demonstrate that IL-17 is crucial for promoting the migration of B cells to the site of mouse lung influenza virus infection70. Influenza mouse lung injury is lessened by epithelial TNF signaling pathway modification because it lowers epithelial chemokine expression and lung inflammatory infiltration71,72. TNF triggers the expression of inflammatory genes, which directly triggers inflammatory responses, but it also indirectly triggers cell death, inflammatory immune responses, and the development of diseases73.Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to examine six major target proteins (RELA, TP53, MAPK3, TNF, AKT1, and MAPK1) and active chemicals obtained from TCMSP, including quercetin, Kaempferol, Luteolin, β-Sitosterol, wogonin, Stigmasterol, Caffeic Acid, and Isorhamnetin. Binding affinities for docking data ranged from − 3.880 to − 9.853 kcal/mol, indicating that all of the targets may be capable of docking with active molecules. Among the six target proteins, TNF and AKT1 had the lowest binding affinities. quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin demonstrated good binding activity to the targets, implying that these chemicals may contribute to GHQWG's therapeutic benefits in flu. More experimental research is needed, however, to confirm and examine the hypothesized targets and regulatory processes.Finally, we selected the six compounds with the highest free binding energy scores as the targets of molecular dynamics simulations, namely AKT1-Kaempferol, MAPK1-Kaempferol, MAPK3-Kaempferol, RELA-Luteolin, TNF-Quercetin, and TP53-Caffeic Acid were subjected to simulation analyses of molecular dynamics to further verify it. The results showed that kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, and caffeic acid were able to tightly dock to the individual targets and quickly reached steady state.It should be noted that there were some restrictions on this study. The reliability and accuracy of the predictions were therefore dependent on the quality of the data because both bioactive chemicals and target information were first gathered from the literature and databases. Second, this study employed a data mining methodology, and additional research using clinical trials and animals is required to validate the results.ConclusionFor the treatment of the flu, this is the first time that bioinformatics techniques like network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics modeling have been used to systematically study the pharmacological and molecular mechanism of action of GHQWG. These bioinformatic and computational investigations showed that the primary constituents of GHQWG with therapeutic actions against the flu may include quercetin, kaempferol, kuteolin, β-sitosterol , wogonin, stigmasterol, caffeic Acid, and Isorhamnetin. Additionally, GHQWG can treat the flu by lowering pathologic harm, inflammatory reactions, and oxidative stress via several channels, including TNF and IL-17.Overall, the present study concentrated on the multi-component and multi-pathway nature of GHQWG and its mode of action. These results are anticipated to guide the use of GHQWG and its continued development for the treatment of flu.Strengths and limitationsNotably, our study provided some fresh insights into GHQWG in flu therapy and revealed feasible biochemical pathways and potential pharmacological targets of GHQWG for the first time. However, a few difficulties with our study's limitations must be addressed. Because the findings of this study were not confirmed in genuine flu patients, future confirmation of these findings will necessitate the recruitment of actual flu patients. Second, additional in vivo and in vitro research are required to confirm the predicted mechanisms and pharmacological targets in order to confirm the potential therapeutic applicability of GHQWG for flu.

The latest COVID-19 boosters will be tailored to the newest variants and will continue to utilize mRNA technology (at least the Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s formulations). The CDC is recommending that all individuals aged 6 months and older get the updated COVID-19 booster, especially those at higher risk, such as the elderly and immunocompromised. The aim is to reduce severe illness, hospitalization, and potential strain on healthcare resources. CDC Recommends Updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 and Flu Vaccines for Fall/Winter Virus Season This year’s flu shot, updated to target the most prevalent strains, is advised for everyone aged 6 months and older. For those over 65 or with underlying health conditions, the high-dose or adjuvanted versions are recommended for added protection. The flu vaccine is critical in reducing the overall burden of illness and preventing complications like pneumonia and heart attacks. Vaccination is still the cornerstone of our defense against these seasonal threats. By staying up-to-date with both the COVID-19 booster and influenza vaccine this fall we can reduce the spread of these viruses, protect vulnerable populations, and maintain a healthier community. Note: As of early July, COVID-19 surveillance data indicates a noticeable uptick in emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations. In the past month, the number of COVID-related ER visits has increased by 25%, while hospitalizations have risen by 20%. However, the public health impact remains modest compared to what we experienced in 2020 and 2021. For example, over the past four weeks, approximately 0.9% of emergency department visits in Arizona have been due to COVID-19. Related Post 03 Feb Disease Control . Vaccination .

Public Health, 10 July 2024 Sec. Children and Health Volume 12 - 2024 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1404506 Parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward vaccinating their children against influenza: a cross-sectional study from China Shufeng HeCaijin ZhuXiaoyan LiuYanling Wang* Department of Infection Disease, Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Child Health, Guangzhou, China Aims: Influenza infection is a health burden in children, and the influenza vaccine is an important prevention strategy for flu illness. Parents play a crucial role in children’s influenza vaccination. The study aimed to assess parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to influenza illness for their children and explore factors that may impact their decisions. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou from November 2022 to April 2023. Answers to KAP questions regarding influenza illness and vaccination were summed, with a total KAP score of 20. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and linear regression models were conducted to explore the factors associated with influenza vaccination. The results were presented as odds ratios (ORs), β, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Overall, 530 parents were respondents, of whom 162 (30.56%) had vaccinated their children during the past year. The mean KAP score (standard deviation) was 13.40 (3.57). Compared to parents who reported non-vaccinated for their children in the past year, the parents who reported an influenza vaccination have higher knowledge scores, attitude scores, practice scores, and total scores. Child body mass index, parental education level (under college), parental work (part-time), and more than two family members over 60 years old were negatively correlated with knowledge score. Child health condition and knowledge score were positively correlated with attitude score. Parental age was negatively associated with attitude score. Conclusion: Though high awareness about influenza illness and vaccination for parents, the coverage rate of influenza vaccination in children was lower in Guangzhou. Implementing public health policies is necessary to spread knowledge about influenza illness and vaccination and to promote the practice of receiving the influenza vaccine in children. Education campaigns would help change the attitudes of parents toward vaccinating their children against the flu. Introduction Influenza is a common and serious infection marked by fever, cough, sore throat, chills, muscle ache, and general malaise (1, 2). It affects both adults and children, with children having a higher seasonal prevalence (20–30%) (3). Annually, influenza leads to up to 35,000 influenza-virus acute lower respiratory tract infection-associated deaths in children under 5 worldwide, posing a significant societal burden (4). Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against the flu, especially in children, significantly reducing infection risk, severe complications, hospitalizations, and deaths (1, 5). Many countries, such as China, prioritize vaccinating children aged 6 months to 18 years (6). However, in China, vaccination coverage for children is low, approximately 11.9%, compared to higher rates in developed nations such as Europe and the United States (6–8). Parents play a crucial role in deciding whether their children get vaccinated against influenza. Their understanding and attitudes toward vaccination are key influencers (9, 10). Misconceptions about vaccine safety and effectiveness, concerns about side effects, and insufficient awareness about vaccination’s importance contribute to parental vaccine hesitancy (11, 12). Additionally, cultural beliefs, socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and information sources shape parental vaccination decisions (13–15). This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of parents regarding the influenza vaccine for their children and explore factors that may impact their decisions. Methods Study design, setting, and participants From November 2022 to April 2023, parental caregivers of children aged 6 months to 18 years, who were treated at the department of infection disease of a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, were selected as participants for this cross-sectional study. Exclusion criteria included (1) children aged <6 months or > 18 years old (2) missing information on influenza vaccination within the past year (3) individuals with allergies to the influenza vaccine or contraindication, and (4) individuals who were unable to complete the questionnaire due to writing or hearing disability. At the department of infection disease in a selected tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, the investigator conducted face-to-face questionnaire surveys with parents in the waiting and observation rooms. All investigators were qualified and trained medical professionals, including physicians and nurses, who were required to work conscientiously. Sample size calculation was performed using the PASS 11.0 version, yielding an optimal size of 554, considering a 5% margin of error, a 95% confidence level, and a conservative estimate of vaccination coverage at 11.9% (7). Taking into account a shedding rate of 10%, a total sample size of 675 was needed for this survey. Finally, 619 parents participated in the study. Measurement tools The survey included demographic information and influenza history for both children and parents. For children, socio-demographic details encompassed gender, age, height, weight, race, education level, health condition, and health insurance. Influenza history covered the children’s influenza history, that of their friends, their COVID-19 history, allergies to influenza vaccination, and contraindications for influenza vaccination. For parents, socio-demographic data included parental role, age, residence, marital status, education level, income, work, health condition, health insurance, and the presence of more than two family members over 60 years old in their household. Parents reported their influenza vaccination status. Influenza cases were diagnosed based on criteria established by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (16). After reviewing relevant literature, a KAP questionnaire was developed and adapted to the local culture and context in Chinese (17, 18). The KAP questionnaire consists of 20 items derived from the literature review, with 7 items for Knowledge, 9 items for Attitude, and 4 items for Practice. Each correct response in the Knowledge section was assigned one point, while incorrect or “I do not know” responses received zero points. Participants were categorized based on their knowledge scores into poor knowledge (0–2), moderate knowledge (3–4), and high knowledge (5–7) groups. Attitude scores were based on varying response scales, including a 7-point disagree to agree scale, with one point awarded for each “Yes” response and zero points for “No” or “I do not know” answers. The Practice section included four statements related to influenza vaccination practices. Scores for the total questionnaire and each section ranged from 0 to 20, such as 0 to 7 for Knowledge, 0 to 9 for Attitude, and 0 to 4 for Practice. The Cronbach’s α coefficient for the KAP questionnaire was 0.71. Ethical consideration The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committees of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University [No. 2022-257A01]. Written consent was obtained from all parents before filling out the questionnaires. Statistical analysis Categorical variables were described using numbers and percentages, and a comparison between the two groups was made using the chi-square tests and Fisher exact tests. The normality of quantitative data was tested using skewness and kurtosis, and the equality of variances was tested using Levene’s tests. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviation. Statistical differences between the two groups were detected utilizing Student’s t-test and Satterthwaite’s t-test for homogeneity and heterogeneity quantitative data. Potential covariates were identified using univariate logistic regression models and univariate linear regression analysis. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and linear regression models were conducted to explore the factors associated with influenza vaccination in children’s parents. The results were reported as odds ratios (ORs), β, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1 (2023–06–16 ucrt). A two-tailed p-value of <0.50 was considered statistically significant. Results Characteristics of parents and children Out of 619 questionnaires distributed, 89 were excluded due to missing information on influenza vaccination within the past year (n = 69), and allergies or contraindications to the influenza vaccine (n = 20). The characteristics of children and parents are shown in Tables 1, 2, respectively. Among the 530 respondents, 368 (69.43%) did not administer influenza vaccination to their children. The mean age of vaccinated children was 4.77 (3.49) years old. Out of the 530 included parents, 426 (80.38%) were mothers. The average age of parents was 34.06 (5.31) years old. Parents possessing a college education level accounted for 283 (53.4%). Concerning those without influenza vaccination, children with influenza vaccination were younger on average, and so smaller, with lower weight, with lower education level, and with younger parents on average (all p < 0.05). Table 1 Table 1. Characteristics for children with and without influenza vaccination within the past year. Table 2 Table 2. Characteristics for parents with and without influenza vaccination for their children within the past year. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of parents regarding the influenza vaccine for their children Table 3 shows the KAP scores for responses to influenza vaccination. The mean KAP score was 13.40 (3.57). The scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 5.77 (1.29), 7.26 (2.10), and 1.68 (1.69), respectively. Compared to parents who reported without vaccinating their children against influenza in the past year, parents who reported an influenza vaccination have higher scores for knowledge, attitudes, practices, and total score (all p < 0.001). The distributions of scores for KAP are presented in Figure 1. Interestingly, despite reported high knowledge and attitude scores, the practice score remained low. Furthermore, 238 (44.9%) respondents have a practice score of 0. Table 3 Table 3. Scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice for parents. Figure 1 Figure 1. Distribution of KAP scores. A total of 450 (84.91%) parents showed a high knowledge level toward influenza vaccination. The most correctly answered knowledge-related question was “Influenza can spread from person to person” with 506 (95.47%). Table 4 shows the questions of the knowledge section as well as the frequency of response for each question. Table 4 Table 4. Frequency of response for each question on knowledge reported by parents. The questions about vaccine willingness and vaccine hesitancy are shown in Tables 5, 6, respectively. The table shows that 478 (90.19%) respondents regarded the vaccine as necessary, and 376 (70.94%) of respondents were planning to give their children the influenza vaccine. A total of 440 (83.02%) respondents were willing to pay the price of the influenza vaccine for their children, and 478 (90.19%) agreed to vaccinate their children if it was free of charge. In addition, 428 (80.75%) respondents thought it is safe to vaccinate children against influenza according to China’s standard immunization schedule. A total of 446 (84.15%) believed the flu vaccination was effective. Table 5 Table 5. Frequency of response for each question on vaccine willing reported by parents. Table 6 Table 6. Frequency of response for each question on vaccine hesitancy reported by parents. In total, 162 (30.56%) respondents reported vaccinating their children against influenza in the past year. The data distribution on four items in practices is presented in Figure 2. Among the respondents, 106 (27.9%) vaccinated their children against influenza occasionally, 134 (25.3%) vaccinated their children every year, and 215 (40.6%) never had their children vaccinated. Parents who got their children vaccinated against influenza were mainly driven by their decisions. Parents who did not administer the influenza vaccine to their children stated lack of recommendation by health providers as the most common reason (28.80%). Figure 2 Figure 2. Distribution of four items in practice score. (A) The distribution of answers to the question “Have you had your child vaccinated against the flu in the last three years”. (B) The distribution of answers to the question “Why are you taking your child for a flu shot”. (C) The distribution of answers to the question “What is the reason for not taking your child for the flu vaccine”. Factors associated with children receiving influenza vaccination In Supplementary Table S1, a high attitude score was associated with higher odds of children receiving the influenza vaccine (OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.05 to 1.31). Knowledge score was marginal significance with odds of children receiving the influenza vaccine (OR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.00 to 1.43). Child body mass index (BMI) (β = −0.02, 95%CI: −0.04 to −0.01), parental education level (under college) (β = −1.34, 95%CI: −1.98 to −0.71), parental with part-time work (β = −0.29, 95%CI: −0.51 to −0.07), and more than two family members over 60 years old (β = −0.28, 95%CI: −0.49 to −0.07) were negatively correlated with knowledge score. Child health condition (β = 0.28, 95%CI: 0.10 to 0.47) and knowledge score (β = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.20 to 0.33) have a positive correlation with attitude score. Parental age (β = −0.02, 95%CI: −0.04 to −0.01) was negatively associated with attitude score, indicating that the younger the parents, the higher the score in vaccine attitudes. Influencing factors on knowledge score and attitude score are presented in Tables 7, 8, respectively. Table 7 Table 7. Influencing factors on knowledge score reported by parents. Table 8 Table 8. Influencing factors on attitude score reported by parents. Discussion Our study found most parents had a high knowledge level and positive attitudes toward influenza vaccination, while only 30.56% of parents reported vaccinating their children against influenza in the past year. The results indicated a gap between parents’ intention and their actual vaccination behaviors in the realm of healthcare practices. The primary reason cited for not vaccinating was the absence of a recommendation. Parental knowledge significantly influences the intentions regarding children’s flu vaccination, as supported by Zhao et al. (19). A survey conducted in the Nanhai district of China showed a positive association between heightened levels of influenza knowledge and previous influenza information with a willingness to vaccinate (11). Our study found that children’s BMI, parental education level, parental with part-time work, and having more than two family members over 60 years old were negatively related to knowledge score. Individuals with higher BMI often face social stigma and discrimination, potentially resulting in diminished health literacy and participation in preventative health practices (20). Therefore, these parents might have limited vaccination knowledge, leading to lower knowledge scores. Parental education level has been linked to decreased knowledge regarding vaccinations (21). Parents with lower education levels may have limited access to credible health information sources, impeding their ability to obtain accurate knowledge on influenza vaccination for their children. Moreover, parental part-time work and having two or more people over 60 years old in the household may contribute to lower knowledge scores due to time constraints and competing responsibilities. The presence of older adult family members may divert parents’ focus and time away from seeking vaccination information. Given the limited knowledge about influenza vaccination among Chinese parents, it is crucial for the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to offer comprehensive and accessible information to address this gap. The majority of parents had favorable opinions toward the influenza vaccine. Parents showed high willingness (70.94%) to vaccinate their children against influenza in our study, indicating that China has done quite well in the publicity and implementation of the law on the prevention and control of infectious diseases (15). Moreover, our study found positive correlations of knowledge score, the health status of children with attitude score. Parental knowledge plays a crucial role in vaccination decision-making (22). Parents who possess accurate knowledge are more inclined to comprehend the advantages of influenza vaccination and make well-informed decisions for their children (10). Parents with children in good health may have had positive experiences with previous vaccinations, which influence their perspectives and beliefs regarding the effectiveness and significance of vaccines (23). A negative relationship was reported between parental age and knowledge score, as supported by Alenazi (22). Younger parents demonstrated higher scores in attitude categories due to their increased internet exposure, which facilitated access to online influenza-related information. Moreover, our findings indicated that as knowledge improved, attitudes became increasingly optimistic (24–26). Only 30.56% of parents reported influenza vaccination for their children in the past year, which is lower compared to rates in various nations such as the U.S. (27), United Kingdom (28), Italy (29), and Saudi Arabia (22). The recommendations provided by physicians were crucial in promoting influenza vaccination among children (30, 31). A survey conducted in the U.S. showed that healthcare provider recommendations significantly influenced the uptake of influenza vaccine in children aged 9–13 years (32). Consequently, stakeholders should educate healthcare professionals about the guidelines for influenza immunization and enhance their knowledge on the subject. The commonly cited reason (28.80%) for parents not taking their children for influenza vaccination was the absence of recommendations, indicating the necessity to promote influenza vaccination. Media can be utilized more effectively to spread information about influenza illness and vaccination as it is an effective tool in increasing vaccination rates in children (33). Additionally, parents’ apprehension regarding potential side effects of the vaccine presented a barrier to childhood influenza vaccination, with various studies identifying concerns about vaccine safety as the primary reason for refusing vaccination (34, 35). The status of influenza vaccination in children is suboptimal, indicating that healthcare providers should focus on improving the situation. Strategies should not only involve providing information but also address parent’s attitudes and concerns. Targeted intervention measures should be implemented based on influencing factors and individual characteristics of health education. Moreover, healthcare providers, serving as a vital and trustworthy source of vaccine-related information for the public, could benefit from additional training in professional ethics and specialized knowledge to enhance parental awareness (36, 37). Several limitations should be recognized in the study. First, the study used a cross-sectional design with respondents sampled solely from one hospital. Future studies should encompass larger and multi-center samples. Second, health conditions for parents and children were obtained by self-reported, leading to response bias. Finally, the majority of parents were women (80.38%), raising concerns about gender bias. The extent to which decision-making regarding children’s influenza vaccination may vary between fathers and mothers remains uncertain. Conclusion While there is increased awareness among parents about influenza vaccination, only 30.56% of them reported vaccinating their children against influenza in the past year. This underscores the need for interventions to boost vaccination rates, addressing not only knowledge and attitudes but also practical barriers that hinder parents from vaccinating their children. Strategies could involve targeted educational initiatives, enhanced access to vaccination services, and assistance for parents in scheduling and attending vaccination appointments. Encouraging physician recommendations for the influenza vaccine is vital and should be promoted in healthcare centers, clinics, and hospitals.

When doctors recommend and offer these vaccines, more pregnant people get vaccinated, which keeps them and their babies safe from these serious illnesses. The Importance of Maternal Vaccines Pregnant people or their babies are at increased risk for COVID-19, Influenza, RSV, and Pertussis complications. Immunization rates for these vaccines are low, leaving many pregnant people or their infants unprotected against these serious vaccine-preventable diseases. Studies confirm that your recommendation and offer of vaccines are essential. One study showed that patients who were offered influenza vaccination during an office visit were seven times more likely to be vaccinated for influenza than patients who reported their provider did not recommend or offer vaccination. Patients who received a recommendation alone were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those that received no recommendation.1 Assuring your patients are protected by recommended vaccines is key. Each vaccine recommended for pregnant people is important for the protection of the patient and/or their baby. Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) Pertussis is on the rise and outbreaks are happening across the United States. On average, about 1,000 infants are hospitalized and typically between five and 15 infants die each year in the United States. Most of these deaths are among infants who are too young to be protected by the childhood pertussis vaccine series that starts when infants are 2 months old. These first few months of life are when infants are at the greatest risk of contracting pertussis and having severe, potentially life-threatening complications from the infection. Fewer babies will be hospitalized for and die from pertussis when Tdap is given during pregnancy rather than during the postpartum period. When Tdap is given during pregnancy, antibodies are passed from the pregnant parent to the developing baby providing protection. Postpartum Tdap administration does not provide protection to the infant, who is most vulnerable to the disease’s serious complications. Influenza (inactivated) Influenza is more likely to cause illness that results in hospitalization in pregnant people than in people of reproductive age who are not pregnant. Influenza also may be harmful for the developing baby. A common influenza sign can be fever, which has been associated in some studies with neural tube defects and other adverse outcomes for a developing baby. Getting vaccinated while pregnant also can help protect a baby from influenza after birth (because antibodies are passed from the pregnant parent to the developing baby during pregnancy). People who get the influenza vaccine while pregnant or breastfeeding also develop antibodies against influenza that they can share with their infants through their breast milk. COVID-19 People who are pregnant are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 compared to those who are not pregnant. They are more likely to need hospitalization, intensive care, or the use of a ventilator or special equipment to breathe if they do get sick from COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 illness can lead to death. There is also an increased risk of complications that can affect a patient’s pregnancy and baby including, preterm birth or stillbirth. COVID-19 vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death for both your patient and their baby. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness and is the most common cause of hospitalization in infants. It causes annual outbreaks of respiratory illnesses in all age groups. In most regions of the United States, RSV season starts in the fall and peaks in the winter, but the timing and severity of RSV season in a given community can vary from year to year. Generally, there are two options to protect infants from RSV: either maternal RSV vaccination or infant immunization with nirsevimab (RSV monoclonal antibody). RSV vaccination is recommended for pregnant people at 32 through 36 weeks gestation, and it is administered seasonally from September through January in most of the continental United States*. Nirsevimab is recommended for all infants under 8 months of age who are born shortly before or during their first RSV season, and it is administered seasonally from October through March in most of the continental United States*.

Providers in jurisdictions with RSV seasonality that differs from most of the continental United States (e.g., Alaska, jurisdiction with tropical climate) should follow guidance from public health authorities (e.g., CDC, health departments) or regional medical centers on timing of administration based on local RSV seasonality. Although optimal timing of administration is just before the start of the RSV season, nirsevimab may also be administered during the RSV season to infants and children who are age-eligible.

The network brings together experts from various disciplines, including the human/animal interface, applied epidemiology, and socioeconomics as well as dedicated groups on avian, wildlife, equine and swine influenza.The network plays a crucial role in enhancing global preparedness and response to influenza outbreaks. By convening its experts, it strengthens collaborations that are crucial to addressing the challenges ahead.Although OFFLU, FAO and WOAH have hosted numerous meetings related to the unprecedented increase in avian influenza, the previous OFFLU meeting that brought together all groups was held in April 2018 in Brighton, UK. This latest meeting seeks to review the modus operandi of the network and update how the groups work, both independently and together. Additionally, it seeks to strengthen collaboration and networking among OFFLU members across the various activities by identifying synergies and overlaps to optimize the support OFFLU can give to stakeholders involved in influenza management at the global, regional, and national levels.By pooling representatives from organizations such as FAO, WOAH, World Health Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, The European Food Safety Authority, Health for Animals, and the VIVACE Consortium, the meeting presented a valuable opportunity to advance global efforts in influenza control. The outputs from this meeting will feed into the Global HPAI Strategy and the Quadripartite One Health Joint Plan of Action, ultimately contributing to strengthened global preparedness and response and safeguarding animal health, public health and food security.

Veterinary pathologist Betsy Elsmo learned that a local wildlife rehabilitation center was caring for foxes with neurological symptoms like seizures, tremors, uncoordinated movements and lethargy. But tests for common pathogens like canine distemper virus and rabies that typically cause the symptoms came back negative. Then a red fox kit tested positive for influenza A. This group of viruses includes seasonal flus that cause respiratory disease in people and many other strains that commonly circulate among animals such as waterfowl and other birds. Tell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now “I was surprised,” says Elsmo, of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “And to be honest, at first I kind of wrote it off.” That is, until a veterinary technician at the rehab center sent Elsmo a study describing cases of avian influenza in red foxes in the Netherlands. Examinations of the Wisconsin kit’s tissues under the microscope revealed lesions in the brain, lung and heart that matched what had been seen in the Netherlands animals. “And I thought, I think it is [bird flu],” she recalls. The ongoing bird flu pandemic has revealed that H5N1 can infect a wide array of mammal species, including the red fox.S.J. Krasemann/Getty Images Additional testing confirmed the diagnosis in the kit and the other foxes, Elsmo and colleagues reported in the December 2023 Emerging Infectious Diseases. The animals had contracted a lethal strain of H5N1 avian influenza that emerged in late 2020 in Europe and has since spread around the world. At the time infections were discovered in the Wisconsin red foxes, bird flu was expanding its incursion into North America. Since H5N1 arrived on North American shores in December 2021, it has infected animals as wide-ranging as polar bears, skunks, sea lions, bottlenosed dolphins and cows (SN: 7/8/24). And one unwelcome revelation of the ongoing outbreak is the virus’s propensity to invade the brains of myriad mammals. Bird flu on the brain H5N1 is now known to infect more than 50 mammal species. Scientists had documented bird flu cases in only about a dozen species during previous outbreaks. There’s nothing particularly special about this strain that allows it to plague so many species, research suggests. Rather, because the strain has spread so far and wide among birds — both wild and domesticated — there are simply more opportunities for mammals to be exposed, says virologist Emmie de Wit of the National Institutes of Health’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont. (SN: 1/25/24). For some mammals, infected birds may be on the menu. For others, their water or food might be contaminated with virus-laden bird excrement. Water-loving birds are exposed to influenza A viruses so often that most have some form of immunity that can protect them from a serious case of H5N1. If the birds do exhibit symptoms, they are usually mild and respiratory or gastrointestinal in nature. But other birds that don’t get infected as frequently, such as eagles, vultures and pelicans, can become severely ill and die. In mammals, bird flu typically causes respiratory symptoms such as congestion or shortness of breath. Neurological symptoms such as seizures or paralysis are among the most striking and common signs that the virus has reached the brain. And once it does, the infection is often fatal. In the ongoing H5N1 outbreak, such cases have been confirmed posthumously in house cats, raccoons, sea lions, dolphins and several other species (SN: 5/31/24). Sponsor Message Mammal infections From a bottlenosed dolphin in Florida to a polar bear in Alaska, many mammals across the United States have tested positive for avian influenza since 2022. Click on a colored dot to find out what species the virus was detected in and the county in which the animals were found. Zoom in for a closer look. H5N1 and its close relatives have an easier path to the brain compared with other flu strains, de Wit says. And the virus is exceptionally good at making copies of itself inside a variety of cells, including nerve cells. To break inside a cell, flu viruses exploit a protein called sialic acid on the cell’s surface. Bird cells and mammalian cells in the upper airway typically have different types of sialic acids, which means that bird flu viruses don’t easily infect mammals and vice versa. But studies have shown that parts of the human brain, for instance, are covered in birdlike sialic acid proteins. Many cells, including the nerve cells in the olfactory bulb — which is important for sense of smell and links directly to the brain — also have additional proteins that allow H5 viruses to replicate. Both of those traits mean that “there’s a direct entry route [to the brain] from your nose,” de Wit says. So avian flu viruses may pose a bigger threat to the brain than, say, seasonal influenzas that mostly target cells in the nose, throat and lungs. Since 2003, there have been 891 cases of H5N1 in people, about half of which were fatal according to the World Health Organization. In the current outbreak, 15 people have been infected with the strain hitting mammals hard. Four people had severe disease — two developed pneumonia — and at least one died. Symptoms in people can vary from mild to severe, and some individuals infected with avian influenza viruses during previous outbreaks have developed neurological symptoms. Such cases are rare, the agency says, although how often the virus makes it to the brain is unclear. How often the virus invades the brains of other mammals is also unknown. Most countries don’t regularly test healthy-looking wildlife for viral infections, so such cases likely represent only the sickest individuals, Elsmo says. It’s possible that some infected animals never develop severe disease and therefore escape the notice of people. Avian influenza viruses can affect other parts of the body as well. “When you break it out by species, it seems like the pattern of tissues that are most affected are little bit different,” Elsmo says. For instance, foxes and raccoons seem to have severe brain lesions as well as lesions in the heart and lungs. Striped skunks, meanwhile, tend to have few brain lesions, some of which are mild compared with red foxes. Instead, at least in Elsmo’s experience, H5N1 seems to target the skunk livers and organs in the lymphoid system, which protects against infection and removes waste from the body. Stranger things Some animals that have been killed by H5N1 weirdly had signs of infection only in the brain. “Flu’s a respiratory virus,” says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. “So [the respiratory system is] where it should be before anywhere else.” The brain of a red fox in the Netherlands, for instance, was infected with H5N1 but not the animal’s lungs. Red foxes and mink in Canada similarly had mostly neurological disease. And bird flu didn’t seem to touch the lungs of a bottlenosed dolphin found off the coast of Florida in 2022, despite the animal having virus-infected brain tissue, Webby and colleagues reported April 18 in Communications Biology. It’s possible that the dolphin had cleared the respiratory infection before it died, but the team found no evidence of pulmonary disease. Nor do dolphins have a sense of smell, which eliminates the possibility that the virus could reach the brain through the nose. Exactly how the virus might sometimes sidestep respiratory tissues and hitch a ride directly to the brain is unclear. One possibility is that H5N1 already has that ability. “Maybe it was more common, but we just never had the numbers [of mammalian infections necessary] to see it,” Webby says. Or perhaps when a mammal like a red fox or a dolphin takes a bite out of an infected bird, viral particles in the meat gain a direct path to the brain via nerves lining the mouth and digestive tract. Virologist and veterinarian Víctor Neira thinks that’s what may be happening in some sea lions in Chile. He and colleagues investigated an outbreak in the animals in 2023 along the coast of Chile, including two animals that the team necropsied. Although one animal didn’t have neurological symptoms, the other had paralysis, disorientation, lack of coordination and tremors, the researchers reported in October 2023 in Veterinary Quarterly. The virus had infected multiple organs including the lungs, liver and kidneys, but the highest viral counts came from the brain. Because H5N1 hasn’t been infecting sea lions for very long, since just 2023, there is still a lot to learn about how the virus affects the animals, says Neira, of the University of Chile in Santiago. Just how many mammal species are susceptible to infection is an open question. “Usually, scientists study influenza virus in swine, mice, humans and birds,” Neira says. “Different wild animals, even several domestic animals, have not been studied with this virus.” There’s an urgency to finding out. That’s because every infection gives the virus an opportunity to adapt in ways that could allow it to spread more readily among mammals, de Wit says. Some research suggests that the virus may be spreading from marine mammal to marine mammal in parts of South America. But so far, infections in other animals are largely dead ends, with no spread to other individuals. The risk to people remains low, although workers on poultry and cattle farms who work closely with animals are at a higher risk than the general public. Still, “we cannot stop paying attention,” de Wit says. The ongoing outbreak serves as a reminder that viruses are versatile foes. Questions or comments on this article?

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Cold & Flu Prevention Understanding Flu Vaccine Effectiveness The flu vaccine reduces risk of illness, hospitalization and death By Kelly Burch Updated on July 09, 2024 Medically reviewed by Mary Choy, PharmD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Effectiveness Now Reasons to Get a Shot Efficacy Factors Types Effectiveness Over Time Side Effects Frequently Asked Questions Close While flu vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year, research shows that flu vaccines are typically between 40% and 60% effective during years when the most prevalent flu strains match the strains in the vaccine. This means the vaccine reduces your risk of catching the flu by 40% to 60%. The vaccine also reduces the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages 6 months and over gets the flu vaccine (with very rare exceptions).Various different flu vaccines are available, but all of them protect against the same strains of flu. Here’s what you should know about flu vaccine effectiveness and types of flu vaccines. Verywell / Theresa Chiechi Flu Vaccine Effectiveness for 2023–2024 Season Each year, the flu vaccine is designed to protect against the flu strains that scientists believe will be most common. However, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine depends on which flu strains are most prevalent and how they compare to the strains that the vaccine protects against. Because of this, flu vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year. Scientists don’t yet have final estimates for the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for the 2023–2024 season, but preliminary data show a range of 33%-49% effectiveness in adults. Flu Tests: Who Should Test and When? During Past Flu Seasons The CDC tracks seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness each year. Over the past 17 years, the highest effectiveness was in the 2010-2011 season, when it was 60% effective. Here are the effectiveness rates over the past six seasons for which data are available: 2016–2017: 40%2017–2018: 38%2018–2019: 29%2019–2020: 39%2021-2022: 36%2022-2023: 44% During the 2020–2021 flu season, the CDC didn’t estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine because transmission of the flu was historically low, likely due to COVID-19 precautions that also protect against the flu. What to Avoid After Flu Shot (and Do Instead) Reasons to Consider Getting a Flu Vaccine The flu vaccine (flu shot or nasal spray vaccine) significantly reduces the risk of contracting the flu. Consider the 2019–2020 season: People who had the vaccine were 39% less likely to get the flu than those who did not. In addition to preventing illness, the flu vaccine also reduces the risk of hospitalization and death. Here’s what researchers have found about the flu vaccine: Getting the vaccine reduces the risk of intensive-care unit (ICU) hospitalization by 26% and the risk of death by 31%, according to a 2021 study.Among adults who are hospitalized for the flu, people who are vaccinated are 59% less likely to need intensive care unit (ICU) care, according to a 2018 study. People with heart disease who get the vaccine are less likely to experience cardiac events.People with diabetes and chronic lung disease who get the vaccine are less likely to be hospitalized for those conditions. Pregnant people who get the vaccine are 40% less likely to be hospitalized for flu than pregnant people who did not get the vaccine. In addition to protecting you, getting the flu vaccine can keep you from contracting the flu and passing it to others, including infants and the elderly, who are at higher risks for complications. Pregnant people who get the vaccine help protect their baby from the flu (passing on the protective antibodies developed by the vaccine), which can be valuable during the first six months of life when a child is not able to be vaccinated. Can a Rash Be a Symptom of the Flu? Flu Vaccine Efficacy Factors There are a number of factors that influence how effective the flu vaccine is every year. The most important is strain matching—whether the strains that the vaccine protects against match the most widely circulating flu strains during a given season. In addition to the construction of the vaccine, there are more personal factors that influence vaccine effectiveness. Strain Matching To decide which strains are covered by the flu vaccine, data on flu infections are collected from around the globe. Using that, the World Health Organization (WHO) meets twice a year to decide which strains to focus on in the vaccines. For the Northern Hemisphere, the WHO makes a recommendation in February. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the final say in which strains are included in the vaccine. The decision about which strains to include is based on projections that are made using past data. This gives time to manufacture the vaccine. Vaccine Timing It takes two weeks for the flu vaccine to become optimally effective. Because of that, the CDC recommends that all people get the flu vaccine during September or October, before flu infections become widespread. Getting the vaccine too late can leave you exposed to early infection from the flu. On the other hand, vaccine protection begins to wane after several months. Adults ages 65 and older are generally not vaccinated early (July or August) due to this. The CDC recommends the vaccine (even later in the season) for people who didn't get vaccinated in by October since flu can spread throughout the spring. Age CDC data show that within a given year, the protection that the flu vaccine offers can vary based on age due to immune changes over time. There’s no way to predict which age groups the flu vaccine will be most or least effective for in a given season. The CDC recommends that people age 65 and older receive a higher-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine. Health Vaccines rely on a person's immune system responding to the vaccine by producing antibodies, which are proteins that have specific targets, in this case on the influenza virus. If a person has an impaired immune system due to a health condition, they may not mount the desired immune response, reducing the vaccine's effectiveness. There are a wide variety of health conditions that can impair your immune system response. This is one reason that everyone should be vaccinated. By having less risk of getting and spreading the flu, they protect those who have impaired immunity and, therefore, can't benefit as much from vaccinating themselves. What Does It Mean to Be Immunocompromised? Types of Flu Shots and Vaccines All flu vaccines protect against the same strains of flu. In 2024, the FDA reduced the number of strains included in the vaccine from four to three, because one of the previously included strains hasn't been detected since 2020. Because the vaccines protect against three they are called trivalent vaccines. The CDC doesn’t recommend one type of vaccine over the others. However, some people, including people under the age of 2, over the age of 65, who have allergies, or are pregnant, have special considerations and should talk to their doctor about which vaccine is best. Adults 65 and Up Some studies indicate that a higher-dose vaccine or an adjuvanted flu vaccine (one with an additional substance called an adjuvant that enhances the body's immune response to an antigen) creates a stronger immune response) produce a stronger immune response and are therefore more effective for this population. The CDC recommends people age 65 and older receive a higher-dose vaccine or an adjuvanted flu vaccine (one with an additional substance called an adjuvant that enhances the body's immune response to an antigen). Three vaccines are specifically recommended for this population: Fluzone High-DoseFluadFlublok Senior Flu Shots If You’re Allergic According to the CDC, people who have severe allergies to an ingredient in the flu vaccine or who have had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine should not get a flu shot. Most flu vaccines are made using eggs or egg protein, but the CDC states that people with egg allergies can get any flu vaccine, regardless of the severity of their allergy. The CDC previously had recommended that people with egg allergies should get their flu shots in an inpatient or outpatient setting. For those interested in an egg-free flu shot, the two egg-free vaccine options are: Flublok: Approved for people ages 18 and olderFlucelvax: Approved for people ages 6 months and older If You’re Pregnant Pregnant people can get any flu vaccine except for FluMist, which contains a live virus. Study Shows Flu Shot in Pregnancy Does Not Lead to Health Issues for Children Nasal Spray Option FluMist is a vaccine administered via a nasal spray. It is approved for people ages 2 through 49. However, it’s the only vaccine that contains a live, weakened virus, and it should not be used by pregnant or immunocompromised people. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether FluMist is safe for you. What Is the FluMist Flu Vaccine? Flu Vaccine for Babies There are five flu vaccines approved for babies 6 months and older. They are: AfluriaFluarixFlucelvaxFluLavalFluzone Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Over Time The flu vaccine needs two weeks to become fully effective, and protection is thought to last for at least six months. But a person's antibody levels in response to the vaccine can decrease over time, and different flu strains may be circulating. Because of that and because each year the vaccine is tailored to the most concerning flu variants, people should get a flu vaccine annually. Flu Vaccine Side Effects Side effects of the flu vaccine are usually mild and go away without treatment in a few days. Common side effects include: Soreness, redness, and swelling where the shot was givenHeadacheFeverNauseaMuscle achesFatigue Rarely, allergic reactions occur, often within minutes of the vaccine being administered. If you experience swelling, racing heart or trouble breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Extremely rarely (no more than one or two cases per million people who receive the flu vaccine) a person may develop Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disease. Flu Shot Side Effects Summary The flu vaccine can prevent illness, hospitalization, and death. The CDC recommends that everybody aged 6 months and older get the vaccine every year (with very rare exceptions). The effectiveness of the vaccine varies since the vaccine only protects against certain strains of flu. Over the past five years, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine has ranged from 29%–40%. A Word From Verywell Deciding whether to vaccinate can be a big decision. Although the flu is a common illness, it can be deadly, particularly for people over the age of 65. The flu vaccine isn’t 100% effective, but it does significantly reduce the risk of illness, hospitalization, and death. If you have questions about the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it is right for you or your children. Frequently Asked Questions When did the flu shot first come out? The flu vaccine first became available in the 1930s, and it became widely available in 1945. Has flu vaccine efficacy increased since the 20th century? Flu vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year. It depends on how well the strains in the vaccine match the strains that are most prevalent in a given year. Is it safe to get the flu and COVID-19 vaccines together? Yes, the CDC says that the flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine, including boosters, can be administered at the same time. Learn More Getting a Flu Shot and COVID Vaccine Together What is the flu shot made of? The flu shot is made with either killed or weakened flu virus. The shots also contain inactive ingredients, including preservatives. 16 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

You can reference the table below to find detailed recommendations for each vaccine from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). General Recommendations for Vaccinating Pregnant People Vaccines General Recommendation for Use in Pregnancy Routine Vaccines COVID-19 Recommended (the current COVID-19 vaccine) Hepatitis A Recommended if pregnant person is at risk for a hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection or severe outcome from infection, if not previously vaccinated. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine No recommendation Hepatitis B Recommended if not already vaccinated. HPV Not recommended. Influenza (Inactivated) Recommended seasonally. Influenza (LAIV) Contraindicated. Mpox Base decision on risk vs. benefit. MMR Contraindicated. Meningococcal (ACWY) May be used if otherwise indicated. Meningococcal (B) Pregnancy is a precaution; may be used if benefit outweighs risk. Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) No recommendation. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23) No recommendation. Polio (IPV) Pregnancy is a precaution. Base decision on risk vs. benefit RSV Recommended (Pfizer Abrysvo only) during gestational weeks 32-36. Td Should be used if otherwise indicated (Tdap preferred). Tdap Recommended during each pregnancy, preferably in early part of gestational weeks 27–36. Varicella Contraindicated. Zoster No recommendation. Consider delaying RZV until after pregnancy. Non-Routine Adenovirus Contraindicated. Anthrax Low risk of exposure — not recommended. High risk of exposure — may be used. Cholera No data available. May be used if benefit outweighs risk. Dengue Pregnancy is a precaution; may be used if benefit outweighs risk. Ebola Inadequate data. May be used if benefit outweighs risk. Japanese Encephalitis No data available. May be used if benefit outweighs risk. Rabies May be used if otherwise indicated. Tick-borne Encephalitis May be used if otherwise indicated. Typhoid Inadequate data. Live typhoid (Ty21a) is contraindicated; give Vi polysaccharide if clearly needed. Smallpox Contraindicated for pre-exposure. Yellow Fever Pregnancy is a precaution; may be used if benefit outweighs risk. Routine Vaccines COVID-19 COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for persons who are pregnant, might become pregnant, were recently pregnant or are breastfeeding. The safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination indicates that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Dengue Pregnancy is a precaution for Dengvaxia. Vaccination should generally be deferred but might be indicated if the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction. 1 Pregnant females, who are at increased risk for dengue-related complications, were not specifically studied in the Dengvaxia trial. The limited number of pregnant females inadvertently vaccinated during the trial had a similar frequency of adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, intrauterine death, and stillbirth) as occurred in the control group; however, the number of vaccinated pregnant females was not sufficient to determine a possible effect of Dengvaxia on pregnancy. 1 Hepatitis A Pregnant women should be vaccinated with HepA vaccine if they are identified to be at risk for HAV infection during pregnancy (e.g., international travelers, persons who use injection or noninjection drugs [i.e., all those who use illegal drugs], persons who have occupational risk for infection, persons who anticipate close personal contact with an international adoptee, or persons experiencing homelessness) or for having a severe outcome from HAV infection (e.g., persons with chronic liver disease or persons with HIV infection). The safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) is produced from inactivated HAV, the theoretic risk to the developing fetus is expected to be low. The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in pregnant women who might be at high risk for exposure to HAV. 2 Pregnant women should be vaccinated with HepA vaccine if they are at risk for infection or severe outcome from infection during pregnancy. Hepatitis B Pregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination. Limited data suggest that developing fetuses are not at risk for adverse events when hepatitis B vaccine is administered to pregnant women. Available vaccines contain noninfectious HBsAg and should cause no risk of infection to the fetus. 3 If not already vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), pregnant women should be vaccinated with HepB in pregnancy, since all adults 19 through 59 years of age are recommended to receive HepB vaccination. Note: Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio are not recommended in pregnancy due to lack of safety data in pregnant women. Therefore, providers should continue to use Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix for individuals needing hepatitis B vaccination during pregnancy. 4 Human Papillomavirus (HPV) HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, the remainder of the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion of pregnancy. Pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination. If a vaccine dose has been inadvertently administered during pregnancy, no intervention is needed. 5 A pregnancy registry has been established for 9vHPV. Pregnancy registries for 4vHPV and 2vHPV have been closed with concurrence from FDA. 6 Influenza (Inactivated or Recombinant) Pregnant and postpartum women are at higher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza than women who are not pregnant because of changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy…. Influenza vaccination can be administered at any time during pregnancy, before and during the influenza season. Women who are or will be pregnant during influenza season should receive inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV). 7 Influenza (LAIV) Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. 7 Mpox Available human data on JYNNEOS administered to pregnant women are insufficient to determine vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, animal models, including rats and rabbits, have shown no evidence of harm to a developing fetus. 8 Vaccine recipients might consider avoiding high-risk exposures until after temporary conditions (e.g., pregnancy or transient therapy with immunocompromising therapeutics) are completed. If high-risk exposures cannot be avoided, persons who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or breastfeeding or who have atopic dermatitis may receive JYNNEOS in consultation with their health care provider and after careful consideration of the risks and benefits. 8 Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) MMR vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus when the mother receives a live virus vaccine, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after receipt of MMR vaccine. If the vaccine is inadvertently administered to a pregnant woman or a pregnancy occurs within 28 days of vaccination, she should be counseled about the theoretical risk to the fetus. 9 Routine pregnancy testing of women of childbearing age before administering a live-virus vaccine is not recommended. MMR or varicella vaccination during pregnancy should not be considered a reason to terminate pregnancy. 10 Rubella-susceptible women who are not vaccinated because they state they are or may be pregnant should be counseled about the potential risk for CRS and the importance of being vaccinated as soon as they are no longer pregnant. 11 Meningococcal (MenACWY) Pregnancy should not preclude vaccination with MenACWY, if indicated. Women of childbearing age who become aware that they were pregnant at the time of MenACWY vaccination should contact their health-care provider or the vaccine manufacturer so that their experience might be captured in the vaccine manufacturer’s registry of vaccination during pregnancy. 12 Meningococcal (MenB) No randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate use of MenB vaccines in pregnant or lactating women. Vaccination should be deferred in pregnant and lactating women unless the woman is at increased risk, and, after consultation with her health care provider, the benefits of vaccination are considered to outweigh the potential risks. 12 Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV) ACIP has not published pregnancy recommendations for any PCV product at this time. 13 Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (PPSV23) The safety of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been evaluated, although no adverse consequences have been reported among newborns whose mothers were inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy. 13 Polio (IPV) Although no adverse effects of IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided on theoretical grounds. However, if a pregnant woman is at increased risk for infection and requires immediate protection against polio, IPV can be administered in accordance with the recommended schedules for adults. 14 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) On September 22, 2023, ACIP and CDC recommended maternal Pfizer RSVpreF (Abrysvo) vaccination in pregnant persons as a one-time dose at 32 weeks and zero days’–36 weeks and 6 days’ gestation using seasonal administration (meaning September–January in most of the continental United States) for prevention of RSV-associated LRTI in infants aged <6 months. 15 Note: Only Pfizer RSVpreF (Abrysvo) may be administered to pregnant persons; Arexvy (GSK) and mRESVIA (Moderna) vaccines should not be administered during pregnancy. 15 Administering maternal RSVpreF vaccine starting in September (1–2 months before the anticipated start of the RSV season) and continuing through January (2–3 months before the anticipated end of the RSV season) will maximize cost-effectiveness and benefits. In jurisdictions with RSV seasonality that differs from most of the continental United States, including Alaska, southern Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands, providers should follow state, local, or territorial guidance on timing of maternal RSVpreF vaccination. 15 Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap); Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Health-care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy irrespective of the patient’s prior history of receiving Tdap. To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation although Tdap may be given at any time during pregnancy. 16 Currently available data suggest that vaccinating earlier in the 27 through 36–week period will maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant. 16 For women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. 16 Available data from studies do not suggest any elevated frequency or unusual patterns of adverse events in pregnant women who received Tdap and that the few serious adverse events reported were unlikely to have been caused by the vaccine. 17 Wound Management: If a Td booster is indicated for a pregnant woman, health-care providers should administer Tdap. Unknown or Incomplete Tetanus Vaccination: To ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus should receive three vaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The recommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks and 6 through 12 months. Tdap should replace 1 dose of Td, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks’ gestation. 16 Providers are encouraged to report administration of Tdap to a pregnant woman, regardless of trimester, to the appropriate manufacturer’s pregnancy registry: for Adacel® to Sanofi Pasteur, telephone 1-800-822-2463 and for Boostrix® to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, telephone 1-888-452-9622. 17 Varicella Because the effects of the varicella virus on the fetus are unknown, pregnant women should not be vaccinated. Nonpregnant women who are vaccinated should avoid becoming pregnant for 1 month after each injection. For persons without evidence of immunity, having a pregnant household member is not a contraindication for vaccination. 18 Wild-type varicella poses a low risk to the fetus. Because the virulence of the attenuated virus used in the vaccine is less than that of the wild-type virus, the risk to the fetus, if any, should be even lower. 18 Routine pregnancy testing of women of childbearing age before administering a live-virus vaccine is not recommended. If a pregnant woman is inadvertently vaccinated or becomes pregnant within 4 weeks after MMR or varicella vaccination, she should be counseled about the theoretical basis of concern for the fetus; however, MMR or varicella vaccination during pregnancy should not be considered a reason to terminate pregnancy. 10 To monitor the pregnancy outcomes of women inadvertently vaccinated with VZV-containing vaccines immediately before or during pregnancy, Merck and CDC established the Merck/CDC Pregnancy Registry for VZV-Containing Vaccines in 1995. The low rate of exposure of varicella-susceptible women of childbearing age to VZV-containing vaccines, in addition to the rarity of the outcome, contribute to the low feasibility that the registry will provide more robust data on the risk for congenital varicella syndrome within a reasonable timeframe. New patient enrollment was discontinued as of October 16, 2013. Merck will continue to monitor pregnancy outcomes after inadvertent exposures to VZV-containing vaccines during pregnancy or within 3 months before conception. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration will continue to monitor adverse events after vaccination with VZV-containing vaccines through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). New cases of exposure immediately before or during pregnancy or other adverse events after vaccination with Varivax and ProQuad should be reported to Merck (telephone, 1-877-888-4231) and to VAERS. 19 Zoster There is currently no ACIP recommendation for Shingrix (RZV) use in pregnancy. Consider delaying RZV until after pregnancy. 20 Non-Routine Vaccines Adenovirus Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral is contraindicated for use in pregnant women. Avoid becoming pregnant following vaccination for at least 6 weeks after vaccination to prevent the fetus from being exposed to adenovirus. 21 Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral contains live virus that is shed in the stool for up to 28 days following vaccination and can cause disease if transmitted. It is given to individuals, undergoing intensive military training, who have limited contact with pregnant women, children under age seven and persons with compromised immune systems. 21 Anthrax In a pre-event setting, in which the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores is presumably low, vaccination of pregnant women is not recommended and should be deferred until after pregnancy. 22 In a post-event setting that poses a high risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores, pregnancy is neither a precaution nor a contraindication to PEP. Pregnant women at risk for inhalation anthrax should receive AVA and 60 days of antimicrobial therapy as described. 22 Cholera No data exist on use of the currently licensed CVD 103-HgR during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Prospective travelers who are pregnant and their clinicians should consider the risks associated with traveling to areas with active cholera transmission. 23 Ebola Human data available from clinical trials with Ervebo are insufficient to establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risk during pregnancy. The decision regarding whether to vaccinate a pregnant woman should involve consideration of the woman’s risk for exposure to EBOV. 24 Japanese Encephalitis (JE) Pregnancy is a precaution for the use of JE-VC. Vaccination with JE vaccine usually should be deferred because of a theoretical risk for the developing fetus. However, pregnant people who must travel to an area in which risk for JE is high should be vaccinated if the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination to the mother and developing fetus. 25 Rabies Because of the potential consequences of inadequately managed rabies exposure, pregnancy is not considered a contraindication to postexposure prophylaxis. Certain studies have indicated no increased incidence of abortion, premature births, or fetal abnormalities associated with rabies vaccination. If the risk of exposure to rabies is substantial, pre-exposure prophylaxis also might be indicated during pregnancy. Rabies exposure or the diagnosis of rabies in the mother should not be regarded as reasons to terminate the pregnancy. 26 Tick-borne Encephalitis TBE virus infection can pose a risk for severe illness in pregnant persons; thus, the benefits of vaccinating pregnant persons when the likelihood of infection is high likely outweigh the potential risks. 27 Typhoid No data have been reported on the use of either typhoid vaccine in pregnant women. In general, live vaccines like Ty21a are contraindicated in pregnancy. Vi polysaccharide vaccine should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. 28 Vaccinia (Smallpox) Because of the limited risk but severe consequences of fetal infection, smallpox vaccine should not be administered in a pre-event setting to pregnant women or to women who are trying to become pregnant. 29 If a pregnant woman is inadvertently vaccinated or if she becomes pregnant within 4 weeks after smallpox vaccination, she should be counseled regarding concern for the fetus. Smallpox vaccination during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to terminate pregnancy. CDC has established a pregnancy registry to prospectively follow the outcome of such pregnancies and facilitate the investigation of any adverse pregnancy outcome among pregnant women who were inadvertently vaccinated. For enrollment in the registry, contact CDC at 404-639-8253. 29 Pregnant women who have had a definite exposure to smallpox virus (i.e., face-to-face, household, or close-proximity contact with a smallpox patient) and are, therefore, at high risk for contracting the disease, should be vaccinated. Smallpox infection among pregnant women has been reported to result in a more severe infection than among nonpregnant women. Therefore, the risks to the mother and fetus from experiencing clinical smallpox substantially outweigh any potential risks regarding vaccination. In addition, vaccinia virus has not been documented to be teratogenic, and the incidence of fetal vaccinia is low. 29 When the level of exposure risk is undetermined, the decision to vaccinate should be made after assessment by the clinician and the patient of the potential risks versus the benefits of smallpox vaccination. 30 Yellow Fever Pregnancy is a precaution for YF vaccine administration, compared with most other live vaccines, which are contraindicated in pregnancy. If travel is unavoidable, and the risks for YFV exposure are felt to outweigh the vaccination risks, a pregnant woman should be vaccinated. If the risks for vaccination are felt to outweigh the risks for YFV exposure, pregnant women should be issued a medical waiver to fulfill health regulations. 31 Because pregnancy might affect immunologic function, serologic testing to document an immune response to the vaccine should be considered. 31 Although no specific data are available, a woman should wait 4 weeks after receiving YF vaccine before conceiving. 31 Breastfeeding and Vaccination Breastfeeding is a contraindication for smallpox vaccination, and yellow fever vaccine should be avoided in breastfeeding women if possible. Other vaccines should not affect the safety of breastfeeding and can be given to breastfeeding women if otherwise indicated. Per ACIP: “Neither inactivated nor live-virus vaccines administered to a lactating woman affect the safety of breastfeeding for women or their infants. Although live viruses in vaccines can replicate in vaccine recipients (i.e., the mother), the majority of live viruses in vaccines have been demonstrated not to be excreted in human milk. Varicella vaccine virus has not been found in human milk. Although rubella vaccine virus might be excreted in human milk, the virus usually does not infect the infant. If infection does occur, it is well tolerated because the virus is attenuated. Inactivated, recombinant, subunit, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines, as well as toxoids, pose no risk for mothers who are breastfeeding or for their infants.” 8 “Breastfeeding is a contraindication for smallpox vaccination of the mother because of the theoretical risk for contact transmission from mother to infant. Yellow fever vaccine should be avoided in breastfeeding women. However, when nursing mothers cannot avoid or postpone travel to areas endemic for yellow fever in which risk for acquisition is high, these women should be vaccinated.” 8 FDA Pregnancy Categories Regulation traditionally required that each product be classified under one of five pregnancy categories (A, B, C, D, and X) on the basis of risk of reproductive and developmental adverse effects or, for certain categories, on the basis of such risk weighted against potential benefits. As of August 2016, most vaccines have not yet converted from the FDA letter categories, and are rated in manufacturers’ package inserts as follows: Pregnancy Category B: Human Papillomavirus, Influenza (Fluarix, FluLaval, Afluria, Flublok, Flucelvax, Fluzone, Fluzone Intradermal, Fluvirin, Fluad, FluMist), Japanese Encephalitis (Ixiaro), Meningococcal (Menveo), Tdap (Boostrix), Meningococcal B. Pregnancy Category C: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza (Fluzone High Dose, FluMist), MMR, Meningococcal ACWY (Menactra, Menomune), Pneumococcal (Pneumovax23), Td, Tdap (Adacel), Japanese Encephalitis (JE-VAX), Rabies, Typhoid. Pregnancy Category D: Anthrax, Vaccinia. Vaccines that have converted from the letter categories as of August 2016 are: Pneumococcal (Prevnar13) – “Available data on Prevnar 13 administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.” Polio – “Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with IPOL vaccine. It is also not known whether IPOL vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. IPOL vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.” Varicella: Contraindication. Varivax should not be administered to pregnant females since wild-type varicella can sometimes cause congenital varicella infection. Pregnancy should be avoided for three months following vaccination with Varivax. Yellow Fever: “It is also not known whether YF-195 VAX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. 196 YF-VAX should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.” Zoster: There is currently no ACIP recommendation for RZV use in pregnancy. Consider delaying RZV until after pregnancy.

July 8, 2024 By Will Cushman For news media More information While H5N1 avian influenza virus taken from infected cow’s milk makes mice and ferrets sick when dripped into their noses, airborne transmission of the virus between ferrets — a common model for human transmission — appears to be limited. These and other new findings about the strain of H5N1 circulating among North American dairy cattle this year come from a set of laboratory experiments led by University of Wisconsin–Madison researchers, reported today in the journal Nature. Together, they suggest that exposure to raw milk infected with the currently circulating virus poses a real risk of infecting humans, but that the virus may not spread very far or quickly to others. Yoshihiro Kawaoka “This relatively low risk is good news, since it means the virus is unlikely to easily infect others who aren’t exposed to raw infected milk,” says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a UW–Madison professor of pathobiological sciences who led the study alongside Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and with collaborators at Texas A&M University, Japan’s University of Shizuoka and elsewhere. Kawaoka cautioned, however, that the findings represent the behavior of the virus in mice and ferrets and may not account for the infection and evolution process in humans. In their experiments, the UW–Madison team found that mice can become ill with influenza after drinking even relatively small quantities of raw milk taken from an infected cow in New Mexico. Kawaoka and his colleagues also tested the bovine H5N1 virus’s ability to spread through the air by placing ferrets infected with the virus near but out of physical contact with uninfected ferrets. Ferrets are a common model for understanding how influenza viruses might spread among humans because the small mammals exhibit respiratory symptoms similar to humans who are sick with the flu, including congestion, sneezing and fever. Efficient airborne transmission would signal a serious escalation in the virus’s potential to spark a human pandemic. None of the four exposed ferrets became ill, and no virus was recovered from them throughout the course of the study. However upon further testing, the researchers found that one exposed ferret had produced antibodies to the H5N1 virus. “That suggests that the exposed ferret was infected, indicating some level of airborne transmissibility but not a substantial level,” Kawaoka says. Separately, the team mixed the bovine H5N1 virus with receptors — molecules the virus binds to in order to enter cells — that are typically recognized by avian or human influenza viruses. They found that bovine H5N1 bound to both types of molecules, representing one more line of evidence of its adaptability to human hosts. While that adaptability has so far resulted in a limited number of human H5N1 cases, previous influenza viruses that caused human pandemics in 1957 and 1968 did so after developing the ability to bind to receptors bound by human influenza viruses. Finally, the UW–Madison team found that the virus spread to the mammary glands and muscles of mice infected with H5N1 virus and that the virus spread from mothers to their pups, likely via infected milk. These findings underscore the potential risks of consuming unpasteurized milk and possibly undercooked beef derived from infected cattle if the virus spreads widely among beef cattle, according to Kawaoka. “The H5N1 virus currently circulating in cattle has limited capacity to transmit in mammals,” he says. “But we need to monitor and contain this virus to prevent its evolution to one that transmits well in humans.” Share via Facebook Share via X, formerly Twitter Share via Linked In Share via email Tags: animal research, biohealth, influenza, research You may also like… UW researchers identify cell type that could be key to preventing marrow transplant complication UW–Madison researchers reveal how key protein might help influenza A infect its hosts Relieving stress in insulin-producing cells protects against Type 1 diabetes For Campus Communicators Communicator Groups Photo Library Editorial Style Guide Policies & Guidelines Brand & Visual Identity Guidelines University logo that links to main university website Part of the Universities of Wisconsin Follow us Facebook X YouTube Linked In Instagram Office of Strategic Communication 165 Bascom Hall View on campus map 500 Lincoln Drive Madison, WI 53706 Email: contact.strategiccommunication@wisc.edu Ph: 608-265-4151 Fax: 608-262-2331 Feedback or questions? contact.strategiccommunication@wisc.edu © 2024 Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System For News Media Media contact: Yoshihiro Kawaoka, yoshihiro.kawaoka@wisc.edu﻿ WHO EMRO | Yemen begins sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centre in London | News | Yemen site WHO EMRO | Yemen begins sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centre in London | News | Yemen site Main Search Contact YouTube Rss feeds Twitter Facebook HomeHealth topicsData and statisticsMedia centreInformation resourcesCountriesProgrammesAbout Us Yemen | News | Yemen begins sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centre in London WHO in Yemen Section menu YemenNewsPriority areasInformation resourcesWHO RepresentativeDonors and partners Yemen begins sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centre in London Shipment process under way on 13 May 2024 at CPHL in Aden, Yemen. Photo credit: WHO/K. Mayas8 July 2024 – Influenza virus sharing is essential to prepare the world against pandemics. Virus sharing also enables the development of candidate vaccine viruses, surveillance for resistance to antiviral medicines, and revision of diagnostic reagents and test kits. Owing to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, the country has been unable to share virus samples every year with the WHO Collaborating Centers under the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). On 14 May 2024, Yemen succeeded for the first time in shipping the first 50 samples of seasonal influenza viruses to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in London. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health and Population designated the Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL) as the National Influenza Centre. Following the COVID-19 emergency, Yemen has adapted its respiratory disease surveillance system to monitor both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This was done with support from WHO headquarters and the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Since then, Yemen has been expanding its services for the subtyping of influenza and other respiratory viruses to feed into this new national integrated surveillance programme and GISRS. Headquarters and Regional Office experts arranged a mission to Yemen in March 2022 in coordination with the WHO Country Office in Yemen. The mission’s aims were to reactivate influenza sentinel sites, which had been suspended during the COVID-19 emergency; train Ministry of Public Health and Population and CPHL staff on virus testing and on sharing influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, as per the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework; and to ensure that CPHL has met the WHO requirements for testing procedures for respiratory viruses. As of January 2023, samples are being collected at influenza sentinel sites. They are then shipped to the CPHL’s governorate-level National Centre for confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The next step should be to share confirmed samples with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London. Logistics have, however, prevented this until May 2024. Dry ice, needed to ship samples internationally, has been unavailable in Yemen since 2015 owing to the war and an embargo. With support and facilitation from WHO, however, dry ice was received in Aden from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This was transported via a United Nations Humanitarian Air Service flight from Addis Ababa to Aden; the same plane then took the packaged samples on to Amman, Jordan. The samples made the last leg of their journey, from Amman to London, via international courier. The same coordination mechanism will be used for future shipments of influenza virus samples until Yemen is able to produce dry ice.

We're now in the midst of a multistate outbreak of influenza A H5N1 bird flu in dairy cows and other animals. USDA has confirmed outbreaks in more than 130 dairy herds across 12 states, and also in a herd of alpacas. CDC has confirmed three human cases of bird flu in dairy farm workers. The first case, on April 1, 2024, was the first-ever known case of cow-to-human transmission of bird flu viruses in the United States and globally, and it was the second-ever documented human case of bird flu in the United States. The first US case was in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022. The chief complaint for the first two patients in that outbreak was conjunctivitis. The third patient had more typical flu symptoms, including a cough. All three of these patients had direct contact with infected cows. On July 3, 2024, a fourth human case of H5N1 bird flu, tied to the dairy cow outbreak, was identified in Colorado. This patient only reported eye symptoms. Over the past 27 years, more than 900 sporadic bird flu cases in humans have been reported worldwide. Overall, 52% of them have been fatal. CDC says to avoid exposure to sick or dead animals. They also recommend wearing appropriate personal protective equipment for job-related exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. Several questions come to mind. Is our milk supply safe? FDA says yes. PCR testing of milk samples did find genetic pieces of the virus, but they're not infectious. Pasteurization seems effective at killing this virus. This supports the safety of our commercial pasteurized milk supply, but not so for raw milk. So, people should avoid raw milk and any products made from it. What about beef? USDA says our meat supply is safe. Even so, they've continued testing, and on Friday, May 24, bird flu was detected via PCR in beef muscle from a second condemned cow. However, results of a USDA ground beef cooking study are reassuring. In this study, high levels of virus were injected into large ground beef patties. The patties were then cooked to different temperatures — 145° F (medium) and 160° F (well done). No virus was present in the burgers cooked to either temperature. The bottom line is that people should be careful handling raw meat and cook their meat to a safe internal temperature. No steak tartare. Here's the good news. Currently available flu test kits can detect H5, but they can't distinguish bird flu from seasonal flu. Current flu antivirals seem to be effective against it, and if we do end up needing a new dedicated vaccine, we already have two candidate vaccine viruses that should provide good cross-reactivity.CDC says that the risk to the general public, at least for now, is low. But CDC remains on high alert and is asking health partners to help raise awareness to physicians. Consider bird flu in patients with conjunctivitis and or other respiratory illness after relevant exposures. If this H5N1 virus starts to mix and mingle with the seasonal flu virus, we could really get into a mess. So please get your seasonal flu vaccine in the fall. 0CreditLead image: Medscape, LLCMedscape Internal Medicine © 2024 WebMD, LLCAny views expressed above are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of WebMD or Medscape.

Our study aimed to establish high-throughput, rapid screening methods for antiviral compounds against influenza A virus from abundant resources of Mongolian medicine.Methods: The use of GFP-based reporter viruses plays a pivotal role in antiviral drugs screening by enabling rapid and precise identification of compounds that inhibit viral replication. Herein, a GFP-based reporter influenza A virus was used to identify potent anti-influenza compounds within traditional Mongolian medicine.Results: Our study led to the discovery of three active compounds: Cardamonin, Curcumin, and Kaempferide, all of which exhibited significant antiviral properties in vitro. Subsequent analysis confirmed that their effectiveness was largely due to the stimulation of the antiviral signaling pathways of host cells, rather than direct interference with the viral components, such as the viral polymerase.Discussion: This study showcased the use of GFP-based reporter viruses in high-throughput screening to unearth antiviral agents from traditional Mongolian medicine, which contains rich antiviral compounds and deserves further exploration. Despite certain limitations, fluorescent reporter viruses present substantial potential for antiviral drug screening research due to their high throughput and efficiency.1 IntroductionThe relentless pursuit of targeted therapies is crucial in the global health landscape, where respiratory pathogens still poses a persistent threat (Hedberg et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023). Avian influenza A viruses (IAV) such as H7N9 (Deng et al., 2017) and H5N1 (He et al., 2010; Sun H. et al., 2014), as well as adenoviruses (Liu et al., 2014), continue to pose sporadic outbreaks, posing an ongoing threat to human health. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) models predict a high risk of IAV and coronaviruses infecting humans after cross-species transmission (Li et al., 2020; Li J. et al., 2022). The identification and evaluation of antiviral drugs are fundamental to the treatment of viral infections and the management and prevention of epidemic. Given this, research into the development of new antiviral drugs for IAV remains of significant practical importance. Initially, antiviral strategies targeted the IAV’s M2 ion channel protein using drugs like amantadine (Calderon. et al., 2019) and rimantadine (Scott. et al., 2020). These early interventions aimed to impede the virus’s ability to infect host cells, but the rise of resistant viral strains rendered them less effective. This challenge led to the development and widespread adoption of neuraminidase inhibitors, including Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) (M, 2004)and Zanamivir (Relenza) (Hayden. et al., 2000). These drugs function by blocking a critical enzyme, neuraminidase, which is necessary for the virus to exit infected cells and spread the infection further. However, the influenza virus’s capacity for mutation demands continual innovation in antiviral drug development. Baloxavir marboxil represents the latest advancement in this endeavor, targeting the virus’s polymerase complex to thwart its replication process (Hayden et al., 2018). By inhibiting the cap-dependent endonuclease function, Baloxavir impairs the synthesis of viral mRNA, a key step in the production of viral proteins and the assembly of new virus particles. Ongoing research is focused on discovering antivirals with broad-spectrum efficacy, capable of targeting multiple IAV strains and reducing the likelihood of resistance development. These efforts are vital in establishing a more robust defense against the ever-evolving IAV and ensuring preparedness for future flu seasons and potential pandemics. While the development of emerging AI technology enables rapid phenotypic predictions such as viral adaptability and the swift virtual screening of antiviral drugs (Popov et al., 2023), the key to antiviral drug research still lies in the high-throughput and rapid experimental assessment of antiviral activity of target drugs. Traditional virological experimental screenings for antivirals are often time-consuming. What’s more, drugs screened based on key enzymatic experiments related to viral proliferation, such as RNP polymerase, often lack reliability. The main reasons include that targeting specific enzymes does not necessarily equate to antiviral activity, or drugs targeting non-enzymatic sites are prone to be overlooked. Considering these, the development of high-throughput screening methods for antiviral drugs is not only a scientific challenge but also a necessity for maintaining global health security.With the development of globalization and modern technology, many traditional medical systems are continuously integrating with modern medicine, contributing to the advancement of human health and medicine. Traditional medical systems from various ethnic groups around the world are also gradually becoming a treasure trove for screening anti-infection and antiviral drugs (Ye. et al., 2023). Steeped in the rich cultural heritage of Mongol nationality, traditional Mongolian medicine is an important part of Chinese traditional culture, which offers a holistic approach to healthcare, integrating herbal remedies, acupuncture, and moxibustion, and has been a cornerstone of healing practices for centuries (Meng et al., 2009; Song et al., 2022; Li. et al., 2023). This ancient system has continuously evolved, incorporating the indigenous healing wisdom of the Mongolian people while also absorbing therapeutic concepts from Tibetan, Chinese, and Indian medicinal traditions (Li X. et al., 2022; Long et al., 2022). A significant aspect of this traditional medicine is the use of various herbs that have shown promising antiviral properties in preliminary research. Notably, Rhodiola rosea, commonly referred to as “Golden Root”, is recognized for its antiviral effects, particularly against influenza A virus (IAV) (Jeong et al., 2009; Döring et al., 2022) and herpes viruses (Tettevi et al., 2022), suggesting its potential in combating viral infections. Likewise, extracts from other medicinal plants, such as Schizandra chinensis (Qi et al., 2023) and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Adianti et al., 2014), have been identified to possess antiviral capabilities. These botanical compounds are key to traditional Mongolian medicine and are now being explored as potential foundations for new antiviral therapies. Current scientific investigations are delving into the molecular structures and actions of these herbal extracts, aiming to unveil their potential as innovative sources for antiviral drug development, thereby bridging ancient practices with modern medical science. However, how to achieve high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds from traditional medicines is currently a pressing technological challenge.Fluorescent reporter viruses have revolutionized the field of antiviral drug screening by providing a powerful tool for rapid and efficient evaluation of therapeutic agents (Cherkashchenko et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). These specially designed viruses incorporate genes for fluorescent proteins that are expressed during viral replication. Upon infection of host cells, these viruses produce a fluorescent signal that can be easily detected and measured. The brilliance of the emitted light serves as a direct indicator of the level of viral replication, allowing researchers to swiftly gauge the potency of antiviral drugs (Manicassamy et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2020). The use of these reporter viruses significantly expedites the drug discovery process. By offering a high-throughput screening capability, they enable the simultaneous testing of numerous compounds, drastically reducing the time and resources required, compared to conventional methods such as plaque assays or cytopathic effect-based assays. Moreover, the real-time nature of the fluorescent readout allows for dynamic monitoring of viral growth and inhibition, providing insights into the kinetics of antiviral action (Pahmeier et al., 2021). This technology is highly adaptable, fitting seamlessly into automated platforms that can handle large-scale drug screenings with minimal human intervention, further enhancing the workflow efficiency. The precision and speed with which fluorescent reporter viruses can deliver results have made them an indispensable asset in the race to identify new antiviral drugs, particularly in the face of emerging viral threats where rapid response is crucial, such as SARS-CoV-2 (Chiem et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023). Their application extends beyond initial screenings, contributing to subsequent optimization and characterization of promising antiviral candidates, ultimately accelerating the path from laboratory discovery to clinical application. The technology based on fluorescent reporter viruses will be an effective method for high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds in traditional medicine.Here, we utilized the GFP-based reporter IAV (GFP-IAV) to conduct in vitro screening of active compounds in traditional anti-IAV Mongolian medicine, and successfully identified three compounds with anti-IAV activity. Subsequent validation of their anti-IAV effects was performed, and their potential antiviral mechanisms were explored. Our research represented an initial application of screening antiviral compounds using the GFP-IAV, laying the groundwork for subsequent high-throughput screening of antiviral components in traditional medicines.2 Materials and methods2.1 Cell and virusesMDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA, CCL-34), and HEK293T (Human embryonic kidney) cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% PSG (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin). A549 (Human lung epithelial carcinoma) cells (ATCC, CCL-185) were cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in F-12K Nutrient Mixture (F-12K, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% PSG (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin). H1N1 subtype IAV A/California/California/07/2009 (CA07) were propagated in MDCK cells.2.2 Reverse genetics rescue of GFP-IAVGFP-IAV was rescued by reverse genetics techniques as described in our previous study (Sun W. et al., 2014). Briefly, the GFP coding sequence (with stop codon) was linked to the NA segment (without stop codon) of CA07 via a 2A peptide, then incorporating a fragment of the NA segment 3’ end sequence post-GFP as the IAV polymerase recognition signal. The linked fragments were cloned into pHW2000 plasmids, and the constructs were confirmed by complete sequencing to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations. 293T cells were transfected with the constructed NA-GFP and the other 7 wild-type fragments using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 24-well plates. The supernatant of the transfected cells was collected 24 hour (h) post-transfection and transferred to MDCK cells with infection medium (6-well plates). The supernatant with rescued viruses was collected at 72 h post-infection, and then the virus was propagated again in MDCK cells. Recombinant viruses (GFP-IAV) were titered by plaque assay.2.3 Screening for anti-IAV compounds by GFP-IAVMDCK cells were cultured in 24-well plates. After the cell density reached 100% confluence, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with GFP-IAV at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Next, cells were washed once with PBS and cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 2 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and without FBS. Meanwhile, the medium was added with the compounds that awaiting screening (final concentration of 50 μM and 25 μM). The cell status and GFP fluorescence intensity was observed at 12, 18, 24 h post-infection, and the images were captured using an Olympus Fluorescence IX73 Microscope.2.4 Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from virus culture supernatant using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). QRT-PCR was performed using an One Step TB Green PrimeScript PLUS RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga Prefecture, Kusatsu City, Japan) with a Light Cycler 480 II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Virus titer was determined by qRT-PCR and converted to pfu numbers by standard curve.2.5 Plaque assayMDCK cells were cultured in 12-well plates. After the cell density reached 100% confluence, cells were infected with IAV at 37°C. After 1 h of virus adsorption, cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.8% Low Melting Point agarose and TPCK-treated trypsin (2 μg/mL) and then incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. At 72 h post-infection, cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. The agarose overlay was removed and stained for 15 min with 1% crystal violet in methanol. The number of plaques in each well was counted.2.6 Transcriptomic sequencing analysisThe A549 cells were cultured in 6-well plates. After the cell density reached about 80–90%, cells were washed three times with PBS and the cell culture medium was replaced with serum-free fresh medium containing different compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin) at concentration of 50 μM, with DMSO as negative control. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transcriptomic sequencing analysis was conducted by Novogene (Beijing, China P.R.). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database under biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF) categories were used for functional annotation and enrichment analyses. The bubble chart for bioinformatics-related data analysis was plotted by http://www.bioinformatics.com.cn (accessed on 23 December 2023), an online platform for data analysis and visualization (Luo and Brouwer, 2013).2.7 Detection of polymerase activity293T cells were cultured in 24-well plates. After the cell density reached about 80% confluence, cells were co-transfected with pHW2000 plasmids encoding PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins, pHH21 plasmid expressing negative vRNA-like firefly luciferase (Fluc) RNA and plasmid encoding renilla luciferase (Rluc) as internal reference using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At 6 h post-transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS and the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing different compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin) at different concentrations (25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.25 μM and 3.125 μM) with DMSO as negative control. After 24 h of incubation with the compounds, cells were harvested and lysed. The polymerase activity was analyzed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). All assays were performed independently and in triplicate.2.8 Western blot analysisCells were lysed with RIPA lysate containing protease inhibitors to extract proteins. Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA assay. The protein was diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μL, DTT, 5×MAster Mix, and Ladder were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and NP primary Antibody was diluted 1:250 with Antibody Diluent II. Luminescent solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of Lumino-S and Peroxide, Anti-Rabbit Secondary Antibody was used for Secondary Antibody, and samples were loaded in sequence. The JessTM automatic protein expression analysis system was used to detect protein bands.2.9 Statistical analysisThe GraphPad Prism 9.0 software was used to conduct all statistical analysis. Data were presented as means ± SD of at least three independent experiments. Differences between the two groups were evaluated using Student’s t-test, and differences between three or more groups were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.3 Results3.1 Workflow for screening anti-IAV compounds using GFP-based reporter virusAs shown in the workflow, the coding sequence of enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) was linked to the NA sequence of IAV via the 2A peptide (Figure 1A). Then, the full length of all eight segments of IAV, including NA-GFP, were amplified from viral RNA segment by RT-PCR and constructed into the pHW2000 vectors (Figure 1A). Recombinant viruses were produced by transfecting 293T cells with eight engineered plasmids, and the viruses harvested after 48 h were subsequently inoculated into MDCK cells to be further amplified for a 72-h duration (Figure 1B). A substantial quantity of IAV carrying the GFP reporter gene (GFP-IAV) could be obtained from the supernatant of MDCK cells (Figure 1C). Upon infecting MDCK cells with the GFP-IAV, GFP could be observed under a fluorescence microscope as early as 12 h post-infection, and prominent fluorescence would be noticeable at approximately 18 h post-infection (Figure 1C). Thus, the GFP-IAV coul be utilized for the rapid screening of antiviral drugs against IAV. The candidate drugs were incubated with MDCK cells infected by the GFP-IAV, and after approximately 12–18 hs, the expression levels of GFP could be observed. Compare the GFP levels with a negative control, the expression of GFP would be reduced if the drug exhibited antiviral activity against IAV; conversely, higher expression GFP levels indicated a lack of antiviral efficacy (Figure 1D). By GFP-IAV, high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs could be rapidly achieved. The drugs obtained after screening were further identified by measuring the influenza virus proliferation curve, resulting in a high positivity rate (Figure 1E).Figure 1 Figure 1 Workflow for screening anti-IAV compounds using GFP-based reporter virus. The workflow was designed as followed. (A) Eight-Plasmid Schematic of GFP-IAV reverse genetics.

The expression of GFP would be reduced if the drug exhibited antiviral activity against IAV; conversely, higher expression GFP levels indicated a lack of antiviral efficacy. (E) Following the screening process, drugs with antiviral activity were subjected to further experimental validation. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA (****p < 0.0001).3.2 The construction and biological identification of the GFP-IAV2A peptides are short sequences of amino acids used in molecular biology to mediate the co-expression of multiple proteins from a single mRNA. This “ribosome skipping” technology allows for the production of separate proteins from the same transcript without the need for additional promoters or multiple cloning sites. The influenza A virus strain A/California/07/2009 (CA07) served as the scaffold, linking the GFP coding sequence (with stop codon) to the NA segment (without stop codon) via a 2A peptide, and incorporating a fragment of the NA segment 3’ end sequence post-GFP as the IAV polymerase recognition signal (Figure 2A). Subsequently, a recombinant influenza virus encapsulating the GFP encoding gene, GFP-IAV, was successfully obtained through eight-plasmid reverse genetics operations (Figure 1B). To verify the expression efficiency of GFP during GFP-IAV infection, MDCK cells were infected with the virus and the expression of GFP was observed at 12, 18, and 24 h post-infection using a fluorescence microscope. The results indicated that faint fluorescence could be observed at 12 h post-infection, with more pronounced fluorescence visible after 18 h, often before any significant cytopathic effects (CPE) are apparent (Figure 2B). By 24 h post-infection, the fluorescence become even more distinct (Figure 2B). It demonstrated that the recombinant GFP-IAV could effectively infect MDCK cells and express GFP, allowing for the assessment of viral infection prior to the appearance of CPE. We then compared the replication capabilities of the recombinant GFP-IAV with that of the wild-type IAV virus. MDCK cells were infected with two different viruses (moi=0.001) and the supernatant was collected at 12, 18, and 24 h post-infection. The viral titers were then determined by plaque assay. The plaque assay results indicated that under the same infection conditions, the progeny virus particles produced by the recombinant GFP-IAV (Figure 2C) were fewer than those produced by the wild-type virus (Figure 2D). This suggested that the replication efficacy of the recombinant GFP-IAV was diminished in comparison to the wild-type counterpart, which could be due to the additional burden of carrying the GFP gene, resulting in a reduced capacity for propagation. To further evaluate whether GFP-IAV accurately mirrors wild-type IAV at the RNA, protein, and viral levels, correlation analyses between wild-type IAV and GFP-IAV were conducted at various infection time points, including viral titers (Figure 2E; Supplementary Figure 1A), RNA copy number (Figure 2F; Supplementary Figure 1B), and protein expression (Figure 2G; Supplementary Figure 1C). The correlation coefficient between wild-type IAV and GFP-IAV were 0.96 for viral titers, 0.93 for RNA copy numbers, and 0.99 for protein level. The results showed that GFP-IAV could reflect the biological characteristics of wild-type IAV to a certain extent. Then, to further confirm the genetic stability of the GFP-IAV, it was passaged continuously for 6 generations on MDCK cells. The results showed that the expression of GFP during infection after sixth passages was essentially consistent with the initial passage (Figure 2H), indicating that the GFP gene has not been lost. In conclusion, recombinant GFP-IAV could infect MDCK cells and proliferate effectively, with the amount of GFP expression increasing over time post-infection. And the GFP gene was not easily lost during the process of viral passage. Observable fluorescence preceded significant CPE, indicating that GFP-IAV could be used for the rapid screening of antiviral drugs against IAV.Figure 2 Figure 2 The construction and biological identification of the GFP-IAV.

The natural compounds within these formulations were organized and 18 natural compounds were selected as potential candidates (Supplementary Table 1). Since most compounds exhibited high cytotoxicity at 200 uM and 100 uM, the maximum compound concentration was set at 50 uM for the subsequent screenings. MDCK cells were infected with GFP-IAV and added natural compounds to the supernatant at concentration of 50 μM and 25 μM, with Zanamivir as positive control and DMSO as negative control. GFP fluorescence was continuously observed at 12 h post-infection. The results indicated that at 24 h post-infection, cells treated with Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin demonstrated significantly lower GFP fluorescence intensity compared to the DMSO group at both concentration of 50 μM and 25 μM, additionally, the positive control group displayed a substantially diminished GFP fluorescence intensity as well (Figure 3A). It suggested that these three compounds might possess antiviral activity against IAV. To further verify their antiviral effects, proliferation curves of the GFP-IAV were conducted in MDCK cells treated with three different compounds and positive control compound at varying concentration gradients. The findings suggested that when exposed to elevated levels of the compounds (50 μM), the virus’s replicative efficacy was markedly decreased relative to the mock-treated group. Furthermore, as the compound’s concentration was lowered, the suppressive impact on viral replication correspondingly lessens (Figure 3B). Considering these, we believed that Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin identified through GFP-IAV screening were worth further investigation due to their potential anti-influenza virus activity. The chemical structures of these three compounds and the positive control were shown in Figure 3C.Figure 3 Figure 3 Three Mongolian medicine compounds with antiviral activity identified by GFP-IAV. (A) MDCK cells were infected with GFP-IAV and added natural compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin) to the supernatant at concentration of 50 μM and 25 μM, with Zanamivir as positive control and DMSO as negative control. GFP fluorescence was observed at 24 h post-infection. (B) MDCK cells were infected with GFP-IAV and added natural compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin) to the supernatant at different concentrations of 50 μM, 25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.25 μM, 3.125μM and 1.5625 μM, with Zanamivir as positive control and DMSO as negative control. Virus titer was determined by qRT-PCR at different time points (12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection) and converted to pfu numbers by standard curve. Virus growth curves were examined. (C) Chemical structures of Kaempferide, Curcumin, Cardamonin and Zanamivir. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001).3.4 Three compounds have significant inhibitory effects on the wild-type IAVTo further verify the antiviral effects of these three compounds screened out by the GFP-IAV, MDCK cells were infected with the wild-type IAV (moi=0.001). After one-hour adsorption, the compounds were diluted in a two-fold concentration gradient and incubated with the infected cells. Supernatants were collected at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection, and the IAV titers were determined through plaque assays. The results of the plaque assay at 48 h post-infection of high-concentration compound treatment showed that the number of viral plaques for the three compounds and the positive control group were lower than that of the mock group (Figure 4A). The compounds’ effect on the proliferation efficiency of the wild-type IAV was essentially consistent with that of the GFP-IAV. It indicated that upon administration of the compounds at heightened concentrations (50 µM), there was a significant attenuation in IAV’s ability to replicate when compared to the mock-treated assemblage. Additionally, a reduction in the concentration of the compounds was associated with a proportional diminution in their inhibitory influence on viral propagation (Figure 4B). The IC50 of three compounds were calculated by the inhibition results on the IAV titers (Supplementary Figure 2A). To determine the cytotoxicity of these compounds, MDCK cells were treated with varying concentrations of each compound. After 24 hours, cell viability was measured and calculated the CC50 values for the three compounds (Supplementary Figure 2B). The SI values were showed in Supplementary Table 2. To further investigate whether the antiviral effects of the compounds were related to the inhibition of influenza virus polymerase activity, the influenza virus polymerase reporter system was used to measure the activity of the viral polymerase under compounds treatment. The Baloxavir marboxil was chosen as positive control due to its known inhibitory effects on the polymerase activity of influenza viruses. 293T cells were co-transfected with pHW2000 plasmids encoding PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins, pHH21 plasmid expressing negative vRNA-like firefly luciferase (Fluc) RNA and plasmid encoding renilla luciferase (Rluc) as internal reference. The cells were then incubated with various concentrations of compounds, and luciferase activity was measured at 24 h after transfection. Due to the poor adherence of 293T cells, detachment occurred at high concentration of 50 µM. Therefore, the maximum concentration was set at 25µM. The results indicated that at the highest concentration of 25 µM and under gradient dilution, the compounds did not exhibit significant inhibitory effects on the IAV polymerase, in contrast to the obvious inhibitory effects of the positive control group (Figure 4C). Taken together, these three compounds significantly inhibited the proliferation of the wild-type IAV, moreover, this inhibitory effect was independent of the IAV polymerase activity, suggesting that it might primarily affect the antiviral signaling pathways of the host cells.Figure 4 Figure 4 Three compounds have significant inhibitory effects on the wild-type IAV. (A) MDCK cells were infected with the wild-type IAV (moi=0.001) and added natural compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin) to the supernatant at concentration of 50 μM, with Zanamivir as positive control and DMSO as negative control. The IAV titers were determined through plaque assays at 48 h post-infection. (B) MDCK cells were infected with wild-type IAV and added natural compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin) to the supernatant at different concentrations of 50 μM, 25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.25 μM and 3.125 μM, with Zanamivir as positive control and DMSO as negative control. Virus titer was determined by qRT-PCR at different time points (12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection) and converted to pfu numbers by standard curve. Virus growth curves were examined. (C) 293T cells were co-transfected with pHW2000 plasmids encoding PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins, pHH21 plasmid expressing negative vRNA-like firefly luciferase (Fluc) RNA and plasmid encoding renilla luciferase (Rluc) as internal reference. The cells were then incubated with various concentrations (25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.25 μM and 3.125 μM) of natural compounds (Kaempferide, Curcumin and Cardamonin), with Baloxavir marboxil as positive control and DMSO as negative control. Luciferase activity was measured at 24 h after transfection. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA (**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001).3.5 Three compounds regulated the antiviral signaling pathways in host cellsTo elucidate the antiviral mechanisms employed by these three compounds in combatting IAV, transcriptomic sequencing analysis was conducted to detect changes in cellular transcriptome after compounds treatment. A549 cells were either mock-treated with DMSO or treated with three compounds for 24 h, and the total RNA were purified for further transcriptomic sequencing. The results indicated that all three compounds have a significant impact on the expression of genes within A549 cells. After Kaempferide treatment, there were 3940 genes upregulated and 4011 genes downregulated in expression compared to the mock group (Figure 5A). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis further indicated that the major upregulated genes impacted by Kaempferide were associated with innate immunity-related pathways, including the NF-kappa B signaling pathway (Ramos and Fernandez-Sesma, 2015), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Schneider et al., 2014), and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Farahani et al., 2022). Meanwhile, the downregulated genes were associated with cellular energy metabolism and and cell cycle, such as Foxo signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2005) and Apelin signaling pathway (Mlyczyńska et al., 2020) (Figure 5B). Analysis of the expression changes of genes in key signaling pathway indicated that it could upregulate the expression of certain genes related to immunity, such as IRF3 (Al and Brady, 2022), SOCS3 (Carow and Rottenberg, 2014), and IL32 (Zhu et al., 2022) (Figure 5C). Furthermore, two additional compounds have demonstrated comparable bioactivity, each exerting regulatory control over the expression profiles of numerous genes in A549 cells (Curcumin upregulated 3297 genes, downregulated 3541 genes, and Cardamonin upregulated 4374 genes, downregulated 4371 genes) (Figures 5D, G). Meanwhile, these genes upregulated by Curcumin and Cardamonin also included molecules related to intracellular immunity signaling pathway (Figures 5E, F, H, I). The above results indicated that these three compounds could exert certain antiviral effects by modulating the signaling pathways related to cellular immune responses.Figure 5 Figure 5 Three compounds regulated the antiviral signaling pathways in host cells.

The incorporation of GFP into the viral genome allows for the direct observation of viral replication, providing a rapid and quantifiable means to assess the antiviral potency of test compounds. This technique presents a significant improvement over conventional plaque assays or terminal assay methodologies, which are not only time-consuming but also necessitate post-infective processing. Utilizing the GFP-IAV, we have successfully identified three antiviral compounds from traditional anti-influenza Mongolian formulations.Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) offers the distinct advantage of enabling researchers to observe and track proteins in living cells in real time without disrupting cellular function, thanks to its inherent fluorescence (Tsien, 1998). GFP’s remarkable stability and non-toxic nature allow for its integration into a wide range of biological systems, facilitating diverse applications in scientific studies. Moreover, its capacity to form a chromophore autonomously, without the need for additional substrates or enzymes, makes GFP an exceptionally versatile and user-friendly tool in molecular and cellular biology (van Thor and Champion, 2023; Wang. et al., 2023). Fluorescent reporter viruses are currently widely used in the field of virology. To illustrate, a stable ZIKV GFP-reporter virus system with improved GFP visibility and stability was used for screening Zika virus inhibitors (Zhang. et al., 2021). There have also been reports of the application of GFP-reporter viruses for Dengue (Leardkamolkarn et al., 2012), West Nile viruses (Pierson et al., 2005) and some other viruses. The GFP reporting system is not the first time being used for the influenza A virus. Previous research has involved linking the GFP reporter gene to IAV NS segments (Perez et al., 2013) or NP segments (Antony and Schaeffer, 2013). The current antiviral drugs for IAV primarily targeted the neuraminidase (NA) of the virus, such as zanamivir (Hayden. et al., 2000) and oseltamivir (M, 2004). Therefore, attaching GFP to the NA segment could facilitate a more direct screening for compounds effective against NA. This is the reason we have opted to incorporate GFP into the NA segment. So, in our research, we have integrated GFP into the influenza virus NA segment via a 2A peptide linkage, which does not interfere with the normal infection and replication processes of the influenza virus. This modification allows the virus to express GFP during infection, and in the early stages of infection, the brightness of GFP fluorescence is directly proportional to the virus’s replication capacity. Using the reported virus, we have successfully identified three compounds with effective antiviral activity from a selection of more than twenty compounds.The research status of antiviral properties in traditional Mongolian medicine is an area of growing interest. Studies have focused on classic Mongolian prescriptions known for antipyretic and antiviral effects, building a database of candidate compounds for further investigation (Yu et al., 2020). Bibliometric analyses have been employed to understand research trends and the current state of traditional Mongolian medicine, highlighting its potential in contemporary medicine (Kim and Kang, 2021). Pharmacological studies aim to provide modern interpretations of the traditional efficacy of Mongolian materia medica, contributing to the body of knowledge on its antiviral applications (Qu et al., 2022). Screening for effective antiviral compounds from traditional Mongolian medicine will also contribute to understanding the mechanisms of Mongolian medicine from a modern scientific perspective. Kaempferide is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound that is found in abundance in plants such as Scutellaria baicalensis, Andrographis paniculata, and Schizonepeta tenuifolia (Ren et al., 2019). Curcumin is abundantly found in the ginger family plant turmeric, which is also its main active ingredient (Weng and Goel, 2022). Turmeric is widely used to treat various inflammatory conditions and digestive system issues (Unlu et al., 2016). Cardamonin is also a naturally occurring flavonoid compound primarily found in plants of the ginger family, including white cardamom and grains of paradise. Its pharmacological activities typically include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor properties (Kim et al., 2015). Our research confirms that these three compounds effectively inhibit the proliferation of the influenza virus, enriching the study of antiviral mechanisms in traditional medicine.The primary mechanisms of traditional Mongolian medicine in combating the IAV involve multiple aspects, including direct antiviral activity and modulation of the host’s immune response (Ma et al., 2023). Antiviral activity primarily includes preventing the binding of influenza virus to receptors on the host cell surface and inhibiting key enzymes such as the virus’s RNA polymerase to block viral replication. Regulating the host immune response primarily involves activating immune cells or increasing the production of antiviral cytokines to enhance the body’s immune response to viruses. Transcriptome sequencing results suggest that the inhibitory effects of these three compounds on the influenza virus may primarily be achieved by regulating the immune response signaling pathways within host cells, enhancing the cell’s natural antiviral immunity, and attenuating cell cycle activities. Past findings have suggested that the division of host cells promotes the accumulation of influenza A virus (IAV) proteins and the production of the virus (He et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2023). This suggests that the antiviral effects of these three compounds could be broad-spectrum, which is worth further verification.However, modified viruses do not alter the fundamental processes of viral entry and infection in host cells, the introduction of fluorescent genes can sometimes compromise their replication efficiency. This reduced replication capacity, when compared to wild-type viruses, may skew the results obtained from high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds. The discrepancy arises because compounds might appear to inhibit the replication of the reporter virus more effectively than they would inhibit a wild-type virus, potentially resulting in the identification of false positives compounds that seem effective in the assay but may not be as effective in a clinical setting against the actual virus. Moreover, the fluorescence signal itself, which is used as an indicator of viral replication, can be influenced by certain drugs or experimental conditions. For example, some compounds might quench or enhance the fluorescence independent of their antiviral activity, or certain experimental conditions might affect the stability of the fluorescent protein (Ke and Sung, 2023), leading to fluctuations in signal intensity that do not correlate with actual changes in viral replication levels. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct follow-up experiments to validate the initial screening results.In summary, by incorporating the GFP gene into the influenza virus NA segment, we successfully rescued GFP-tagged influenza A virus (GFP-IAV) using reverse genetics. Utilizing the characteristic that the intensity of GFP fluorescence is directly proportional to viral proliferation during GFP-IAV infection, we identified three natural compounds with anti-influenza virus activity from traditional Mongolian herbal formulas. Preliminary investigations into the antiviral mechanisms of these compounds were conducted using transcriptome sequencing, suggesting that they may exert their antiviral effects by modulating the host cell’s innate immune response signaling pathways. Although the use of fluorescent reporter viruses has certain limitations, their high throughput and efficiency offer significant potential in the research of antiviral drug screening.Data availability statementThe transcriptomic sequencing data presented in the study are deposited in the China National Microbiology Data Center (NMDC; https:/mdc.cn/en) repository, BioProject accession number NMDC10018695.

Kate Brady / Flickr cc On July 6, the ministry reported the first new case, which involves a 3-year-old boy from Takeo province in the southern part of the country. Initial symptoms included fever, cough, and breathing difficulty. The boy was hospitalized, and his condition is improving. An investigation found that 10 days earlier he had touched and held a chicken that had died in the village.Both cousins exposed to dead poultryToday the ministry reported a second case, involving a 5-year-old girl who is a cousin of the first patient and lived in the same home. The girl had a fever and is receiving treatment. Officials said her illness is mild. Investigators found that she had also touched the dead chicken.So far, the clade isn't known, but other recent H5N1 illnesses in Cambodia were linked to the older 2.3.2.1c clade that circulates in poultry in some Asian countries, including Cambodia. It is different from the 2.3.4.4b clade affecting wild birds, poultry, and some mammals across several world regions. Cambodia has reported an uptick in human infections, with 13 reported since February 2023. The infections are often serious or fatal. Canada reports rise in resistant gonorrhea News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Gonorrhea The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) last week reported an increase in antimicrobial-resistant gonococcal (AMR-GC) infections, including a near doubling of cases showing resistance or decreased susceptibility to two different antimicrobials.The Enhanced Surveillance of Antimicrobial-Resistant Gonorrhea (ESAG) report summarizes data on 3,377 gonorrhea cases submitted for analysis in four Canadian provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Novia Scotia, and the Northwest Territories) from 2018 through 2021. Most patients (80.2%) were male, of which an average of 55.5% were among men who have sex with men (MSM). From 2018 through 2020, the prevalence of AMR-GC (as indicated by resistance to at least one antibiotic) was stable, but it increased from 69.3% in 2020 to 77.4% in 2021, while GC cultures demonstrating resistance or decreased susceptibility to two different antimicrobials rose from 24.8% to 44.5%. In 2021, the AMR-GC burden was highest among MSM (85.2% of isolated cultures were resistant to at least one antimicrobial), followed by heterosexual men (73.5%) and women (66.7%). Recommended regimen remains effectiveOf tested antimicrobials, resistance to ciprofloxacin was most prevalent, rising from 46.6% of cases in 2020 to 63.1% in 2021. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was high among all sexual behavior groups but highest among MSM. But no cases demonstrating combined resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone or cefixime (the gonorrhea treatment regimens recommended by PHAC) were reported. Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone or cefixime was detected in one case each in 2018, 2020, and 2021, and in three cases in 2019.Fourteen cases were reported by public health authorities as treatment failures, but none demonstrated resistance or decreased susceptibility to prescribed treatment regimens.PHAC says that, as gonorrhea cases rise across Canada and resistance continues to evolve, it's hoping to recruit additional ESAG sites to collect more representative data."The continuous monitoring of AMR-GC patterns via surveillance is of paramount importance to ensure the effectiveness of the recommended antimicrobials to treat GC infection," the agency said. "ESAG can play an important role in assessing and monitoring the effectiveness of GC treatment options and for the success of Canadian initiatives to combat AMR-GC." Probiotics have minimal effect on kids' gut microbiota, study finds News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship ChrisChrisW / iStock A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial found that a probiotic supplement had only a minor and transient effect on the gut microbiome composition of children during and after antibiotic treatment, researchers reported late last week in JAMA Network Open.The trial, which involved 350 children and was conducted at three hospitals in the Netherlands and two in Poland, found that a multispecies probiotic given to participants within 24 hours of initiating antibiotics had no effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), but did reduce the overall risk of diarrhea during and for 7 days after antibiotic treatment compared with placebo. For the secondary analysis, to better understand the underlying protective mechanism of probiotics, the investigators collected stool samples from 88 children in the trial (44 from the probiotics group and 44 from the placebo group) at four predefined times and conducted microbiota analysis.Minimal effect on bacterial diversityThe stool samples were collected and analyzed at inclusion in the trial, on the last day of antibiotic use, on the last day of the study intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. Alpha diversity did not significantly differ between the probiotic and placebo groups during the first three collection times, and Beta diversity was not significantly different at any of the collection times. Shannon diversity (mean, 3.56 vs 3.09) and inverse Simpson diversity (mean, 3.75 vs –1.31) indices were higher in the placebo group compares with the probiotic group 1 month after intervention.While the analysis did find that three of five bacterial genera contained in the probiotic—Ligilactobacillus, Lactiplantibacillus, and Lactobacillus—were more abundant in children from the probiotic group than the placebo group during supplementation, the difference between the groups disappeared after 1 month. "It therefore remains debated whether probiotics have beneficial effects on antibiotic-induced microbiota composition aberrations," the study authors wrote. They add that future studies are needed to assess whether the observed transient effects on taxonomic composition and on diversity play any role in preventing AAD and other adverse effects from antibiotics. Sleep disturbances linked to worse COVID-19 outcomes News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 iStock A new meta-analysis of 48 observational studies that included 8,664,026 people reveals that pre-existing sleep disturbances are tied to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes if infected. The study is published in eClinicalMedicine. Previous studies have shown that up to 50% of COVID-19 patients experience sleep disturbances, and sleep disturbances are linked to "daytime drowsiness, work burnout, and low spirits but also induce immune deficiency and systematic inflammation," the authors note.For the purposes of this study, sleep disturbances included obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, abnormal sleep duration (less than 6 hours or more than 9), night-shift work, and restless legs syndrome already documented before infection with COVID-19 The studies analyzed had sample sizes ranging from 118 to 4.9 million and were conducted in 15 countries, including 19 studies based on US patients. Pre-existing sleep disturbances were tied to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection of 12% (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 1.18), hospitalization of 25% (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.36), death of 45% (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.78), and long COVID of 36% (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.57).Findings differ by age, sexAge and gender played a role in the findings, with men with sleep disturbances more likely to die from COVID than women with sleep disturbances. Young individuals with pre-existing sleep disturbances had a higher susceptibility and hospitalization for COVID-19 than those without."Young individuals with pre-existing sleep disturbances had a higher susceptibility and hospitalization for COVID-19 than those without. This finding further confirmed the compromised immune function induced by sleep disturbances," the authors wrote. "In old individuals, those with pre-existing sleep disturbances elevated the hospitalization and mortality of COVID-19 but did not increase the susceptibility compared with those without."

Register ADVERTISEMENT A Quarter Horse mare at a boarding facility in Simcoe County, Ontario, is positive for equine influenza, and multiple other horses have clinical signs. | Adobe Stock On June 26, a 5-year-old Quarter Horse mare at a boarding facility in Simcoe County, Ontario, tested positive for equine influenza. This mare is one of several horses displaying signs of respiratory disease in the barn. The horses returned from a competition a few days before the index case (a gelding) was examined for nasal discharge and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. S. equi testing was negative in the index case and the influenza-positive mare. Within the next 48-72 hours, several of the horses in the barn developed similar respiratory signs. Some of the horses are vaccinated for influenza and have more mild signs. The affected horses are under quarantine. EDCC Health Watch is an Equine Network marketing program that utilizes information from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) to create and disseminate verified equine disease reports. The EDCC is an independent nonprofit organization that is supported by industry donations in order to provide open access to infectious disease information. About Equine Influenza Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that infects horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus that causes it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with humans’ contaminated hands, shoes, or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets, or other equipment. Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106°F); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse’s health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread. ​Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the six months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from. In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse’s chance of infection and disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

Study: Pathogenicity and transmissibility of bovine H5N1 influenza virus. Image Credit: Toa55 / Shutterstock Background After unexplained symptoms and reduced milk production in dairy cattle in Texas, HPAI H5N1 was detected in cow milk and nasal wash samples on March 25, 2024. By May 30, 2024, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed 69 infected herds in nine states, with spread linked to cattle movement and potential transmission through contaminated milking equipment. This outbreak, alongside cases in farm workers and cats, underscores the public health risk. The bovine H5N1 virus is closely related to North American wild bird strains. Further research is necessary to understand its replication, pathogenicity, and transmission in mammals. About the study In the present study, animals were acclimated to the facilities before the start of the experiments, maintained on a 12-hour light cycle, and provided with food, water, and enrichment. Humane endpoint criteria included ≥35% body weight loss or inability to remain upright. In the United States (US), HPAI viruses are classified as 'Select Agents' under federal regulations, requiring immediate reporting to the Federal Select Agent Program. All experiments were conducted in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories at the Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, approved for studies with these viruses. The research received funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR). All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committees of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were used for virus isolation and amplification, and no mutations emerged during passage in these cells. The isolated virus, A/dairy cattle/New Mexico/A240920343-93/2024 (H5N1), was fully sequenced and found to be part of the same clade as other publicly available cow H5N1 virus sequences. This virus and control viruses were used for all studies. Mice and ferrets were used to test replication, pathogenicity, and respiratory droplet transmission. Lactating mice were also used to study vertical transmission. Tissue samples were collected for virus titration and plaque assays, while receptor specificity was compared among different virus strains. The studies were reviewed and approved by relevant institutional committees, and the NIAID grant for the research was determined not to meet the criteria of Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). Study results To evaluate the public health risk of H5N1 virus-containing milk, researchers demonstrated that oral consumption of milk from an HPAI H5N1-infected cow led to rapid disease symptoms and virus dissemination in Bagg Albino Laboratory-Bred Mouse/C strain J (BALB/cJ) mice. Repeating this experiment with smaller volumes of milk, they observed substantial weight loss and virus titers in the lung, nasal turbinate, and brain in mice inoculated with 25 μl or 10 μl of infected milk. In contrast, mice inoculated with 25 μl of milk from a healthy cow showed no symptoms. Mice inoculated with smaller volumes (5 μl and 1 μl) exhibited less apparent disease and sporadic virus replication. No seroconversion was observed in surviving mice. Related StoriesH5N1 bird flu is mutating fast and jumping to mammals - could the next pandemic be here?Oropouche virus spreads in South America as scientists warn of potential outbreaks in the U.S.Scientists detect replication-competent Oropouche virus in semen of traveler, sparking transmission fearsTo assess pathogenicity after respiratory exposure, female BALB/cJ mice were inoculated with serial dilutions of Cow-H5N1, monitoring body weight and survival. The mouse lethal dose 50 (MLD50) was 31.6 PFU, comparable to clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 mink viruses from Spain, but higher than that of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203)-H5N1, an avian H5N1 virus. Tissue tropism studies revealed systemic infections with Cow-H5N1 and VN1203-H5N1, with high virus titers in respiratory and non-respiratory organs, including mammary glands, teats, and muscle tissues. The Isumi-H1N1 virus was detected only in respiratory tissues. Infected ferrets exhibited similar virus replication patterns, with high titers in respiratory and non-respiratory organs, but no virus was detected in blood or muscle tissues. Next, lactating mice were tested for vertical transmission of Cow-H5N1 to pups or adult contacts. Lactating females were inoculated and either reunited with their pups or placed with non-lactating adults. Virus replication was observed in lactating females, and some pups became infected, but no virus was detected in adult contacts. The virus was detected in the mammary glands and milk of some lactating females, suggesting vertical transmission via milk. Finally, a respiratory droplet transmission experiment in ferrets showed that while Isumi-H1N1 transmitted efficiently, Cow-H5N1 did not. However, one exposed ferret had a low positive hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer, indicating possible inefficient transmission. Receptor binding specificity studies revealed that Cow-H5N1 bound to both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids, unlike the avian VN1203-H5N1 virus, suggesting the potential for Cow-H5N1 to bind to cells in the human upper respiratory tract. Conclusions To summarize, HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses do not typically transmit efficiently among mammals, and influenza A viruses are rarely detected in cattle. However, the current HPAI H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows and spillover into other mammals poses significant risks to public health and the dairy industry. Despite over 850 human infections, sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission has not been reported, though recent outbreaks in mink and sea mammals suggest it is possible. In this study, a bovine HPAI H5N1 virus exhibited limited respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets, supporting findings of potential mammal-to-mammal transmission. The virus also displayed dual human/avian-type receptor-binding specificity, highlighting the pandemic potential of these viruses. Journal reference: Eisfeld, A. J. et al.

Four cases of H5N1 infection in people â all of them farm workers in close contact with cattle â have been confirmed, but there has been no known onward transmission to others. However, the virus has adapted so there is more mammal-to-mammal transmission in multiple places in the world. Global health security experts say the virus is not considered a current risk to the general population, but they caution that the H5N1 risk level is not static. It could changeâup or downâas the virus mutates. âWhile there have been just a few confirmed cases in people, CEPIâs approach for the moment is one of calm urgency,â says Nicole Lurie, CEPIâs Executive Director for Preparedness and Response. âItâs much better to be ahead of the curve than behind it, so you have a greater chance of containing an outbreak. We think of preparation actions a bit like putting our shoes on in case we need to start running.â Since CEPI is a âno-regretsâ organisation that wants to act as swiftly as is warranted, it is now âpreparing to respondâ to any change in the H5N1 threat level. CEPI has pulled together a cross-departmental group of its expertsâincluding epidemiologists, vaccine R&D specialists, regulatory, preclinical and clinical testing, and manufacturing expertsâto monitor the outbreak and initiate pre-emptive steps that could put the world ahead of H5N1 if it were to pose a greater human threat. Those steps including exploring potential H5N1 vaccine development using computer-assisted design of H5N1 immunogensâsubstances that trigger an immune responseâand looking at the potential role of mRNAâthe technology behind some of the lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines that were developed and authorised in under a year. Each of these approaches has the potential to produce a vaccine that is better or can be manufactured faster than the traditional approach of making flu shots by growing virus in eggs and cells. CEPI is also in discussion with partners across the pandemic preparedness and response ecosystem, including national governments and global health partners such as the WHO, Gavi and others to think about how we can best collaborate to improve H5N1 preparedness and increase equitable access to doses. And it is talking to its network of vaccine manufacturers in the Global South to better understand and then navigate the potential barriers that might stand in the way of scaling up production of new H5N1 vaccines if they were needed. Through its partnerships across research and policy, CEPI is also using its voice to advocate for equitable access. With currently available doses limited and already being bought up by high-income countries, there is concern that, as we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic, low- and middle-income countries could once again be pushed to the back of the queue. âWe estimate internally that 50 percent of existing supply is already tied up in contracts or potentially subject to export controlsâ explains Lurie. âVaccine equity should be a forethought, not an afterthought. The goal of equity does not necessarily need to compete with the need for sovereign nations to protect their populations.â If the epidemiological situation escalates, CEPI will ramp up its response, always trying to be a step ahead, and always focusing on equity as a goal. And, on the other hand, if human case numbers remain low and the work of CEPI partners engage in isnât necessarily needed right now, âthe data and knowledge generated will still be incredibly important to help improve understanding of H5N1 and other highly pathogenic flu viruses,â says Lurie. âTaking these steps now will also allow our partners to test out how they could better prepare for future viral disease outbreaks.â Such preparedness thinking is central to the 100 Days Mission, the ambitious goal spearheaded by CEPI and embraced by the G7, G20 and industry leaders to reduce vaccine development timelines and create vaccines against a novel virus in as little as 100 days.

The research team isolated the virus from the milk of an infected cow in New Mexico (USA) and found that it spreads in mice and ferrets, reaching the mammary glands of both animals. In addition, the virus was also transmitted from infected lactating mice to their offspring. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has issued a press release on Monday recommending increased surveillance for these viruses. SMC Spain 08/07/2024 - 17:00 CEST Versión en castellano Expert reactions Aitor Nogales - gripe leche mamíferos EN Aitor Nogales González Virologist (senior scientist) at the Animal Health Research Centre (CISA, INIA-CSIC) Center for Animal Health Research (CISA) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain Recently, in March 2024, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 was reported for the first time in dairy cows. This was the first time that these avian influenza viruses were detected in cattle. These outbreaks have spread across several US states and are in addition to those already observed across the globe in other mammals such as sea lions, cats and mink. In addition, as a consequence of the spread of the virus in livestock, infections have also been described in workers who have been in contact with infected animals, as well as other farm animals, such as cats and, of course, birds. The virus was also detected in cow's milk and it is thought that this could be a route of transmission. In this good work by Kawaoka's prestigious group, the pathogenicity and transmission of a virus isolated from contaminated milk has been characterised. Two animal models widely used in the field, mice and ferrets, were used. Researchers have shown that animals can become infected by consuming contaminated milk and that vertical transmission occurs in suckling mice. However, the bovine H5N1 virus was transmitted inefficiently by the respiratory route in ferrets. Some of these results are similar to those obtained with other H5N1 viruses in the past. However, the researchers also point out that the virus isolated in the cattle outbreak possesses characteristics that may facilitate infection and transmission in mammals, including humans. This conclusion is mainly due to the ability of the virus to bind to cellular receptors present in the upper respiratory tract of humans. Given the increase of cases in mammals that have been infected by avian influenza subtype H5N1 and the characteristic evolvability and adaptability of the influenza virus, the situation should continue to be actively monitored. In addition, it is important to assess the evolution of the virus and the functional significance of changes in its genome to identify possible adaptations to mammals, including humans. Although the risk to the population, in general, is considered low, this situation could change in the future and we must remain vigilant. We must remember that recent influenza pandemics have had avian influenza as a key player. The author has declared they have no conflicts of interest Language EN Gustavo del Real - gripe leche mamíferos EN Gustavo del Real Researcher at the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis and Transmission (CRIPT) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA and researcher at the National Institute for Agrarian and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain In March this year, the first outbreak of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle was announced. It occurred in the state of New Mexico (USA) and, as of May, 69 affected herds have been reported in nine other states. In parallel, several cats on affected farms have died and there have been three cases of farmers infected with conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms. This is a quantum leap in the ability of these highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses to transmit to other non-poultry animal species. Until now, transmission of this type of virus to various mammalian species, especially cats, mustelids, seals, elephants and sea lions, as well as a few hundred isolated human cases, had been reported. Fortunately, subsequent sustained transmission between individuals of these species is not very efficient, with the exception of those that have occurred in recent months in marine mammals off the coasts of South America and in the Antarctic region. The novelty of this new episode, apart from affecting the bovine species for the first time, is the presence of the virus in the milk of infected cows, which facilitates a new route of transmission of the virus both to their offspring and, potentially, to the human species - only if the milk is not properly sanitised. According to the authors of this experimental study, conducted in mice and ferrets, the ability to transmit through milk derives from the virus's ability to proliferate in the mammary gland. This new ability of the virus may have been produced by its ability to use appropriate cellular receptors as a result of its adaptation to mammals. This first experimental approach will open up new studies carried out in the bovine species itself to reveal the pathogenesis of the infection, as well as the possibilities of transmission to other animal species and, especially, to humans as it is a key livestock species. The author has not responded to our request to declare conflicts of interest Language EN Elisa Pérez - gripe leche mamíferos EN Elisa Pérez Veterinary virologist at the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA - CSIC) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain This is a very solid article carried out by a group of recognised prestige in the area of research on avian influenza viruses. The results are highly relevant for their impact on animal and public health in the context of a very relevant and highly topical health alert: H5N1 avian influenza. Since the end of 2020, this virus has caused the death of millions of poultry worldwide and hundreds of thousands of wild birds. In fact, we are living through the largest avian influenza epidemic in history. The impact on the poultry industry and wildlife has been devastating. In addition, the virus has become progressively more capable of jumping to mammals, first in the wild (with mass mortalities of marine mammals in South America, for example), then mink in fur farms in Spain and Finland, outbreaks in domestic cats and finally, the most unexpected and probably the most worrying jump: dairy cattle in the United States. This subtype has never before been detected in ruminants, so this is a completely new scenario with many question marks. Since the end of March, when the virus was confirmed in the first herd in Texas, the virus has been spreading unstoppably across the country, affecting 141 farms in 12 states. This is the context for this study, which attempts to answer some key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to be transmitted between mammals by different routes. The authors confirm that the H5N1 virus in cows (belonging to a specific genotype called B3.13) can cause systemic infection in mice. Mice are easily infected both orally (by ingesting milk from infected cows) and intranasally (by inoculating the virus into the nostrils). Infection by both routes causes disease and death in a percentage of mice and the virus is distributed throughout the body, reaching the mammary glands. In fact, the authors confirm that vertical transmission can occur in the mouse model, i.e. a lactating female can transmit the virus to her offspring via milk. In addition to mice, this study also evaluates the characteristics of infection in ferrets, which is a species commonly used in in vivo research on influenza viruses and is considered a model closer to humans. Intranasal inoculation in this species also caused disease in the animals and the virus managed to reach many organs, including the brain, eye and mammary glands. Airborne transmission between ferrets occurred, but inefficiently because only one of the "contact" animals developed antibodies, although the virus could not be detected in the nasal swabs of this individual. Another very relevant finding of this study is that they have shown that the virus isolated in cows has a high affinity for the receptors that the virus normally uses to enter avian cells (alpha 2,3) but also for mammalian receptors (alpha 2,6). These receptors are present in the upper respiratory tract of humans, so this particular genotype of H5N1 may be more capable of infecting and transmitting between humans. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the H5N1 subtype isolated in cows has a high tropism (affinity) for the mammary glands, where it replicates intensively, and that at least in mice, the offspring of an infected lactating female can become infected by suckling. This is very relevant in terms of food safety implications in cow's milk and as a possible route of mother-to-calf transmission in cow farms. Furthermore, it is the first time that an avian influenza virus has the ability to bind not only to avian but also to mammalian cell receptors and, albeit inefficiently, can be transmitted by air between ferrets. All these results indicate a high potential for transmission between mammals and thus an increased pandemic potential of this particular subtype. With this new information, the importance of keeping a close eye on the H5N1 virus is even more evident. It is never good news when a highly pathogenic virus of avian origin adapts to mammals, but in this case the situation is particularly worrying because this is a livestock species with intense interaction with humans. Faced with this risk scenario, it is imperative to support a One Health strategy in which health surveillance is intensified both in cattle and in workers who are in contact with these animals.

The occasional jumps to mammals, including occasionally humans, have the scientific community vigilant and working on the characterisation of viruses emerging in new mammalian species to understand the risk they pose to global/human health. This work is part of these studies, which range from characterising the bovine udder epithelium and virus replication, transmission to calves or transmissibility to abundant and important mammals for the epidemiology of influenza A viruses such as pigs, to studies of transmissibility between different mammalian species or between individuals. Here, a team with extensive experience in the study of influenza A viruses and with abundant means to perform experimental studies in high biosafety laboratories, experimentally demonstrates several characteristics of one of the viruses isolated from a dairy cow. His results show that transmission of this particular virus between ferrets, a species commonly used as a model for humans, is inefficient. However, it highlights other characteristics that reflect the risk posed by these viruses, such as the ability to bind to both avian and human respiratory epithelial receptors. Overall, it reflects, like many other papers, particularities of the virus that may constitute a high risk if other adaptive changes are added that may allow the virus to easily transmit and infect mammals, including humans.

Listen: State Veterinarian Mark Ernst discusses testing dairy cattle prior to exhibiting and the importance of biosecurity Your browser does not support the audio element. Testing must be conducted by a National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory and the negative test must be brought to the exhibition. The animals must be sampled no more than seven calendar days prior to the date of arrival at the show.All test results are animal specific, so the identification tag on the animal must match the identification on the test results. If one animal being exhibited from a herd has not been tested, all animals in the herd will be ineligible for exhibition. If one animal in a herd tests positive, no other animals in the herd will be permitted to attend exhibitions for at least 30 days.The new requirement takes effect July 17 and applies to all livestock exhibitions in the state occurring on or after that date.While Illinois currently has no reported cases of H5N1 in dairy cattle, 12 states have confirmed cases, and IDOA said this step is being taken out of an abundance of caution.“Our best defense against animal disease is biosecurity,” said Dr. Mark Ernst, IDOA state veterinarian. “We are committed to working closely with all stakeholders — from veterinarians and testing labs to exhibitors and fair managers — to identify and implement best practices to limit or prevent the spread of disease.”For more information about testing and a list of approved labs, visit agr.illinois.gov Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Dairy Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Livestock Exhibitions OUR MISSION: We are committed to the economic well-being of Illinois agriculture and enriching the quality of farm family life.

The newly added outbreaks include 3 in Colorado, 1 in Michigan, and 1 in Texas, boosting the USDA's total to 145 in 12 states.Separately, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health reported another new outbreak in a dairy herd, which involves cows from Benton County in the central part of the state. Minnesota has now reported eight H5N1 outbreaks at dairy farms.More cat and wild-bird positivesIn related developments, APHIS confirmed H5N1 detections in three more domestic cats, two from Minnesota and one from Michigan, raising the total since 2022 to 33.A notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) said the cats from Minnesota were feral barn cats on an affected dairy farm in Sibley County in south central Minnesota. Samples were collected on June 10.Meanwhile, APHIS said samples from the Michigan cat were collected on April 18 and that the cat was from Ottawa County, one of 10 Michigan counties affected by outbreaks in dairy cows. Also, APHIS reported an H5N1 detection in a raccoon from Ottawa County, with samples collected on the same date as the cat.Additionally, APHIS reported four more H5N1 detections in wild birds from two Iowa counties, all agency-harvested birds that were sampled in mid to late June. The birds that tested positive were from Plymouth and Sioux counties and included a red-winged blackbird, robin, turkey vulture, and barn swallow.

FluGen, Inc. – Findings reported today in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases– Study shows synergistic immunological response generated by M2SR and Fluzone High Dose vaccine when used in combination in the highly vulnerable 65-85 years old population – Results suggest approach could be used for vaccination against future influenza pandemics such as H5N1 MADISON, Wis., July 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FluGen, Inc., a clinical-stage vaccine company transforming vaccine efficacy in infectious respiratory diseases, today announced the results of its study comparing the coadministration of intranasal M2SR and the high dose flu shot in an unprecedented study of older adults ages 65-85 years. The findings are reported today in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00351-7/fulltext). The study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunological response to FluGen’s investigational supra-seasonal, live, single-replication, intranasal influenza (flu) vaccine when administered with Sanofi’s Fluzone High Dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). There is a demonstrated unmet need for improved flu vaccine options, as current injectable vaccines primarily generate hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies and have shown only modest efficacy in most flu seasons. Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), this study evaluated M2SR and Fluzone High Dose alone, and dosed concomitantly, in healthy adults 65-85 years of age, a population considered highly vulnerable to mortality from flu. “Influenza continues to be a major cause of seasonal respiratory epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in older adults. Current vaccines fall short in three main areas – they don’t last long enough, they don’t protect against viruses that mutate and they don’t block the initial infection in the upper respiratory tract,” said Robert Belshe, MD, founder of Saint Louis University’s Center for Vaccine Development and recipient of the 2023 American College of Physicians James D. Bruce Memorial Award for Distinguished Contributions in Preventive Medicine “The results from this study represent a potential solution that might save millions of older adults from getting sick or worse.” Intranasal vaccines are known to provide a wall of defense at the site of infection to help prevent influenza viruses from entering the nasal mucosa. Intranasal M2SR has shown the ability to elicit mucosal antibodies and also protect against drifted strains while being durable. Standard flu shots on the other hand, generate antibodies in the blood to help fight off the virus after it has already entered the body. Combining the benefits of both nasally delivered vaccines and the standard shot provide the best of both worlds. The study demonstrated M2SR’s ability to statistically significantly raise mucosal antibodies in the nasal passages, serum antibodies against matched and drifted strains of the influenza virus, and cellular immune responses in subjects when compared to Fluzone High Dose and placebo. In a prior Phase 2 drifted H3N2 challenge trial, M2SR demonstrated efficacy against infection and illness across seven years of flu virus drift. Previous studies have also demonstrated that while currently licensed influenza vaccines administered by intramuscular injection generate tremendous antibody responses, only intranasal M2SR stimulates mucosal and cellular immunity as well as serum antibodies. “The idea of delivering two vaccines in one sitting has become widely accepted,” said Paul Radspinner, President and Chief Executive Officer of FluGen. “Imagine being at your local pharmacy for your annual flu shot and also receiving a quick nasal spray that would greatly enhance your chances not only of becoming seriously ill but of being infected at all. This combination solution could have a tremendous impact on the health of older adults." Radspinner went on to discuss the possible impact on influenza pandemic protection. “If H5N1 or any other mutating influenza strain were to begin infecting millions of people as SARS-CoV-2 did, imagine the benefits of combining an intranasal vaccine, which could stop most infections from occurring, with a strong antibody-based vaccine shot. The impact on human health could be unequalled in our history.” The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b study, entitled FluGen H3N2 v006 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05163847) was designed to evaluate a monovalent Cambodia 2020 H3N2 M2SR influenza A vaccine in a healthy, older adult population. The study enrolled over 300 subjects in four cohorts receiving either M2SR alone, high dose IIV alone, both vaccines concomitantly or placebo. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of monovalent M2SR influenza vaccine delivered intranasally alone or concomitantly with high dose IIV delivered intramuscularly to healthy subjects 65 to 85 years of age. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of serum and mucosal antibody responses to matched and drifted strains of influenza virus following monovalent M2SR influenza vaccine delivered intranasally alone or concomitantly with high dose IIV delivered intramuscularly. Exploratory endpoints included evaluation of additional immune parameters such as T-cell responses.

The chickens showed signs of hoarseness, as well as crest and wattles cyanosis.The flock included 1,708 chickens, and 74 of those birds were confirmed as HPAI cases. Of those 74, 62 had died.The virus is of the H5 (N untyped) variety, WOAH stated.Control measures are being implemented, including stamping out, traceability, quarantine, disinfection, surveillance within and outside of the restricted zone, movement control, official destruction of animal products and official disposal of carcasses, byproducts and waste.Prior to this, the last time HPAI was detected at a commercial poultry operation in Peru was in February, when a flock of 27,000 laying hens in Chepén was affected.Non-commercial cases of HPAI in PeruOn the same day WOAH issued a report concerning the layer flock infection, it issued another oat a non-commercial flock, describing the affected birds merely as “non-poultry birds.”The affected farm is in the Dean Valdivia District.According to WOAH, the flock involved 70 birds, of which, 66 were considered positive cases, with six of those birds being deceased.The birds had been displaying hoarseness, weakness and head oedema.Since November 2022, WOAH has reported 13,733 non-poultry birds in Peru as susceptible to HPAI.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email INFECTIOUS DISEASE Ferret study shows bird flu found in US cows carries low risk of airborne transmission Study shows avian influenza strain found in US cows not easily transmitted through air, but it is possible Reuters Published July 8, 2024 2:03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video CDC issues alert over bird flu case Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel on what to know about bird flu and why it is important to not look directly at the solar eclipse without proper glasses Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that the strain of avian influenza found in U.S. cows is not easily transmitted through the air among ferrets, but it does have some capability of spreading this way. The experiment involved ferrets infected with bird flu being placed near healthy animals, but not close enough for physical contact. No virus was recovered from the healthy ferrets during the study, but one of them produced antibodies suggesting it had been infected.The pandemic threat of H5N1 is assessed by public health agencies worldwide as low, as there is no evidence yet of any human-to-human transmission.The bird flu strain found in cows in the United States is not easily transmitted through the air among ferrets, a new study shows, although the scientist who led the work said it had shown some ability to spread this way. Ferrets are considered to be the best small mammal for studying influenza virus infection and transmission, and are often used to inform assessments of the public health risk of emerging viruses.In the experiment led by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ferrets infected with a sample of the H5N1 bird flu strain were placed near healthy animals, but not close enough for physical contact. BIRD FLU-INFECTED COWS HAVE DIED IN 5 STATES AS EXPERTS CLOSELY MONITOR THE DISEASE None of the four healthy ferrets exposed in this way became ill, and no virus was recovered from them during the study. However, one of the ferrets had produced antibodies to the virus, the researchers later found, suggesting it had been infected."It is good news that the virus does not have extensive transmissibility between ferrets through the air, but it is concerning that it has the ability to transmit (at all in this way)," said study author and flu virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka. Cows stand in their pen at a cattle farm in Rockford, Illinois, U.S., April 9, 2024. Fact (Reuters/Jim Vondruska/File Photo) A virus that can spread easily through the air between humans would pose a greater pandemic threat than H5N1 currently does.That risk is currently assessed by public health agencies worldwide as low, as there is no evidence yet of any human-to-human transmission. Four human cases have been reported in the U.S. since avian flu was confirmed in dairy cows in March. All have recovered. The study, published on Monday in Nature, also showed the bird flu virus in cows can bind to human-type receptors under lab conditions. These receptors are how flu viruses typically enter and infect human cells in the real world.Bird flu prefers to bind to avian-type receptors only, which are scarce in humans. The lab results need further study to assess their real-world implications, scientists said, as in the past flu viruses that developed the ability to bind to both types have caused human pandemics.The study also confirmed that the virus, isolated from the milk of an infected cow in New Mexico, made both mice and ferrets sick after exposure to the unpasteurized milk. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt also spread through the body to muscles and mammary glands in infected mice, as it appears to do in cows.Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said it was a relief to see the virus had not yet acquired the capability to cause a human pandemic, but this did not mean it would never do so, particularly if the spread among cows goes unchecked. "It's always better to stop a pandemic before it starts than to respond to it once it has started. We should heed this warning and take action now," she said via email.

Dr. Reed specializes in IV medications. learn more Close gahsoon / Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises everyone aged 6 months and older to get the flu shot each year. The best time to get a flu shot is September or October. It may be too early to get a flu shot in July or August because its efficacy reduces over time. You'll want to make sure you have immunity before peak flu season, which is typically from December to February. Influenza (the flu) is a highly contagious respiratory illness that's caused by a virus. About 8% of the U.S. population develops the flu every year. The vaccine can effectively protect you and others from getting sick. Read on to learn what happens if you get a flu shot too early and why you need one. Can Adults Get the HPV Vaccine? When Is Flu Season? Flu season occurs in the fall and winter in the U.S., but influenza viruses spread throughout the year. The CDC says flu activity typically peaks between December and February but can persist until May. When Should You Get the Flu Shot? The CDC recommends that you wait until at least September or October to get an annual flu shot. It's important to get the flu shot when it's going to be most effective, which is right before flu season. Getting the flu shot in the fall will offer optimal protection. Keep in mind that you can still get the flu vaccine later in the season, even if you miss the fall recommendation. Some protection is better than none. You might need to wait to get a flu shot if you're sick. It's not necessarily a bad idea to get a flu shot when you're sick, but the CDC advises against it if you have moderate or severe illness. Research has shown that a weak immune system can negatively affect the way your body responds to the vaccine. You can get a flu shot as soon as you feel better after being sick. Some groups of people may need to get a flu shot earlier in the year. The CDC advises exceptions for children and pregnant people. A healthcare provider may recommend that children get two doses of the vaccines, given four weeks apart. Pregnant people might also consider getting a flu shot in July or August if they're in the third trimester. The flu shot helps protect the baby after birth when they're too young to be vaccinated. What Happens if You Get a Flu Shot Too Early? July and August may be too early for most adults since the protection can wear off by the time flu season peaks. Getting a flu shot in September or October allows the body to trigger enough protection against the virus and ensures it can last through peak flu season. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for enough antibodies to form and achieve full immunity. The flu shot decreases in efficacy each month after vaccination. Research has shown that people still have protection for at least six months after the shot. Why Do I Need It? You need to get a flu shot each year. The flu virus evolves and mutates, allowing for different strains to dominate each flu season. Scientists update the flu vaccine yearly to protect against the dominant strain. They monitor data from different parts of the world, including the Southern Hemisphere. Flu season peaks from April to May in the Southern Hemisphere, which helps scientists predict the dominant strain. It's especially important to get a flu shot to protect yourself and others from getting sick. The vaccine will significantly reduce the severity of the illness if you do happen to get sick. It's estimated that flu vaccination prevented 7.52 million illnesses between 2019 and 2020 while lessening the hospital burden by 108,000 hospitalizations. How To Prevent the Flu Getting an annual flu shot is the best way to protect yourself and others from the flu. Other ways to prevent infection include: Avoiding contact with people who are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects that people often touch (e.g., door knobs and counters) Covering your mouth and nose with the crook of your elbow if you cough or sneeze Regularly washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Staying home if you're sick Using hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable How Was the COVID-19 Vaccine Developed—and So Quickly? A Quick Review The flu shot is essential every year to protect you against the viral infection. You may want to wait until at least September or October when you hear your local pharmacy is offering flu shots in the summer. Getting your flu shot in the fall can make sure you benefit from all the protection a flu vaccine can offer. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

So far only one of Pennsylvania’s nearly 5,000 dairies has completed the three-week enrollment period, and a few farms are interested, Hamberg said.The state provides the sampling and shipping materials. The only cost to the farm is the time to collect and box up the samples, he said.Enrolled farms can do interstate shipment of lactating dairy cows without additional individual animal testing. If a farm continues to test, it can stay enrolled after testing positive for influenza.One processor is also participating in testing of milk trucks arriving at the plant. Hamberg is working with other processors to do blind testing to ensure the state is negative for avian influenza in dairy.Avian influenza can be detected in milk up to two weeks before cows become sick, so milk testing allows the state to identify and respond to infections quickly, Hamberg said.The testing is also intended to reassure the public that milk is safe to drink. In addition, pasteurization destroys the virus.Pennsylvania has not reported any influenza cases in dairy cows so far, but more than 140 dairy herds in 12 states have tested positive since the virus was found in cattle earlier this year.Over 50 cases were reported in the past 30 days, according to USDA.Beyond the voluntary surveillance testing, Hamberg pressed farmers to report suspicious illnesses promptly to their veterinarian or the Ag Department.“I just can’t urge that enough,” he said.In another state, Hamberg said, two dairy farms were pretty sure they had avian influenza in their cows but waited to report it.In that time, a large adjacent layer complex tested positive.Unlike with dairies, infected poultry farms must be depopulated.“If (the dairies) had known there was a problem earlier and reported it, perhaps that could have given (the poultry farm) a better shot at remaining negative,” Hamberg said.Reporting avian influenza in cows also helps protect neighboring dairy farms. Sick cows lose some milk production, which reduces farmers’ income.Hamberg said the state can protect the identity of an infected farm at least until the infection on the site is cleared.The state Right-to-Know Law includes an exemption for information that is part of an active investigation.That doesn’t mean the farm’s identity would remain private indefinitely.But Hamberg’s counterparts in affected states have said dairy farms have not lost contracts because of flu infections, and consumers continue to buy milk.Milk testing could also reduce the potential for spreading avian influenza to humans.A few dairy farm workers have gotten eye infections, and one got respiratory symptoms, after exposure to infected milk.This strain of influenza has not evolved to become well suited to humans in its 30 years of existence, but “now that we seem to be seeing increasing spillover, that concern does still exist,” Hamberg said.Flu viruses change quickly, so it is possible the virus could rapidly become more dangerous to people.“We wouldn’t be having all these calls (with industry) if this was just something that would cause mild conjunctivitis in dairy workers,” said Dr. Miriam Wamsley, a respiratory virus epidemiologist at the state Health Department.Dairy cows can be infected and not show clinical signs, so dairy farm workers and milk haulers may want to start using protective gear that covers the eyes, nose, mouth and hands.“Doesn’t mean they have to. It just means it might be a good idea,” Wamsley said.If avian influenza is suspected or confirmed on a farm, everyone who is exposed to the cows or raw milk should wear some combination of an N95 mask, face shield or goggles, plus gloves.Farmers can request this protective gear from the state stockpile, Wamsley said.People most at risk from avian influenza from cows are pregnant or lactating women and their babies, people with chronic respiratory or immune issues, and people 65 and older.Wamsley also recommends workers get a seasonal flu vaccine.Though the summer isn’t peak flu season, the vaccine reduces the risk of problems if someone is infected with both the seasonal flu and avian influenza at the same time.“Those two viruses could swap parts back and forth like Lego pieces, and then we have a new virus to deal with,” Wamsley said.

The Trust Project What is this? WILLMAR — Two breeder turkey flocks in Kandiyohi County and a third in neighboring Renville County are among the latest to be infected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as HPAI or bird flu.The Minnesota Board of Animal Health reported that a flock of 4,259 breeder toms and a flock of 21,938 breeder hens were confirmed as infected on July 9 in Kandiyohi County. It also reported a flock of 15,414 breeder hens was infected on July 9 in Renville County. ADVERTISEMENT This is the first time this year that flocks in Kandiyohi and Renville counties have been infected, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.The July 9 infections are considered atypical in that they occurred outside of the migratory period for wild birds, which can spread the virus.Dr. Shauna Voss, a veterinarian and program director with the Board of Animal Health, said a complicating, sister outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in the state’s dairy population is likely contributing to the disease spread at this time. Dr. Shauna Voss, veterinarian and program director with the Minnesota Board of Animal HealthContributed / Minnesota Board of Animal Health It’s not known how the presence of the virus in some dairy cattle contributed to its spread to poultry. “That is the million-dollar question,” said Voss.She said the state Board of Animal Health has called on the United States Department of Agriculture to provide additional resources to help with the investigation. The state conducts epidemiological studies at each infected farm in hopes of identifying how the virus reached a flock. More on avian flu: F.D. Flam: Lock down the cows to prevent further bird flu spread Oct 1 Kandiyohi County hopes to keep infectious diseases at arm's length with vaccinations Sep 3 Even in a year of H5N1, showcasing dairy is still a priority at Minnesota State Fair Aug 23 Minnesota producers have been very vigilant with biosecurity measures, and breeder farms often have additional layers of security. Voss said the infections at three breeder farms in the two counties is a reminder that nobody is free from the risks posed by this particular virus.“We have not historically thought of cows as something we really need to worry about with this particular virus,” she noted. ADVERTISEMENT Producers need to be vigilant and looking at possible new pathways for infection, especially if they are located near dairies or where their manure is being spread, she explained.Adding to the concerns is the presence of the virus in cats and dogs and mice and rodents that can travel between farms. Cats are especially susceptible to the virus, she said.There is no smoking gun telling investigators how this virus is being spread at this time. “I‘m not entirely sure if we’ll ultimately be able to get the source of everything, but I really hope that we can,” said Voss.

Ashley Kohls, Minnesota Turkey Growers Association executive directorContributed / Minnesota Turkey Growers Association “(It) definitely weighs on the growers emotionally and financially to have this level of surveillance — and to be frank, stress — year around, really weighing on people,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Board of Animal Health, Minnesota has now had 17 commercial poultry flocks struck by the virus in 2024. Along with Kandiyohi and Renville, other Minnesota counties to have confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial poultry this year are Otter Tail, Swift, Pipestone, Stearns, Lyon, Meeker, Morrison and Dodge.No state has had more flocks struck by HPAI during the 2022-24 outbreak. In 2022, virus appeared in 81 flocks, and in 2023, it appeared in 34 flocks.

"Wastewater acts as a 'mirror' of population health," the researchers wrote. "Through the analysis of sewage samples, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides information on substance consumption (licit and illicit drugs, tobacco and alcohol), chemical exposure and the circulation of certain pathogens within a population."The results were posted today in Eurosurveillance.Narrowing the possibilitiesTo identify target pathogens, the researchers used criteria informed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the World Health Organization, arriving at 60 pathogens. They then linked those pathogens to those the Games by France's national public health agency included on a risk map for the event, including notifiable diseases, those associated with foodborne illnesses, acute respiratory infections, emerging infectious diseases, and zoonotic diseases, plus six other infectious diseases considered for WWS.To be monitored in wastewater, pathogens must be excreted in the urine and/or faeces of infected individuals or introduced into sewage via greywater, i.e. from showers and other hygiene activities.Next, they narrowed the list based on pathogen analytical feasibility, relevance to the event and pathogen characteristics, and value in guiding public-health decision making (eg, allocation of hospital beds, physical distancing)."To be monitored in wastewater, pathogens must be excreted in the urine and/or faeces of infected individuals or introduced into sewage via greywater, i.e. from showers and other hygiene activities," the researchers said. "Pathogens must also persist in the environment long enough to be detectable by existing analytical methods."Pathogens that failed to reach the 70% consensus threshold in questionnaires completed by 32 experts were reevaluated by France public health epidemiologists in charge of the country's national wastewater monitoring system using specific criteria, leaving a list of 25 pathogens of interest.The team eventually arrived at six target pathogens: the viruses that cause polio, influenza A, influenza B, mpox, COVID-19, and measles.For example, influenza A and B viruses represent a relevant public health burden, with worldwide distribution and year-round circulation. "Integrating WWS during the 2024 OPG [Olympic and Paralympic Games] could provide valuable insight into the background circulation of influenza A and B viruses in Paris during summer months and facilitate tracking of potential transmission chains of the viruses imported by travellers from the southern hemisphere," the authors wrote.Mpox was chosen for its propensity to remain undiagnosed. "The social stigma related to the higher incidence of mpox among men who have sex with men (MSM) is believed to contribute to its underdiagnosis," they said. "This trend may be exacerbated among foreign tourists during the OPG."More work needed for ParisThe researchers noted the benefits of WWS, which became widely known during its deployment in monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic: collection of data regardless of symptomatic or asymptomatic status, freedom from the availability of testing or test-seeking behavior, low cost, early-warning function, passive provision of community-level data, ability to quantify virus and evaluate genetic diversity, and its use to guide public health decision making.At the time of writing, a wastewater sampling strategy proposal based on the conclusion of this study was under review by the French health authorities.The framework and information gathered in the process are a starting point for a WWS plan for the Paris games, the authors said, but more work is needed before implementation. WWS would use France's existing wastewater treatment network of 54 plants."At the time of writing, a wastewater sampling strategy proposal based on the conclusion of this study was under review by the French health authorities," the researchers wrote. "Upon approval, the next steps will include the selection of operators in charge of sampling and partner laboratories that will perform analyses."Laboratory methods will need to be developed for the detection and quantification of certain pathogens, methods will also need refinement in terms of time efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and the sampling strategy may need adjustment. "A WWS plan for Paris 2024 OPG would serve as an exploratory tool, providing proof of concept for monitoring measles virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus in Parisian wastewaters," the authors said.The Olympics begin on July 26, and the Paralympics start on August 28.

However, our ability to assess and manage that risk is compromised by limited surveillance for influenza viruses in animals globally.Understanding how these viruses are spreading and changing in animals is essential for identifying any changes that might increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the potential for a pandemic.WHO calls on all countries to strengthen influenza surveillance and reporting in animals and humans;To share samples of influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centres;To share genetic sequences of human and animal flu viruses with publicly accessible databases;To provide protection for farm workers who may be exposed to infected animals;To accelerate research on avian influenza; And to encourage closer cooperation between the animal and human health sectors. Even as we continue to study the spread of H5N1, we also continue to study COVID-19, which still kills an average of 1700 people globally every week.However, data show that vaccine coverage has declined among health workers and people over 60, which are two of the most at-risk groups.WHO recommends that people in the highest risk groups receive a COVID-19 vaccine within 12 months of their last dose. Mpox also remains a global health threat, with 26 countries reporting cases to WHO this month. The outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows no sign of slowing, with more than 11,000 cases reported this year, and 445 deaths, with children the most affected. South Africa has recently reported 20 cases of mpox to WHO, including three deaths, the first cases in that country since 2022.The cases were all men, and most self-identified as men who have sex with men. None had reported any history of international travel, which suggests the confirmed cases are a small proportion of all cases, and that community transmission is ongoing.WHO is supporting both DRC and South Africa to respond to these outbreaks, to conduct surveillance, to engage the affected communities, and to develop immunization strategies to ensure the most effective response. ===Now to Ukraine, where the Ohmatdyt National Children’s Hospital in Kyiv was severely damaged on Monday following a series of aerial strikes.More than 600 children were in the hospital when it was struck. Two people were killed and 50 injured, including 8 children.Sixty-eight children remain under treatment in the surviving buildings, and 94 children were transported to other medical facilities in Kyiv. The remaining children, who were in the hospital for scheduled treatment, have been examined and temporarily discharged. Our WHO team arrived at the hospital immediately after the attack and saw the desperation of parents, medical staff, and volunteers evacuating the children. WHO’s biomedical engineers are assessing the damage to medical equipment to determine what we can provide to ensure continuity of care.We will also provide medical supplies to hospitals that have received patients from Ohmatdyt. Including the attack on the children’s hospital, WHO verified four attacks on health care in Ukraine on Monday, killing 9 health workers and patients and leaving another 71 injured.Since the beginning of the war, WHO has verified 1885 attacks on health care, which have been linked to 157 deaths and 435 injuries among health workers and patients.Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law.===Next to Sudan, which has endured 15 months of conflict, with almost 19,000 people killed and 33,000 injured.Access to health services continues to be severely constrained due to insecurity and shortages of medicines, medical supplies and health workers.Almost 15 million people need urgent health assistance, including maternal and newborn care, treatment for cancer, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases, and protection from outbreaks of cholera, measles, malaria, dengue, meningitis, and more.The risk of famine is growing, with more than half Sudan’s population facing crisis levels of food insecurity, or worse.WHO has recently distributed 3 metric tons of pre-positioned supplies to meet the critical needs of the population in North Darfur.We call on both sides to the conflict to facilitate assistance for those in need. Opening the Adré crossing from Chad into western Darfur is absolutely vital for scaling up assistance.Access must also be facilitated elsewhere, including to Khartoum, the Kordofan states, and other hotspots.Renewed fighting has forced even more people to flee. In the past three months, the number of displaced people has increased by more than 45% to 12.7 million, including 10.5 million who are displaced internally, and 2.2 million who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.Their health needs are enormous. In Chad, most arrive after multiple displacements, suffering gunshot wounds, many having survived rape and sexual violence, without sufficient food for months, and having walked for days.Host communities in Chad have been very hospitable, offering food, water, and shelter for refugees, but the needs are overwhelming.Last week, WHO experts from our Eastern Mediterranean and African regions conducted a joint mission to Chad to assess the refugee situation and scale-up cross-border operations.Our priority is to create systems that address immediate medical needs but also strengthen Chad’s health system capacity so the health needs of refugees are not dependent on aid in the long-term.Despite the increasing health needs in both Chad and Sudan, WHO has only 18% of the funds we need to meet those needs. The international community must do better than that. Sudan remains a political crisis that can only end with a political solution. Peace, access, and funding are in desperately short supply, and once again it is the innocent who suffer.===Finally, to Gaza.Since the conflict began in October last year, more than 38,000 people have been killed, 88,000 injured, and about 10,000 are missing.More evacuation orders issued by Israel are further threatening the health of people who have already suffered so much.The Al Ahli and Patient Friendly hospitals in northern Gaza are the latest that are unable to function because of fighting nearby.Patients from Al Ahli have been evacuated to the Indonesian Hospital, which is now operating at three times its capacity.Over 10 000 patients still need medical evacuation for treatment that cannot be provided in Gaza.Multiple evacuation corridors are needed urgently, to the West Bank, Egypt and Jordan.And almost the entire population of Gaza now faces high levels of acute food insecurity.Almost one in four are facing starvation, and another one in three face an emergency level of food shortages that can lead to a high rate of acute malnutrition.*At the same time, very few supplies are getting into Gaza.Only five WHO trucks were allowed into Gaza last week.More than 34 trucks are waiting at the Al Arish crossing, and 850 pallets of supplies are awaiting collection. A further 40 trucks are waiting at Ismailiya in Egypt.WHO calls for the restrictions on supplies entering Gaza to be lifted immediately.The people of Gaza who have nothing to do with this conflict must not be the ones who pay the price for it.To say more, I’m pleased to welcome WHO’s Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Dr Hanan Balkhy, who visited Gaza and the West Bank last week.Hanan, thank you for joining us. You have the floor.[DR BALKHY ADDRESSED THE MEDIA]Thank you, Dr Balkhy, we really appreciate your leadership.Tarik, back to you. *The speech was updated for clarity on 11/7/2024 Related Health situation in SudanHealth situation in GazaInfluenza (Avian and other zoonotic) Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOReporting on Java’s 1918 influenza pandemic - Inside Indonesia: The peoples and cultures of Indonesia Nov 12, 2024 Last Updated 2:20 AM, Oct 31, 2024 Facebook Twitter Inside Indonesia Search Home About Vision & Mission IRIP Board Editorial Collective Contact Us Contribute Donate Write for us Volunteer Youth editorial team Editions Topics Bacaan Bumi Youth Politics Environment Society Arts Law Human Rights Economy Religion Fiction & Essays Essays Lontar Modern Indonesia Series Reviews Books Film Archive Articles HomeEditionsEdition 142: Oct-Dec 2020Jokowi’s 35000 megawatt dream Reporting on Java’s 1918 influenza pandemic Details Written by: SIDDHARTH CHANDRA Published: Jul 12, 2024 Category: Edition 157: Jul-Sep 2024 Published: Jul 12, 2024 Tagged under Health Siddharth Chandra Pieter Bastiaan van Steenis’ insightful article in the Geneeskundig Tijdschrift Voor Nederlandsch-Indië is a rare and detailed account by a colonial health official who experienced first-hand the horrors of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Java. A second-class health officer with the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) at the time, he was able to visit and interact with victims and survivors of the pandemic and unusually, given the scarcity of such reports from that time, put pen to paper to record his findings. Later in his career, van Steenis was to become a leading light in the field of tropical medicine in the Netherlands. The first part of van Steenis’ report characterises influenza as a disease and explores its causes based on a robust literature review and his own experiences as a bacteriologist and public health professional. While we take for granted today the knowledge that influenza is caused by a virus, in 1918 the question of influenza’s causative agent was the subject of a vigorous debate. Many scientists at the time believed that Pfeiffer’s Bacillus (now known as Haemophilus influenzae, henceforth Hi) caused the flu. Van Steenis’ account, written 15 years before the definitive discovery and isolation of the influenza virus, illustrates the many doubts scientists and public health officials across the globe were beginning to have about the role of Hi in causing influenza. The second part of van Steenis’ report focuses on how the pandemic unfolded in Magelang in Central Java. The 1918 influenza pandemic struck Java with great severity. With estimates of population loss ranging as high as 4.26 to 4.37 million, or approximately 10 per cent of the population, Java was one of the worst-affected regions of the world. Van Steenis made several observations that aligned with what was being observed in other parts of the world at the time. For example, he emphasised the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on pregnant women, noting a spike in deaths among women between 20 and 40 years of age and ‘extremely frequent influenza-associated deaths during childbirth (at term or premature)’. Drawing the reader’s attention to the important role of nutrition in determining individual outcomes of infection, observed in many other locations including British India and the USA, he pointed out the ‘paramount importance’ of a good supply of food in areas affected by the influenza. On the timing of the pandemic, he noted that Java experienced a so-called ‘Herald Wave’ of infections and excess mortality in mid-1918 that preceded and was later dwarfed by the massive wave of late 1918. A similar spring or early summer wave had been observed in many locations around the world. Van Steenis’ account also gives us a unique week-by-week account of the spread of the pandemic across Magelang. Here he emphasises the importance of the roads from Yogyakarta to the southeast and Temanggung to the northwest as important routes for the spread of the infection to Magelang. Importantly, he highlights the role of the crowded markets (see the above image) as locations of what we might today call ‘super spreader’ events: ‘with a few exceptions, the outbreaks appear to start close to the large bazaars and to develop around them. This is very important. Everybody knows the bazaars, where thousands of natives appear twice a week, swarming together. One could not create a better opportunity for the infection to spread rapidly.’ The public health implications of this observation, with all the challenges they entailed, were as clear to him then as they were to officials during the recent COVID-19 pandemic: ‘Domestic Administration officials I spoke to considered it impossible to close a large bazaar for two to three weeks - that would cause famine - but in any case, measures should be taken to mitigate the dangers of these bazaars; closely monitoring and removing feverish patients would help somewhat, but how long the recovered influenza patients remain infectious, and what is the status of healthy bacilli carriers, these are unanswerable questions.’ While van Steenis’ report mentions maps, they were not included in the digital scan of the article used for this translation. Therefore, a cartographic version of his account, rendered using ArcGIS, is included as an appendix to illustrate how the pandemic progressed from the main thoroughfares and markets of the regency to more remote locations, often at higher altitudes. Click on the image to read and download the translation Van Steenis’ account of the pandemic also provides an important, contemporary, and authentic insight into the magnitude of the devastation of the pandemic. For example, ‘…dessa Tindomojo met 822 inwoners stierven in de week 22-28 November 60 personen’ (van Steenis, p.909), which translates to ‘60 people died in the week of 22-28 November in village Tindomojo (population 822)’. This translates to a staggering seven per cent mortality rate in a single week for a pandemic that dragged on for many months and appeared and reappeared in multiple waves across Java. Van Steenis’ account is backed by reports from other sources, for example ‘Nu er bijna 2 millioen Inlanders aan die ziekte gestorven zijn, komt men pas tot de ontdekking, dat die groote sterfte te wijten is aan onvoldoende voiding’ (‘Persoverzicht’, Koloniaal Tijdschrift of 1919, first half-year, p.482), translated as ‘Now that almost 2 million Natives have died of that disease, it is only discovered that this large death is due to insufficient feeding’. Notably, the synopsis in the Koloniaal Tijdschrift referred to a newspaper article published in December 1918, that quoted a notification by the Civil Medical Service of the Netherlands Indies long before the pandemic had worked its way through all of Java, let alone the other islands of the Netherlands East Indies. The published two million figure is (like van Steenis’ account) based on truncated information, pointing to an even higher death toll for the entire duration of the pandemic. These descriptions are important because a recent estimate of deaths places the toll for Java at an optimistic 1.47 million (or about 3.9 per cent of the population; see the unpublished working paper by van der Eng (2023)). This calculation is based on Boomgaard and Gooszen’s (1991) underestimate of early 20th century population growth in Java. They ignore the impact of the one-time drop in population during the pandemic on the slope of the population growth trajectory, thereby deriving a much lower growth rate of population than would otherwise be obtained. This introduces a logical contradiction into the van der Eng analysis. It attempts to estimate the effect of a historical event based on underlying data that assumes that the event never occurred. The final section of van Steenis’ report speculates on modes by which influenza was transmitted in Magelang. While he rightly identifies ‘droplet infection at a short distance’ as a key mode, his statement, ‘In the high, humid mountain regions I consider it likely that long-lived germs of infection blow through the air during the early morning or evening hours from village to village over greater distances’, is intriguing and likely would not pass muster among modern-day epidemiologists. While there exist a few reports on the 1918 influenza pandemic in the Netherlands East Indies, most describe the pandemic at a high level of spatial aggregation (such as ‘Rapport over de Influenza-epidemie in Nederlandsch-Indië 1918’ [Report on the influenza epidemic in the Netherlands Indies 1918], Mededeelingen van den Burgerlijken Geneeskundigen Dienst in Nederlandsch-Indië [Reports of the Civil Medical Service in the Dutch East Indies] 1920;10:77–157); or provide very brief snapshots of the pandemic in specific locations (for example, the Koloniaal Tijdschrift article described above). By virtue of its thoughtfulness and degree of detail, the van Steenis report on the pandemic in Magelang is a unique and valuable resource that stands apart by providing rich scientific, social, and spatial context on how this devastating event unfolded in one of the most densely populated regions of the world. van Steenis, P.B. ‘Some epidemiological remarks about the flu in the Magelang Division, 1918’, Medical Journal for the Netherlands Indies, LIX:901-20.

South-East Asia Maldives Home Health topics Our work News Emergencies About us Home/ News/ Detail/ WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) funds strengthen Influenza and Communicable Disease Surveillance in Maldives / WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) funds strengthen Influenza and Communicable Disease Surveillance in Maldives 8 July 2024 Highlights Maldives Significant enhancements in the Maldives' health surveillance infrastructure, particularly for influenza and communicable diseases, have been achieved through the collaborative efforts of World Health Organization and the Health Protection Agency. This partnership has been strengthened by the use of Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) funds, leading to initiatives that emphasize effective and sustainable health system improvements.Approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2011, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits (PIP Framework) plays a pivotal role. With the aim of preparing countries to respond to the next influenza pandemic, the PIP Framework establishes a ‘Partnership Contribution’ mechanism. Through this mechanism, WHO receives funds that are directed towards strengthening pandemic preparedness worldwide, including the initiatives seen in the Maldives.“Despite being a high middle-income country, PIP funds are crucial for our nation, providing essential support for our Influenza program in areas such as human resources, logistics, and digitalization. These funds play a vital role in maintaining and enhancing our health surveillance systems.” said Dr Nazneen Anwar, WHO Representative "We extend our appreciation to the Influenza Program Team at WHO South-East Asia Regional Office for facilitating this support to our Country Office.” A primary objective of this endeavor is the enhancement of the 'Sustainable Flu Surveillance System,' with all activities directed towards achieving this goal. With this support, WHO Maldives has facilitated the procurement of critical items such as Universal Transport Medium (UTM), Viral Transport Medium (VTM), and triple packaging boxes. These supplies are essential for the secure and efficient collection, transport, and storage of influenza samples. They are now stocked at both Health Protection Agency and the National Influenza Center (NIC), ensuring that the Maldives is well-prepared for influenza surveillance and response.In addition to improving logistical capabilities, WHO has also supported the shipment of influenza samples to regional National Influenza Centers for sequencing. This step is crucial for identifying and tracking influenza strains, enabling timely and appropriate public health responses. WHO has also extended support in attaining Human Resources for the Influenza Programme through the hiring of a Project Manager and Project Officer. These consultancies provide dedicated expertise and leadership to the national programme.A cornerstone of this initiative is the engagement with a digital health expert to develop a health information system based on District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) for Influenza and COVID-19 surveillance. Originally introduced in 2017 as a national health management information system, DHIS2 has revolutionized data management in the Maldives. By 2019, DHIS2 was operational nationwide, encompassing all public health facilities, private hospitals, and some clinics. This comprehensive rollout has facilitated better data analysis, monitoring, and evaluation of key health indicators, enabling informed and evidence-based decision-making.Building on the Maldives' positive experience with DHIS2, WHO is now expanding its application to strengthen the country's communicable disease surveillance system, with a special focus on respiratory pathogens such as influenza, COVID-19, RSV, and other notifiable diseases. As the initial step, this digital platform was piloted in the Greater Male' Region before being implemented at an Influenza Sentinel site in Raa Atoll. This process provided valuable feedback and insights on how to further strengthen the established data platform to enhance respiratory disease surveillance in the Maldives. It also enabled the recording and immediate notification of 19 diseases and notification within 24 hours for an additional 17 diseases. The system integrates both surveillance and laboratory components, allowing for seamless data entry, lab investigation requests, and result recording. Additionally, WHO is taking steps to document and showcase these innovative digital health initiatives being implemented by the country. . The support from WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) funds has significantly bolstered the Maldives' capacity to monitor and respond to influenza and other communicable diseases. From procuring essential supplies to leveraging digital health tools like DHIS2, these efforts have led to substantial improvements in health surveillance. As a trusted partner of the Government, WHO remains committed to supporting Maldives in advancing public health preparedness and ensuring the resilience of its health systems against future threats.

FLORIDA Published: Jul 12, 2024 Category: Edition 157: Jul-Sep 2024 Published: Jul 12, 2024 Tagged under Theatre Health Nancy K. Florida In response to the devastating flu epidemic of 1918-19, the government publishing house Bale Pustaka issued a slim volume of some 52 pages in Javanese language and script, illustrated with figures from the wayang (shadow puppet theatre) tradition. The volume, titled Awas Lĕlara Inpluwensa (Beware the Disease of Influenza), was to be distributed among the Javanese populace as a public health measure. Beware the Disease of Influenza tells a story of the epidemic in Java, while at the same time offering measures to control the outbreak and to treat its sufferers. Though it was not written in the form of a wayang shadow play, the story is told in the idiom of wayang and the form of a play. Below you will find a complete translation of this short pocketbook. A public health intervention Commissioned by the Health Service of the Netherlands East Indies government in May 1919, the book came out the following year. By then it was too late, several millions had already perished and the epidemic was on the wane. It is estimated that in the space of a year the flu had caused a population decline of between 4.26 and 4.37 million in Java and Madura (excluding the Principalities) – with most of the deaths occurring in late 1918. This was approximately ten per cent of the population of these most populous areas of the colony. We do not know who the author of the book was, but we can surmise that he (or possibly she) was a Javanese who was well-versed in the wayang and in Javanese literary conventions. The author may well have been a dhalang (shadow puppeteer). He or she was also well-informed on the most recent advances in modern medical knowledge pertaining to the causes and treatment of influenza. The book forms an epistemological translation of sorts, across these different worlds of knowledge. Traditional wayang characters, living in a traditional wayang world, encounter and meet the challenges of a contemporary early twentieth-century medical emergency. The story The light-hearted story that our author tells in the form of a play revolves around the figures of the punakawan, that is, the retainers that serve the noble heroes who are the protagonists of the wayang stories. The punakawan, who appear and reappear in every wayang play, perform both as clowns and as voices for the ‘little people.’ Sĕmar is the most senior of the punakawan we meet in Beware the Disease of Influenza. With his obese form and weepy eyes, Sěmar is the father of the two other punakawan who appear as protaganists of the story. Though he is a lowly servant, Sĕmar is in fact the highest of the manifest gods. He is noted for his wisdom and supernatural powers and is often considered the guardian spirit of Java. Sĕmar’s divine name is Bathara Ismaya; he is the second egg-born son of the highest god, Sanghyang Wĕnang (the Almighty), having been created from the white of the divine egg. Sĕmar’s sons are Petruk and Gareng. Petruk, the younger son, is the ‘hero’ of our story. Tall and thin, with a pointy nose and little pot belly, Petruk is the brash one and it is he who leads the effort to eradicate the flu. Gareng, the elder son, is short and plump. He is riddled with tropical yaws, a disease of poverty. A bit whiny and ‘school-marmy,’ Gareng joins with his brother and father in the effort to combat the epidemic. The three are portrayed as ordinary, if enterprising, Javanese villagers. The other punakawan to appear in the story is Togog. Short and obese, with a hideously deformed wide mouth, the Togog of the wayang world serves as a retainer to the forces of evil (demons or foreign enemy kings). But he is also Sĕmar’s brother. The eldest son of Sanghyang Wĕnang, Togog was born of the shell of the divine egg. In our story he appears as the head of a village that has been struck down with influenza – and as the father of the lovely Sari-hati (Heart’s Essence). The other central figure in the story is ‘the most noble Sir Doctor’ (Bĕndara Dokter), a Javanese doctor. An unparalleled master of modern medical science, Bĕndara Dokter is a clever aristocrat, depicted by the wayang figure of Krĕsna. In the wayang world, Lord Krĕsna is the world-conquering hero who is an incarnation of the god Wisnu. He wields his power, in part, through the means of his supernatural weapon, a blazing discus, or chakra. In our story, the chakra is the receptacle of all the doctor’s modern medical knowledge. He bestows this magical, world-conquering weapon upon Petruk, thereby instantly endowing the Javanese ‘little man’ with the means and methods of modern scientific medical knowledge. At the close of this very short book, Petruk conveys this ‘magical-modern’ knowledge to his new bride Sari-hati and to the villagers whom he has just cured – while at the same time, by extension, delivering it to the most important audience, the Javanese readers of the book. The final section of Beware the Disease of Influenza comprises a short treatise on the etiology and epidemiology of influenza as it was understood at the time, as well as a textual guide on both the treatment of the disease and the prevention of its spread. The song The ‘treatise’ is composed as a song in traditional Javanese verse (macapat) in Sinom verse form, a melodic form considered appropriate for delivering teachings. Macapat verse is written to be sung, and one can presume that at least some of the Javanese readers would have sung this final section of the book – reading it aloud to themselves or to their fellows in the easy, steady cadences of Sinom. In the Javanese script published edition, the text of these teachings is presented in hybrid form – the first stanza is graphically presented in poetic form, while the following stanzas are graphically rendered in numbered paragraphs (2-15), as if they were prose. And yet, as Petruk notes, the entire text conforms to the metrical rules of Sinom meter, and thus may be (or is meant to be) sung. It is for this reason that, as you will see below, I have made the choice to render all thirteen stanzas graphically in poetic form, while retaining the numbers that indicate the numbered paragraphs, each of which constitutes a separate topic. I invite readers to imagine Petruk, the clown and emblematic ‘little man’, reciting these teachings to his fellow Javanese in an engaging melodic voice – and doing so in a very traditional form according to the strict prosodic rules of sung Javanese poetry – thereby to instill in them a more ‘modern’ consciousness of the disease that was threatening them and very well might return to threaten them again.

All rights reserved. Copyright Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By Marta Iraola Iribarren Published on 09/07/2024 - 17:16 GMT+2Share this articleCommentsShare this articleFacebookTwitterFlipboardSendRedditMessengerLinkedinVK While the number of avian influenza outbreaks has decreased in Europe, health and food safety authorities recommend increasing surveillance given bird migrations after the summer. ADVERTISEMENT“There is reason for increased awareness but not for increased concern,” said Pamela Rendi-Wagner, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in a statement, adding that it was important to stay alert and proactive as “this threat to human health should not be underestimated”. While several outbreaks of avian influenza have been detected on farms around the world - with recent reports coming from farms in the United States - transmission to humans is still rare and limited to those in close contact with infected animals and contaminated spaces. Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs mainly in poultry and wild water birds. It can be high or low pathogenic (HPAI/LPAI) depending on its ability to cause severe disease or mortality to the host organism. HPAI is fatal to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks in a matter of days, whereas LPAI strains typically cause few or no signs of disease. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported that the HPAI epidemic was most observed in terms of the geographical spread of poultry outbreaks and the number of dead wild birds. The agency also noted an increase in the range of species affected by the virus. As of the latest data available on 20 June, 14 new human cases with avian influenza infection have been reported from Australia, China, India, Mexico, United States and Vietnam. According to the reports, most of the cases were exposed to poultry or live poultry markets. Both ECDC and EFSA stress that despite these human infections – none in the EU so far - no human-to-human transmission has been reported. However, the agencies warn that sporadic transmission to humans is likely to continue among those exposed to infected animals if protective equipment isn't used appropriately. Based on these data, the ECDC has issued recommendations to increase vigilance and surveillance for possible cases. The agency recommends lowering the threshold for testing for avian influenza in humans, including using a risk-based approach for exposed asymptomatic individuals and testing for influenza in any patient admitted to hospital with symptoms compatible with infection. RelatedCommission secures 40 million vaccines against avian flu pandemic In June, the European Commission purchased 665,000 doses of pre-pandemic avian influenza vaccine and took an option on 40 million doses over the next four years. The first shipments of vaccine have been sent to Finland for immediate vaccination of workers at risk of exposure, such as poultry farm workers and veterinarians. Avian influenza can be transmitted from animals to humans mainly in two ways: through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments or through an intermediate host, such as pigs, cows, foxes or sometimes cats living on farms. The European Food Security Authority reported that there is no evidence that avian influenza can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated poultry products.

Birds come together into groups for breeding before migrations begins. If the virus exists in one of those birds, multiple will have it after the breeding period is over. “Each of those groups come together and bring their own influenza to a new ecosystem, which is how those viruses begin to mix and be shared.”Additionally, new viruses can be created when one host is infected with more than one type of the virus. New influenza viruses tend to fall apart, especially in reservoir hosts, organisms that contract a pathogen and suffer no illness, where multiple viral subtypes are coming together, she explained.Species and their habitatsAccording to Cardona, the industry should remember multiple species of birds and mammals that can host influenza A viruses are stationary and do not migrate.“This creates a dynamic and an ecology of mixed genetics moving from north to south or south to north over resident animals,” Cardona stated.Habitats that are linked to water usually contain better reservoir hosts for the virus. For example, mallards, who reside in an aquatic habitat, are likely to have more diverse avian influenza viruses compared to wood ducks, who mainly nest in trees.Pathogenicity and virulence vary by species, which influences how birds react to influenza viruses. For instance, a mallard may show few or no clinical signs when infected with the same virus that can cause death in white leghorn birds. “Although we often perceive birds as a singular, they should be viewed as multiples. Their collective biology shapes the ecology of future viruses,” Cardona said.RecommendedHatchersGiordano HatchCargoSystem ProLifeLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesRelated StoriesAvian InfluenzaColorado layer operation struck by avian fluAvian InfluenzaAvian influenza confirmed in Peru layer flockAvian InfluenzaOnly one HPAI control zone remains in CanadaAvian Influenza2 Minnesota counties have new avian flu casesMore in Avian InfluenzaAvian InfluenzaAvian flu confirmed in poultry flocks in 13 European countriesThe H5N5 variant has been confirmed for the first time at a European poultry farm.Brand InsightsThink strategically in developing IBDV vaccination programsZoetisDeveloping vaccination programs for IBDV requires strategic use of several vaccine types.Avian Influenza8 more British Columbia flocks struck by avian fluSo far in 2024, the province has had 22 commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus.Avian InfluenzaLatest Canadian HPAI infections involved variety of speciesOne more flock infection has been reported in Abbotsford, British Columbia.Avian InfluenzaHPAI hits 5 flocks in British Columbia, 1 in CaliforniaAPHIS provides additional information concerning two broiler flocks previously reported as confirmed cases.Avian InfluenzaAustralia commits more funds to H5N1 preparednessAustralian authorities add additional funds to surveillance, biosecurity, vaccines and communications in the face of possible H5N1 incursion.Avian InfluenzaAPHIS updates report on California HPAI casesFlock size numbers for two of four affected operations have been disclosed.Avian InfluenzaMore HPAI reported in California, British Columbia poultryBoth the state and the province have confirmed cases in two commercial flocks.Avian InfluenzaFirst avian flu outbreaks of the season in East AsiaHPAI cases have been reported in poultry and wild birds across Asia from Israel to Japan and South Korea.Avian InfluenzaAvian influenza strikes two California broiler flocksThe number of chickens involved has not yet been disclosed.North AmericaAvian flu infections continue to hit British ColumbiaThe province has had six commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus since October 21.Avian InfluenzaFrance confirms avian flu in vaccinated flocksDucks were found to be positive for the HPAI virus following routine testing, despite them showing no symptoms of the disease.Avian InfluenzaAvian flu hits second broiler flock in California countyThe latest flock infection in Tulare County involved 6,000 broilers.Page 1 of 182Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Europe urged to prepare for next avian flu season | WATTPoultry.comMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSign InPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureRegionsMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesTop Feed CompaniesAgriculture ProductsDirectory of SuppliersEvent CalendarExpert InsightsWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesMoreSign InSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconSign InFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseBroilers & TurkeysDiseases & HealthAvian InfluenzaEurope urged to prepare for next avian flu seasonEuropean Food Safety Authority reports that the number of cases in the region’s wild birds and poultry so far in 2023-2024 has been the lowest since 2019-2020.Jackie LindenJuly 10, 2024designtools | BigstockAs Germany reports the first detection of the H7N5 variant of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, animal health agencies across Europe are urged to increase disease surveillance efforts ahead of the expected start of the next disease “season.” The latest assessment of the HPAI situation in Europe from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is generally upbeat. It highlights that the number of cases in the region’s wild birds and poultry so far in 2023-2024 has been the lowest since 2019-2020. Furthermore, EFSA states that the health risk to the general public continues to be low. For those exposed to contaminated environments or infected birds, the risk is assessed as low-to-moderate. However, there is uncertainty over the reason for the decline in outbreaks over the March-June period of the study, which EFSA carried out with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the EU reference laboratory (EURL). Even if recent case numbers are low, there is evidence that HPAI virus continues to circulate among European wild bird populations. Between mid-March and mid-June of 2024, the report puts the number of detections of HPAI A(H5) viruses in Europe at 42. This total comprises 15 in domestic birds, and 27 in wild avian species in 13 countries.Outside Europe, the study also highlights the recent detection of HPAI virus for the first time in Australia, and a growing number of infections with a different virus genotype (B3.13) in U.S. dairy cows, as well as other “unusual hosts,” which include a variety of mammalian species. This combination of developments led EFSA and the other agencies to call on the region’s authorities to step up surveillance ahead of the start of the next HPAI season in the coming months. Germany detects H7N5 HPAI virus for the first time At the end of June, laying hens at a farm in Lower Saxony tested positive for HPAI after 6,000 of the near-91,000-bird flock died.According to the official notification to World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the virus was identified as the H7N5 serotype, making this the first detection of this variant in the country. The remaining layers at the premises have been destroyed, according to the report. These are also the first cases affected by this virus variant in Europe this year, based on details recorded by the Animal Disease Information System from the European Commission (as of July 3).Positive tests for an H7 virus contrasts with different variants of the H5 virus family, which have been detected in Germany and more widely in Europe in recent years, according to the national veterinary reference laboratory, Friedrich-Loeffler Institute (FLI). Previous studies there indicate the new variant likely emerged as the result of a mutation of a previously existing low-pathogenic avian influenza virus. These mutations are thought to occur sporadically. Germany’s most recent HPAI outbreak linked to an H7 virus was in 2015, when an H7N7 variant was discovered in the same region of Lower Saxony, according to FLI.The index farm appears from the WOAH report to be in close proximity to the border with the Netherlands. As a precaution against the spread of the disease, the Dutch agriculture ministry immediately set up a restriction zone within 10km of the outbreak farm. At six Dutch poultry farms within this zone, a ban is in place on movements of birds, eggs, other animals, manure, and used litter.According to this source, detection of the H7 HPAI virus in Lower Saxony is the first to occur so close to the Netherlands since 2003. So far, none of the nation’s wild birds has tested positive for this virus. HPAI vaccination of ducks continues in FranceAs of June 28, more than 41.6 million of the nation’s ducks had received their first dose of vaccine against HPAI, according to the French agriculture ministry.Vaccination has occurred in all regions. Numbers of ducks vaccinated have been highest in the main centers of duck farming in the west of the country, including Pays de la Loire (18.0 million birds received their first vaccine dose), Nouvelle-Aquitaine (11.8 million), Occitania (5.0 million), and Bretagne (Brittany; 4.2 million). Following devastating losses from HPAI in recent years, a nationwide vaccination campaign started in October of last year. Funded by the state, the program required the vaccination of all commercial ducks across mainland France except those producing products for export. Other avian flu-related developments in EuropeOver the past two weeks, a small number of wild birds have tested positive for HPAI in European countries. All were linked to H5N1 HPAI virus. Based on official notifications to WOAH, there were two new cases in each of Germany, and Poland, and one in both France and Spain. In recent weeks, researchers based in the Netherlands have reported initial indications that two HPAI vaccines under investigation are effective in laying hens housed under commercial conditions. The trial is expected to continue until the third quarter of 2025.

(Dakota News Now) - While the recent flooding and explosion in mosquito populations isn’t too worrying for medical professionals when it comes to new cases of West Nile, they still want people to be aware of just what type of virus is out there, and how to spot it and manage symptoms.South Dakota’s first recorded case of West Nile joins at least 15 other cases in 11 states nationally, according to data from the CDC.It can be hard to know what’s West Nile too, compared to other viruses. Dr. Mark List, a Family Practice Physician with Avera Health, says most common symptoms like headaches, body aches or fatigue can feel very similar to Influenza or the common cold.“With West Nile, you can get headaches, you can get fevers. You can get body aches, you can feel really tired. Some people get abdominal pain. Everything that you’d normally feel with kind of a regular cold, that’s what the average person if you’re going to get symptoms would get with West Nile,” List said.Still, though, only one in five people infected with West Nile will actually feel symptoms.However, CDC data says about one in 150 people will develop a serious, potentially fatal case, and List said that’s mainly the concern for people with at-risk situations.“People without a good immune system, immunosuppressed patients going through cancer. Elderly patients, people with a lot of chronic diseases. They have a rare chance for actually the neurological symptoms of West Nile,” List said.The Culex tarsalis mosquito, the main species that carries the West Nile virus, isn’t the mosquito now common with the added flood waters. But even then, there’s still a risk of infections from a regular bite.“Occasionally, if you itch it too much, you can actually get a staph or strep infection, so cellulitis from scratching at the bite too much,” Avera Health Vice President of Clinical Quality Dr. David Basil said.List said there’s no treatment for West Nile, but you can manage your symptoms just like Influenza or the cold.“For the average symptoms of headaches, bodyaches, joint aches and fatigue. Rest, fluids, ibuprofen or Tylenol as long as you’re okay taking those on a routine basis, and you should be just fine,” List said.List said if symptoms continue to get worse, like getting a severe headache, a stiff neck, or any neurological symptoms, those people should contact their care providers immediately and seek help. Again, he said those likely to see those severe cases are the ones already most at risk for other severe illnesses.Copyright 2024 Dakota News Now.

In his job, he manages the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where the sickest patients in the hospital are cared for.We spoke to Dr Visser about what it’s like to look after people who are in ICU because they have influenza. We’ve all heard of the flu and most people have even had influenza at some point in their lives. But not everyone knows that the flu can make you so sick you end up in a ward like Dr Visser’s, or that the flu can even kill you. Dr Visser explained what it’s like to look after someone who is so sick from the flu that they are at risk of dying.How influenza patients end up in the ICUThroughout the year, the ICU is a busy place. While the number of patients on the ward is smaller than other general wards, they require care 24 hours a day from a number of different staff members.‘At any one time,’ says Dr Visser, ‘we could have about five or six critically ill patients on ventilators. We’re not admitting people to the ICU because their cough is bad, or they’ve got a high fever. It’s organ failure, an inability to breathe, things like that, that see people admitted to our ward.’Patients on ventilators require a machine to help them breathe, because their bodies are no longer able to breathe by themselves. Once flu season hits, usually from June to September in Queensland and typically peaking in August, Dr Visser sees more of these patients arrive at the ICU.‘We certainly will get a fair bit busier during winter, when we’ll have more respiratory patients with different respiratory viruses. Some of that is influenza. The difference with influenza is people who do end up in Intensive Care tend to be there for longer. It usually takes them a week, sometimes two or even longer, to get better. That’s a long time to be in hospital, let alone in ICU.’So, why are patients with the flu even ending up in ICU? Dr Visser says that while most people who catch the flu will just spend a week or two at home feeling pretty sick, some people can get severely unwell.‘There are two broad categories of complications we see from influenza,’ Dr Visser explains. ‘One is that the respiratory virus part of it becomes more severe. They might develop pneumonia, and that can often happen if they have an underlying respiratory disease, whether that’s asthma, emphysema, having previous lung damage or from being a smoker.’These patients will require help breathing, as their lungs struggle to take in the oxygen that keeps their body alive. But Dr Visser says it’s not just breathing problems that affect people who are seriously unwell with the flu. Other, even more deadly conditions, like sepsis, can quickly take over the body.‘We see patients who develop secondary complications from influenza, like a bacterial infection, which can lead to the development of sepsis,’ he says. ‘They can become overwhelmingly sick with multi-organ failure. These patients can develop failure of any organ, so we see the heart can be affected, they could have kidney failure, liver failure, or profound problems with blood pressure.’Sepsis is a condition that happens when the body’s response to an infection starts to damage healthy organs and tissue. It can be caused by any kind of infection in the body, but one of the most common causes is a bacterial infection in the lungs, which can develop when a person has the flu.When the young and healthy are struck down by the fluWe all know that it’s dangerous for the elderly to get any kind of illness and we are often more careful around grandparents and elders to not spread germs. But Dr Visser wants Queenslanders to know that the patients he sees in the ICU aren’t just the old or already unwell. Every year, he treats young, healthy people whose bodies have been devastated by the effects of influenza.‘Those are the ones that stick in your head,’ Dr Visser says. ‘It’s the 30-year-old mothers, or the pregnant people, or the people like myself who would normally be completely healthy, normal people going about their business one day, who are struck down by it.’While it’s more likely for the elderly or people who are already unwell to get very sick from influenza, it’s possible that anyone can develop severe complications from the flu.‘In Toowoomba, which is a relatively small unit, we see one or two of those patients every year. It would be unusual to go a year without seeing someone in the prime of their life become critically unwell or even die from influenza,’ says Dr Visser.Watching a loved one in ICUGetting the call that your loved one is in ICU can be a devastating experience. Dr Visser says that while staff reassure families that they are working around the clock to save the life of the patient, families know that admission to ICU means that their loved one is extremely unwell and at risk of dying.‘I think anyone who’s got a relative in Intensive Care finds it distressing,’ says Dr Visser. 'They’re obviously there because they’ve got a risk of dying, and even if we say to them there’s a 90% chance they’ll get better, that’s still a fairly high risk of dying.’When it comes to an influenza patient, Dr Visser says that the situation can be even more shocking.‘A proportion of the patients we see with influenza have got no risk factors for becoming severely unwell. It must be absolutely shocking for their families to see them become so unwell so quickly, with a disease that everyone’s heard about. I can imagine it’s horrible for them.’Waiting for the patient to turn a cornerDr Visser explains that when his staff are treating someone sick with a virus like influenza, there isn’t always a lot they can do to treat the actual virus, because we don’t have many medications that attack viruses.‘For most viral infections, there’s little specific treatment we can offer,’ he says. ‘Our job is to keep the patient alive and wait for them to start getting better on their own.’Dr Visser and his team help support the patient’s body to function, while they wait for the effects of the virus to ease.‘We support them in their breathing with a ventilator, and we give them dialysis if their kidneys fail,’ Dr Visser explains. ‘We keep their blood pressure up with adrenaline style drugs. And we wait for the immune system response to dampen down and for things to start improving.’It’s a tough job, one that requires specialist staff who can be resilient in the face of very difficult situations.‘You do see horrible things happen to normal people all the time,’ says Dr Visser. ‘You do end up becoming resilient when you work in Intensive Care—it’s a resilient place full of resilient people.’How you can prevent yourself and your loved ones from getting the fluWhile he’d take great care of you, Dr Visser doesn’t want to see you in his ICU, especially not with influenza. And there’s an easy way to lower your risk of getting sick from influenza, or even catching the virus at all: a flu shot.Every year, new influenza vaccines are released targeting the strains of the flu most likely to affect Australia that winter. Everyone should get a new flu shot every year to protect themselves from the flu.The flu vaccine is free for all Queenslanders aged 6 months and older.You can find more information about getting this year’s influenza vaccine from the Queensland Government website.‘It’s very unlikely that you will be the person that ends up on a ventilator in my ICU,’ says Dr Visser. ‘But even if it just stops you from getting sick and ending up in bed for three days or having to take a week off work, to me, that seems like a bit of a bargain. It can also stop you from spreading the flu to your friends and family, who might get really sick.‘To me it’s a no brainer that you get the vaccine,” says Dr Visser. “That’s a fairly easy decision.’More informationInfluenza (The Flu)Thank you to Dr Adam Visser and the team at Darling Downs Hospital and Health Service for providing your time and expertise for this article.

PDF FILE In a significant development for the poultry industry, Chile has officially recognized Argentina as a country free from High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI). This recognition comes after Argentina successfully contained and eradicated outbreaks of avian flu in its commercial poultry farms. As a result, poultry exports between the two neighboring countries have resumed, benefiting both economies. This recognition is the result of rigorous and coordinated work between the sanitary authorities of both countries, said Chilean government officials. It ensures that poultry products imported from Argentina meet the highest standards of sanitary safety, thus protecting public health and animal welfare in Chile. Background The avian flu outbreak in Argentina began in early 2023, causing concern among poultry producers and disrupting trade. The disease, caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, led to the suspension of poultry exports from Argentina. However, swift action by the National Service for Agri-Food Health and Quality (SENASA) helped contain the outbreaks and restore Argentina’s disease-free status. Argentina’s self-declaration On August 7, 2023, Dr. Ximena Melón, National Director for Animal Health at SENASA, submitted a self-declaration to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). This declaration confirmed Argentina’s status as a country free from HPAI, in accordance with the WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The scope of this declaration covers the entire country, including its poultry production systems. Poultry industry in ArgentinaContinue after advertising. Argentina boasts a robust poultry industry, with over 4,000 establishments involved in poultry meat production. These include genetic establishments, hatcheries, and broiler production farms. In 2022, Argentina slaughtered a staggering 751,691,962 chickens. Additionally, the laying sector maintains more than 42 million laying hens and nearly 9 million rearing birds. SENASA oversees the health regulations governing these poultry systems, ensuring disease control and public health safety. Resumption of poultry exports Chile’s recognition of Argentina’s avian influenza-free status has paved the way for the resumption of poultry exports. Approximately a month after the self-declaration, compliance with international standards was confirmed, allowing trade to resume. During the epidemic, Argentine chicken meat exports had declined by 28% in volume and 35% in value during the first semester. Conclusion Argentina’s successful containment of avian flu outbreaks and Chile’s recognition of its disease-free status demonstrate effective collaboration between neighboring countries. The resumption of poultry exports not only benefits both nations’ economies but also ensures a stable supply of poultry products for consumers. As Argentina continues to prioritize animal health, it sets an example for other countries facing similar challenges in the poultry industry.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link AFP Updated On Jul 12, 2024 at 06:29 AM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals Geneva:The World Health Organisation warned Thursday that its ability to manage the risk to humans posed by the H5N1 bird flu virus was being compromised by patchy surveillance.The WHO said the United States last week reported a fourth human case of H5N1 avian influensa following exposure to infected dairy cows, while Cambodia had reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens."For the moment, no human to human transmission has been reported, which is why WHO continues to assess the risk to the general public as low," the UN health agency's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Advt "However, our ability to assess and manage that risk is compromised by limited surveillance for influensa viruses in animals globally," he told a press conference."Understanding how these viruses are spreading and changing in animals is essential for identifying any changes that might increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the potential for a pandemic."The WHO called on all countries to step up influensa surveillance and reporting in animals and humans, and for countries to share samples and genetic sequences.It also urged greater protection for farm workers who may be exposed to infected animals, and for greater research on bird flu.- Spread in US cattle -Avian influensa A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996.The 2.3.4.4b clade of the virus, first detected in 2020, is behind an exponential growth in the number of outbreaks in birds, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.The human cases recorded in Europe and the United States since the virus surged have largely been mild.H5N1 has been spreading among dairy cow herds in the United States, with now four recorded cases of the disease jumping from cattle to people. Advt Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's head of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, said H5N1 had now been detected in 145 herds in 12 US states."I think that's only going to continue, given that we've seen some expanse of spread, given that we have some, limited sampling that's happening in dairy cattle -- not just in the United States, but globally," she said."We really need to understand the extent of the circulation in dairy cattle."WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said it was typically easier to eradicate disease from domesticated animals, because it is known where the animals are, and bio-security measures can be applied."The difficulty is when that disease exists in pockets of wild animals," he said, due to the risk of mixing.

The outbreak has affected 6,047 domestic birds, with 6,000 fatalitiesThe outbreak was detected in the Nordhorn region, bordering the Netherlands. Officials culled or disposed of 84,832 birds out of a suspected total of 90,879 that might have been infected.In November and December 2023, bird flu cases were reported from poultry farms in northern and western Germany, leading to the culling of over 54,000 birds, including ducks.Meanwhile, the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a fourth human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) in Colorado. This year’s fourth case involves a dairy cow worker and was confirmed on July 4. While the A (H5) infection is confirmed, the specific neuraminidase designation (N in the subtype) awaits genetic sequencing with the CDC. Including this case, there have been five human cases reported since 2022.The previous cases in 2024 were from Texas and Michigan. The infected individual, a dairy farm worker, experienced eye symptoms but recovered fully after receiving treatment.CDC maintains a low threat level for avian flu due to the lack of human-to-human transmission. “To date, more than 1,390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals and at least 60 people who have developed flu-like symptoms have been tested as part of this targeted, situation-specific testing,” it stated in an update on July 5.Aside from long-term exposure to infected cattle and poultry, CDC has advised avoiding contact with animal poop, unpasteurised or raw milk, bedding (litter), or other materials that have come into contact with suspected or infected A (H5N1).Worldbird fluAvian influenzaShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Iowa News Dairy cow attractions cut from Iowa State Fair due to Avian Influenza concerns by: Griffin Wright Posted: Jul 11, 2024 / 08:45 AM CDT Updated: Jul 11, 2024 / 08:45 AM CDT by: Griffin Wright Posted: Jul 11, 2024 / 08:45 AM CDT Updated: Jul 11, 2024 / 08:45 AM CDT SHARE DES MOINES, Iowa — The Iowa State Fair is cancelling two attractions amid concerns over Avian Influenza infections in dairy cows. The Milking Parlor and the I Milked a Cow Experience will not be a part of the fair this year to prevent the spread of avian flu. So far this year there have been at least ten confirmed cases of bird flu in Iowa dairy herds. Newton woman accused of stealing over $17k of Jasper County funds Jeremy Parsons, CEO of the Iowa State Fair, said safety is the fair’s first concern. “I think for the average fairgoer you’re still going to see dairy cattle at the Iowa State Fair,” Parsons said. “The dairy industry is important in Iowa agriculture so we’re still showcasing that, just showcasing it a little different in terms of no milking parlor and no hands-on experience of I Milked a Cow that many fairgoers have done over the years, so just a chance to still walk through the barns, see the cattle, honestly just trying to keep the livestock safe quite frankly as we showcase Iowa agriculture.” To learn more about the Iowa State Fair visit the fair website.

The J.R Campbell home was converted into a Spanish Flu hospital. The second wave of the Spanish Flu hit British Columbia in the fall of 1918. Summerland recorded 89 influenza cases, 19 patients were hospitalized and four residents died. The hospital closed after the second wave was over. In 1919, Summerland’s general hospital was destroyed by fire Today this building is the site Granny’s Fruit Stand. (Photo courtesy of former Summerland mayor Don Cameron)(Photo courtesy of former Summerland mayor Don Cameron) Listen to this article 00:03:13 A little more than a century ago, one of the most deadly viruses in recorded history took a toll on communities around the world including British Columbia. The Spanish influenza epidemic had three distinct waves of infection. The first wave began in the spring of 1918. This was followed by a second wave in the fall of 1918 and a third wave which began in the fall of 1919 but had its peak in the spring of 1920. The first wave, which was also the least deadly, did not reach British Columbia. The first official case of Spanish influenza in the province was recorded on Oct. 5, 1918 and was part of the second wave of infection. At that time, the province recommended closing schools, churches and other social events. “The health authorities are seemingly taking every precaution to guard against the epidemic getting a foot-hold in this province,” said Dr. F.W. Andrew, Summerland’s medical health officer at the time. “It would be a serious mistake to minimize the danger attending the epidemic now spreading throughout the continent.” The first person to die in the Southern Interior from the Spanish flu was Fred Jenkins Pardee, on Nov. 2, 1918. He lived in Mineola, near present-day Summerland and died at a lumber camp in Princeton. Mineola was a centre of Spanish influenza at the time. In Summerland, there were plans to battle the epidemic. Summerland’s Hospital Society, which had earlier built hospitals, created the Influenza Emergency Hospital in early November, 1918. This facility was specifically designed to treat influenza patients. Volunteer nursing staff at the facility included Matron Miss Gordon, Kathleen Babbit and Faith Walker. Gordon and Babbit became ill soon after receiving patients at the facility. Gordon recovered and was able to resume nursing, but Babbit was confined to her home and did not return. Nurse Beatrice Gale took her place. By the middle of November, there were 60 influenza cases in Summerland, with 11 requiring hospitalization. Two additional volunteer nurses joined the emergency hospital. Andrew, with the support of Reeve Isaac Blair, closed schools, churches and the theatre. These institutions remained closed in November and December. Then, in the first four months of 1919, Summerland had 80 cases of Spanish Influenza, with one death. The third wave of the influenza began in the fall of 1919 and continues into the spring of 1920. While Summerland saw fewer cases than Kelowna and Penticton, Summerland again closed schools, churches and the theatre in March and April. During the epidemic, control measures were similar to those put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic which began in 2020. The prevention measures included physical distancing, hygiene efforts, self-isolating for those who were ill, use of face masks and good nutrition. See a typo/mistake? Have a storyip?

(ABC Danielle Bonica)In short:Farmers, virologists and environmental protection lobby groups say the federal government's $7 million investment in bird flu preparedness is not enough.About 1.8 million commercial birds have already been culled in an attempt to eradicate the H7 variant of avian influenza.What's next?Experts are calling for more funding to protect the country's native and commercial birds, with fears the H5 variant could arrive within months.abc.net.auewsural-bird-flu-funding-not-enough-fears-for-h5n1-varient/104090604Link copiedShareShare articleAustralia is not investing enough money to prepare for an outbreak of the strain of bird flu that is causing environmental and agricultural 'catastrophes' overseas, according to virologists, farmers and environmental lobby groups.This week, the federal government announced $7 million in funding to address the threat posed by a potential incursion of H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza.This strain is different to the current H7 strain of the virus, which has caused outbreaks in Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT.A low pathogenic H9N2 avian influenza strain was found in WA in May, which didn't require any birds to be culled.Australia is currently the only continent in the world free of the H5 variant.The ABC understands most of the money announced is not new, but simply a 'renewed commitment' from the government and a reallocation of existing funds.Millions of wild birds have died in the avian influenza H5N1 outbreak sweeping the world since 2020. (REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun)University of Queensland virologist, Kirsty Short, said $7 million was not enough and believed investment should have happened sooner."If [H5] avian influenza gets into Australia it's not just devastating for poultry, but it will be devastating for our native bird populations," Dr Short said."And then there is the potential, like what we've seen in the US, for this to get into dairy cattle and potentially even to spill over into humans."We really have seen very unusual activity with this virus, and I think we should have probably reacted earlier."Catastrophic deathsOn farms across Australia, the poultry industry has culled about 1.8 million commercial birds in a bid to eradicate the H7 variant of avian influenza.But conservationalists are warning the consequences of the H5N1 variant would be much more dire, across a variety of animal species."That strain is causing absolute wildlife massacres around the globe," Invasive Species Council advocacy director, Jack Gough, said."If it gets to Australia, the level of death we could see amongst our birds would be equivalent to the black summer bushfires.Mr Gough said the variant could arrive in Australia within the next three months "It could turn up with the spring migration of birds from Europe and we're not prepared," he said."The scale of death could be huge and it could send some species locally extinct.The H5N1 strain of the virus has caused mass mortality events among birds in Antarctica. (Supplied: Meagan Dewar)Mr Gough also said more money was required to spread public awareness of the disease and to help prepare federal, state and territory governments."The $7 million was existing money and there were some really important reprioritisations there," he said."Our understanding is that is a packaging up of some of the existing [agricultural] departmental resources that was going into surveillance."This is not enough money... we're hopeful this is just a first step."Mr Gough said only $580,000 of the announced $7 million was new investment.Jack Gough says the H5 virus has decimated wildlife around the globe, and fears Australia could be next. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)He has called for all states and territories to invest in a dedicated bird flu coordinator."It's actually really ridiculous how this has been under prioritised by departments," he said."The reason for that is that it's slipped through the gaps, it sits between environment and agriculture."When H5 gets here it will not be eradicated, we may be able to do some really good work to reduce it's impact on the poultry industry, but when it comes to wild birds it will be limiting impact."What's going on with the egg shortage and bird flu?Photo shows A chicken stares into the camera with more chickens and their movable shed in the background.A strain of high pathogenicity avian influenza was detected on a poultry farm in the Hawkesbury this week.Farmers disappointedVictorian egg producers are sceptical the investment into avian influenza preparation will provide any benefit for poultry farmers.Victorian Farmers Federation vice president and caged egg producer, Danyel Cucinotta, said the money was too focused on surveillance."It's about finding out if wild birds are carrying avian influenza but there are very little practical outcomes to that," he said.$200,000 of the funding will be invested in analysis to track 'movement patterns of Australia’s commercial poultry industries', which Ms Cucinotta said would be useful."It's really convoluted and complex," she said."Money and surveillance is always important but we actually need to consider how we're going to mitigate risk."Brian Ahmed and his daughter Danyel Cucinotta's family has farmed caged eggs in Werribee for 53 years. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)Ms Cucinotta said poultry farmers were aware of the risks of avian influenza, but did not feel like the government was prepared for an outbreak of H5N1."The government is forcing farmers to put more birds into free range systems, and ups the risk [of bird flu], how is it farmers are going to protect themselves?" she asked."We just don't know what those practical outcomes look like and $7 million dollars certainly isn't going to change that."It comes as Australian supermarket shelves have been stripped of egg supplies due to the current disruption caused by the H7 variant.Bird flu clean up bill increasingAgriculture Minister Murray Watt said the current outbreak's clean up bill far surpassed the $7 million funding announcement."Already the outbreak that we've seen of the H7 strain, a less serious strain of this disease, the cost so far in dealing with that is already well over $40 million and moving upwards by the day," he said.Federal Agriculture Minister Murray Watt says 1.8 million birds have already been killed in the H7 outbreak. (ABC News: Marco Catalano)In a statement, a Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry spokesperson said the recent announcement renewed the government’s commitment to existing initiatives."[This] is a combination of reprioritisation of existing, committed resources and additional supplementation," a spokesperson said."The government’s investment will also foster increased collaboration across stakeholders ... in recognition that biosecurity is a shared responsibility. "Specific investment is also being made with targeted funding provided to Animal Health Australia towards improving the preparedness and response capability across the production system."ABC Rural RoundUp newsletterStories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Fri 12 Jul 2024 at 8:00pmFriday 12 Jul 2024 at 8:00pmFri 12 Jul 2024 at 8:00pm, updated Mon 15 Jul 2024 at 3:11amMonday 15 Jul 2024 at 3:11amMon 15 Jul 2024 at 3:11amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Ian Birchall, secretary of the Mudgee Poultry and Pigeon Club, has cancelled two events, the junior championship and a rare breeds show, this month. Mr Birchall said he was worried about the implications for the club, established in 1946, if avian influenza was found in a show bird and led to the euthanasing of all birds at the event. "There were 70 exhibitors at our last show and whether they've had their birds for one year or, like my mum who's had the line there for 80 years ... the club doesn't want to put those people at risk," he said.The Central West Bird Club has also cancelled its annual expo and sale, which was scheduled for Forbes in three weeks.President Wayne Downes said hundreds of exhibitors from across New South Wales and other states usually attended, but the risk of spreading the disease was considered too great.More cancelled poultry shows The Exhibition and Poultry Association of NSW has listed these cancelled events:Belinger River District Poultry Club, July 13 Dubbo Poultry Club, July 14 The Pekin Club of Australia, July 20 Goulburn Poultry, July 21 Nowra Poultry Club, July 21Mudgee Poultry and Pigeon Club, July 27 Wagga Wagga Poultry Club, July 28Belgium Club of Australia, July 28 Canberra Queanbeyan, August 4Backyard breeders urged to registerA case of the H7N8 avian influenza strain in a chicken in Belconnen, Canberra, has prompted the ACT government to ask everyone in the affected area to register their birds.It is the second detection in Canberra since late June at Pace Farm's egg-grading facility, Parkwood.Bird flu has caused the deaths of 100 million birds globally and killed thousands of wild species. H7N8 is different from the global strain of concern, H5N1 which can cross into humans and was detected in a Melbourne toddler recently, as well as H7N3 and H7N9 found in outbreaks in Victoria.Rebecca Vassarotti. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)ACT Environment Minister Rebecca Vassarotti said the second ACT case was found by a pet chicken owner.She said the H7N8 detection was within the biosecurity quarantine area established after the first detection "While this is unfortunate, it's not unexpected to see another detection within the quarantine area," Ms Vassarotti said.Avoid wild birds ACT Chief Veterinary Officer Kyeelee Driver said registration would establish how many domestic birds were in the area and where they were."We have acted quickly in response to this detection and believe there is a very low risk of spread to other poultry in the ACT from this site," she said.Megg Millar, who judges poultry, said this latest case in backyard chickens is a wake-up call for breeders and poultry fanciers. (Supplied: J Millar)Megg Miller, a patron of the Royal Canberra Poultry Show, said people should be careful to avoid contact with wild birds as avian flu could be spread by human transmission. "No feeding wild birds in your back yard or encouraging them anywhere near and don't visit chook or poultry people at all," Ms Miller said.David Thistleton, president of the Canberra and Queanbeyan Poultry Association, said many properties had gone into lockdown to protect precious genetics. "We're very worried that it's going to come over the border and we've got members in that area," he said."I'd like to see more strict guidelines for selling birds over Gumtree just in case it can spread into other areas."He has covered his dam and restricted his ducks and geese from accessing it for the time being and the club has cancelled its August event. The federal government has committed $7 million to track avian influenza in the wild bird population.The biggest risk to Australia is the spread of more dangerous strains of avian influenza that are present overseas.Bird flu guide for backyard breedersIf you live in ACT quarantine areas register your animals Be aware of restrictions if you live in a bird flu-restricted area.Regularly clean your chicken coop, including feeders, drinkers and equipment.Frequently replace nesting materials.Always wash your hands with warm water and soap after handling birds, eggs or other materials in the coop.Try to avoid contact between chicken and wild birds, rodents or pets.Your birds should drink water clean of droppings or animal waste.If you are selling or giving away eggs, use new cartons if possible or keep reused cartons clean and away from birds.If you see signs of disease call the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline 1800 675 888.Source: Agriculture Victoria and ACT GovernmentABC Rural RoundUp newsletterStories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Fri 12 Jul 2024 at 2:05amFriday 12 Jul 2024 at 2:05amFri 12 Jul 2024 at 2:05amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Follow these practical tips to shield yourself from the harmful effects of influenza. Taking proactive measures now can save you from discomfort and complications later. Namita S Kalla July 08, 2024 / 12:22 IST How to avoid seasonal flu: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports a robust immune system. Foods high in vitamins C and D, zinc, and antioxidants are particularly beneficial (Image: Canva) The arrival of monsoon often brings with it those irritating bouts of coughs and sneezes, along with the discomfort of body aches, fever, and shivering. The increased humidity and fluctuating temperatures during this season create conditions where viruses can thrive longer and spread more easily among people in close contact, contributing to the transmission of respiratory viruses, including influenza.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. These viruses infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs, leading to symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches, and fatigue. The flu spreads primarily through droplets when infected individuals cough, sneeze, or talk, making close contact a significant risk factor.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdHere are a few preventive steps you can take to avoid the flu:Get your flu shot: The most effective way to prevent the flu is to get vaccinated annually. The flu vaccine is designed to protect against the most common strains of the virus expected each season. According to the WHO, vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness, hospitalisation, and flu-related complications. It's especially important for high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions.Wash those hands: Regular hand washing with soap and water is crucial in preventing the spread of the flu. Use hand sanitiser if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face, particularly the eyes, nose, and mouth, to prevent the virus from entering your body. Practicing good respiratory etiquette, such as covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing, also helps reduce transmission.

Foods high in vitamins C and D, zinc, and antioxidants are particularly beneficial. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is also essential for overall health and immune function.Move it to boost it: Regular physical activity boosts the immune system and helps the body fend off infections. The WHO recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week for adults. Activities like walking, jogging, or yoga can enhance immune response and improve overall well-being.Prioritise your sleep: Quality sleep is vital for maintaining a strong immune system. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to allow your body to rest and recover. Poor sleep can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to the flu and other illnesses.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdStay home, rest up: If you experience flu symptoms, stay home to prevent spreading the virus to others. Rest and isolation help speed up recovery and reduce the risk of infecting coworkers, classmates, or family members.Consult your doctor: Severe flu symptoms require immediate attention as they indicate a high risk of complications. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications to reduce the severity and duration of the illness, especially if started early.

How worried should we be? Vaccines have already entered the conversation – though not in Singapore just yet. Chickens stand in their cages at a farm in the United States. A spreading bird flu strain has killed or led to the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry globally in recent years, upsetting food supply chains in some cases.

Weeks later, the United States gave US$176 million to pharma giant Moderna to advance development of a bird flu vaccine. This would be based on the same mRNA technology used for COVID-19 jabs – in a pandemic still fresh in the memory. What is bird flu? It’s a virus that was discovered nearly 150 years ago, back in the late 1800s, and has been spread among migratory water birds since. At some point it also crossed over to farm animals and domestic poultry - which can become very sick and die from bird flu. Human cases are rare but can result in severe and possibly life-threatening illness. Among several sub-types or strains of bird flu, the ones that have affected humans the most are H5N1 and H7N9.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced concerns over H5N1’s growing spread of late. It has killed or led to the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry globally in recent years, upsetting food supply chains in some cases. And it has increasingly been infecting mammals not previously thought susceptible, from alpacas to house cats. In the US, the virus has struck more than 130 cow herds and three dairy workers. Australia meanwhile is battling outbreaks at 11 farming facilities, all involving virus strains different from H5N1. It’s led to an egg shortage and prompted McDonald’s to cut breakfast service timings by 1.5 hours. Other cases of human infections have been reported in Mexico, India and China. There are no known instances of the virus in Singapore so far. Researchers have pointed to climate change as a factor in the spread, with fluctuating temperatures altering bird migratory and breeding patterns. Habitat destruction and urbanisation are also increasing human contact with animals, and it will probably become more common to see viruses spilling over into humans, said Professor Ooi Eng Eong from the Duke-NUS Medical School’s emerging infectious diseases programme. “Our ability to detect such viruses has also improved greatly … We have a lot more tools,” he added. “We can detect these events (which) 50 years ago were probably unheard of.” Should humans be worried? Bird-to-human transmissions are relatively rare. The few cases reported overseas were exposed to infected birds and poultry or contaminated environments. The WHO has said H5N1's risk to the general population is low because there's no evidence of human transmission. But that doesn’t mean the chances of it happening are zero. "It is definitely possible," said Prof Ooi. He cited an experiment some years ago, where researchers attempted to find out how many adaptations were needed for H5N1 to be transmitted from ferret to ferret. The creatures are often used to study respiratory diseases as they contract the same viruses as humans, and their lungs and airways are physiologically similar. “The answer is not that many,” said Prof Ooi. “It may just be a few mutations away. And that's why we need to take H5N1 seriously.” When humans do catch bird flu, the fatality rate is high, with WHO data over the last two decades showing that H5N1 for one has killed about half of almost 900 people infected with it. The symptoms are quite similar to COVID-19, according to Prof Ooi. These include fever, cough and in some cases, shortness of breath and tightness of the chest.

Bird flu found in mammals near Antarctica for the first time, scientists say So is it safe to consume chicken, eggs or milk? In Singapore at least – yes, said Prof Ooi, pointing to the Singapore Food Agency tightly controlling imports and ensuring overseas sources follow biosecurity protocols. Late last year, for instance, Singapore suspended the import of raw poultry and poultry products from several countries affected by H5N1 outbreaks. But that might not be the case in other countries, Prof Ooi added, echoing warnings issued by local authorities earlier in June. Singapore's Health Ministry (MOH) has strongly advised travellers not to go to live bird markets or dairy farms when abroad, and not to consume uncooked meat or raw milk. How is bird flu treated? According to MOH’s website, the antiviral medication Tamiflu is often the go-to treatment. In the preemptive space, Finland meanwhile is expected to become the first country to offer vaccines to workers exposed to animals. On Saturday (Jul 6), MOH told CNA there were currently no plans to vaccinate high-risk people in Singapore. A spokesperson pointed to how the WHO also doesn't recommend vaccinations for humans, due to human infections being “rare and limited”. “The usefulness of avian influenza vaccines is dependent on whether the vaccine closely matches the avian influenza virus strains that may circulate in Singapore in future, but influenza virus strains continually change,” he added.

Should a day come when the bird flu adapts and gains the ability to transmit efficiently from animals to humans; and then from humans to humans – that would be the beginnings of a pandemic, said Prof Ooi. He noted that influenza has been behind major pandemics in history, with three in the last century and the biggest being in 1918, which killed about 60 million people. A Reuters report on Jul 1 said several leading scientists were increasingly concerned that gaps in surveillance and testing for bird flu might keep the world several steps behind in responding to a new pandemic. Singapore, while free of the bird flu for now, shouldn’t take things for granted and should be prepared with plans in place that can be quickly ramped up, said Prof Ooi. For one, with the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrating that vaccines can be made quickly, Singapore and its neighbours should build up such capabilities so there's no need to “queue up" to buy jabs from Europe or North America, he noted. The researcher also stressed the importance of having first responders and disease control professionals aware of what they need to do, rather than “make it up” as and when a pandemic happens. “We need to keep engaging the population as well so that they are aware of what they need to do when it does happen,” he said. On that front, he has observed that people are “more or less slowly sliding back” to pre-COVID days, when they cared less about wearing a mask or taking time off work when unwell. Should the bird flu emerge as a serious public health concern, said Prof Ooi, one must hope that the people "can very quickly go back to some of those precautions”. Want an issue or topic explained?

Doctors report ‘unusual’ surge in cases Doctors said ‘changes in weather pattern’ could be one of the reasons behind this Published: Tue 9 Jul 2024, 6:00 AM Updated: Tue 9 Jul 2024, 9:41 PM By Nandini Sircar Follow us Follow on Google Follow on WhatsApp Follow on Telegram Top Stories Influenza, the virus usually responsible for most winter colds, seems to have persisted into the summer this year — a period typically considered flu-free in the UAE. Doctors said “changes in the weather pattern” could be one of the reasons behind this. They added that sometimes, international travel and the influx of tourists may also contribute to the transmission of flu strains. Dr Hend Makky, a general practitioner at Aman Lil Afia Clinic Dubai, said: “A lot of doctors in the UAE are reporting a rise in influenza cases since summer started, raising concerns about a potential summer flu season. Traditionally, influenza peaks in the UAE during the cooler months, from October to February.” Dr Hend Makky Reasons under investigation Medics emphasised that the exact reasons behind the flu cases this summer are still under investigation. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. “Summer travel can expose people to different flu strains circulating in other parts of the world. This could introduce new strains into the UAE population, potentially leading to a surge in cases. It’s also possible that the predominant flu strain circulating this year is particularly contagious or causes more severe illness. This could contribute to a rise in cases regardless of the season,” Dr Makky added. Dr Mais M Mauwfak, an internal medicine specialist at Thumbay University Hospital, said her clinic, too, has experienced a “notable increase in flu cases” which may be linked primarily to the oscillating weather conditions experienced during the summer months in the UAE. Dr Mais M Mauwfak “The climate during summer fluctuates between extreme heat and high humidity, combined with sudden shifts in temperature due to air conditioning in homes, offices, and cars. These abrupt changes in temperature can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, and bronchitis. The dry, dusty environment often leads to irritated airways, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections like the flu,” Dr Mauwfak added. Careful diagnosis crucial Medics said it is essential to recognise that not all respiratory symptoms stem from viral infections. A substantial number of cases are related to allergies, where the symptoms resemble those of the flu but are actually triggered by allergic reactions to dust, pollen, or other prevalent allergens. “Therefore, careful diagnosis is crucial to ensure appropriate treatment for each condition,” said Dr Mauwfak. Prioritise flu vaccaination Meanwhile, paediatric healthcare professionals stressed taking the flu jab so as to reduce the spread of influenza. Dr Hassan Hababa, paediatrics specialist at Burjeel Day Surgery Center, Al Shahama, said: “The rise in patient visits can be attributed to several factors. Seasonal variations, changes in weather patterns, and increased indoor crowding due to cooler temperatures are likely contributing factors. Additionally, variations in circulating flu strains may also play a role in the increased prevalence.” Dr Hassan Hababa “It’s essential for individuals, especially those in high-risk groups such as children, elderly, and people with chronic medical conditions, to prioritise influenza vaccination,” he added. Children visiting the outpatient department are complaining of cough, runny nose, fever, and strep throat. Dr Mamata Bothra “This is more compared to the same month in previous years. Influenza cases are not very common during summers and cases are seen more during winter months. But this year we are seeing more cases of influenza,” said Dr Mamata Bothra, paediatrician and neonatalogist AT International Modern Hospital Dubai. Doctors added that parents must supervise their kids’ water intake and monitor the urine colour to ensure they are hydrated. “Among other reasons, this may also be due to increased intake of icy cold beverages by kids, rise in junk food intake as compared to healthy fruits and vegetables consumed in daily diet, erratic sleep schedule, less exercise, vitamin deficiencies especially vitamin D. All these have a negative impact on immunity," Dr Bothra said.
