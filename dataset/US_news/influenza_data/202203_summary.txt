1. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds, like the Common buzzard, can cause increased mortality during outbreaks.
2. The Common buzzard can serve as a bio-sentinel for the presence of the HPAI virus in wildlife.
3. In a study, eleven freshly dead Common buzzards were found to be systemically infected with the HPAI H5N8 virus.
4. Viral RNA of the HPAI H5N8 virus was detected in cloacal and pharyngeal swabs, as well as in all ten selected tissues of the birds.
5. The most common virus-associated pathological changes observed were necrotizing encephalitis and necrotizing myocarditis.
6. Two birds showed virus-associated necrosis in the proventriculus, indicating the virus's tropism for the digestive tract.
7. It is recommended to collect a miniset of samples, including the brain, heart, liver, and spleen, for testing, as these tissues showed positive results both by RT-PCR and for virus-antigen-associated lesions.
