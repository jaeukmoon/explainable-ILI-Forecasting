Because this outbreak represented some of the first substantial influenza activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC, in collaboration with the university, MDHHS, and local partners conducted an investigation to characterize and help control the outbreak. Beginning August 1, 2021, persons with COVID-19–like* or influenza-like illness evaluated at UHS received testing for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses by rapid multiplex molecular assay.† During October 6–November 19, a total of 745 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were identified.§ Demographic information, genetic characterization of viruses, and influenza vaccination history data were reviewed. This activity was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ During October 6–November 19, among 3,121 persons tested, 745 (23.9%) received a virus test result that was positive for influenza A, 137 (4.4%) for SARS-CoV-2, and 84 (2.7%) for respiratory syncytial virus. Overall, >95% of influenza cases were detected during November 1–19 (Figure), suggesting rapid spread. One patient with confirmed influenza A infection was hospitalized. Among patients with positive influenza test results, the median age was 19 years (range = 17–31 years), 54.1% were female, 60.0% resided off-campus, 34.6% resided in on-campus residence halls, and 5.4% resided in fraternity or sorority houses. Among 380 specimens sequenced for influenza, all viruses belonged to the A(H3N2) 2a.2 subgroup, which diversified recently from the influenza A(H3N2) subclade 3C.2a1b.2a viruses (i.e., full clade: 3C.2a1b.2a.2). Among 2,405 persons who received testing for influenza A during October 6–November 12, 128 of 481 persons (26.6%) with positive influenza test results and 512 of 1,924 persons (26.6%) with negative influenza test results had documented receipt of 2021–22 influenza vaccine ≥14 days before the test.** Available influenza vaccines are designed to provide protection against four different influenza viruses: A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage. Historically, vaccine effectiveness has been lower against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B viruses, likely because A(H3N2) viruses evolve more rapidly and are able to escape immunity (1). The A(H3N2) component of the northern hemisphere 2021–22 influenza vaccines was updated in February 2021 to protect against a newly emerging 3C.2a1b.2a subclade, which now includes two subgroups (2a.1 and 2a.2) (2). The 2a.2 subgroup of H3N2 viruses detected in Michigan is genetically related to, but antigenically distinguishable (i.e., lower postinfection ferret antibody cross-reactivity) from 2a.1-like H3N2 virus included in the northern hemisphere 2021–22 influenza vaccines (3). The similar vaccination rates among persons with positive and negative influenza test results in this outbreak suggest that protection against mild infection with the 2a.2 subgroup of H3N2 viruses was low among these mostly younger adults. However, cautious interpretation of this finding is needed for reasons such as the potential for incomplete vaccination history and changing coverage with ongoing vaccination campaigns. Persons included in this analysis had mild influenza illness, and vaccination offers protection against a spectrum of outcomes such as hospitalization and death, which occur rarely and are difficult to measure in this age group (4). Results for this specific 2a.2 subgroup of H3N2 viruses are not generalizable to other age groups, populations at higher risk, or other influenza viruses that might circulate. Additional investigation and monitoring are needed to determine vaccine effectiveness against circulating H3N2 viruses in other settings, in other groups of persons, and against other influenza viruses that might emerge this season. The findings of this investigation highlight the importance of increasing vigilance for influenza disease this winter, as indicated in CDC’s Health Alert Network Health Advisory issued on November 24, 2021 (5). Given the substantial impact of COVID-19 on health care systems, with a weekly rate of approximately 500 or more COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in Michigan during the week ending November 19, 2021 (6), additional strategies to reduce influenza illness are important. Several measures can help mitigate severe influenza and the resulting strain on health care services. First, improving influenza vaccination coverage in persons aged ≥6 months, particularly those who are at higher risk for serious influenza complications, is critical to reducing influenza-associated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. Compared with influenza vaccination coverage in 2020, coverage is lower so far this season in certain groups at higher risk for severe influenza illness, such as pregnant persons and children. Second, clinicians should consider diagnostic testing for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with acute respiratory illness, especially among hospitalized patients and those at higher risk for complications. Third, treatment with influenza antiviral medications can reduce influenza complications and should be used in all patients with suspected or diagnosed influenza who are hospitalized, in outpatients who develop progressive disease, and in outpatients with increased risk for complications (7). Influenza antivirals also can be used to reduce the risk for influenza among asymptomatic persons who have been exposed to someone who has influenza (i.e., postexposure prophylaxis) (7). Influenza antivirals have historically been used for postexposure prophylaxis among residents in institutional settings, such as long-term care facilities, to help control influenza outbreaks. In the context of ongoing COVID-19 surges, influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis could also be considered for persons living in other communal settings (e.g., shelters, university residence halls, or prisons) to reduce strain on health care services in these institutions during influenza outbreaks. Fourth, nonpharmaceutical interventions that are used for prevention of COVID-19, such as physical distancing, masking, routine surface cleaning, hand hygiene, and proper cough etiquette, might also provide protection against influenza (8). To help mitigate the potential severity of the influenza season, public health practitioners and clinicians should recommend and offer the current seasonal influenza vaccine to all eligible persons aged ≥6 months.

The key to influenza vaccination currently is the availability of candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Ideally, CVVs reflect the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus, which may vary depending upon the isolation method. For traditional inactivated egg-based vaccines, CVVs are isolated in embryonated chicken eggs, while for cell-culture production, CVV’s are isolated in either embryonated eggs or qualified cell lines. We compared isolation rates, growth characteristics, genetic stability and antigenicity of cell and egg CVV’s derived from the same influenza-positive human clinical respiratory samples collected from 2008–2020. Influenza virus isolation rates in MDCK33016PF cells were twice that of eggs and mutations in the HA protein were common in egg CVVs but rare in cell CVVs. These results indicate that fully cell-based influenza vaccines will improve the choice, match and potentially the effectiveness, of seasonal influenza vaccines compared to egg-based vaccines.

Vaccination is the most effective treatment to prevent infection. For the majority of influenza vaccines that are currently produced, the supply of suitable influenza seed viruses for vaccine production depends on the isolation and propagation of influenza viruses from original clinical respiratory samples (OCS).Traditionally, influenza vaccines have been produced by propagating the viruses required in embryonated chicken eggs. Clinical samples are directly inoculated into the amniotic or allantoic cavities of eggs3. Further manipulations on these initial virus isolates, such as by reassorting with laboratory-adapted viruses, are then required to generate high yielding viruses suitable for vaccine production4. Alternatively, the isolation and propagation of influenza viruses can be performed in continuous cell culture that has been qualified for use in human vaccines5. Concurrent to virus isolation for vaccine candidate production, influenza viruses are typically propagated in cell lines in surveillance laboratories to isolate viruses for antigenic analysis. Many continuous cell lines have been shown to support the growth of influenza viruses, such as Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK)6,7,8, MDCK-SIAT1 (MDCK cells that overexpress α-2,6-sialoglycans)9, MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 (MDCK-SIAT1 cells expressing transmembrane protease, serine 2)10, hCK (MDCK cells that overexpress α-2,6-sialoglycans and have extremely low expression of α-2,3-sialoglycans)11, African green monkey kidney (Vero)12,13, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21)6, SJPL (St Jude porcine lung cells)14, Lewis lung carcinoma monkey kidney (LLC-MK2)7, swine nasal epithelial cells (siNEC) and tracheal epithelial cells (siTEC)15 and EB66[®16 cells. Among these, MDCK and MDCK-SIAT1 cell lines are commonly used as they are highly permissive to influenza viruses, easy to cultivate and progeny virus contain few modifications from the OCS9. Currently, the majority of influenza virus vaccines are still manufactured in embryonated hen’s eggs17,18, although alternative non-egg host systems, such as the use of mammalian cells and recombinant protein vaccines have been licensed (reviewed in ref. 5).It is well recognised that the propagation of influenza viruses in eggs can result in the selection of egg-adapted viruses with mutations in the influenza virus surface protein, haemagglutinin (HA)19,20,21. Mutations in the antigenic sites of the HA protein may alter the immune epitopes of the virus and alter the antigenicity of the virus21,22,23,24,25. This has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine22,26,27. In the past eleven years, A(H3N2) viruses have antigenically drifted rapidly resulting in more frequent updates to the recommendation for the A(H3N2) component of the vaccine compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B (Victoria or Yamagata)28. Egg adaptation of viruses occurs in both influenza A and B viruses, but are most common for A(H3N2) viruses29 and are in part responsible for the reduced efficacy of this vaccine component22,26,27. Thus, the challenge to isolate A(H3N2) candidate vaccine viruses (CVV’s) in eggs that are antigenically well matched to circulating strains and do not contain undesirable egg adaptations in the HA protein is still ongoing.The aim of this study was to assess the isolation rates, genetic and antigenic characteristics and growth properties of influenza viruses isolated in a proprietary MDCK cell line, MDCK33016PF30, compared to embryonated hens eggs, for potential use as influenza CVV’s. MDCK33016PF cells are highly permissive to influenza viruses whilst having limited ability to propagate other human viruses, a characteristic similar to embryonated hen’s eggs31,32,33. It was hypothesised that propagation of human influenza viruses in mammalian cells would result in improved isolation of viruses with fewer mutations in the HA compared to isolation in embryonated hen’s eggs.ResultsHigher isolation rates of human seasonal influenza viruses in MDCK33016PF cells compared to embryonated hen’s eggsThe isolation rate of human viruses from OCS was directly compared between cells and eggs from 2008–2020. OCS from 895 individuals were inoculated into both substrates and were assessed for virus growth by Haemagglutination (HA) assay. Overall, 336 samples (37.5%) were isolated in both cells and eggs, 389 samples (43.5%) were isolated in cells only, 27 samples were isolated in eggs only (3%) and 143 (16%) samples were not isolated in either substrate (Fig. 1a). Samples were twice as likely to be isolated in cells (81.0%) than eggs (40.6%) (p < 0.00001).Fig. 1: The proportion recovery in each culture type of viruses grouped by subtype/lineage and of all samples combined.a 895 samples were inoculated into both cells and eggs and b 369 samples were inoculated into cells only.Full size imageFor all influenza A subtypes and B virus lineages, a higher proportion of viruses were isolated in cells than in eggs (Fig. 1a). Over 80% of viruses from each subtype/lineage were isolated in cells (range 74.8–82.6%) (Fig. 1a). Almost half of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were isolated in eggs (48.7%), whilst lower proportions of A(H3N2) (37.7%), B/Victoria (37.9%) and B/Yamagata (33.3%) viruses were isolated in eggs (Fig. 1a).During this study, an additional 369 OCS were inoculated into cells only giving an overall isolation rate in cells for all subtypes/lineages of 78.5% (range 73.5–80.4%, Fig. 1b).Analysis by sample year and subtype/lineage showed that isolation of viruses in cells was more consistent than eggs (Fig. 2). There was significantly less variation in the isolation rate of viruses in cells as compared to eggs, from year to year, for A(H1N1)pdm09 (p = 0.0153) and B/Yamagata (p = 0.0462) viruses. There was no statistically significant difference in variation in the isolation rate of viruses in cells as compared to eggs, from year to year for A(H3N2) (p = 0.0600) and B/Vic viruses (p = 0.0961). Early in the study, the isolation rates were comparable between cells and eggs, but very low isolation rates in eggs (less than 50%) were observed between 2011–2013, and in 2015 for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, for 2011–2017, 2020 for A(H3N2) and 2011–2015 for B/Victoria and for 2010–2014 for B/Yamagata viruses (Fig. 2, see Supplementary Table 1 for raw data).Fig. 2: Isolation rates of all human influenza viruses tested in cells and eggs.Proportion recovered in cells (red bar) or eggs (blue bar) by year of sample collection is shown for A(H1N1)pdm09 (a), A(H3N2) (b), B/Victoria (c), B/Yamagata (d) and all (e) viruses.Full size imageIn the first few years after the 2009 pandemic, isolation of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in embryonated eggs by allantoic inoculation of influenza-positive OCS was quite successful. However, by 2012, A(H1N1)pdm09 isolation rates had fallen to around 20% and the inoculation method for A(H1N1)pdm09 OCS reverted to the methods used prior to 2009 for seasonal A(H1N1) viruses. They consisted of initial isolation in the amniotic cavity followed by passaging of viruses in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hen’s eggs. From 2013, egg isolation rates for A(H1N1)pdm09 containing samples improved and by 2017 had reached 75% or greater with some years having higher isolation rates in eggs than in cells (Fig. 2a), although only a small number of isolations were attempted in eggs in these years (isolations for 2018: eggs- 17/17, cells – 41/44; 2019: eggs – 4/4, cells – 31/48; 2020: eggs – 2/2, cells – 11/18).The genetic and antigenic complexity of A(H3N2) has increased in recent years resulting in the designation of multiple genetic clades and sub-clades based on the HA gene34. The isolation rate was assessed by clade for A(H3N2) viruses where sequences were available (Fig. 3). At least one virus was isolated in eggs and in cells for each clade, except for 3c2a1b/131K/186D, where only one OCS was received and only grew in eggs. Viruses in the 3a, 3b and 3c clades, which circulated in 2011–2013, were isolated in very high proportions (95–100%) in cells but only at low proportions (20–24%) in eggs. Similarly, two-thirds of viruses in the 3c.2a and 3c.2a1 clades, which circulated in 2014–2017, were isolated only in cells. This is in contrast to viruses early in the study (2009–2010), or more recently (2018–2020), which have been more readily isolated in both cells and eggs.Fig. 3: Isolate rates of A(H3N2) viruses tested in cells and eggs by clade.Numbers at the top of the bars indicate the number of viruses attempted in each clade. Virus clades were determined by sequencing the HA gene.Full size imageDifferential binding of turkey and guinea pig red blood cells to virus isolates over timeChicken, turkey and mammalian red blood cells (RBC) have traditionally been used to detect and quantitate influenza viruses for several decades. RBC from different species express different levels of glycan linkages making them useful to assess changes in the HA receptor binding preferences24. Guinea pig (GP) RBC express more α2,6-linked sialylated N-glycans than turkey RBC and chicken RBC, which have more α2,3-linked sialylated N-glycans35. Throughout this study the titre of cell-grown viruses was measured by HA assay using GP and turkey RBC, effectively assessing the binding preferences of HA over time. Cell-derived A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are consistently bound to both GP and turkey RBC with titres increasing from 2011 to 2019 following the introduction of the pandemic A(H1N1) virus in 2009 (Fig. 4b, c). Increases in HA titres for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses grown in eggs was also observed (Fig. 4d) from 2014. The proportion of MDCK33016PF cells infected with a virus, as determined by flow cytometry detecting nucleoprotein (NP) expression as a marker of virus infection, was greater than 50% for all years (Fig. 4a). The majority of A(H3N2) viruses (87%) lost the ability to bind to turkey RBC from 2011–2018 (Fig. 4g) yet retained binding to GP RBC (Fig. 4f). A consistent level of infection in cells was maintained (Fig. 4e) and consistent HA titres were observed in egg-grown viruses as measured with GP RBC (Fig. 4h). These data indicate a change in the binding preference of the H3 HA away from avian-like receptors towards mammalian-like receptors during the study period. HA titres for cell-grown influenza B viruses were consistent over time (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 4: HA titres of influenza A isolates to GP and turkey RBC, from 2008–2020.a, e Cell-grown A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were assessed for infectivity of cells by flow cytometry. The red bar indicates the mean. HA titres of cell-grown isolates to GP RBC (b, f) and turkey RBC (c, g). d The HA titre of egg-grown A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was measured using turkey RBC. h The HA titre of egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses was measured using GP RBC. (b–d, f–h) Red bar indicates geometric mean titre).Full size imageComparison of virus growth for cell and egg isolatesThe HA titres of viruses that grew in cells only, eggs only or both cells and eggs were compared. Influenza A viruses that were isolated in both cells and eggs had higher HA titres in cells than influenza A viruses that grew in cells only (Fig. 5a, b). The amount of viral RNA (as determined by real-time PCR cycle threshold values) was also higher in the OCS of A(H1N1)pdm09 samples that were isolated both in cells and eggs as compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 samples isolated in cells alone (Fig. 5c). These data indicate that the OCS’s containing higher amounts of virus were more often isolated in both cells and eggs whilst samples containing less virus were more likely to be isolated only in cells. Influenza A viruses that were isolated in both cells and eggs had similar HA titres in eggs as influenza A viruses that grew in eggs only (Fig. 5a, b). There was no statistical difference in titre for influenza B viruses that were isolated in cells alone compared to those isolated in both cells and eggs (Fig. 5d).Fig. 5: Assessment of HA titre for cell-grown or egg-grown viruses.Viruses were inoculated into both cells and eggs and growth was assessed, as per Fig. 1a. Cell-grown viruses were grouped by viruses that were isolated only in cells as compared to viruses that were isolated in cells and eggs. Egg-grown viruses were grouped by viruses that were isolated only in eggs as compared to viruses that were isolated in cells and eggs. The HA titres were plotted for A(H1N1)pdm09 (a) and influenza B (d) as detected by turkey RBC and A(H3N2) (b) as detected by GP RBC. c The Ct of vRNA for a subset of A(H1N1)pdm09 samples was measured. ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. The difference in HA titres or Ct was assessed using an unpaired t-test.Full size imageComparison of mutations in the HA and NA genes in the cell and egg isolatesA subset of viruses (n = 68) was assessed for the stability of the HA sequence after isolation and subsequent passage in both eggs and cells by consensus Sanger sequencing of the HA gene. Non-synonymous mutations in the HA gene were observed in 93% (63/68) of viruses passaged in eggs and 10% (7/68) of viruses passaged in cells, as compared to the HA gene sequence of the OCS (Fig. 6). The HA sequences were assessed for a further 98 viruses passaged in cells only, and non-synonymous mutations in the HA were observed in 11% (11/98) of viruses; taken together, mutations were observed in 11% (18/166) of all sequenced viruses passaged in cells (Fig. 6). Of the seven viruses with mutations observed in both cells and eggs, common mutations following cell- and egg-passage were observed in four of the viruses (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Table 2). Of the four viruses, three had polymorphisms in the HA of the OCS, that when isolated selected the same amino acid in both cells and eggs, indicating that there was no selection by the isolation substrate (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Table 2). Following passage in eggs, the proportion of viruses with mutations was similar for both influenza A subtypes and influenza B viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09—86% (24/28), A(H3N2)—100% (26/26), B—93% (13/14)). Influenza B viruses were less likely to acquire mutations in the HA following passage in cells (3% 1/36), than influenza A viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09—11% (7/66), A(H3N2)—16% (10/64) (Fig. 6). The NA gene sequences were also assessed by consensus Sanger sequencing. Adaptive mutations in the NA gene of egg-grown viruses was less common, observed in 40% (6/15) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 8% (2/26) of A(H3N2) viruses and no (0/9) influenza B viruses. Adaptive mutations in the NA gene of cell-grown viruses was rare, observed only in 7% (1/15) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and none in A(H3N2) (0/25) or influenza B (0/9) viruses (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Table 2).Fig. 6: Assessment of mutations in the HA protein following virus isolation.The frequency of mutations in HA protein of viruses isolated in cells and eggs for A(H1N1)pdm09 (a), A(H3N2) (b), B/Victoria and B/Yamagata (c) as compared to the OCS. The total number of cell and egg virus isolates with HA gene sequenced and the number of viruses with and without any mutation in the HA is indicated on each graph. The location of each mutation in the HA protein is indicated below the x-axis, as determined using26,58,59,60.Full size imageMutations were located mainly in the head of the HA protein in both egg and cell passaged viruses (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Information, Supplementary Table 2). Over twice as many mutation sites were located in antigenic sites for A(H3N2) viruses passaged in eggs (65% 13/20) than passaged in cells (30% 3/10) (Fig. 6b), and for influenza B viruses (eggs 100% 3/3, cells 0% 0/2)- (Fig. 6c). Similar proportions of mutation sites were located in the antigenic sites of H1 HA for egg (23.5% 4/17) and cell (25% 2/8) passaged viruses (Fig. 6a). One-quarter of mutations observed following passage in cells and in eggs resulted in mixed amino acids in the HA protein (Fig. 6).Half the amino acid sites that mutated following passage in eggs (19/38) were shared among more than one virus (Fig. 6). Seven mutations were seen in at least four influenza A viruses each and are indicative of common egg-adaptation mutations (S183P, L191I and Q223R in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, T160K, G186V, L194Pand S219Y/F in A(H3N2) viruses)20,22,24,29,36 (Fig. 6a, b). Mutations observed following passage in cells were only found in one or two viruses (Fig. 6a, b). The N196D/Y/X mutations in B/Yamagata viruses is structurally equivalent to the N197S/X mutation in B/Victoria viruses and was observed in nine egg-passaged influenza B viruses (Fig. 6c).Overall, these data indicate that cell-grown viruses are more representative of currently circulating strains in humans than egg-grown influenza viruses.Egg adaptations in the HA protein affect the antigenicity of egg-passaged virusesThe impact of egg adaptation/s in the HA protein on the antigenicity of A(H3N2) viruses was assessed by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against a panel of post-influenza vaccination human sera. The reactivity of sera from patients that had received the egg-grown influenza virus vaccine was tested against cell- and egg-grown pairs of viruses from different A(H3N2) genetic clades that circulated from 2014–2017.Antibody responses expressed as geometric mean titres to egg-grown viruses were significantly higher than antibody responses to the corresponding cell-grown viruses for all clades tested (Fig. 7a). These data indicate that sera obtained from post-vaccination donors inhibited egg-grown viruses well, but did not inhibit cell-grown viruses well. The egg-grown viruses had all acquired T160K and L194P adaptations in the HA protein, which corresponded to adaptations in the egg vaccine received by the recipients (Fig. 7b). The T160K and L194P mutations are located in antigenic site B of the H3 HA protein. Thus it is likely that the post-vaccine antibody response was directed to the egg adaptations and may not protect as well against infection with circulating viruses, which do not contain these adaptions in the HA protein.Fig. 7: Assessment of impact of egg adaptation on antigenicity.a Analysis of post-vaccination serological responses to egg- and cell-grown virus pairs. Twenty human post-vaccination sera were tested by HI assay against the indicated virus. The Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) and 95% confidence interval was calculated for each virus assessed. b Amino acid mutations in the HA-1 sequence, as compared to the cell sequence is shown for each virus included in (a). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. The difference in GMT was assessed using a multiple t-test.Full size imageDiscussionThis study demonstrated that human influenza viruses were more readily isolated in the qualified mammalian cell line, MDCK33016PF, than in embryonated hen’s eggs. All subtypes and lineages were isolated at higher levels in MDCK33016PF cells and this remained consistent over the study period (2008–2020), while the isolation rate of viruses in embryonated eggs varied for each subtype and lineage. Changes in receptor binding preferences may influence the isolation of human influenza viruses, especially A(H3N2) viruses, in eggs24,37. Viruses that were isolated in the MDCK33016PF cell line had few mutations in the HA, whilst egg adaptation of the HA was common. The egg HA adaptations affected the antigenicity of the virus and reduced the recognition of vaccine-induced antibodies to circulating virus strains as demonstrated in this study and others38,39,40.The difference in the isolation rate between cells and eggs is significant. Overall, for every five viruses inoculated into cells, on average four will grow, whilst for every five viruses inoculated into eggs, on average only two will grow. Thus at least twice as many inoculations into eggs compared to cells, are required to isolate the same number of viruses. This increased isolation rate in cells is directly related to the susceptibility of each substrate to influenza virus infection with human viruses having to undergo adaption to the avian (egg) host in order to replicate efficiently. Limited isolation of viruses in eggs reduces the choice and availability of viruses for influenza virus reassorting and vaccine manufacture. Poor yielding egg-derived viruses may also lead to a delay in vaccine availability due to the failure to have a high-yielding CVV available. The significantly improved isolation rates in MDCK33016PF cells increase the number of CVVs available for manufacture, and this increases the likelihood that a good growing, high yielding CVV will be available. Furthermore, the reduced number of mutations of cell CVVs compared to egg-grown CVVs indicates that cell-derived isolation results in a better-matched CVV to the circulating influenza viruses, especially with the A(H3N2) subtype.The improved isolation rate of cells versus eggs may be explained by the level of sialylated N-glycan expression. Human influenza viruses bind to sialylated N-glycans and phosphorylated non-sialylated N-glycans expressed on the human respiratory tract41,42,43,44. Studies using the Sambucus nigra (SNA) and Maackia amurensis (MAA) lectins show that human respiratory tissues express α2,6-linked sialylated N-glycans more abundantly than α2,3-linked sialylated N-glycans on cells, though both linkage types are present42,43. Similar patterns were observed on MDCK cells45. Studies of avian tissues show expression of both types of receptors, with an increased level of α-2,3-linked sialylated glycans in tissues46,47 and in the chorioallantoic and amniotic membranes in embryonated chicken eggs48. An increased expression of human-like surface receptors (α2,6-linked sialylated N-glycans) on MDCK33016PF cells as compared to eggs may explain their improved isolation rates of human influenza viruses. Increased expression of human-like surface receptors may lead to an increase in the avidity of the interaction between the viral HA and its receptor, improving isolation of samples with low amounts of virus or low HA affinity for its receptor9. In fact, we showed that influenza A samples isolated in cells only had lower viral loads in the OCS than influenza A samples that could be isolated in both cells and eggs. Over the course of the study, A(H3N2) viruses lost their ability to agglutinate turkey RBC and this directly correlated with a reduction of isolation of viruses in eggs, but not in cells. Others have also documented the loss of turkey RBC agglutination of A(H3N2) viruses over time and the accompanying reduction in HA affinity and specificity for its receptor24,49,50,51. Taken together, these data indicate that MDCK33016PF cells support the isolation of samples by increasing the avidity of the viral HA and the receptor on the cell surface.This study demonstrated that viruses that are isolated in the MDCK33016PF cell line have fewer mutations in the HA gene, whilst egg adaptation mutations in the HA gene are common. Not unexpectedly, the majority of mutations occurred around the globular head of the HA, the region involved in virus binding to its cell receptor. For cell isolations of influenza viruses, 25% of mutations were located in antigenic sites, and 35% of mutations were located in antigenic sites or the RBS. Mutations were spread over the whole HA, consistent with random mutation due to a lack of proof-reading ability in the polymerase of influenza virus52. In contrast, for egg-derived influenza virus isolates, mutations were predominantly in the antigenic sites and RBS (63%). Mutations were particularly focused in these regions for the H3 HA (80% of mutations) and influenza B HA of egg-grown viruses (100% of mutations). It is well known that egg adaptations in A(H3N2) viruses can affect antigenicity as well as receptor binding specificity and affinity24,36,53. Changes in affinity or specificity of HA binding can lead to compensatory NA sequence changes54. Compensatory NA mutations in egg-passaged viruses predominantly occurred when HA adaptation occurred at the receptor-binding site or surrounding antigenic sites.Some egg adaptations will lead to detrimental antigenic changes in the HA. Following vaccination with egg-adapted viruses, antibodies may be focussed on the egg-adapted HA sites and not be able to neutralise circulating viruses leading to reduced protection following vaccination with egg-based vaccines. This was demonstrated in this study using a panel of post-vaccination (egg-based vaccine) human sera. The sera recognised egg-grown viruses well, but not cell-grown viruses, which more closely resemble circulating influenza viruses. Similar results with human and animal post-vaccination and infection sera has also been demonstrated by others19,38. A significant effort is made to minimise the use of virus strains with known egg adaptations in the manufacture of influenza vaccines but this also restricts the number of egg-based CVVs that are available. However, a certain level of adaptation is tolerated as with many viruses some egg adaptive HA and NA changes are inevitable. The level to which this contributes to reduced vaccine efficacy depends on the virus, the subtype, the lineage, and the year in which the egg CVV and the influenza vaccine was produced. To date, this reduced efficacy has been mostly attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses25,26,27,55. In 2017/2018 Northern Hemisphere, Flucelvax® Quadrivalent was available and contained the A(H3N2) component that was exclusively derived and manufactured from a cell CVV. Improved effectiveness of this vaccine component as compared to egg-passaged influenza vaccine in preventing influenza-like illness was demonstrated in the 2017/2018 NH season, where A(H3N2) viruses dominated22. All four influenza viruses for Flucelvax® Quadrivalent have been isolated and propagated exclusively in MDCK33016PF cells since 2019/2020, and further improvements in vaccine efficacy are expected. There is also a need to develop alternate technologies, such as cell, recombinant or egg-based platforms that do not allow for egg adaptation5,29. The potential for 'humanised-eggs', where eggs express the SIAT1 gene are an alternative future approach. The data in this study clearly demonstrate that the successful isolation of human influenza viruses in MDCK33016PF cells offers an alternate, attractive strategy for CVV generation with the potential for improved influenza vaccine protection.MethodsClinical specimens and virusesHuman clinical samples that are supplied to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne (the Centre) fall under the terms of reference of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS, see ref. 56) and the use of these samples for influenza vaccine development is permitted without additional ethics approval being held by the Centre. Human seasonal influenza-positive OCS and virus isolates received from 2008–2020 as part of routine influenza surveillance activities from WHO National Influenza Centres, WHO Collaborating Centres and other regional laboratories and hospitals in Australia, New Zealand and Asia/Pacific region, were included in this study. OCS were predominantly throat swabs, nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs as well as a small number of nasopharyngeal aspirates with very few bronchoalveolar lavages. The clinical samples used in this study were chosen to ensure a broad representation of the viral genetic clades present in each type/subtype circulating at the time.Virus infection and passaging in embryonated hen’s eggsOCS were diluted 1:2(v/v) in a 1000 U/ml neomycin sulfate (Pharmacia & Upjohn)/2000 U/ml polymyxin B sulfate (Xella Pharmaceutical) solution and 200 µl was inoculated into either the amniotic cavity of 13–15 day old embryonated hen’s eggs or the allantoic cavity of 10–12 day old embryonated hen’s eggs (kindly provided by Seqirus). Inoculated eggs were incubated in a humidified incubator at 35 °C for 3–4 days for influenza A viruses and 33 °C for 3–4 days for influenza B viruses. Amniotic or allantoic fluid was harvested and the presence of virus was assessed by Haemagglutination (HA) Assay using 1% turkey or GP RBC. Viruses were passaged up to seven times in eggs, with up to three (blind) passages in the amniotic cavity and up to four passages in the allantoic cavity. For passage, the inoculum was prepared at three different dilutions, into 3–6 eggs per dilution, according to the HA titre of the prior passage (4–16 HA— diluted 10−1, 10−3, 10−5, 32–512 HA—diluted 10−2, 10−4, 10−6, >512 HA—diluted 10−4, 10−6, 10−8 prior to infection).Passaging of MDCK33016PF cellsMDCK33016PF suspension cells (a proprietary cell line developed by Novartis31,32,33 and now owned by Seqirus Limited) were maintained at densities between 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml in 500 ml disposable spinner flasks (Corning, USA) in MDCK 33016 CDM (Lonza, Germany) at 37 °C, 4.5% CO2, shaking at 1 g. Cells were passaged at 3–4 day intervals.Virus infection in MDCK33016PF cellsVirus infections in cells were performed in a 5 ml total volume in 50 ml filter tubes (TPP, Transadingen, Switzerland), containing 1 × 106 cells/ml (range 9.9–1.1 × 106) in a (7:3 v/v) mixture of PFM:CDM infection media (PFM manufactured by Invitrogen, USA, CDM by Lonza, Germany) supplemented with trypsin (1%, Roche, USA) and neomycin (37.5 µg/ml, Sigma, USA). About 50 µl OCS (neat) was inoculated for passage 1 (P1) inoculation, resulting in a 10−2 dilution. If less than 50 µl OCS was available, the specimen tube was washed with 50 µl PBS and this was inoculated into the cells. The virus cell suspension was cultured at 34.5 °C, 5% CO2, shaking at 4 g for 72 ± 2 h. To harvest the virus, samples were centrifuged at 500×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The presence of the virus was assessed by HA Assay and flow cytometry (see below). A second passage (P2) of 100 µl P1 virus into 10 ml cells was performed for all samples, as above. The P1 virus inoculum was diluted based on the HA titre (0–8 HA—diluted 1/10; >8–64 HA—diluted 1/100; >64–512 HA—dilution 1/1000; >512 HA—dilution of 1/10000). All samples were stored at −80 °C unless immediately passaged or analysed. All analyses were performed on P2 virus samples.Assessment of virus samples by HA Assay and flow cytometryEgg- and cell-grown virus isolates were assessed for virus growth by HA assay. Briefly, 1% haematocrit turkey or GP RBC was added to an equal volume of virus that had been serially diluted twofold in a microtitre plate3.Virus-infected cells (a total of 104 cells), at 72 h post-inoculation, were fixed and permeabilised using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression of influenza A and B nucleoprotein (NP) was detected using the IMAGEN influenza A and B kit (Cat # K610511-2, Thermo Scientific, USA), diluted 1:100. Cells were analysed using a FACsCanto II (BD, USA) with FACSDiva™ software (v9, USA). Single cells were identified by forward and side scatter and the proportion influenza-positive was determined by assessment of fluorescence as compared to a ‘mock-infected’ cell population. Isolates were classified as positive for growth in cells or eggs if a HA titre of at least 2 was observed for either turkey or GP RBC. Isolates were also classified as positive for growth in cells if at least 20% of cells were positive for NP by flow cytometry in the absence or presence of a detectable HA titre. There was a high positive correlation between flow cytometry results and HA titres for all subtypes/lineages (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. 2).Sequencing of HA genesRNA was extracted from 140 µl virus isolate or OCS using QIAmp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A 5ul aliquot of RNA was used to amplify the HA-1 domain of influenza HA using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, USA) with M13 tagged-gene-specific primers57. Unincorporated primers and dNTPs were removed using ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA sequencing was performed with M13 primers (M13F-59 TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT and M13R 59 CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) in a 96-well plate format using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA), followed by the removal of excess dye terminators with a BigDye XTerminator purification kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). The sequence was determined using an automated capillary DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 3500xL). Identification of mixed bases was set at 25%. Sequences were assembled as consensus using DNASTAR Lasergene Suite v.9.1.0, Seqman v9.1 and compared using Megalign (v9.1).Haemagglutination inhibition assayPre- and post-vaccination sera were used to analyse antibody responses. Subjects were enroled in a clinical trial at the Royal Adelaide Women and Children’s hospital, and blood was drawn prior to influenza vaccination and 21 days post-vaccination. Subjects were vaccinated with the Seqirus Southern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccine for the 2016 season (the vaccine contained an A/California/7/2009-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like virus and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus). Sera was sent to the WHO CC in Melbourne, and antibody responses to the four vaccine components were assessed using the Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using both egg and cell-derived viruses3. Serum samples were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme II (Denka Seiken Co. Ltd.), 1:5 (volume/volume). Influenza virus (4 HA units, 25 μl) was added to an equal volume of treated serum that had been serially diluted twofold in a microtitre plate. Following a 1-h incubation, 25 μl 1% (volume/volume) guinea pig RBC was added to each well. HI was read after 45 min. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum where Haemagglutination was inhibited.Statistical analysisThe proportion of viruses isolated in eggs as compared to cells was assessed using Chi-squared analysis. The difference in variation in isolation rates over the years studied between egg and cells was assessed using the F-test, calculated in Excel (Microsoft, Australia). The difference in HA titres or Cts between viruses isolated only in cells as compared to viruses isolated in both cells and eggs was assessed using an unpaired t-test, using GraphPad Prism Version 7. The difference in HI titres between cell and egg-grown isolates was assessed using a multiple t-test, using GraphPad Prism Version 7.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Flu is a major public health concern, and this week is a reminder that there is still time to get a flu vaccineâthe only vaccine that protects against fluâto prevent flu illness and potentially serious complications. Getting a vaccine every year is the best way to prevent flu because flu viruses constantly change, and vaccination protection decreases over time.Vaccination in December or later is still beneficial, and the vaccine is especially encouraged to help everyone stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines are particularly important for people who are most vulnerable to developing serious flu complications, including people with certain chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, in past flu seasons, 9 out of 10 adults hospitalized for flu had at least one underlying medical condition.Many Vaccine Options For the 2021â2022 season, CDC recommends use of any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine. These include:Injectable flu vaccines, or flu shots. These include:Flu shots that are made with inactivated viruses.One flu shot that is made without influenza viruses.A live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is given by nasal spray.There are many flu vaccine options, and CDC does not recommend any one vaccine over another. Different vaccines are approved for different groups of people.Some flu shots are approved for use in children as young as 6 months old and others are approved for use in adults 65 years and older.Flu shots also are recommended for pregnant people and people with certain chronic health conditions.The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for people from age 2 to 49 who are not pregnant. People who are pregnant and people with certain medical conditions should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine.Getting a flu vaccine is the best way for everyone to protect themselves and their loved ones from flu.

As the country continues the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, a flu shot remains the most effective way to protect against seasonal flu and is an important step individuals and families can take to help safeguard the overall health of the community and minimize the impact on strained health care resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established National Influenza Immunization Week in 2005 to highlight the importance of flu vaccinations through the holiday season and into the New Year, when flu activity is typically at its peak. In a survey conducted by CVS Health1, nearly three quarters of Americans say they plan to get a flu shot this year, with 45 percent planning on getting their vaccine at a retail pharmacy. It is possible that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both be circulating at the same time over the next few months, therefore it is more important than ever to get vaccinated. "Last year, we saw a decline in flu cases, due in part to increased focus on personal hygiene and mask wearing as well as people spending less time in large gatherings and public places," said Prem Shah, Executive Vice President and Chief Pharmacy Officer, CVS Health. "This year, as some Americans have returned to pre-pandemic routines and activities, we expect the number of flu cases may increase, and we strongly recommend that people get their annual flu shot to help increase their immunity and protect themselves, their families and their communities." Both CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic, the retail health clinic inside select CVS Pharmacy locations, offer convenient options for people to get their flu shots and COVID-19 vaccinations, seven days a week, with expanded evening and weekend hours. In addition, for people who do fall ill this season and begin to experience symptoms, there are more than 1,100 MinuteClinic locations across the country that can help diagnose illnesses such as a cold, the flu, strep throat or COVID-19, and quickly provide expert care and an appropriate treatment plan. "Just because it's flu season doesn't mean that if you get sick, you have the flu," added Angela Patterson, DNP, FNP-BC, NEA-BC, FAANP, Chief Nurse Practitioner Officer, MinuteClinic. "Fortunately, our MinuteClinic locations have various rapid, point-of-care tests available to help diagnose conditions such as flu, strep throat and COVID-19. We provide patients with a convenient option to see a health care provider who can assess your symptoms and provide comprehensive care this flu season and year-round." The company has continued to lead the way in supporting access to COVID-19 vaccines and has delivered approximately 43 million COVID-19 vaccines through the end of October. CVS Health also recently announced that select CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations are now offering the two-dose primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 pediatric vaccine for children ages five to 11 years of age, and Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 booster doses to all eligible adults ages 18 years and older who have completed a primary vaccination series with any authorized COVID-19 vaccine. CVS Health enables families to easily schedule their flu and COVID-19 vaccines together at CVS Pharmacy via CVS.com or through the CVS App. Patients may also schedule an immunization appointment with a MinuteClinic provider at Minuteclinic.com.

Science has ticked off some major accomplishments over the last century. The world learned about viruses, cured various diseases, made effective vaccines, developed instant communications and created elaborate public-health networks. Yet in many ways, 2020 is looking like 1918, the year the great influenza pandemic raged. (Edward A. “Doc” Rogers/Library of Congress via AP, File) By Alexi Cohan | Boston HeraldPUBLISHED: December 10, 2021 at 6:04 PM ESTThe 1918 influenza pandemic infected 500 million people and is known as the mother of all pandemics. See below a timeline of how the pandemic unraveled with information collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. March 1918: Outbreaks of flu-like illness are detected in U.S. soldiers which spreads through Europe and Asia in the next six months, but cases are mild. September 1918: A second wave of the flu emerges and is highly fatal. October 1918: 195,000 Americans die of the flu in October alone. Businesses are closed, hospitals have staff shortages and masks are worn. January 1918: The end of WW1 triggers a third wave which subsides in the summer. Early 1920: With one third of the global population having been infected, the pandemic ends and enters an endemic phase. Modern day flu strains still have a footprint of the 1918 flu.

To test the hypothesis that host factors, including age and sex, play a role in determining the effect of repeated vaccination and levels of pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza, we evaluated pre- and post-vaccination strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in adults over 75 years of age who received a high-dose influenza vaccine in at least four out of six influenza seasons. Pre-vaccination titers, rather than host factors and repeated vaccination were significantly associated with post-vaccination HAI titer outcomes, and displayed an age-by-sex interaction. Pre-vaccination titers to H1N1 remained constant with age. Titers to H3N2 and influenza B viruses decreased substantially with age in males, whereas titers in females remained constant with age. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-existing immunity in this highly vaccinated older adult population and suggest that older males are particularly vulnerable to reduced pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza.

In the United States (U.S.), there are an estimated 4 million incident cases per year in older adults, accounting for 90% of deaths associated with influenza4,5. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual influenza vaccination for prevention of influenza infection and complications in people 6 months and older6. The high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) is available to older adults and has demonstrated superior efficacy over the standard-dose vaccine in older age groups6,7. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage is relatively high in older adults, with >60% of older Americans being vaccinated annually, compared to <40% vaccination coverage in the 18–49 age group8.Age-related immunosenescence, defined by a decline in cellular and humoral immune function combined with a chronic low-grade inflammatory phenotype (CLIP), or inflammaging9,10,11, is believed to be the primary reason for the reduced effectiveness of influenza vaccines observed in older adults12,13,14. Repeated annual vaccination may also have a negative effect on vaccine-induced humoral immune responses as well as vaccine effectiveness (VE). For example, a recent observational test-negative study using ten years of vaccination history found that in older adults, VE decreases with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations but that vaccination continues to offer some level of protection15. Another study over eight seasons in the general adult population found that VE to H3N2, but not influenza B virus, is reduced among individuals with frequent vaccination history compared to those without prior vaccination16. Age-specific effects have also been observed in this context, with a reduction in influenza vaccine immunogenicity observed with repeat vaccination in teenagers, but not adults17. In addition, a meta-analysis found heterogeneous effects of repeated vaccination overall and that when negative effects are observed, they are most pronounced for H3N218. In contrast, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that the available evidence did not support a reduction in VE with consecutive repeat vaccination, but that certainty in the evidence was low19. Case–control studies in both Australia and Spain found beneficial effects of repeated annual vaccination on VE in older adults20,21, and an observational population-based study in Sweden found no differences in VE between those who had been vaccinated in the current season only and those who had been vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons22. Based on the conflicting evidence, multi-season clinical studies to address the effects of aging and repeated vaccination have been recommended18.Mechanistically, pre-existing immunity generated to various influenza virus exposures over time can have an important impact on the outcome of vaccination. According to the immune imprinting theory, the memory response established by an individual’s first influenza exposure has a lifelong effect on subsequent immune responses to infection or vaccination23. Broad pre-existing immunity is thought to have negative consequences, as pre-existing antibodies can suppress the response to novel influenza virus strains by reducing the amount of available antigen or epitope masking24,25. A theoretical benefit of HD-IIV is that pre-existing antibodies cannot sequester the increased amount of antigen delivered, and, thus, more antigen is available to activate memory B cells and elicit a protective response26,27,28. To our knowledge, however, the impact of pre-existing immunity in the context of HD-IIV has not been adequately characterized.In addition to age, other host factors including sex, frailty, and body mass index (BMI) can impact vaccine responses in older adults. Females have been found to mount greater antibody responses to HD-IIV than males29. The immunological differences between males and females in immune responses are largely attributed to sex hormones and sex chromosomes30,31,32. Inflammaging also contributes significantly to age- and sex-related differences in immune responses and vulnerability to infections, as discussed in two recent reviews in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and ongoing pandemic31,33. The relationship between frailty and influenza vaccine responses is debated in the literature, with one study reporting frailty having a negative effect34, others reporting no effect35,36,37,38,39, and others still reporting a positive effect40. Finally, in older adults, obesity, as measured by BMI, is significantly associated with decreased hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers and percentage of switched memory B cells41. Whether host related factors, including sex and age, explain variation in pre-existing immunity following repeated vaccination has not been reported. We hypothesize that the variation across studies in estimates of the effects of pre-existing immunity and repeated annual vaccination is partly caused by failure to adequately account for heterogeneity and interactions among host factors that likely differ across studies. To address this knowledge gap, we used a longitudinal cohort of older adults over 75 years of age who had received high-dose, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) in at least four out of six influenza seasons to estimate the impact of repeated vaccination on the antibody response to HD-IIV3 and its dependence on the intersection of age, sex, frailty, BMI, and pre-existing immunity.ResultsStudy participants and annual influenza immunization with HD-IIV3Over the six influenza seasons from 2014–2015 to 2019–2020, 90 individuals participated in at least four study seasons and 433 doses of HD-IIV3 were administered. The strains included in each vaccine and the study protocol are described in Fig. 1. Table 1 shows demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants. There were slightly more females (55.6%), and yearly study enrollment increased over time. There were missing data in our study (i.e., individuals who did not participate in all six influenza seasons), but this did not substantially depart from the missing at random assumption, so multi-level models were used to account for this missingness. Baseline characteristics, measured during the first year of participation, were similar between males and females. The median age at study enrollment was 80, and >50% of participants were classified as pre-frail as per the Fried Frailty Phenotype42. Trends in the change of frailty status since baseline were calculated as the difference between the first and last years of participation and differed by sex. A greater proportion of males improved in frailty status, whereas more females either did not change or progressed in frailty status. A greater proportion of males also experienced changes in BMI over the course of the study, while BMI did not change for females.Fig. 1: Study design.Study procedures and the three strains included in each seasonal HD-IIV3 are shown. Serum from blood draws was used to evaluate pre- and post-vaccination strain-specific hemagglutination antibody inhibition (HAI) titers, and frailty was assessed using the Frailty Phenotype. Images were created with BioRender.com.Full size imageTable 1 Summary of study population characteristics.Full size tablePre- and post-vaccination strain-specific HAI titers are high among repeatedly vaccinated older adultsPre- and post-vaccination strain-specific HAI titer outcomes to the three HD-IIV3 vaccine strains are summarized and disaggregated by sex in Table 2. Pre- and post-vaccination outcomes stratified by influenza season are detailed in supplement tables (Supplementary Tables 1–6). As expected in this highly vaccinated elderly population, titers and seroprotection rates (defined as an HAI titer ≥4043,44,45) were high. This was particularly true for influenza B, where 98% of the participants were seroprotected prior to immunization. Post-vaccination, >94% of participants achieved seroprotection for H1N1 and H3N2, while 100% of participants were seroprotected against influenza B. Because of the lack of variability in post-vaccination seroprotection, this outcome was omitted from further analysis. Fold-rise in titers and rates of seroconversion, as defined by ≥4-fold titer increase46, were relatively low but were highest for H3N2. There were no sex differences in any post-vaccination outcomes. Together, these data indicate that pre-existing and post-vaccination strain-specific HAI titers remained high among older adults who were repeatedly vaccinated with HD-IIV3.Table 2 Pre- and post-vaccination hemagglutination antibody inhibition (HAI) titer outcomes.Full size tableAge, sex, BMI, frailty status, and repeated vaccination are not associated with post-vaccination outcomesWe then assessed the relationships between pre-defined host factors (i.e., age, sex, BMI, and frailty status) and post-vaccination strain-specific HAI titer outcomes. When controlling for pre-vaccination titers and influenza season, neither age, frailty, nor BMI individually had statistically significant associations with post-vaccine titers (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C), the fold-rise in titers (Fig. 2a–c), or the odds of seroconversion (S Supplementary Fig. 2A–C) for either H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B. Inclusion of interaction terms in the models allowed for analysis of sex-specific contributions of age, frailty, and BMI as well as sex differences in the effects of these host factors. None of the host factors had a statistically significant association with post-vaccination titers (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C), the fold-rise (Fig. 2a–c), or the odds of seroconversion (Supplementary Fig. 2A–C) for either males or females.Fig. 2: Impact of host factors, repeated vaccination, and pre-vaccination titers on the fold-rise in HAI titers.The relationship of age (in decades, Age/10), frailty status, and BMI (five-unit intervals, BMI/5) with log10-transformed fold-rise in titers (post-titer/pre-titer) are shown as slopes for H1N1 (a), H3N2 (b), and influenza B (c). The relationship between increasing years of vaccination and the log10-transformed fold-rise in titers are shown for H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B (d–f), with the slopes summarized (g). The relationships between pre-vaccination HAI titers and the log10-transformed fold-rise in titers are shown for each vaccine antigen (h–j), with the slopes summarized (k). Estimates and 95% confidence intervals were derived from multi-level mixed-effects models with random intercepts on the individual participant. Models controlled for influenza season and pre-vaccination HAI titers (a–g), and either controlled for sex (whole population estimates) or used interaction terms between sex and the host factor of interest to derive sex-specific estimates.Full size imageThe relationship between the number of years of study participation (measured as a time-varying predictor) and post-vaccination HAI titers outcomes was investigated to evaluate potential negative effects of repeated annual vaccination on the humoral immune response to future vaccines. Vaccination status prior to study enrollment could not be verified, but leveraging the longitudinal design of our study, we sought to quantify whether post-vaccination outcomes declined with additional annual vaccination, and whether this effect differed by sex. There was a non-significant negative trend between the number of years participated and the fold-rise in titers (Fig. 2d–g). These trends were also observed when analyses were repeated using post-vaccination titers (Supplementary Fig. 1D–G) and rates of seroconversion (Supplementary Fig. 2D–G) as outcomes of interest.Pre-vaccination HAI titers strongly predict post-vaccination outcomesOverall, host factors and increasing number of annual vaccinations did not significantly predict any of the post-vaccination antibody titer parameters. Pre-vaccination titers, however, were strong predictors of the fold-rise for H1N1 (slope = −0.15; 95% CI: −0.18; −0.13) (Fig. 2h), H3N2 (slope = −0.12; 95% CI: −0.15; −0.10) (Fig. 2i), and influenza B (slope = −0.13; 95% CI: −0.15; −0.11) (Fig. 2j) (p < 0.0001 for testing the null hypotheses that the slope equals zero for each vaccine strain), such that greater pre-vaccination titers were associated with a smaller fold-rise. Analyses were repeated using post-vaccination titers (Supplementary Fig. 1H–K) and odds of seroconversion (Supplementary Fig. 2H–K) as outcomes of interest, and similarly strong associations were observed with the pre-vaccination titers. The strength of these associations suggests that post-vaccination outcomes are primarily determined by pre-existing humoral immunity. Thus, in highly vaccinated populations, such as the older adult participants in this study, pre-vaccination titers are not just confounders to be controlled for in the analysis of post-vaccination humoral immunity but are an outcome of public health importance that illustrate the durability of immunity to influenza from one season to the next. Given the importance of pre-vaccination titers, we focused subsequent analyses on exploring the relationships between host factors and pre-vaccination HAI titers in the context of advanced age and repeated annual vaccination.Sex modifies the relationship between age and pre-vaccination HAI titersNext, we assessed the relationships between age, frailty, BMI, and pre-vaccination titers (Fig. 3a–c). Neither frailty nor BMI were statistically significantly associated with pre-vaccination HAI titers for all participants or in sex-disaggregated subgroups. Further, there were no statistically significant sex differences in the effects of frailty or BMI on pre-vaccination HAI titers against either H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B. A statistically significant sex by age interaction, however, was observed for H3N2 (Fig. 3b) and for influenza B (Fig. 3c), in which HAI titers declined with age among male but not female participants.Fig. 3: Relationship of age, frailty status, and BMI to pre-vaccination hemagglutination antibody inhibition (HAI) titers.Estimates for the relationship of age in decades (Age/10), frailty status, and BMI (five-unit intervals, BMI/5) to pre-vaccination HAI titers were derived from multilevel mixed-effects models controlling for study year for H1N1 (a), H3N2 (b), and influenza B (c). Expanded age models controlling for frailty and BMI are shown for responses to H1N1 (d), H3N2 (e), and influenza B (f). Expanded models for responses to H1N1 (g), H3N2 (h), and influenza B (i) were then amended to include cubic B-splines for age with knots at 5-year intervals. Models for the whole study population adjusted for sex, while sex-specific estimates included an interaction term allowing effects to differ by sex and are shown with 95% confidence intervals. Asterisks indicate significant sex differences.Full size imageTo further interrogate the sex-specific effects of aging, expanded models controlling for frailty and BMI, in addition to influenza season, were constructed. Coefficients from the base (i.e., controlling for infleunza season only) and expanded models are shown in Table 3, and results from expanded models are plotted in Fig. 3d–f. For H1N1, HAI titers tended to increase with age for both males and females, but the increase was not statistically significant (males: 0.49 units per decade, p = 0.152; females: 0.35 units per decade, p = 0.267), nor was the sex difference in slope (p = 0.676) (Fig. 3d). For H3N2, while titers again tended to increase with age in females (0.62 units per decade, p = 0.121), they tended to decrease with age in males (−0.75 units per decade, p = 0.097), leading to a significant sex difference in age slopes (sex by age interaction = 0.137; p = 0.010) (Fig. 3e). For influenza B, titers again tended to increase with age in females (0.33 units per decade, p = 0.275) but decreased by 0.78 units per decade in males (p = 0.023) (Fig. 3f). Like H3N2, the sex difference in the effect of age was significant for influenza B (p = 0.005).Table 3 Sex-specific effects of age on pre-vaccination hemagglutination antibody inhibition (HAI) titers.Full size tableBoth the base and expanded models were then amended to include cubic splines to obtain more granular estimates of the effects of age on HAI titers for males and females. Coefficients for base and expanded non-linear models are shown in Table 3, and results from expanded models are plotted in Fig. 3g–i. The non-linear model for H1N1 did not differ from the linear model, and no significant effects of age within each sex or difference between the sexes were observed (Fig. 3g). Although the trends in the linear models were similar for H3N2 and influenza B, using age as a non-linear predictor revealed that different age categories were driving the overall effects. For H3N2, the increase in pre-vaccination HAI titers with age in females was driven by individuals in the 80–85 age category (increase of 0.67 units; p = 0.037), and the decrease in males was driven primarily by people in the 75–80 age category (decrease of 1.78 units; p = 0.012) (Fig. 3h). Thus, the sex difference was greatest at the younger end of the cohort (p = 0.036 at 75 years of age). Conversely, increasing titers to influenza B with age in females were driven by individuals in the 75–80 age category (increase of 1.2 units; p = 0.004), whereas for males there was a sharp decline in HAI titers that occurred in participants 90–95 years of age (decrease of 1.65 units; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3i). Here, the sex difference in pre-vaccination titers was only significant at the oldest end of the cohort (p = 0.003 at 95 years of age). Taken together, these data illustrate sex-specific effects of aging on pre-vaccination antibody titers to H3N2 and influenza B, but not H1N1.To account for the fact that there were several consecutive influenza seasons where the strain included in the vaccine remained constant for either H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B, the above analyses were repeated controlling for viral vaccine stain rather than influenza season. Reanalasis of prevaccination antibody titers using viral vaccine strain rather than influenza season in the models did not change any of the associations between age and sex described above, and the trend of declining pre-vaccination titers in males to H3N2 and influenza B remained (Supplementary Table 7). Further, to illustrate the consequences of ignoring sex as a biological variable, as is commonly encountered in biomedical research47,48, analyses were repeated controlling for sex rather than allowing age effects to vary by sex. For H3N2 and influenza B, where the effect of aging was found to be significantly different in males as compared to females, the estimates derived by controlling for sex (black lines in Fig. 3e, f, h, i) were not representative of either males or females. In the linear models, for example, controlling for sex led to the incorrect inference that titers remain constant with age, while the interaction models demonstrate that this is false for both males and females. The goodness-of-fit of models controlling for sex and using an age-by-sex interaction term were compared using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) in Table 4, where lower values indicate better relative goodness-of-fit. For antibody titers to H3N2 and influenza B, despite the penalty for increasing model complexity, fit was improved by including an age-by-sex interaction term that allowed the effect of age to differ by sex. Thus, incorporating sex differences into vaccinology research can lead to more robust analysis.Table 4 Goodness-of-fit comparison of pre-vaccination age models.Full size tableDiscussionIn this multi-season, longitudinal study of older adults over 75 years of age, pre-vaccination titers, rather than host factors or repeated vaccination, strongly predicted all post-vaccination antibody titer outcomes. While it has previously been reported that pre-existing immunity predicts the outcome of vaccination across various age groups15,17, the role of sex and age in explaining variability in pre-existing immunity has not been characterized. We report that pre-existing humoral immunity, which reflects the durability of humoral immunity against influenza from previous seasons, displayed an age-by-sex interaction. We found that HAI titers to all three vaccine strains stayed constant in females with age but that HAI titers to H3N2 and influenza B decreased with age in males, leading to significant sex differences in the effect of age for these two vaccine viruses. Thus, sex is a fundamental predictor of the effect of age on pre-existing immunity in this vulnerable population. It has previously been reported that at older ages, there is a male-bias in influenza B infection and hospitalization49,50. Our results, therefore, provide a potential mechanism for this sex difference and highlight the need to develop better vaccines or vaccination strategies against influenza for older males.Because older adults are disproportionally burdened by severe disease and mortality from seasonal influenza, significant effort has been devoted to improving annual vaccination coverage for this vulnerable population. Older adults, particularly those who are over 75 years of age, can thus have decades of repeated annual influenza vaccination. Cumulatively, repeated annual vaccination can lead to high pre-vaccination titers, which we observed in this study and previously reported in younger adult healthcare workers, where mandatory vaccination policies result in exceptionally high rates of immunization51. Particularly important in older adults, where formation of de novo responses is impaired by immunosenescence52, the breadth of pre-existing humoral immunity and the positive predictive value for post-vaccination titers can thus be harnessed to elicit protection27. The clinical and scientific implications of this notion are far-reaching and long-term, as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the CDC has recommended annual influenza vaccination for anyone aged 6 months and older since 201053.For many vaccines, antibody titers wane over time54,55,56,57. Influenza vaccines are unique in this respect due to the recommendation for yearly immunization and exceptional antigenic diversity, which alter the dynamics of waning immunity. The constant pre-vaccination HAI titers with age in females seen in our study suggest that females benefit from a booster effect from each successive annual vaccination that appears to prevent antibody waning. This influenza-specific effect has been reported elsewhere, where samples collected from individuals over a 20-year period revealed longitudinal increases in neutralizing titers to influenza58. However, our data suggest that this effect is absent in males for H3N2 and influenza B. The reasons for this sex difference are unknown, but may be attributable to the compounding effects of females developing stronger responses to influenza infection and vaccination throughout adulthood59, leading to a more robust repertoire of memory B cells that recognize conserved epitopes on drifted virus strains. It is speculated that in older adults, consistently inferior responses among males may manifest as a lack of memory B cells that can be boosted by drifted viruses to counteract waning of antibody over time, thus resulting in decreasing pre-vaccination titers with age.Notably the sex difference was absent for responses to H1N1 vaccine antigens. A possible explanation for this lies in the differing evolutionary rates of the three vaccine viruses. H1N1 viruses experience slower evolution than H3N2 viruses60 and the influenza B/Victoria lineage61. In addition, the global co-circulation of B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages leads to increased exposure to divergent antigens62. Accordingly, over the six influenza vaccine seasons included in our study, and in the past decade, vaccine antigens were significantly more variable for H3N2 and influenza B than for H1N163. It is thus possible that repeated exposure to the same H1N1 strain sufficiently boosted male steady-state immunity to mask sex differences in the immune response. Conversely, for H3N2 and influenza B, sequential exposure to drifted viruses required robust and broad responses to allow for boosting of steady-state immunity, which may have only been present in females. Another possible explanation is immunological imprinting in youth, as it has a lifelong impact on subsequent immune responses to influenza infection and vaccination23,64. Individuals in our cohort, born from 1916–1941, may have been exposed to H1N1 in their youth, while the 1918 pandemic virus continued to circulate, but were likely exposed to H3N2 and influenza B later in life65. It is, therefore, possible that strong immune imprinting to H1N1 virus strains masked the sex differences otherwise observed for H3N2 and influenza B.Our study had several strengths and limitations. First, this was an observational study that was not specifically designed to interrogate sex differences in the immune response to influenza vaccination. To overcome small yearly sample sizes, six influenza seasons were pooled together, and statistical methods were used to control for annual variation in vaccine virus strains and repeated measurements on participants. The resulting multi-season nature of this work improves generalizability to future influenza seasons. Secondly, the humoral immune response to vaccination was strain-specific HAI titers, which are the standard in the field, but lack the functional quality of microneutralization assays66. Relying solely on serological samples also prohibited mechanistic investigation at the cellular level. In-depth studies of cellular and transcriptional mechanisms underlying the sex differences observed in this cohort are on-going. Third, the lack of racial diversity in our cohort must be noted, as it prohibited us from investigating race as a host factor of interest, which should be considered in future studies. Although the study lacked racial diversity, the cohort was diverse in terms of age at vaccination, allowing us to study effects in the ‘oldest’ old subset. In addition, we were unable to ascertain vaccination history for the participants prior to enrollment in the study. Previous research suggests that influenza vaccination coverage is similar among older men and women67, such that it is unlikely that gender differences in vaccination history confounded the results observed. Finally, a major strength of this study is the intersectional approach to analysis, which allowed for interrogation of effects both between and within groups (i.e., between and among males and females), leading to a richer and more nuanced interpretation68.In conclusion, we demonstrate that in highly vaccinated older adults, pre-vaccination HAI titers, rather than age, sex, BMI, frailty, or repeated vaccination, predict post-vaccination parameters of humoral immunity. These pre-vaccination titers change with age in a sex-specific manner, such that older males are particularly vulnerable to lower levels of pre-existing humoral immunity. These findings provide a basis for future studies to investigate the predictive value of host factors and vaccination history in protection from influenza, which could ultimately be a valuable tool in a clinical setting. Further research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying this sex difference, as well as novel vaccination strategies to harness the breadth of pre-existing immunity in older adults to provide better protection against influenza for this vulnerable population.MethodsStudy population and protocolDuring the 2014–2015 to 2019–2020 influenza seasons, we enrolled community-dwelling older adults above 75 years of age who had not yet received a seasonal influenza vaccine. Individuals who had a history of allergic reaction to influenza vaccines or to eggs, were currently taking oral steroids, or had worsening or new-onset of immune-modulating conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, hematologic malignancies, etc) were excluded. Study participants came to the Clinical Research Unit at Johns Hopkins Institute of Clinical and Translational Research on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center campus, or study visits were conducted at participants’ home as needed. A detailed medical history was obtained, vital signs were measured and frailty was assessed as per the Fried Frailty Phenotype42. After a pre-vaccination blood draw, participants received HD-IIV3 (Fluzone®High-Dose, Sanofi Pasteur, PA, USA). A second blood sample was collected between 21 and 28 days after vaccine administration (Fig. 1). To focus on the context of repeated annual vaccination, only individuals who participated in a minimum of 4 influenza seasons were included in this analysis.EthicsWritten, informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02200276).Hemagglutination inhibition assaysValidated HAI assays were performed by Sanofi Pasteur and used to quantify antibody titers against the three influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B) included in each season’s vaccine69. Briefly, serum was incubated with type III neuraminidase to eliminate non-specific inhibitors and then with turkey red blood cells to adsorb non-specific agglutinins. Two-fold serial dilutions of sera, beginning at a 1:10 dilution, were then performed in duplicate, and sera were incubated with influenza virus (4 hemagglutination units/25 µl). Turkey red blood cells were then added, and the titer defined as the highest dilution in which hemagglutination of turkey red blood cells was inhibited.Definitions and categorization of predictor variablesSex was used as a dichotomous variable based on self-report. Age was calculated based on the date of vaccination and used as a continuous variable. The frailty assessment was based on the presence or absence of five measurable characteristics: slowed motor performance (by walking speed), poor endurance and energy (by self-report of exhaustion), weakness (by grip strength), shrinking (by unintentional weight loss), and low physical activity (by self-report)34,42. Participants with three or more out of these five characteristics were defined as frail, those with one or two as prefrail, and those with none as non-frail. BMI was calculated based on measured height and weight and used as a continuous variable. Influenza season (i.e., 2014–2015 to 2019–2020) was used as categorical variable so as not to imply a linear relationship from year-to-year. The influenza season was included as a dummy variable in analyses to account for possible confounding due to variation in the vaccine composition over time. In sensitivity analyses, viral strain was used as an alternative approach to control for confounding due to antigenic drift. Number of years of study participation was defined as the number of vaccines administered to an individual as part of the study at the time that the outcome was measured each year. Number of years of study participation was used as a time-varying continuous predictor ranging from 1 to 6 (i.e. set to one the first year an individual participated, two the second year an individual participated, etc…).Outcome variablesGeometric mean titers were calculated both pre- and post-vaccination. For regression analysis, titers were transformed to a log2 scale to achieve an approximately normal distribution. The fold-rise in titer was calculated as post-vaccination titers divided by pre-vaccination titers, and log10 transformed to achieve a normal distribution. Seroconversion was defined as achieving a fold-rise ≥4 and used as a binary outcome. Seroprotection was defined as a titer ≥40 and used as a binary outcome.Statistical analysisTo account for repeated measures on participants, multi-level mixed-effects models with random intercepts on the individual were used. Although there was missing data in our study, we do not anticipate substantial departure from the missing at random assumption. The mixed-effects method was selected because it is considered to be robust in addressing “non-informative” missing data70. Following standard risk factor analysis procedure, the contributions of host factors of interest were first assessed individually. Based on the a priori hypotheses of this analysis, fixed effects of the base models for post-vaccination outcomes adjusted for influenza season, pre-vaccination titers and included interaction terms to allow the effect of the host factor to differ for males and females. Fixed effects of the base models for pre-vaccination titers adjusted for influenza season and included interaction terms to allow effects to differ by sex. Where significant sex differences were found, further analysis controlled for additional covariates, and used cubic B-splines to investigate non-linear relationships71. The relative goodness-of-fit of various models were compared using Akaike’s Information Criterion. For graphs, predictions were capped at 95 years of age due to low sample size and large uncertainty in estimates above 95 years. Coefficients were considered statistically significant if 95% confidence intervals did not span the null value of zero (i.e., p < 0.05). Analysis was performed in Stata 15 (StataCorp).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

With COVID-19 still with us, it's more important than ever to get a flu vaccine to keep yourself and others safe while protecting our health care systems struggling with the pandemic, according to Dr. Lisa Costello, a pediatric specialist with WVU Medicine Children’s. Watch a video with Dr. Costello explaining the importance of flu shots during the pandemic. Dr. Kathy Moffett, a pediatrician in the School of Medicine and infectious disease expert, also shares information about staying safe over the holidays with COVID and the flu in this video. In addition to getting a flu shot from their primary care provider, walk-in appointments are available for students, faculty and staff through WVU Medicine Student Health and WVU Medicine Urgent Care. Walk-in appointments at WVU Medicine Student Health are offered during regular business hours (Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). The WVU Medicine Urgent Care location in Evansdale offers walk-in appointments Monday through Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 9:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Suncrest Town Centre location is open daily from 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. Operating hours for other WVU Medicine Urgent Care locations may vary. WVU Medicine requires all staff, providers, residents, students and volunteers to have a flu vaccination unless they have an approved medical or religious exemption. This includes WVU faculty and staff (state employees) whose job duties bring them into contact with patients as well as those whose work requires them to enter patient care areas intermittently, even if their main work location is elsewhere. Individuals who are uncertain if this requirement applies to them should ask their supervisor for clarification. Proof of immunization must be provided to the employee’s department supervisor. Both the WVU Medicine Student Health and WVU Medicine Urgent Care clinics also offer COVID-19 vaccination opportunities. First, second and booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine are available at these clinics, and individuals may choose to get their flu shot at the same time as their COVID-19 vaccine. Flu shots are fully covered under PEIA and The Health Plan for insured employees, spouses and dependent family members. Flu shots also are covered for students under the Aetna Student Health insurance plan. Those not insured through these providers also may bill their insurance. Note: A $30 cash payment option also is available for the flu vaccine; however, most insurance providers fully cover the cost. The COVID-19 vaccine is offered free of charge. Visit the Talent and Culture or WVU Medicine Student Health websites for more information. Students should contact Student Health at 304-285-7200 with any questions. Employees should contact WVU Shared Services at 304-293-6006 or sharedservices@mail.wvu.edu.

Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging.Why is it in the news again?The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors.What are the most dangerous strains?The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area.Where has it appeared?The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain – of which 33 are in England – and two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter.A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland’s Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese.Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a “small backyard flock”.If it just affects birds, why the panic?It doesn’t. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened.So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic.How do you catch bird flu?It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings.What are the symptoms in humans?They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis – red, sore and discharging eyes.How does it spread?WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it “spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces”. Officials added: “It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear … Avian influenza isn’t an airborne virus.”It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said.What measures is the UK taking?The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK’s constituent nations have “agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks”. It added: “The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.”How do you spot the virus in birds?Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying.People are advised not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird.What drug treatments are available to humans?There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza).Scientists have found that such treatments “help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff,” the NHS said.Explore more on these topicsBird fluexplainersShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBird flu outbreak confirmed at East Yorkshire poultry farm5d agoBird flu in pheasants in England sparks concern over lax rearing rules17 Oct 2024Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is ‘enormous concern’, says WHO 18 Apr 2024Northumberland’s Farne Islands reopen to visitors after bird flu outbreak27 Mar 2024Avian flu outbreak confirmed at vital seabird colonies in Wales20 Jul 2023Human gene identified that prevents most bird flu viruses moving to people 28 Jun 2023RSPB calls for suspension of game-bird releases over avian flu fears18 May 2023Two poultry workers test positive for bird flu in England16 May 2023‘We feel more prepared’: Farne Islands face another season battling avian flu4 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Suspected cases have also been detected in County Tyrone and County Antrim. Culls of flocks in those two areas were completed earlier this week. They included a commercial flock of 22,100 ducks at Silver Hill Duck in Aughnacloy, and a backyard hobby flock of 30 birds in Broughshane. Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) officials told the committee that two swans were collected from the Waterworks in Belfast last month to confirm the presence of the virus, as part of ongoing surveillance. The strain has also been found in wild birds at West Belfast Lough, Monlough Lough in Carryduff, Hillsborough and the Loughshore in Portadown. 'Native wild birds' Officials said once the virus was confirmed in the Waterworks, it was up to Belfast City Council as the landowner to take decisions about the site. "Daera has responsibility for the control of avian influenza in kept poultry and captive birds," Jim Blee from the department told committee members. "It is unfortunate that the native wild bird population has become affected by these migratory wild birds, but there are a couple of things in that. "It's very hard to predict that happening, and it's also virtually impossible to prevent," he said. "Daera has no statutory role in the control of the virus in wild birds," he added.Belfast park closed due to avian flu outbreakSecond bird cull ordered over suspected avian fluAvian flu confirmed in six wild birds in NIThe Public Health Agency said while the risk to humans from bird flu is very low, people should not handle sick or dead birds. Officials told the committee the 1.8m (3km) protection zone would stay in place around affected sites for 21 days, and the 10km surveillance zone for 30 days. As well as the two zones in place in Northern Ireland, there are four zones in the Republic of Ireland - three in County Monaghan and one in County Cavan. Virus from migratory wild birdsOne in Monaghan and the Cavan zone extend into Northern Ireland, and corresponding zones have been put in place in those areas by the department. A fourth outbreak in the Republic of Ireland was confirmed in a turkey flock in County Cavan. The birds are being culled. It is understood the control zone around the affected premises extends across the border into County Fermanagh, where Daera has put a corresponding zone in place. The virus is present in migratory wild birds, primarily via droppings. Officials urged flock owners to follow strict biosecurity measures to help stop the spread of the virus, by preventing wild birds having contact with kept birds. Asked if any of the detected outbreaks would affect the supply of turkeys, ducks and other poultry for Christmas, officials said much of the Christmas kill had already happened and availability was unlikely to be disrupted.

Experts say it's not too late for Americans to get vaccinated.Adrianna Rodriguez | USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption CDC leader: Flu shot 'doubly important' this yearThe message is clear: Get your flu vaccine. The U.S. is gearing up in case of a bad flu season on top of the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Public health experts pleaded Thursday for Americans to get vaccinated against both. (Oct. 7)APThe U.S. may have dodged a ‘twindemic’ last year, but health experts say the country may not be so lucky this season.While the U.S. continues to report more than 800,000 coronavirus cases per week, flu cases and hospitalizations are also steadily increasing.Flu is back, said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.“We talked about a ‘twindemic’ last year, but I think we’re going to see it now this year because there’s been a relaxation of masks and social distancing," he said. Flu cases haven’t reached pre-pandemic levels yet. But as of Dec. 4, the Walgreens Flu Index reports flu activity is 335% higher nationwide this season compared with last season during the same period.“Several Southern states and markets are showing the most widespread flu activity this season, consistent with trends seen over the last two flu seasons,” said Dr. Kevin Ban, chief medical officer at Walgreens. “This may be due to the increased face-to-face interaction and reduced COVID-19 mitigation measures in certain regions.”Weekly hospitalizations for the flu increased from 288 in the week ending Oct. 30 to nearly 500 in the week ending Nov. 27, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly flu surveillance report. Flu hospitalizations pale in comparison to the 90,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations reported in the last week, but health experts say hospital systems can’t handle any extra stress.Hospitals in 39 states reported more COVID-19 patients than a week earlier, while hospitals in 36 states had more COVID-19 patients in intensive-care beds, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. Health and Human Services data.“Hospital capacity is an issue (and) the addition of influenza this season could portend a real danger in terms of patients being able to receive care in hospitals,” Glatter said. “With flu expected to hit hard, we’re in for a tough winter season.”Health experts are also concerned about the availability of testing supplies, as double the number of people are getting tested for flu this season compared to the 2019-2020 season. In the week ending Nov. 27, the CDC reported more than 43,000 specimens tested for flu. Only about 21,000 specimens were tested during the same week in 2019.The surge in testing is due to dual COVID-19 and flu testing, experts say. With a single swab, people can get tested for the coronavirus as well as influenza A and B. With COVID-19, flu and cold cases rising, more Americans are waking up with the sniffles and getting tested to find out if they need to quarantine.Is it a cold? The flu? Or COVID?: How to tell sniffles and chills apart this holiday seasonScared of the shot?: 9 expert tips to help your child overcome their fear of shots“There is a concern that rising flu rates may result in resource constraints,” said Arvind Kothandaraman, managing director of specialty diagnostics at PerkinElmer, a diagnostics and life sciences company. “Last year, health care systems were overburdened by the pandemic, especially strained by shortage of components needed for infectious disease testing.”While a record number of Americans showed up to get their flu shot in 2020, a recent survey suggests not as many people are getting vaccinated this year.The survey published by SingleCare, a free prescription savings service, found fills for flu vaccine from August to November were 53% lower than fills during the same time frame in 2020.“Whether it’s because people are feeling protected with their COVID vaccine, experiencing vaccine fatigue, or don’t realize they can and should also get their flu shot, the low vaccination rates are concerning,” said Ramzi Yacoub, chief pharmacy officer at SingleCare. “People need to be aware that it remains important to receive annual immunizations from the flu.”As of Nov. 20, about 39% of the U.S. population had gotten this season's flu vaccine, according the CDC.The CDC recommends everyone over the age of 6 months receive an annual flu shot by the end of October,. But health experts say it’s never too late to get vaccinated. "With the holiday season well underway and more people gathering and traveling, flu activity may remain on an upward trajectory in the coming months," Ban said. "This latest data underscores the critical importance of getting vaccinated against the flu as another line of defense to help keep yourself and those around you healthy."Follow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.

Rueda Altez, MDRana F. Hamdy, MD, MPH, MSCEPublicationArticleContemporary PEDS JournalDecember 2021 Volume 38Issue 12 Experts answer pediatricians’ and parents’ top questions about this COVID-19 strain’s impact on children.Since March 2021, when it was first encountered in the United States, the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly; as of November, Delta represents the predominant strain causing COVID-19 in the United States.1 How does this variant differ from others, and how does it affect pediatric patients? The following answers provide a round- up of the currently available information on this strain of the virus.What is the COVID-19 Delta variant? How did it become the predominant variant in the United States?SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is an RNA virus. This type of virus is prone to mutation, especially when it infects a large number of individuals. As we all know, mutations are errors that occur during the process of viral replication: The more opportunities a virus has to replicate, the more chances it has to mutate.2 This is not a unique feature of COVID-19; it also occurs with other viruses, such as the influenza virus.Mutations happen at random, and most have no effect on viral function. Some may even cause the virus to weaken and become less contagious. However, a mutation that confers the ability to be more transmissible can rapidly take over and become the dominant form among susceptible hosts. The Delta variant has multiple mutations, which are thought to make this variant more transmissible and prone to avoid the human immune system.3How does the epidemiology of the Delta variant differ from that of prior strains of SARS-CoV-2?After the introduction of the vaccines, incidence of COVID-19 in the United States steadily decreased among all age groups. In children, the weekly Average incidence rates in early June 2021, the lowest of the year, were 1.7, 1.9, and 2.9 per 100,000 persons for 0 to 4, 5 to 11, and 12 to 17 years, respectively. As the Delta variant rose to dominance in July 2021, a rapid incidence increase was observed, reaching rates as high as 16.2, 28.5, and 32.7 per 100,000 persons for the 3 respective age groups by August 2021.4 Other factors that could have contributed to this peak include relaxation of masking mandates and physical distancing, as well as school openings.Is the COVID-19 Delta variant more transmissible in children? How about in vaccinated children?The Delta variant is more than twice as transmissible as the original COVID-19 strain and 40% to 60% more than the Alpha variant.2 Unvaccinated individuals of all ages are at increased risk of contracting the Delta variant.Vaccinated individuals can become infected with COVID-19. Also known as breakthrough infections, these cases have been more frequently observed since the Delta variant surge. Because these individuals are contagious, it is important to follow isolation precautions.1,3 Thankfully, vaccination effectively reduces the overall risk of infection with COVID-19 by 6-fold.5Does the Delta variant cause more severe disease in children?The increase in transmissibility and rising number of hospitalizations led to the concern that children were getting sicker. To determine if higher rates of severe disease were observed, a Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network team looked at pediatric hospitalization data before (March 1, 2020, to June 19, 2021) and after (June 20 to July 31, 2021) Delta became the predominant strain. The authors found no significant difference in intensive care admission, highest level of respiratory support, or mortality between the 2 periods.6 These data provide reassurance that although the Delta variant led to a larger number of infected children, the severity of disease is not greater compared with that of other variants. Data need to be further updated with subsequent reports including the latest surveillance information to determine other important potential complications in children, such as the incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or persistent post–COVID-19 symptoms, better known as “long COVID.”How can we protect children from the Delta variant?Vaccination is effective in preventing COVID-19 infection, especially the more severe manifestations. With the Delta variant, new cases of infection were observed in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that one of the current available vaccines (BNT162b2; Pfizer/BioNTech) has slightly lower effectiveness against the Delta variant compared with the Alpha variant (88% vs 93.7%, respectively).7 A subsequent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that the Moderna vaccine’s efficacy was 92% in adults during the Delta variant surge.8 Findings of a study evaluating the trends in COVID-19–related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations since the Delta variant surge showed that ED visits and hospitalizations were more than 3 times higher in US states with the lowest vaccination coverage (< 50%) compared with those with the highest coverage (> 70%). This effect was seen even in children younger than 12 years, showing that immunizing eligible individuals in the community provides protection to the youngest. At the time this article was drafted, the US Food and Drug Administration had recently approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in children aged 5 to 11 years old and is currently being evaluated by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for further recommendations to the general public.9Our health authorities continue to recommend masking and social distancing in addition to vaccination. Findings of a comparison study of Arizona schools (kindergarten through grade 12) with variable mask policies from July to August 2021 showed that those with no mask requirement had 3.5 higher odds of a school-associated COVID-19 outbreak compared with schools that had required masking since the beginning of the school year.10 Similar results were observed in a larger study including 520 school districts across the United States.11 These studies show that a multilayered approach is still needed to stop the transmission of COVID-19.Are there any additional variants that we should be concerned about? How about other emerging infections?Public health networks and national authorities are constantly monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) closely follows the emergence and progression of new variants that emerge globally and the CDC monitors these variants’ threat to the United States. Any variant shown to have genetic changes that might pose a future risk but without clear evidence of impact is labeled by the WHO as “variants under monitoring” and enhanced monitoring and assessments are undertaken to actively seek new evidence about potential impact. At least 15 such variants have been identified worldwide, most recently the B.1.630 variant identified first in the Dominican Republic in October 2021. If an identified variant has mutations that provide a higher transmissibility, immune escape, or severity of disease, and has shown at a community level to have increasing transmission and relative prevalence, it is categorized as a “variant of interest” (VOI), which for the WHO currently includes the Lambda and Mu variants. Given their limited prevalence and expansion within the US, they are not considered VOI by the CDC. The most concerning variants are labeled by the WHO as “variants of concern (VOC)”, which are those that have been proven to have a significant impact in global public health. This group currently includes the Delta variant, in addition to other previously described variants like Alpha (first identified in the United Kingdom), Beta (first identified in South Africa), and Gamma (first identified in Brazil).12 Within the United States, the Delta variant has been considered a VOC since July 2020. In contrast, given their declining prevalence, Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants are considered “variants being monitored” as of September 2021 by the CDC.2There are also an increasing number of subvariants—descendent lineages from each variant—being identified and closely monitored. “Delta plus”, formally known as AY.4.2, is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant that has additional mutations, including 2 in the spike protein region. The WHO has reported an increasing number of viral isolates identified as AY.4.2 predominantly in the United Kingdom, but distributed across 42 countries including the United States.13 More information is needed to determine the potential impact of this subvariant.In addition to SARS-CoV-2, there are reports of a surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza type A (H5N6) in China. H5N6, first described in 2014, is a zoonotic infection transmitted by infected birds that can cause severe disease in humans. Only 52 cases of H5N6 have been diagnosed since 2014, but, alarmingly, 25 of these occurred during 2021. In addition, the first case outside of China was identified this year, in Laos. The CDC has conducted a risk assessment of the pandemic potential of this infection and has determined that, to date, the risk for human-to-human transmission is low.15 The WHO is monitoring H5N6, as well as other avian influenza viruses.16SummaryThe Delta variant is the current predominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States and has demonstrated increased transmissibility when compared with prior variants. The most current data have not shown an increase in severity of COVID-19 infections among pediatric patients. Pediatricians should continue to spread awareness of the risks of COVID-19 infection and the known measures for prevention. Vaccination, social distancing, and masking continue to be our greatest tools to protect both children and adults.References1. Delta variant: what we know about the science.

Like many virus specialists at the time, he predicted that the new pathogen would not be eradicated. Rather, it would become endemic — the fifth coronavirus to permanently establish itself in humans, alongside four ‘seasonal’ coronaviruses that cause relatively mild colds and have been circulating in humans for decades or more.

The Sapienza University of Rome conducted a study with 1200 patients hospitalised due to pneumonia. Of these patients, 700 were men and 500 were women. They were all over 60 years of age. Follow-up was carried out thirty days after hospitalisation due to infection. 32% of patients experienced some type of cardiovascular complication, such as heart failure (24%), atrial fibrillation (9%) or myocardial infarction (8 %). The increase in risk of myocardial infarction in the short and long term was more evident when the pneumonia was more severe. This shows that not only does pneumonia affect the lungs, but in severe cases it can be systemic, affecting other organs. A multicentre study conducted in Spain reported that cardiac complications are more common in pneumonia caused by pneumococcus (one type of bacteria that causes the disease). Additionally, age, smoking, chronic heart disease and initial severity of pneumonia are risk factors for early (30 days after admission) and late (one year after admission) cardiac complications. Possible mechanisms have been described based on animal models to explain the cardiac complications stemming from pneumonia. On the one hand, pneumococcus causes lesions in the heart muscle by means of pneumolysin, a toxin produced by this bacterium. This toxin can also directly cause the death of cardiac myocytes. On the other hand, cardiac damage (for example myocardial infarction) is mainly caused by decreased blood flow to the body's tissues, which is caused by coronary artery closure related to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. This plaque contains inflammatory cells such as platelets, which accumulate after an infectious stimulus. Pneumococcus has been linked to the activation and hyperactivity of these platelets. In the case of influenza virus, studies show that cardiac complications can occur due to direct effects of the virus on the myocardium (the cardiac muscle) or due to an exacerbation of existing heart disease. This link between infection and heart disease makes vaccination all the more important, in the case of both pneumonia and influenza. Studies have shown 36% less risk of a cardiovascular event among adults who had received the influenza vaccine, compared to those who did not. This percentage was higher in people diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Like influenza, pneumonia is an illness that affects a large part of the world's population and can be serious. The demonstrable link between infection and heart disease should be useful for the treatment of these infections, to encourage vaccination and design or test potential drugs to reduce the risk of developing heart disease.

Although overall flu activity remains low, positive cases in Missouri are picking up. Flu vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, including children age 5 and under, adults older than 65, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease. “We know flu season typically peaks in the month of February, so there’s still time to benefit from vaccination,” said Donald Kauerauf, DHSS Director. “Although last winter’s flu season was very low in activity, it’s important to remember that our immunity from the flu decreases over time. That means many people may have reduced immunity to flu this season and it is incredibly important this year for you and your family to take the step to get vaccinated for the flu.” Flu viruses are constantly changing and protection from vaccination decreases over time, so getting a flu vaccine every year is the best way to prevent flu. ​As we celebrate this holiday season, DHSS and other public health experts are concerned about the potential for reduced immunity in people who are already at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, especially those with the chronic health conditions listed above. In past flu seasons, 9 out of 10 adults hospitalized for flu had at least one underlying medical condition. Flu can be very serious. Nearly every year in the United States, millions of people get the flu, hundreds of thousands are hospitalized, and thousands die from flu-related illnesses. The most common symptoms of flu are fever, cough, and sore throat. Symptoms can also include body aches, headaches, chills, runny nose and fatigue. Nationally and in Missouri, flu activity during the 2020-2021 season was very low, likely because of COVID-19 prevention measures. In the first eight weeks of surveillance for the 2021-2022 flu season, Missouri has reported 853 positive influenza cases (597 influenza A, 242 influenza B, and 14 untyped) and one death using data collected through Nov. 27, 2021. Missouri’s flu trends remain consistent with what is being reported nationally: influenza activity remains low, with a slight increase in the number of cases reported compared to previous weeks. To see Missouri’s weekly influenza reports, click here. The purpose of NIVW, celebrated Dec. 5-11, 2021, is to remind individuals of the importance of getting their influenza vaccine before the holiday. NIVW is a call to all Americans 6 months and older to get their annual flu vaccine if they have not already. Flu remains a significant public health concern, but there is still time to get a flu vaccine – the only vaccine that protects against flu – to prevent flu illness and potentially serious complications. Additionally, a COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine can be given at the same time. Contact your healthcare provider, or find a location near you for either vaccine at Vaccines.gov.

Amar Mehta News reporter @Amarjournalist_ Thursday 9 December 2021 13:54, UK Image: Bird flu has been detected in captive birds and wild birds at multiple sites in the UK. File pic Why you can trust Sky News The UK is experiencing its largest ever outbreak of avian flu, Environment Secretary George Eustice has warned.Thousands of farming birds have been culled across the country and an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared 3 November before being extended on 29 November, with the added requirement all captive birds had to be kept indoors, amid concerns that wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter are carrying the disease. There are 40 infected premises in the UK, 33 in England, with around half a million birds culled so far, according to UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss, who warned there is a "phenomenal level" of bird flu, which has "huge human, animal and trade implications".The risk to human health from the bird flu remains very low, according to public health advice, and there is a low food safety risk. Image: George Eustice warned that levels of bird flu are at the highest level ever seen Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, George Eustice said: "I have to say this year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza with 36 confirmed cases. "We have put in place an avian influenza prevention zone that came into force on 3 November in England and 17 November in Northern Ireland, and an additional housing order was introduced on 29 November."Conservative MP Scott Benton told MPs that 15 swans died last month following an outbreak in Blackpool's Stanley Park.

Dr Middlemiss said the disease is spreading through migratory birds flying from northern Russia and eastern Europe, but further research is needed to prevent a worsening outbreak in the future."We can't wait until another year and have an even bigger outbreak. So, we will be working not just with our own scientists but internationally, to understand more of what we can do about what's behind it," Dr Middlemiss said.

The Alappuzha district was put on alert on Thursday after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at Kunnumma South (ward 10) in Thakazhy grama panchayat.District Collector A. Alexander said the presence of H5N1 subtype of the Influenza A virus was reported in ducks.Joseph Cherian, a duck farmer from Purakkad who was raising around 13,500 ducks close to the outer bund of a paddy field in Thakazhy, with an eye on the Christmas festive season, lost more than 10,000 birds in the past two weeks. Following the mass death of ducks, the Animal Husbandry Department (AHD) last week sent samples of dead birds to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), Bhopal for analyses, which tested positive for avian influenza.Mr. Alexander, who chaired a meeting to take stock of the situation, said that measures had been initiated to check the spread of the disease. Rapid responseAHD officials said that between 8,000 and 10,000 ducks belonging to five farmers within a 1-km radius of the infected area were culled by rapid response teams as part of the containment measures. The carcasses of the culled birds were disposed of as per the standard operating procedure.The District Collector has issued an order banning movement and sale of duck, chicken quail, and other domestic birds, their egg, meat and waste (manure) in 12 local bodies (within 9 km radius of the hotspot) of Champakulam, Nedumudi, Muttar, Edathua, Veeyapuram, Karuvatta, Thrikkunnappuzha, Thakazhy, Purakkad, Ambalappuzha South, Ambalappuzha North, and Haripad municipality.Besides, the place in ward 10 of Thakazhy grama panchayat where the disease was confirmed has been declared a containment zone. The movement of people and vehicles to and from the place has been banned.Mr. Alexander directed the assistant conservator of forests to monitor migratory birds for avian influenza.Apart from Thakazhy, duck mortality has also been reported from Nedumudi in Alappuzha, Vechoor and Kallara in the Kottayam district in recent days. The AHD has sent samples from these places for analyses but is yet to receive the test results.Second time this yearIt is the second time in less than a year bird was confirmed in the region. Earlier this year, avian flu caused by the H5N8 strain of the Influenza A virus was detected from six places in Kuttanad at Nedumudi, Thakazhy, Pallippad, Karuvatta, and Kainakary in Alappuzha district and Neendoor in Kottayam district.More than 80,000 birds, mostly ducks, died or were culled in the two districts due to the outbreak. It was the third outbreak of avian influenza reported in the region in the last seven years. In 2014, thousands of ducks had perished or were culled following a highly infectious bird flu outbreak caused by H5N1 virus. In 2016, avian influenza caused by the H5N8 virus was detected among ducks in Kuttanad.

trustNewsSportWeatherServicesPodcastsBusinessPoliticsNews from the IslandsTravelEducationVoicesCoronavirusCampaignsFeaturesMore CloseNewsSportWeatherServicesPodcastsJobsPropertyMotoringBiSiFamily NoticesPicture StorePride Of GuernseyDigital EditionsNewslettersConcern over growing spread in ‘largest ever’ bird flu outbreakAround half a million birds have been culled so far, according to the UK chief veterinary officer.Published Dec 9, 2021Concern is growing among conservationists and nature lovers as the UK’s “largest ever” bird flu outbreak continues to grow.The RSPB said High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is affecting a range of poultry operations across the UK.Wild bird species involved are mostly geese, ducks and swans, but a number of birds of prey have also been confirmed to have died.Around half a million birds have been culled so far, according to UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss, who said there are 40 infected premises in the UK – 38 in Great Britain including 33 in England.The risk to human health from avian influenza remains very low, according to public health advice, and there is a low food safety risk.Speaking in the House of Commons, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: “Each year the UK faces a seasonal risk in incursion of avian influenza associated with migratory wild birds.“While we have that each year, I have to say this year we are now seeing the largest-ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza with 36 confirmed cases.”Defra confirmed the most up to date figure is 40 – 33 in England, three in Wales, two in Scotland and two in Northern Ireland.Dr Middlemiss told the BBC the “phenomenal level” of bird flu has “huge human, animal and trade implications”.Environment Secretary George Eustice said the outbreak was already the largest ever seen in the UK, before the latest cases (Aaron Chown/PA)The vet warned the UK is only a few weeks into a migratory season that goes on until March.“We are going to need to keep up these levels of heightened biosecurity for all that time,” she said.The protection zone means that in addition to keeping birds and poultry housed, keepers must continue to take precautions such as regularly cleaning and disinfecting clothing, equipment and vehicles and limiting access to non-essential workers and visitors.Defra has said the new housing measures will be kept under regular review.Dr Middlemiss said she is “very concerned” about bird flu, and that having 40 infected premises is “a really high number for the time of year”.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that around half a million birds have had to be culled.“I know that sounds a huge number, and of course for those keepers affected it’s really devastating.“But in terms of food supply impact it’s actually relatively a very small number in terms of egg supply, meat, chicken and so on.”She said they are continuing to get new detections, adding she confirmed another two on Wednesday night.Dr Middlemiss said people who keep chickens and want to feed wild birds need to make sure everything is kept “scrupulously clean” and “absolutely separate” to avoid infecting their own flocks.She said there is an ongoing background risk of bird flu every year, adding that previously there would have been a reasonably sized outbreak followed by two or three quiet years.“But that’s not happening,” she told the Today programme, adding this is being seen across Europe, with outbreaks last year and some over the summer.“And now we’ve got this massive increase with the migratory wild birds, and absolutely it’s something we need to understand better about why we are getting these ongoing infections every year,” Dr Middlemiss said.Another RSPB spokesperson said: “Everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands.”The bird flu outbreak is not expected to have any impact on the supplies of turkeys or other birds over Christmas.NFU chief poultry adviser Aimee Mahony said it was a “challenging” time for all bird owners.“Vigilance is key and poultry farmers are doing all they can to ensure the continued health of their flocks, and that their welfare needs are being met,” she said.“We are relying on all bird keepers, whether they have a small backyard flock or a commercial business, to follow the enhanced biosecurity and housing measures implemented by the chief veterinary officer to help prevent further disease outbreaks.”British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said they did not expect there to be an effect on overall production “but we, as ever, urge all poultry keepers across the country to remain vigilant and look out for signs of the disease in your birds or bird”.The British Hen Welfare Trust said it was committed – within legal guidelines and following strict biosecurity procedures – to collecting one more small flock of birds.A spokesperson added: “However, there will be no further rehoming activity with effect from December 12 until the AI (Avian Influenza) situation improves.“When it is safe to recommence our lifesaving rehoming work, we will be up and running immediately.”A spokesperson for Ilchester Estates, the landowner of Abbotsbury Swannery, near Weymouth in Dorset and the Fleet lagoon, said bird flu has been confirmed in “a number of birds”.They said any dead birds found on the reserve during their daily monitoring will be collected and sent for testing.Abbotsbury Swannery is closed to the public as usual for winter and is due to reopen in spring.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the papers say –

It is often fatal in birds.Some of the clinical signs of HPAI in birds include sudden and rapid increase in the number of birds found dead, several birds affected in the same shed or air space, a swollen head, closed and excessively watery eyes, head and body tremoring, drooping of the wings and/or dragging of legs, twisting of the head and neck and swelling and blue discolouration of comb and wattles.Chickens at Leicestershire-based egg producer Sunrise Poultry Farms playing with a football while they are stuck indoors during the bird flu lockdown (Sunrise Poultry Farms Limited/PA)– What measures are in place?An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared across the UK on November 3 before being extended on November 29 with the added requirement all captive birds have to be kept indoors.Defra said poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from a vet if they have any concerns.– What is the risk to the public?The risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, Defra said.People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that they find and instead report them to the relevant helpline.Swans with their cygnets in Bushy Park in London in May (John Walton/PA)– Is it still okay to feed birds in your garden?The RSPB said everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, and also recommended “regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands”.UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said people who keep chickens and want to feed wild birds need to make sure everything is kept “scrupulously clean” and “absolutely separate” to avoid infecting their own flocks.– What should you do if you see a sick or injured bird?The RSPB said if people find any dead waterfowl, any gulls or birds of prey or five or more of any other species in one place, they should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 335577 or in Northern Ireland to DAERA on 0300 200 7840.– Will the outbreak have any impact on the availability of turkeys at Christmas?Supplies of turkeys or other birds over Christmas are not expected to be affected by the outbreak.More than 15 million turkeys are produced in the UK every year so the number in relative terms that are affected is very small and it is unlikely to affect the overall supply of Christmas turkeys.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the papers say – November 11UK News|3 hours agoGovernment says it will not allow events to be ‘hijacked’ by antisemitismUK News|3 hours agoStarmer and Macron to discuss Ukraine ahead of Armistice commemorationsUK News|7 hours agoSFA chief tells of emergency eyecare surgery before key Euros matchUK News|7 hours agoDrivers handed £4.1m Dartford Crossing fines by mistakeUK News|7 hours agoMost popular1Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|19 hours ago2GST heading your way for 2027News|Nov 83‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|Just now4Queens Road Medical Practice opens at new site on MondayNews|Nov 95St James grateful but future is still uncertainNews|Nov 9Follow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press. All rights reserved.BioNTech vaccine available at eight private healthcare institutions starting today (with photos) Go to main content Brand HK | Font Size: | Sitemap BioNTech vaccine available at eight private healthcare institutions starting today (with photos) BioNTech vaccine available at eight private healthcare institutions starting today (with photos) ****************************************************************************************** Members of the public, starting from today (December 6), can make appointments to receive the BioNTech vaccine at 24 vaccination venues of the eight private healthcare institutions that have enrolled in the BioNTech vaccination pilot scheme. The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Patrick Nip, visited one of the participating clinics to view its arrangements in the provision of BioNTech and Sinovac vaccination services at different floors today. He also spoke with the clinic's operator and members of the public who got vaccinated at the clinic to know more about their views towards the scheme. The Government launched the pilot scheme for members of the public to receive the BioNTech vaccine at eight private healthcare institutions with a view to further facilitating vaccination by expanding the vaccination network of the BioNTech vaccine and providing more channels for vaccination. In addition, members of the public can receive the Sinovac vaccine from private doctors and clinics participating in the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme. They can make appointments with the relevant private healthcare institutions and clinics directly without going through the Government's website. Information on enquiry hotlines and vaccination venues is available at the thematic website of the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme (www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/en/programme). Mr Nip said the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme is now providing the vaccination service through a variety of vaccination venues, and the launch of non-governmental venues providing vaccination service using the BioNTech vaccine is an example. Getting vaccinated with either the Sinovac vaccine or the BioNTech vaccine at the private clinics under the programme is free of charge. Other vaccination venues include 11 COVID-19 Vaccination Stations at public hospitals, a vaccination vehicle operated as a mobile vaccination station, designated clinics under the Hospital Authority and 21 Community Vaccination Centres. Mr Nip appealed to members of the public to get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves against the threat posed by mutant strains. A high vaccination rate can especially protect elderly persons to reduce the risk of falling seriously ill and dying should one be infected, reduce the risk of a community outbreak and help avoid frequent suspensions if quarantine-free travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong is resumed. The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases under the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health and the expert advisory panel highly recommend elderly persons to receive COVID-19 vaccination, pointing out that all elderly persons who have previously received influenza vaccines can safely receive COVID-19 vaccines. Elderly persons or residents with chronic illnesses should receive COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible as long as they are not suffering from acute illnesses. Before making an appointment, members of the public should take note of a minimum interval of 14 days between COVID-19 vaccination and any other vaccination (including seasonal influenza vaccination).
