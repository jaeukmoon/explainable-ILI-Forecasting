By the end of 2021, 2.3.4.4b viruses were detected in North America, signifying further intercontinental spread. Here we show that the western movement of clade 2.3.4.4b was quickly followed by reassortment with viruses circulating in wild birds in North America, resulting in the acquisition of different combinations of ribonucleoprotein genes. These reassortant A(H5N1) viruses are genotypically and phenotypically diverse, with many causing severe disease with dramatic neurologic involvement in mammals. The proclivity of the current A(H5N1) 2.3.4.4b virus lineage to reassort and target the central nervous system warrants concerted planning to combat the spread and evolution of the virus within the continent and to mitigate the impact of a potential influenza pandemic that could originate from similar A(H5N1) reassortants.

Over time, viruses of the GsGD H5-lineage have evolved into several transient, phylogenetically distinct hemagglutinin (HA) clades2. Genotype turnover driven by virus reassortment has generally occurred only sporadically, but such events occurred with increased frequency among clade 2.3.4.4 yielding A(H5Nx) viruses possessing different neuraminidases (NA), most commonly N1, N6, or N8. Although geographic spread of GsGD H5-lineages is dynamic, clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have consistently expanded since 2020. In the 4 months prior to February 2022, 30 countries or territories across Asia, Europe, and Africa reported the detection of viruses of this clade in birds3. Most of these 2.3.4.4b outbreaks had been caused by A(H5N1) viruses, with the noticeable exception of the outbreaks of A(H5N6) in China which have been associated with human infections. Of note, A(H5N6) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4h had been the previously predominant clade in poultry in China and had also caused human infections4.In December 2021, A(H5N1) viruses were detected in poultry and a gull in Eastern Canada. The virus responsible was closely related to 2.3.4.4b viruses identified in Europe in the spring of that year5. This was only the second time that a GsGD H5-lineage virus was detected in birds in the Americas; the first such occurrence was in 2014, when the infected birds had crossed the Bering Strait and entered the Pacific flyway. After the initial 2021 detection in Newfoundland, infected wild birds were reported in the U.S. south atlantic states6 and in several other U.S. regions soon thereafter. The purpose of this study was to understand the course of the genetic and phenotypic evolution of the 2.3.4.4b viruses as they spread throughout North America (NAm). We demonstrate that westward intercontinental 2.3.4.4b expansion resulted in reassortment with NAm wild bird viruses yielding reassortants with diverse ribonucleoprotein gene mixtures. The resulting viruses have distinct in vitro phenotypes including increased virus replication rates and pH of activation, but most concerningly, they cause severe disease outcomes with dramatic neurologic involvement in mammalian animal models.ResultsVirus pathogenesis and transmission in chickens and ferretsWe first conducted a risk assessment to determine the pathogenic and transmission properties of two early isolates in birds and mammals; A/American wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021 (Wigeon/SC/21) and A/bald eagle/Florida/W22-134-OP/2022 (Eagle/FL/22) were collected in December 2021 and February 2022, respectively (Table 1). White leghorn chickens and ferrets were initially used, both of which are susceptible to a variety of influenza viruses and are critical animal models among influenza risk assessment pipelines (IRAT, TIPRA)7, 8. Both chicken-to-chicken and chicken-to-ferret transmission were examined. Naïve chickens were placed in the same cage as inoculated birds, and ferrets were housed in a separate cage 12 inches away from inoculated chickens (Supplementary Fig 1A). Both viruses replicated robustly in inoculated chickens but transmitted inefficiently to naïve contact chickens (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Chickens (n = 3 per virus) directly inoculated with either Wigeon/SC/21 or Eagle/FL/22 died within 48 h post-inoculation (hpi). Two of twelve contact chickens paired with Wigeon/SC/21 inoculated chickens shed virus and met euthanasia endpoints at 4 or 7 dpi, while two additional non-shedding contacts died at 4 or 10 dpi. Three of twelve contact chickens paired with Eagle/FL/22 inoculated chickens shed virus and met euthanasia endpoints 3- 4 days post-inoculation (dpi); virus was transiently detected in a fourth bird which survived (Supplementary Fig. 1B). No aerosol transmission was detected from infected chickens to naïve ferrets (Supplementary Fig. 1C), suggesting that the risk of transmission at the avian-mammalian interface remains low. We next assessed ferret-to-ferret contact transmission by placing inoculated ferrets in the same cage as naive ferrets. Neither virus transmitted from inoculated ferrets to naïve direct-contact ferrets (Fig. 1A, and Supplementary Table 4). Surprisingly, there were dramatic differences in disease severity among directly inoculated ferrets between the two viruses. Consistent with a recent report9, Wigeon/SC/21 infection resulted in mild disease and the ferrets survived (Fig. 1B). Only one of three Wigeon/SC/21 inoculated ferrets exhibited weight loss (Fig. 1C), and upper respiratory tract virus shedding was detected until 5 or 7 (n = 1 ferret) dpi (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Eagle/FL/22 inoculation resulted in rapid weight loss (Fig. 1C), lethargy, and severe neurologic symptoms, including ataxia and hindlimb paralysis (Supplementary Table 4). By 7 dpi, all Eagle/FL/22 inoculated ferrets reached humane endpoints (Fig. 1B).Table 1 North American HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses used in this studyFull size tableFig. 1: Pathogenicity of North American HPAI Influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22 viruses in ferrets.A Experimental design of ferret pathogenesis and transmission. At 0 dpi, ferrets (n = 9 per virus) were inoculated with 106 EID50 units of A(H5N1) virus. Three inoculated ferrets were individually co-housed with 3 naïve contact ferrets beginning 1 dpi. Clinical course of infection was monitored, and nasal wash samples were taken at indicated time points from both inoculated and contact ferrets. The remaining inoculated ferrets were euthanized at 3 dpi and 5 dpi (n = 3 per time point per virus) for viral titration in tissues.

P values for viral titers were calculated using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison post hoc test. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageThe differential pathogenicity of the two viruses was reflected in the higher mean nasal wash titers at 1, 3, and 5 dpi for Eagle/FL/22 (4.2 to 5.2 log10 TCID50/mL) than for Wigeon/SC/21 (1.7 to 3.4 log10 TCID50/mL) (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1D). Eagle/FL/22 inoculated ferrets also had higher viral loads in turbinate, tracheal, and lung samples (P ≤ 0.001), and virus was observed in brain tissues at 3 dpi (mean titer, 6.2 log10 TCID50/g) and 5 dpi (mean titer, 8.2 log10 TCID50/g) (Fig. 1E). In contrast, Wigeon/SC/21 inoculation led to virus being detected primarily in turbinate and tracheal tissues, trace amounts in the lung at 5 dpi only, and no virus detected in brain tissues (Fig. 1E).Genotypic and antigenic analyses of clade 2.3.4.4b virusesTo begin to understand molecular determinants contributing to the higher virulence of Eagle/FL/22, sequence analysis was performed on A(H5N1) wild bird viruses from this outbreak, which included Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22. These data revealed that reassortment event(s) among H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses and NAm wild bird influenza viruses had occurred soon after introduction of the A(H5N1) viruses into NAm (Fig. 2). Whereas Wigeon/SC/21 had the same genotype as the first viruses detected in Canada and those detected in Europe in the spring of 2021, Eagle/FL/22 had undergone reassortment, and acquired NAm wild bird-lineage polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2: Genotypic diversity among North American HPAI Influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses.A Genotypic diversity of 58 A(H5N1) viruses (some sequences generated directly from clinical material).

Nodes on the PB2 tree represent A(H5N1) viruses and representatives of other subtypes. Asterisks (*) indicate viruses that were used in subsequent experiments.Full size imageIn total, we identified four different viral genotypes among the 58 A(H5N1) viruses sequenced in this study (Fig. 2B). All viruses maintained the parental Eurasian-origin (EA) HA, NA, matrix (M), and nonstructural (NS) gene segments, but they had different combinations of polymerase and NP gene segments of either EA or NAm origin. In all cases except for PB2, for which two phylogenetically distinct genes were detected (Fig. 2A), the NAm gene segments were monophyletic, suggesting that a single or minimal number of reassortment events had occurred, with the resulting viruses spreading geographically. The NAm-lineage proteins of A(H5N1) viruses had no markers associated with increased virulence in mammalian hosts10, 11, and all viruses remained antigenically homogeneous, as determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays (Supplementary Table 1).Pathotyping of additional clade 2.3.4.4b viruses in ferretsTo further assess if virulence was linked to acquisition of NAm gene segments, we used the ferret model to pathotype four additional A(H5N1) viruses of genotypic diversity represented later in the outbreak period (Fig. 3A). These viruses were A/Fancy Chicken/Newfoundland/FAV-0033/2021 (Ck/NL/21; native EA constellation; with the same genotype as Wigeon/SC/21); A/Red-shouldered hawk/North Carolina/W22-121/2022 (Hawk/NC/22; with the same genotype as Eagle/FL/22); A/Lesser scaup/Georgia/W22-145E/2022 (Scaup/GA/22), with PB2, PB1, polymerase acidic (PA), and NP of NAm wild bird-lineage; and A/Bald eagle/North Carolina/W22-140/2022 (Eagle/NC/22), with PB2 and NP of NAm wild bird-lineage (Table 1). In general, the number of NAm gene segments acquired was strongly associated with disease severity in ferrets including degree of weight loss and the number of animals that ultimately succumbed to disease (Fig. 3B, C), with the least number of clinical signs and mortality observed with Ck/NL/21, which has no NAm genes, and the most significant signs and high mortality observed with Scaup/GA/22, which possesses four NAm genes (Fig. 3B, C, Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, and Supplementary Table 4). This trend extended to viral replication in tissues. Peak mean nasal wash titers were 2.9, 3.8, 5.4, and 6.0 log10 TCID50/mL for Ck/NL/21, Eagle/NC/22, Hawk/NC/22, and Scaup/GA/22 viruses, respectively (Fig. 3D). All EA/NAm viruses were detected in multiple organs confirming systemic viral spread, while the native constellation virus Ck/NL/21 had very low or trace amounts of virus outside the respiratory tract (Fig. 3E). Additionally, infection with the EA/NAm viruses resulted in higher temperature increases than Ck/NL/21 along with respiratory and neurologic symptoms (Supplementary Table 4).Fig. 3: Impact of different detected genotypes of North American HPAI Influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses on pathogenicity in ferrets.A Experimental design of ferret pathogenesis and transmission. At 0 dpi, ferrets (n = 9 per virus) were inoculated with 106 EID50 units of A(H5N1) virus. Clinical course of infection was monitored, and nasal wash samples were taken at the indicated time points. Ferrets (n = 3 per virus per analysis) were euthanized at 5 dpi for viral titration in tissues and pathology (Supplementary Figs. 3–5).

The most virulent virus, Scaup/GA/22, produced severe necrotizing lesions throughout the URT (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) and LRT (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B) that correlated with robust viral antigen staining. Histopathology was less severe in ferrets infected with Hawk/NC/22, which produced fewer necrotizing lesions, limited multifocal clusters of neuroepithelium in URT (Supplementary Fig. 3C, D) and well demarcated LRT lesions (Supplementary Fig. 4C, D), corresponding to less extensive viral antigen staining. Abundant antigen staining was observed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) of ferrets inoculated with Scaup/GA/22 (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B), whereas antigen staining for Hawk/NC/22 was limited to the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex of inoculated ferrets (Supplementary Fig. 5C, D). Eagle/NC/22 produced even less severe histopathology, with only a few small foci of virus-positive cells being observed in the URT olfactory neuroepithelium and no lesions or virus antigen staining extending into the LRT (Supplementary Fig. 3E, F, and Supplementary Fig. 4E, F). Finally, in ferrets inoculated with Ck/NL/21, both the URT and LRT respiratory epithelia were devoid of lesions or cells staining for viral antigen, except for a single small focus of virus antigen-positive cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium (Supplementary Fig. 3G, H, and Supplementary Fig. 4G, H).Virus Pathogenesis in the mouse modelTo investigate whether the pathogenicity and virulence in ferrets was mirrored in other influenza mammalian models, we inoculated BALB/c mice with each virus. Viruses that caused 100% lethality in ferrets and those that had acquired increasing numbers of NAm gene segments, including Scaup/GA/22, Eagle/FL/22, and Hawk/NC/22, had the lowest 50% lethal doses (LD50s) in mice (i.e., less virus was required for lethality) at 3.8, 2.2, and 4.6 log10 EID50/mL, respectively. Additionally, these viruses induced neurologic symptoms in mice, along with weight loss and virus replication in the lungs and brains. Viruses causing moderate or no lethality in ferrets, including Eagle/NC/2, Ck/NL/21, and Wigeon/SC/21, had the highest mouse LD50s at >6 log10 EID50/mL (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7).Phenotypic properties of clade 2.3.4.4b virusesSeveral influenza virus characteristics are known to contribute towards mammalian infection and spread, including receptor binding properties, pH of HA activation, and polymerase activity12,13,14,15,16,17. Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22 bound strongly to sialic acid receptors with a 3′SLN linkage to the underlying sugar (preferred by avian viruses), but poorly to 6′SLN-linked sialic acid receptors (preferred by human viruses) (Fig. 4A, B). The pH of HA activation and inactivation segregates with host adaptation17, and the pH of HA activation for A(H5N1) viruses in avian species is 5.6–6.012. Consistent with this, both Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22 had a relatively high pH of HA activation of 5.8 by syncytium assay (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 7). These values were slightly higher than the pH of HA activation of the control human virus A/California/04/2009 (CA/04) (H1N1)pdm09 (pH 5.6) and substantially higher than the pH of HA activation of most human-adapted influenza viruses14. In contrast, Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22 had virus inactivation pH values of 4.4, substantially lower than that of the CA/04 (H1N1)pdm09 virus (pH 5.4) (Fig. 4C). A virus inactivation pH that is lower than the HA activation pH is rare but has been observed with some swine H1 and H3 isolates and a bat A(H9N2) isolate18. The polymerase activities of Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22 were not statistically different when measured in the reporter gene assay with transiently expressed proteins (Fig. 4D). However, we detected differences in the replication rates of whole virus in non-differentiated Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4E) and primary differentiated human airway cultures (Fig. 4F). At 48 hpi, cell cultures inoculated with viruses that had the most NAm gene segments (Scaup/GA/22, Eagle/FL/22, and Hawk/NC/22) had the highest viral loads, followed by those inoculated with Eagle/NC/22, and then those inoculated with viruses containing no NAm gene segments (Ck/NL/21 and Wigeon/SC/21). Additionally, at 72 hpi, differentiated human airway cultures infected with Scaup/GA/22 and Eagle/FL/22 exhibited higher viral loads as compared to a representative seasonally circulating rg-A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2) virus (Fig. 4F) (P ≤ 0.001). In contrast, Widgeon/SC/21 titers trended lower, while CK/NL/21 titers were statistically lower than rg-A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2) (P = 0.001).Fig. 4: Phenotypic properties of North American HPAI Influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses.A, B Solid-phase binding of A(H5N1) viruses to biotinylated sialylglycopolymers A 3’-SialLacNAc-PAA-biotin (3’-SLN) or B 6’-SialLacNAc-PAA-biotin (6’-SLN), representing galactose-linked sialic acids α2,3-SA (the avian virus preferred receptor) and α2,6-SA (the human virus preferred receptor), respectively.

Using a set of 48 human serum samples obtained from blood donors aged 18 to 46 years, we examined the presence of such cross-reactive antibodies. As expected, there were generally no significant neutralizing titers (serum dilution >1:20) to H5 HA protein (Fig. 4G). In contrast, an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) targeting antibodies to the N1 protein revealed the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of antibodies against both Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22 to be equivalent to those of antibodies against the seasonal CA/04 (H1N1)pdm09 NA in this serum panel (Fig. 4H). The NA proteins of the A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b and those of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have 89.6% amino acid identity, with considerable conservation at some antigenic sites19, 20.Antiviral susceptibility of clade 2.3.4.4b virusesTo evaluate whether the available antiviral therapies would be effective against the A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, we examined the phenotypic susceptibility of these viruses to antivirals from two U.S. FDA–approved classes: the NA inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir and the active metabolite of the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil. All six viruses tested (both reassortant and native constellations) had IC50 or EC50 values comparable to those of drug-susceptible human A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza reference viruses (Table 2). Additionally, genotypic M gene analysis revealed the absence of amino acid changes associated with reduced susceptibility to the adamantane class of drugs (Table 2).Table 2 Susceptibility of North American HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b to approved antiviral drugsFull size tableDiscussionWith the spread of A(H5N1) viruses throughout the United States and the detection of an infection in a human21, the increased virulence of the reassortant viruses is of considerable concern. Except for pockets of endemic clade activity in South and Southeast Asia, clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have predominated over other A(H5Nx) clades over the past 18 months. Clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have become entrenched in Asia, in Europe, and probably in parts of Africa. The WHO update (covering September 2021 to February 2022) reported 26 cases of 2.3.4.4b infection in humans, comprising 25 cases of A(H5N6) infection in China and one case of A(H5N1) in the United Kingdom, demonstrating the zoonotic transmission potential of these viruses3. From a public health perspective, the increased pathogenicity of the reassortant A(H5N1) viruses is of significant concern. However, this is tempered by the avian virus-like characteristics of the viruses with respect to their receptor binding preference and their pH of HA activation. Modification of these characteristics are likely required to enable sustained human-to-human transmission, although only a few amino acid changes among various influenza proteins are needed to switch these properties during adaptation in mammals22, 23. In addition to the representative viruses we assayed phenotypically, we did not identify any mutations previously associated with 6′SLN-linked sialic acid binding or alterations in pH of HA activation in the viruses we sequenced. To date, a single case of human A(H5N1) infection in an individual involved in poultry culling has been detected in North America during the current outbreak21. This individual underwent isolation and oseltamivir treatment and recovered after experiencing only minor symptoms. Publicly deposited sequence from samples collected from this case (albeit partial and missing PB2 and NP segments) were of Eurasian origin. Zoonotic transmission is likely to continue if this virus remains present in North American wild birds, and vigilance must be maintained as these birds continue their migrations. While direct translation of animal model findings to humans must be done cautiously, future zoonotic infections with the reassortant A(H5Nx) viruses may well include severe cases. Consistent with this possibility is the recent identification of a severe reassortant virus infection of a child in Ecuador24.The A(H5Nx) clade 2.3.4.4 viruses originally identified in NAm in 2014–2015 ultimately disappeared from avian species for reasons that are unclear25, but previous experience is unlikely to predict future events in this situation. Like the current NAm clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, the 2014–2015 viruses reassorted soon after detection on the continent, but this reassortment was not associated with changes in mammalian pathogenicity26. In contrast, our study with contemporary 2.3.4.4b viruses revealed that reassortants containing increasing numbers of NAm gene segments exhibited enhanced virulence with neurological involvement in mammalian models, including ferrets. However, these viruses retained avian-like receptor specificity, did not possess molecular markers of mammalian adaptation, or the ability to transmit between ferrets. Clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have thus far been associated with infections within a European mink farm27, spread among aquatic mammals in the Americas28,29,30, and reported identification from a variety of other NAm mammals including foxes, skunks, bobcats, mountain lions, and bears31. The increasing prevalence of 2.3.4.4b viruses are also changing the dynamics of disease in Europe, with the potential for transition from epizootic to enzootic status32. Our data highlight how quickly things can change in a natural system, and the potential for further A(H5Nx) reassortment and phenotypic diversification will only increase as the unprecedented global distribution of these viruses broadens.MethodsEthics statements and animal husbandryAll animal studies including co-housing of chickens and ferrets in the same bioisolator were approved by the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number 428) in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, approved by the Governing Board of the US National Research Council, and carried out by trained personnel working in a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-inspected Animal Biosafety Level 3+ animal facility in accordance with all regulations established by the Division of Agricultural Select Agents and Toxins (DASAT) at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as governed by the United States Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) regulations (7 CFR Part 331, 9 CFR Part 121.3, 42 CFR Part 73.3). Animal holding rooms were on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with dry-bulb temperatures set below each species lower critical temperature to minimize potential heat stress (71 °C ± 1 °C with alarm points beyond this value). Room humidity was set to 45%, with active humidification of each room allowing ≥40% humidity during winter months. Human sera were purchased from a commercial provider (BioIVT, Hicksville, NY) who played no role in our study. The specimens were not collected specifically for our study, and we had no access to the subject identifiers linked to the specimens. This study utilized USDA-classified select agents and A(H5N1) viruses used herein are subject to the guidelines of, and compliance with, requirements discussed in Title 9 (CFR Parts 121 [Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agent Toxins] and 122 [Importation and Transportation of Controlled Organisms and Vectors]).Cell cultureMadin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells (ATCC CCL-81) were grown in culture in Modified Eagle’s Medium (MEM) (CellGro) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), 1 mM L-glutamine, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Gibco). Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (ATCC CRL-3519) were grown in culture in OptiMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. Human airway epithelial (Calu-3) cells (ATCC HTB-55) were grown in culture in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Primary differentiated human airway cultures were purchased from MatTek and maintained as discussed in the replication kinetics section.Influenza virus propagation and titrationThe A(H5N1) influenza viruses were isolated from wild birds in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (eggs) at 35 °C for up to 48 h. Seasonal influenza A(H1N1) or rg-A(H3N2) viruses were grown in MDCK cells at 37 °C for up to 72 h. Viral titers were determined by injecting 0.1 mL of 10-fold dilutions of virus into the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old eggs and then calculating the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) or by inoculating MDCK monolayers and then calculating the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) by the method of Reed and Muench33. The lower limit of virus detection was 1.0 log10 TCID50/mL or 1.0 log10 EID50/mL.Replication kineticsCalu-3 cells (approximately 9 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with virus (MOI of 0.001) in 2.0 mL of infection medium (MEM, 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA, Sigma-Aldrich], 0.3–1 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin [for non-A(H5N1) viruses], 1× penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B). One hour later, the inocula were removed, the monolayers were washed with PBS, and the supernatants were replaced with 3.0 mL of infection medium. Primary differentiated human airway cultures (MatTek, AIR-100) on trans-well inserts were cultured at an air-liquid interface using manufacturer provided medium in the basal chambers and no medium the apical chambers. Cells were washed and inoculated (MOI of 0.005), with the addition of a low pH 2.0 physiological saline wash to inactivate residual virus. No medium was added back to the apical chambers. At each timepoint, 200 µL of BEBM (Lonza) supplemented with 1% BSA was added to the apical chambers for 15 min at 37 °C, then harvested. All cells or insert supernatants were sampled at 1 to 72 hpi as indicated, and virus titers (log10 TCID50/mL) were determined in MDCK cells by the method of Reed and Muench33. Data are presented for one of two independent experiments conducted using triplicate wells/inserts for each time point and for each virus among each cell line.Receptor binding assayFlat-bottom, 96-well immune assay plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 10 µg/mL fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C overnight then washed three times with washing buffer (PBS with 0.01 % Tween 80). Plates were blocked with PBS containing 1 % BSA then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 32 HA units of the Wigeon/SC/21 A/(H5N1), Eagle/FL/22 A/(H5N1), or CA/04 A/(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Plates were incubated with biotinylated sialylglycopolymers: 3’-SialLacNAc-PAA-biotin (3’-SLN) (Glycotech) or 6’-SialLacNAc-PAA-biotin (6’-SLN) (Glycotech), serially diluted in the reaction buffer (PBS with 0.02% Tween 80, 0.02 % BSA, and 5 µM oseltamivir carboxylate). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen; diluted 1:2000) in blocking solution. After washing, the plates were incubated with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 N H2SO4 (Fisher Chemicals), and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek).Syncytium assaySyncytium formation in vero cells was assayed as described34. Briefly, vero cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The cells were then washed with PBS, inoculated with each virus at an MOI of 3.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The inocula were then removed and replaced with 1.0 mL of infection medium. At 6 hpi [for the A(H5N1) viruses] or 24 hpi [for the CA/04 (H1N1)pdm09 virus], the supernatants were removed, the cells were washed with PBS, 1.0 mL of infection medium supplemented with 5 µg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin was added, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The infection medium was then removed, and residual trypsin was neutralized with 1.0 mL of MEM supplemented with 5% FBS. The supernatants were replaced with 0.5 mL of PBS, the monolayers were examined visually to verify their confluence, then the PBS was replaced with an equal volume of pH-adjusted buffer (pH 5.5–6.0) for 5 min. The pH buffer supernatants were then removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 1.0 mL of MEM supplemented with 5% FBS at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were fixed and stained using the Hema 3 Stat Pack (Fisher Scientific). Micrographs were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope with a Zeiss Axiocam ERc 5 s camera at 100× total magnification. The HA activation pH was defined as the highest pH at which syncytium formation was observed. The resolution of this assay was 0.1 pH units. Mock-inoculated cells (treated with PBS only) and cells inoculated with CA/04 (H1N1)pdm09 virus were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.pH of inactivationThe A(H5N1) influenza viruses were standardized to a concentration of 1.6 × 107 TCID50/mL and incubated with pH-adjusted buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were neutralized by adding infection medium. The infectious titers of neutralized samples were determined in MDCK cells by TCID50 assay33. The resolution of this assay was 0.2 pH units. The CA/04 (H1N1)pdm09 virus was used as a positive control.Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA)The presence of NA-specific antibodies was determined in ELLAs35. Tested human sera samples were purchased from a commercial vendor (BioIVT). The vendor had no role in the study, the samples were not collected specifically for this study, and no subject identifiers linked to the specimens were available to the investigators. Briefly, flat-bottom, 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25 µg/mL in 0.1 M PBS at 4 °C for 48 h. After blocking, heat-inactivated sera (inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h) were serially diluted in Dulbecco PBS (DPBS) (Gibco) supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20 and added to the plates. This was followed by the addition of a standardized reverse genetics (rg)–derived H6Nx antigen (virus). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated peanut agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 1 μg/mL and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed and 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The color reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 1 N H2SO4. The plates were read at 450 nm for 0.1 s in a Synergy H1 microplate reader. The NI titers were defined as the reciprocal of the last dilution that resulted in at least 50% inhibition.Phenotypic susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitorsThe neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir carboxylate (oseltamivir) and zanamivir were purchased from MedChem Express. NA susceptibility was determined by fluorometric assay using the substrate 2′-(4-methylumberlliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) (Sigma-Aldrich) with additional modifications36, 37. Influenza viruses were standardized to equivalent NA activity and incubated with 10-fold dilutions of each NA inhibitor (at concentrations of 5 pM to 50 µM). The fluorescence signal of the released 4-methylumbelliferone was measured using a Synergy H1 microplate reader at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelengths of 360 nM/460 nM. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were estimated from dose-response curves by using the sigmoidal, four-parameter logistic non-linear regression equation (in GraphPad Prism v9). The results are representative of the combined values of at least three independent dose-response curves and include influenza A/Denmark/524/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (NA H275, NAI susceptible), and A/Denmark/528/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (NA H275Y, NAI reduced susceptibility) as reference viruses.Phenotypic susceptibility to endonuclease inhibitorsThe active metabolite of baloxavir marboxil, baloxavir acid (BXA), was purchased from MedChem Express. BXA susceptibility was determined by plaque-reduction assay. MDCK cells (106 cells/well in 6-well plates) were inoculated with a virus volume previously determined to yield approximately 50–100 plaque-forming units (PFUs). At 1 hpi, the cells were washed and overlaid with MEM containing 0.45% immunodiffusion-grade agarose (MP Biomedical), 0.1% BSA, 1 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin (for non-A(H5N1) viruses), and 10-fold dilutions of BXA (1 pM to 1 μM). At 72 hpi, the overlays were removed, and the cell monolayers were stained and fixed with 1% crystal violet, 10% formaldehyde. The number of PFU per well was calculated, and the 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) were determined by using the log (inhibitor) versus response logistic nonlinear regression equation (in GraphPad Prism v9). The results are representative of three independent dose-response curves and include rg–derived CA/04 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with the wild-type PA I38 (BXA sensitive) or the PA I38T substitution (reduced susceptibility to BXA) as reference viruses38, 39.Genotypic susceptibility to M2 protein inhibitorsSusceptibility to M2 protein inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine) was determined from the M2 splice product of the full-length M gene, with analysis of the M2 amino acid substitutions (residues 26, 27, 30, 31, and 34) mediating resistance.Generation of reverse-genetics (rg) virusesInfluenza virus gene segments were amplified from viral RNA using gene-specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Supplementary Table 5) and cloned into the influenza A virus rg dual-promoter expression vector pHW200040. To generate rg viruses, plasmids encoding cDNAs of all eight genomic RNA segments were transfected into HEK293T cells by using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher). At 48 h post-transfection, the cell supernatant was harvested, and 0.2 mL of the supernatant was injected into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs to propagate the virus. Viruses used in ELLAs were generated with the HA gene of A/Teal/Hong Kong/w312/1997 (H6N1), all internal gene segments were from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), and the NA gene was from either Wigeon/SC/21 (H5N1) or Eagle/FL/22 (H5N1). rg-A/H1N1 and rg-A/H3N2 viruses containing PA substitutions conferring baloxavir reduced susceptibility were generated in previous studies38, 39.Minireplicon assayInfluenza virus genes encoding PB1, PB2, PA, and NP were cloned into pHW2000 as described previously, propagated in Top 10 competent cells (Invitrogen), and purified with a HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). HEK293T cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well in a 48-well plate) were transfected (using Mirus TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent) with the virus plasmids, a pPolI-358 NP firefly luciferase reporter gene for influenza polymerase activity (kindly provided by Megan Shaw, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), and a pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid for transfection control normalization. After 24 hpi at 37°C, the monolayers were lysed with 0.2 mL of passive lysis buffer (Promega) and the supernatants were clarified by centrifugation. The ratio of luciferase activity (as measured with the Luciferase Assay System [Promega]) to β-galactosidase activity was determined using 15 µL of clarified supernatant. Data shown are representative of one of three independent assays using at least triplicate measures for each sample.Sanger sequencingViral RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using a OneStep RT-RCR Kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification of influenza A virus gene segments was performed using primers (sequences available upon request). PCR products were extracted from 1.5% agarose gel by using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Sanger sequencing was performed by the Hartwell Center at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital on an ABI Prism capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and assembled with DNASTAR Lasergene version 15.3.0, 422.Illumina sequencingViral RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The influenza A virus gene segments were amplified using modified universal primers in a multi-segment PCR as described41. PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BeckmanCoulter). Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (300 cycles) on a MiSeq System (Illumina). Sequencing reads were then quality trimmed and assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 22.0.1). A total of 423 gene segment sequences obtained from 53 isolates in this study were deposited in the Influenza Research Database and are available under GenBank accession numbers presented in Supplementary Table 3.Phylogenetic analysesSequences other than those found in this study were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Influenza Virus Sequence Database and from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID42). Sequences were then aligned, and ends were trimmed to equal lengths with BioEdit sequence alignment editor software (v.7.2.5). Similar sequences, including sequences obtained in this study, were removed, and phylogenetic relationships were inferred by the neighbor-joining method from 500 bootstrap values; topology was confirmed by the maximum likelihood method43; and evolutionary analyses were conducted with the MEGA 7 software44.TanglegramAdditional North American and Eurasian influenza HA and PB2 gene sequences isolated from May 2021 to May 2022 were obtained from the GISAID database (Supplementary Table 4). Redundant PB2 sequences were eliminated by setting a sequence identity threshold of 97%, using CD-HIT (v.4.8.1)45. Twenty-five non-redundant PB2 sequences from the GISAID database were combined with 14 studied North American A(H5N1) sequences by using BioEdit (v.7.2.5). Using the default parameters of Augur (v.15.0.1)46, the sequences were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Furthermore, a PB2 gene time-resolved tree was generated using TreeTime (v.0.8.6)47, which is included in Augur. Using exclusively the 14 studied A(H5N1) sequences, an HA gene time-resolved tree was generated through the same Augur process. These data were visualized using Auspice (v.2.29.1)48.Virulence and transmission in ferretsFour-to-six-month-old outbred influenza-seronegative male ferrets (Triple F Farms, Sayre, PA, USA) were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50 units of A(H5N1) virus diluted in 1.0 mL of PBS. Ferrets (n = 3 to 6 per group) were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection. Characteristics monitored included body temperature, weight loss, relative inactivity indices49, ataxia, respiratory symptoms, stool consistency, and neuropathologic signs. Animals reaching the humane endpoint, according to an IACUC-approved clinical scoring system, were euthanized. Nasal washes were collected from all surviving ferrets at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days post-infection (dpi). Ketamine was used to induce sneezing. At 3 and 5 dpi (in the initial phenotyping experiment) and 5 dpi (in the follow-up experiment), ferrets (n = 3 per group) were euthanized, and tissue samples were collected from the respiratory tract (nasal cavity, trachea, and lungs), the central nervous system (a combination of the brain stem, cerebellum, and frontal lobes), and the small intestine (not examined for Wigeon/SC/21 and Eagle/FL/22). Viral titers were determined in MDCK cells by TCID50 assay. For transmission studies in the initial phenotyping experiment, three ferrets were inoculated intranasally with A(H5N1) virus as described above and housed individually in separate cages. Direct-contact transmission was assessed by placing a naïve ferret into the cage of the inoculated ferret at 1 dpi. Ferrets were monitored daily, and nasal washes were collected at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 dpi, starting just before the inoculated and contact ferrets were co-housed. At 25 days post contact, sera were collected from all surviving inoculated and contact ferrets and treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denko) as per manufacturer instructions. Degree of seroconversion was determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay50, and discussed in detail in the Serological Testing section.Pathogenicity in miceGroups of 6-to-8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus suspension containing 102 to 106 EID50 units of A(H5N1) virus in 30 µL of PBS. After virus inoculation, mice were weighed daily and monitored for mortality (death or loss of ≥25% of their body weight) and any clinical signs of infection for 14 dpi. The 50% mouse lethal dose (LD50) was calculated after the 14-day observation period. For viral replication studies, BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 104 EID50 units of each tested virus in 30 µL of PBS. At 5 dpi, mice were euthanized, and their lungs and brains were collected and homogenized in 1 mL of infection medium. Viral titers in harvested organs were determined by TCID50 assay in MDCK cells.Transmission in chickensSix-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) white leghorn chickens (Charles River Laboratories, CT, USA) (n = 3 chickens per virus) were inoculated with 106 EID50 units of Wigeon/SC/21 (H5N1) or Eagle/FL/22 (H5N1) virus by the natural routes (0.2 mL intranasally, 0.1 mL intraocularly, 0.1 mL intraesophageally, and 0.1 mL intratracheally). At 1 hpi, naïve chickens (n = 12 per virus) were co-housed with the donor chicken and all birds were monitored daily for disease signs. Oropharyngeal and cloacal specimens were collected at 2, 4, and 6 dpi, and the infectious viral titers were determined by EID50 assay. To evaluate aerosol transmission from chickens to ferrets, naïve ferrets (n = 3) were housed in a ferret cage that was placed adjacent to a donor chicken cage (distance between cages was 12 inches) within the same bioisolator. Ferret nasal washes were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 dpi, and infectious viral titers were determined by EID50 assay. All animals were monitored twice daily for disease signs. At 21 dpi, sera were collected from all ferrets to assess the degree of seroconversion by HAI assay as described below.Serologic testingSera samples ferrets or chickens were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Denka Seiken Co.) at 37 °C overnight, heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer was determined by incubating 2-fold serial dilutions of serum sample with 25 µl of 4 hemagglutinating (HA) units (HAU) in 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning). Sera and virus mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 45 min prior to addition of a 0.5% solution of chicken red blood cells (Rockland Immunochemicals) in PBS and subsequent incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The HI titers were recorded as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution where there was complete inhibition of hemagglutination and reported as endpoint doubling dilution or Log2 as indicated in each figure or table.PathologyFerret lungs and nasal mucosa were fixed via intratracheal/intranasal infusion with 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) followed by continued immersion in 10% NBF. Tissues were routinely processed and embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Serial sections were subjected to antigen retrieval for 30 min at 98 °C before undergoing immunohistochemical labeling of viral antigen, using a primary goat polyclonal antibody (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) against influenza A/USSR/1977 (H1N1) virus at a dilution of 1:1000 and a secondary biotinylated donkey anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200.Statistical analysisData were analyzed using unpaired t-tests, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison post hoc test, and univariant log-rank analysis (survival curves) in GraphPad Prism v9. Replicates, group comparisons, and P values are listed in each figure legend.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Other respiratory virus surveillance data can be found on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker, NCIRD Surveillance Systems website and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide during week 21, 1.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group More than 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. During week 21, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet was 5.9% among those 0-4 years, 3.2% among those 5-24 years, 1.4% among those 25-49 years, 0.9% among those 50-64 years, and 0.7% among those 65 years and older.

Vaccination prevents infections and reduces influenza-related mortality. Given the limitations associated with current influenza vaccines, such as their reliance on fertilized chicken eggs, limited production capacity, the need for egg adaptation, and prolonged production time, exploring alternative methods is a must. In light of these drawbacks, cell-based manufacturing presents itself as a viable alternative for the production of influenza vaccines. The history of cell-based influenza vaccine development Over the past 80 years, various methods have been developed to culture influenza viruses. In 1933, the first human influenza virus was isolated by propagating specimens obtained from throat washings collected from a patient, using ferrets through intranasal instillation.1 In 1935, Wilson Smith proposed a method that involved cultivating the influenza virus in the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs.2 This technique proved to be highly successful, yielding significantly higher concentrations of the virus compared to earlier methods that relied on extracting the virus from the lungs of infected animals. Notably, fertilized chicken eggs continue to be employed in the present day for the production of influenza vaccines. However, since the late 1950s, researchers have gradually transitioned towards utilizing various cell lines, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Vero cells, for the cultivation of influenza viruses. This shift from eggs to cells for influenza vaccine production. (Figure 1) Figure 1. The transition from egg-based to cell-based flu vaccines is still in progress today. (Ref: DOI:10.1002mv.2243). Image Credit: Sino Biological Inc. Cell-based vs. Egg-based influenza vaccines For over 70 years, the primary method of producing influenza vaccines has relied on egg-based techniques. However, despite the extensive industrial manufacturing experience and safety regulatory filings, certain challenges have emerged in this process. Inherent limitations in the manufacturing procedure involve the serial passage of the virus in chicken eggs, particularly with H3N2, which can result in egg-adaptive mutations affecting the antigenic sites and diminishing vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, surges in the demand for chicken eggs, particularly during pandemics, hinder the timely production of vaccines. The occurrences of avian influenzas, notably the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 outbreaks from 1997 to 2008, prompted researchers to explore cell-based vaccines as an alternative. Additional disadvantages of the egg-based approach include a higher risk of allantoic fluid contamination, labor-intensive manufacturing systems, and potential allergic reactions among certain recipients. (Table 1) To address these limitations, the adoption of culture-based vaccine production methods becomes crucial for the future success of the influenza vaccine industry. Table 1.

Items Egg-based flu vaccines Cell culture-based flu vaccines Flu vaccine production technology The platform relies on a steady supply of embryonated eggs. However, supply can be overwhelmed by sudden increases in demand, such as during a pandemic. Viral production in a cell culture bioreactor is more flexible and scalable and is unaffected by egg shortages. Production cycle 6~8 Months. 3 Months. Passage adaptation variation Adaptive mutations may accumulate and potentially change the strain’s antigenicity. Low mutation rates and the antigenicity of the vaccine are closer to the wild type. Allergic reaction May cause allergic reactions to ovalbumin. Ovalbumin-free to reduce the risk of post-vaccination anaphylaxis. Influenza vaccine contamination The allantoic fluid of individual chicken embryos is contaminated, resulting in a high risk of contamination of the entire batch. Low risk of contamination when using closed systems such as cell engineering, microcarrier culture, and bioreactors. Scale-up and automation Increased production is more limited and requires higher labor costs. A high degree of automation, large-scale cultivation, and easy scale-up. Efficacy Not obvious. Not obvious. Cell-based influenza vaccines necessitate a more precise characterization and definition of raw materials and substrates compared to the production of egg-based flu vaccines. However, the scalable nature of the process grants increased flexibility in addressing heightened demand. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the utilization of MDCK and Vero cells for the manufacture of influenza vaccines. MDCK cells, an adherent cultured cell line, were originally derived from canine kidney tissue by Madin and Darby in 1958.3 In comparison to other cell lines, MDCK cells exhibit a higher rate of influenza virus replication and can be adapted to generate substantial viral titers in as few as 3–10 passages. This shortens the production time of vaccine strains, and reducing the number of adaptive generations can also reduce the antigenic drift of the genes encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins that occurs during the passage of vaccine strains. Thus, MDCK cells are now classed as a vital cell line suitable for influenza virus strain isolation and vaccine production. Furthermore, MDCK cells can be readily adapted to serum-free medium and serum-free suspension, facilitating large-scale industrial production. Vero cells, as recommended by the WHO, serve as the designated cell line for vaccine production. In 2010, Baxter's Preflucel, a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, received approval from the EMA.4 This vaccine was produced using a Vero cell serum-free adherent culture. Studies have indicated that Vero cells also exhibit broad sensitivity to various types and subtypes of influenza viruses. However, their efficiency in virus amplification is lower compared to MDCK cells and chicken embryos. Consequently, the yield of Vero cell-based influenza vaccines is relatively limited, necessitating research and development efforts to cultivate high-yielding influenza virus strains in Vero cells. Challenges to cell-based influenza vaccines The initial stage of cell-based vaccine production necessitates substantial R&D investment, which in turn leads to increased costs for patients. Biopharmaceutical companies transitioning to cell-based pipelines must consider two crucial aspects: vaccine safety and effectiveness. One key consideration is the ability of a cell line to consistently replicate a diverse range of virus strains, thereby ensuring a high level of performance. Influenza viruses derived from cell cultures exhibit a greater resemblance to primary human virus strains, eliciting a more robust protective response. However, cell-based production platforms are susceptible to variations stemming from host cell lines and culture conditions, which can impact their reliability. To support the development of influenza vaccines, Sino Biological offers a comprehensive range of reagent products within its ProVir® viral antigen collection. This collection encompasses WHO-recommended vaccine strains of the HA, NA, and nucleoprotein (NP) proteins from recent years. Furthermore, Sino Biological has developed an extensive assortment of monoclonal antibodies targeting flu antigens. These reagents prove invaluable in facilitating the development of relevant assays.

Licensed cell-based influenza vaccines Significant advancements have been achieved in recent years regarding the R&D and industrialization of cell-based influenza vaccines. In 2001, the Sekirus Company (United States) successfully developed the Flucelvax® Quadrivalent (Flucelvax® TETRA) influenza vaccine. This subunit vaccine is manufactured using MDCK cells that are cultured in adherence to serum-free microcarriers. Flucelvax® Quadrivalent received its initial license in the United States in 2012 and is presently authorized for use in children aged four years and above. Similarly, in 2007, the European Union approved Novartis' Optaflu, a trivalent subunit vaccine produced using the MDCK 33016 cell line cultured in a serum-free suspension. In 2016, the FDA approved Flucelvax® Quadrivalent, another quadrivalent influenza subunit vaccine manufactured utilizing serum-free suspension MDCK cells, developed by Seqirus. In South Korea, SK Chemicals has produced the SKYCellflu trivalent and quadrivalent subunit vaccines using MDCK cells. These vaccines have obtained licenses for use in children aged six months and older in Korea, and three years and older in Malaysia and Thailand.5 All these vaccines use MDCK cells or Vero cells as substrates.

MDCK cells have been widely used by scientific research organizations and laboratories across the world for decades. MDCK cells are also used as a passage cell line for vaccine production, and their potential tumorigenicity and the risk of contamination by exogenous factors have become a widespread concern. With the improvement of cell-based vaccines and the advancement of influenza vaccine production technology, it is only a matter of time before cell-based influenza vaccines completely replace chicken egg-based vaccines.

Current influenza vaccines elicit antibodies predominantly to the highly variable head region of haemagglutinin and their effectiveness is limited by viral drift1 and suboptimal immune responses2. Here we describe a neuraminidase-targeting monoclonal antibody, FNI9, that potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of all group 1 and group 2 IAVs, as well as Victoria/2/87-like, Yamagata/16/88-like and ancestral IBVs. FNI9 broadly neutralizes seasonal IAVs and IBVs, including the immune-evading H3N2 strains bearing an N-glycan at position 245, and shows synergistic activity when combined with anti-haemagglutinin stem-directed antibodies. Structural analysis reveals that D107 in the FNI9 heavy chain complementarity-determinant region 3 mimics the interaction of the sialic acid carboxyl group with the three highly conserved arginine residues (R118, R292 and R371) of the neuraminidase catalytic site. FNI9 demonstrates potent prophylactic activity against lethal IAV and IBV infections in mice. The unprecedented breadth and potency of the FNI9 monoclonal antibody supports its development for the prevention of influenza illness by seasonal and pandemic viruses.

IAVs have a vast host tropism that includes different animal species such as swine, bats and various wild birds, which represent the primary reservoir of these viruses. This wide tropism fosters viral evolution and leads to zoonotic infections as well as pandemics4. IBVs predominantly circulate in humans and display lower genetic diversity but can cause severe disease especially in children and high-risk individuals5.IAV and IBV infectivity relies on two glycoproteins expressed on the viral envelope that work in concert6. Haemagglutinin (HA) binds to the sialic acid (SA) receptor and is pivotal for endosomal membrane fusion, leading to virus uncoating7. Neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-destroying enzyme that cleaves SA, facilitating the release of viral particles from infected cells8. NA is also crucial for penetration of the virus through the mucus layer by cleaving decoy receptors that are abundantly present in mucins9,10. Owing to their complementary roles, HA and NA activities must be finely balanced to allow viral entry and egress from host cells11,12.Despite the lower abundance on the viral envelope than HA8,13, NA represents a key target for neutralizing antibodies. The protective role of anti-NA antibodies has been documented following the 1968 pandemic in which the H3N2 virus carried an NA antigenically related to the previously circulating H2N2 virus14. In addition, more recent studies have demonstrated that serum antibodies with NA inhibition (NAI) activity are an independent correlate of protection against IAV infection15,16,17. Besides blocking the interaction of the enzymatic pocket with SA receptors, NA antibodies can also promote Fc-mediated protection in vivo18. Although NA neutralizing antibodies can be induced by natural infection, the anti-NA immunity elicited by current influenza vaccines is weak, mainly due to the low abundance and poor stability of the NA antigen, and to the lack of standardization of the amount of NA in approved vaccines19.In view of the antigenic diversity of IAVs and IBVs, the identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) covering both viruses and their variants remains challenging. Several anti-HA stem neutralizing mAbs that recognize the antigenically distant groups 1 and 2 HAs of IAVs have been identified. When tested in a therapeutic setting, these mAbs showed no or only limited efficacy20,21. However, one of these mAbs is currently being tested in a phase II prophylactic study22. Anti-NA mAbs with broad reactivity may represent a complementary and possibly synergistic approach to anti-HA stem mAbs.Recent studies described anti-NA neutralizing mAbs isolated following infection or vaccination, showing breadth across several IAVs and IBVs23,24,25,26. Here we identify a mAb, designated FNI9, which displays an unprecedented breadth and potency against both IAVs and IBVs via receptor mimicry. These findings together with the synergy with HA stem-directed mAbs support the development of FNI9 for the prevention of influenza illness by seasonal and pandemic viruses.Isolation of pan-influenza anti-NA mAbsSera from almost 200 healthy individuals were screened for the presence of IgG cross-reacting antibodies to non-human circulating group 1 (N4) and group 2 (N3 and N9) NAs transiently expressed on the surface of mammalian cells (Fig. 1a). One donor, designated ‘I’, with high reactivity against these NA antigens was selected. More than 10 million peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived IgG+ memory B cells from this donor were interrogated using a N1-based baiting strategy (N1 from H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004) and 14,625 cells were sorted and then seeded as single cells in co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells. Culture supernatants were screened for inhibition of N1 sialidase activity by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). As ELLA also identifies antibodies that inhibit NA activity by steric hindrance, we further screened the NAI activity of the antibodies in the cell supernatants using the 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) substrate to select mAbs that directly target the enzymatic pocket of group 1 (N1) and group 2 (N2) NAs. Fourteen mAbs (designated FNI mAbs) were identified and found to belong to a single clonal family diversified by a high load of somatic mutations. These antibodies use IGHV1-69 and IGK3-15 genes and are characterized by heavy chain complementarity-determinant region 3 (HCDR3) that is 21 amino acids long (Extended Data Fig. 1a–e and Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 1: Breadth of FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 anti-NA mAbs across IAVs and IBVs.a, Phylogenetic tree of IAV and IBV NAs constructed using maximum likelihood analysis of amino acid sequences.

Coloured boxes represent the lowest concentration at which mAb binding (expressed as mean fluorescence intensity) was measurable.Full size imageThree mAbs—FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19—stood out for their binding to a broad panel of cell-surface-displayed seasonal and animal circulating IAV and IBV NAs (Fig. 1a,b, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). To confirm their broad NAI activity, the three mAbs were tested in a MUNANA assay with N1, N2 and IBV NA antigens (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The previously described broadly neutralizing anti-NA mAb 1G01 (ref. 24) was also included as a positive control. FNI9 and FNI19 displayed NAI activity similar to 1G01 to N1 and N2 NAs but stronger inhibition of enzymatic activity to the IBV NAs. FNI17 demonstrated the weakest NAI activity versus N2 antigens but the strongest inhibition of IBV NAs (Extended Data Fig. 2b).We next assessed FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 mAbs for their neutralizing activity against a panel of seasonal IAV and IBV strains spanning more than 80 years of NA antigenic evolution (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). The three FNI mAbs efficiently neutralized all IBVs tested, with FNI17 showing the highest potency in line with the NAI results. Conversely, 1G01 mAb neutralized only a fraction of IBVs tested, consistent with its reported limited coverage of IBV strains24. Potent neutralization was observed for all the mAbs to seasonal H1N1 strains (Fig. 2a). Of note, 1G01, but not FNI mAbs, was affected by the oseltamivir-resistant mutation H275Y27 (Fig. 2a), which was present in up to 68% of H1N1 seasonal strains pre-2009 H1N1 pandemic28. Although all anti-NA mAbs efficiently neutralized the H3N2 strains isolated before 2015, the activity of FNI17 and 1G01 was strongly impaired by the most recent H3N2 isolates (Fig. 2a). Since the 2014/2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, a new N-linked glycosylation site at position 245 was introduced on the N2 NA as a result of the S245N and S247T substitutions (Extended Data Fig. 2c). This glycan, which is located at the entry of the NA enzymatic pocket, has been present since then in all seasonal H3N2 viruses, and has been shown to reduce the activity of antibodies targeting the catalytic site29,30.Fig. 2: In vitro characterization of FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 mAbs.a, FNI9, FNI17, FNI19 and 1G01 mAbs neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against a panel of seasonal IAVs (H1N1 is blue; H3N2 pre-2015 is in red and H3N2 post-2015 is in orange) and IBVs (B/Victoria/2/87-like viruses are in light green, B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses are in dark green and ancestral is in olive).

Neutralization matrixes were performed in technical triplicates with one of two independent experiments shown.Source DataFull size imageTo dissect the effect of the N245 glycan on antibody activity, we produced a panel of three N2 antigens derived from H3N2 strains isolated before and after 2015 together with their counterparts in which the glycosylation site was either introduced or removed (Supplementary Table 4). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed that FNI17 Fab has weaker affinity than FNI9, FNI19 and 1G01 towards N2 antigens even when the glycan N245 was not present, and glycosylation further decreased its binding (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 4). Although the 1G01 Fab displayed the highest binding affinity in the absence of the glycosylation, the presence of the N245 glycan severely dampened 1G01 binding to all N2 antigens tested (Fig. 2b). Despite the N245 glycan being associated with decreased binding to N2, FNI9 and FNI19 retained nanomolar binding affinity (Fig. 2b). Consistent with SPR results, all mAbs showed similar inhibition of N2 enzymatic activity when the N245 glycan was not present, but the introduction of the glycosylation resulted in a marked decrease of NAI activity by FNI17 and 1G01 compared to FNI9 and FNI19 (Fig. 2c). Our results for 1G01 are in line with those recently reported31, indicating a decrease in NAI activity by this mAb to N2 bearing the N245 glycan, albeit 1G01 in vivo protection was retained at the single dose tested. Overall, FNI9 and FNI19 mAbs were found to be the most active to contemporary H3N2 strains carrying the N245 glycosylation as well as to oseltamivir-resistant strains.Next, we assessed the ability of the FNI mAbs to inhibit the enzymatic activity of pseudoparticles bearing NAs representative of enzootic and zoonotic avian and mammalian IAVs. FNI mAbs displayed different inhibitory activity against pseudoparticles bearing NAs from highly pathogenic avian IAVs that were previously reported to have infected humans32 or were responsible of the recent outbreak in farmed mammals33 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Of note, FNI9 showed the highest NAI activity against N9 from H7N9 among the clonally related antibodies. FNI mAbs displayed comparable NAI activity to pseudoparticles decorated by low pathogenic avian influenza viruses N3, N4 or N5, with the latter not being sensitive to the 1G01 mAb (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Finally, the FNI9 mAb demonstrated broad inhibitory activity across a panel of pseudoparticles presenting NAs from enzootic IAVs circulating in swine and dogs (Extended Data Fig. 3c).Besides inhibiting enzymatic activity and viral replication in vitro, FNI9 induced complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity, mediated the lysis of infected cells by human primary natural killer cells (antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity) and promoted antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis by monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4).The potential interaction of anti-NA mAbs with other influenza virus-targeting antibodies was investigated by combining FNI9 with the broadly neutralizing HA-stem directed mAb MEDI8852 (ref. 34). In a checkerboard neutralization assay, these mAbs were found to strongly synergize with a 1:1 anti-HA:anti-NA ratio against both H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and H3N2 A/Tasmania/503/2020 (Fig. 2e), suggesting that synergistic activity of broadly neutralizing mAbs could be exploited to increase the breadth and barrier to viral resistance.Collectively, we identified broadly neutralizing NA-targeting mAbs with unprecedented breadth to seasonal and zoonotic IAVs and IBVs, which can synergize with anti-HA stem-directed mAbs.Receptor mimicry by FNI mAbsTo elucidate the structural basis for the FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 broad neutralizing activity, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures of their Fabs in complex with NA from H3N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010 at 2.9 Å, 2.3 Å and 3.1 Å resolutions, respectively (Supplementary Table 5). The overall topology of the FNI9–NA complex adopts a C4 symmetry, with each NA protomer bound to a Fab (Fig. 3a). FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 all adopt the same binding mode (Fig. 3b), inserting the HCDR3 into the enzymatic pocket where residues R106 and D107 establish multivalent salt bridges with the NA active site residues R118, D151, R292 and R371 (ref. 35) (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3: Structure of anti-NA mAbs targeting the SA-binding site.a, Topology of the complex formed by FNI9 (light blue) binding to NA (grey).

Key contact residues are shown in red. The binding energies of epitope residues (as a percentage of the total) are shown in the heat map; for the IBV analyses, PDB 1NSC (SA, B/Beijing/1/87) and 4CPY (OSE, B/Lyon/CHU/15.216/2011) were used.Source DataFull size imageThese four NA active site residues also form the primary interactions with SA, suggesting that the broad neutralizing activity of FNI mAbs is the result of receptor molecular mimicry (Fig. 3d,g), similar to the binding mode of oseltamivir (Fig. 3e,g). By contrast, 1G01 interactions within the enzymatic pocket are distinct from those observed for the SA receptor, oseltamivir and the FNI mAbs (Fig. 3f). Of note, both 1G01 and FNI mAbs also interact with E227, which contributes to form the NA active site framework (Fig. 3c,f). Owing to the functional constraints associated with the SA receptor interactions, the key contact residues of the FNI mAbs are highly conserved across IAV and IBV NAs (Fig. 3h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5). Moreover, in vitro resistance studies with live virus as well as deep mutational scanning via an NA library expressed in mammalian cells revealed a very limited number of NA mutations capable of reducing, but not abrogating, the binding or activity of FNI mAbs (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4). Of note, most of these mutations were only retrieved after several rounds of viral passages, are associated with a decrease in the NA sialidase activity and are extremely rare in human and animal isolates, suggesting a fitness cost for the corresponding virus mutants and a high barrier to resistance for this class of anti-NA antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 6).To obtain a more detailed understanding of the binding epitopes of FNI mAbs, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FNI–NA complexes were performed using the complete glycans revealed by peptide mapping liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although the analysis of the static structures shows similar binding energies for the FNI9–NA and FNI17–NA complexes (Extended Data Fig. 8a), the MD-derived total dynamic binding energy predicts that FNI9 is a stronger binder (−370 MOE (molecular operating environment) kcal per mol) than FNI17 (−250 MOE kcal per mol) for NA from the H3N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010 strain (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c), in line with binding affinity measurements (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 4). The interactions are balanced across more residues in the FNI9–NA complex than in the FNI17–NA complex both in the epitope (Extended Data Fig. 8d) and in the paratope (Extended Data Fig. 8e), providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the superior binding of FNI9.We next investigated the structural basis for the reduced binding affinities to N2 antigens bearing the N245 glycan. Two-dimensional classification of the cryo-electron microscopy data showed the presence of N2 tetramers carrying the N245 glycan saturated with three or four FNI9 Fabs (6.08% with three FNI9 Fabs and 91.20% with four FNI9 Fabs) or FNI19 Fabs (6.05% with three FNI19 Fabs and 93.27% with four FNI19 Fabs), whereas only zero or one FNI17 Fabs (77.03% with zero FNI17 Fabs and 22.97% with one FNI17 Fab) were found to occupy each tetramer (Fig. 4a). These data are consistent with the lower binding affinity and neutralizing activity of FNI17 than FNI9 and FNI19 versus the N2 antigens and viruses bearing the N245 glycan (Fig. 2a,b).Fig. 4: FNI mAbs induce a conformational change in the 242/252 loop when N245 is glycosylated.a, 2D and 3D classifications and percentages of classes of FNI9–NA (N2 A/Hong Kong/2019) showing four, three and zero Fabs bound to the tetramer (the condition with a single Fab bound is not shown: 1.33%), FNI17–NA (N2 A/Tanzania/2010 with S245N and S247T) showing one and zero Fabs bound to the NA tetramer, and FNI19–NA (N2 A/Hong Kong/2019) with zero, three and four Fabs bound to the NA tetramer. b, N245 glycosylated (+Glyc245; grey) and non-glycosylated (−Glyc245; brown) NAs reveal very similar conformations of the 242/252 loop in the unbound state. Overlay of the FNI9 Fab (light blue, translucent surface) indicates the steric hindrance with the N245 glycan (light green surface), which would occur without a rearrangement of the 242/252 loop and the glycan. c, Overlays of N2 A/Tanzania/2010 NA (−Glyc245) with (+FNI9, gold) and without (−FNI9, brown) Fab bound reveal that the NAs adopt indistinguishable conformations; the FNI9 Fab is shown as a light blue surface. d, Overlays of N245-glycosylated NA structures with (+FNI9, dark green) and without (−FNI9, grey) Fab bound illustrate the influence of the Fab on inducing a conformational change in the 242/252 loop. Although the peptide mapping liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in Extended Data Fig. 7 revealed that position 245 bears an A2G2F glycan, only the two GlcNAcs and fucose resolved by cryo-electron microscopy are shown in the figure.Source DataFull size imageStructural analysis revealed that the conformation of the 242/252 loop, which contains the N245AT247 glycosylation motif, is not influenced by the presence or absence of the N245 glycan (Fig. 4b). In N2 NA structures without the glycan, there is no clash with the antibody and the 242/252 loop adopts virtually indistinguishable conformations in both bound and unbound states (Fig. 4c). By contrast, following binding of the FNI9 antibody, both the 242/252 loop and the N245 glycan undergo a dramatic conformational change to avoid a clash between the Fab and the glycan (Fig. 4d). The energy required for the induced fit of loop 242/252 could underlie the differences in affinity and neutralizing activity of the FNI mAbs against the recent N2 NAs.Prophylactic activity of the FNI9 mAbTo assess the in vivo activity of FNI9 in a mouse model, we produced a murinized IgG2a form of this mAb (muFNI9) and a N297Q mutant (muFNI9(N297Q)) that lacks FcRs and complement C1q binding36. For comparison, we also produced the same murinized versions of MEDI8852, a broadly IAV neutralizing anti-HA stem antibody34. The four mAbs were prophylactically administered via intravenous injection to BALB/c mice 24 h before lethal challenge with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Mice receiving muFNI9 were completely protected from loss of body weight down to 0.9 mg kg−1 and displayed limited loss of body weight at 0.3 mg kg−1, with all the animals recovering throughout 14 days (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Administration of muMEDI8852 conferred full protection from body weight loss down to 3 mg kg−1; whereas moderate-to-significant body weight loss was observed at 0.9 and 0.3 mg kg−1, respectively (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). When the same antibodies were tested with the N297Q mutation, muFNI9(N297Q) displayed protection comparable with that of the parental antibody at all the doses tested (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9a). By contrast, muMEDI8852 bearing N297Q showed a marked decreased activity at limiting doses (0.9 and 0.3 mg kg−1), consistent with previous findings on the role of effector function in protection by anti-HA stem-directed antibodies37 (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Overall, these data indicate that FNI9 has strong prophylactic activity against lethal infection with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34, which does not appear to be dependent on Fc-mediated effector functions at the doses tested.Fig. 5: FNI9 mAb protects mice from seasonal IAV and IBV lethal challenges.a–d, Percentage of body weight loss of BALB/c mice (n = 6 mice per group) prophylactically administered with murinized anti-NA FNI9 mAb (a), anti-HA stem-directed MEDI8852 mAb (b) and the same mAbs bearing the N297Q Fc mutation (c,d) 24 h before lethal infection with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Doses are reported in different colours and the average body weight loss for each dose group is shown. Error bars represent standard deviations. The 0% dotted line indicates baseline body weight loss; the −30% dotted line indicates body weight loss % for euthanasia based on lead veterinarian assessment as described in the ethical statement. e–h, Replicating virus titres in the lungs of BALB/c mice measured 4 days post-infection with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (e), H3N2 A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (f) (n = 5 mice per group), B/Victoria/504/2000 (Yamagato linage) (g) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) (h) (n = 6 mice per group) following prophylactic administration of FNI9 at 3, 0.9, 0.3 mg kg−1 (e–h) and 0.1 mg kg−1 (e,f). Each panel presents data derived from n = 1 independent experiment. Two-tailed Mann–Whitney test was used for statistical analysis of significance. LOD, limit of detection; TCID, tissue culture infectious dose.Source DataFull size imageNext, we observed that mice prophylactically administered with an ineffective dose of MEDI8852 combined with FNI mAbs in a 1:1 ratio were overall better protected from morbidity than those receiving only the same amount of FNI mAbs contained in the mix, suggesting that the activity of anti-HA stem antibodies can benefit from the association with NA-inhibiting antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 9b).Given the similarity in the mechanism of action, we compared the prophylactic activity of a single injection of FNI9 with daily administration of oseltamivir in BALB/c mice lethally challenged with a panel of IAVs and IBVs (Fig. 5e–h). Daily administration of oseltamivir at 10 mg kg−1 (ref. 38) reduced viral titre by approximately 1 log against IAVs (H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 or H3N2 A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016) and no further viral titre reduction was observed by doubling the dose (20 mg kg−1) of the small molecule. Conversely, FNI9 at 3 and 0.9 mg kg−1 reduced lung viral titres by 4 and 3 logs after challenge with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and by 3 and 2 logs after challenge with H3N2 A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 that carries the N245 glycan (Fig. 5e,f). A viral lung titre reduction comparable with the one provided by oseltamivir was obtained with both IAVs when FNI9 was administered at 0.3 mg kg−1 (Fig. 5e,f).In line with the lower in vitro potency and clinical efficacy against IBVs than IAVs39,40, oseltamivir did not show significant activity to IBVs B/Victoria/504/2000 (B/Yamagata/16/88-like virus) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria/2/87-like virus). Conversely, administration of FNI9 significantly reduced viral lung titres to B/Victoria/504/2000 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 down to 0.3 mg kg−1 (Fig. 5g,h). Of note, viral replication in the lungs inversely correlated with the serum mAb concentration measured 2 h before infection (Extended Data Fig. 10).Collectively, these results indicate that a single administration of FNI9 mAb at 0.3 mg kg−1 is highly efficacious in preventing replication of both IAVs and IBVs in the lungs of BALB/c mice.DiscussionThe effectiveness of current influenza vaccines is often suboptimal due to mismatch with circulating seasonal strains, immunological imprinting and limited immunogenicity, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals2,41. Previous studies have shown that NA-directed antiviral drugs are effective in prophylaxis42,43, albeit their use in this setting is limited by their short half-life and potential selection of escape mutants. Furthermore, anti-NA serum antibodies have been shown to independently correlate with protection from IAV infection15,44. In comparison with other previously described anti-NA mAbs23,24, the FNI9 mAb presented in this study displays larger breadth and higher potency across seasonal IAVs and IBVs, including contemporary H3N2 strains. The SA receptor molecular mimicry exploited by the FNI9 mAb might provide an additional layer of protection from viral escapes, as the key interacting residues in the epitope are evolutionarily conserved in human and animal IAVs and IBVs and most of the NA mutations retrieved from in vitro resistance studies are associated with a fitness cost for the virus. Of note, molecular mimicry of the SA receptor was also observed for anti-HA mAbs45, which displayed limited breadth. The features of the FNI9 mAb combined with half-life extension through Fc modifications46 support its development as a single dose per season prophylaxis against influenza.The synergistic activity observed when FNI9 is combined with the MEDI8852 mAb is consistent with previous reports on the synergy between oseltamivir and anti-HA stem mAbs34. In addition, other studies have shown that anti-NA mAbs can increase the Fc-mediated protection by anti-HA stem mAbs47,48. We therefore speculate that FNI9 efficacy could be further increased by synergy with endogenous anti-HA stem antibodies elicited by previous infections or vaccinations.Collectively our findings support the notion that NA is an important target for influenza prophylaxis and justify ongoing efforts to produce recombinant stabilized NA immunogens49,50 to elicit broadly reactive NAI antibodies, thus contributing to the development of a universal influenza vaccine.MethodsCells and virusesCell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (HEK293T/17, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), MDCK-London (MDCK-LN) and A549), or Thermo Fisher Scientific (ExpiCHO-S and Expi293F cells). Expi293F and ExpiCHO-S cells were maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium (Gibco) and ExpiCHO Expression Medium (Gibco), respectively. FreeStyle 293-F cells (Thermo Fisher) used in the DMS experiments were cultured in pre-transduction FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher, 12338018) or post-transduction media consisting of DMEM + 10% FBS +1% HEPES + 1% Pen/Strep, with 1.5 μg/mL puromycin for selection. All cell lines used in this study were routinely tested for mycoplasma and found to be mycoplasma-free. Wild-type influenza strains were obtained from the International Reagent Resource (CDC) and the Centre for Biological Reference Materials (NIBSC). Propagation of viral stocks was performed as previously described51. In brief, MDCK-LN cells (FR-58, International Reagent Resource) were seeded at 6 × 106 cells in a T75 flask in growth medium (DMEM (11995040, Gibco), 10% FBS (97068-085, VWR), 0.01 M HEPES (15630-080, Gibco), 100 U ml−1 penicillin–100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (15140-122, Gibco)) and infected the next day at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in infection medium. Cells were washed twice with PBS before infection. Virus was diluted in infection medium (DMEM, 0.1% BSA, 0.01 M HEPES, 100 U ml−1 penicillin–100 µg ml−1 streptomycin) and added to cells for 1 h at 37 °C. After absorption, virus inoculum was removed, cells were washed once with PBS, and 10 ml of infection medium containing 2 µg ml−1 of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (100 mg; LS003740, Worthington Biochemical) was added to the flasks. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for IAV and 35 °C for IBV in a tissue culture incubator for 24 h. Infection medium were then harvested, spun at 2,000g for 5 min, and supernatant was collected, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Virus titres were determined by focus forming units (FFU) per millilitre, as described below.Sample donorsSamples from healthy individuals were obtained from Swiss blood donation centres. Blood donors agreed, by means of a written inform consent form, that their blood or certain components of it could be used anonymously for research purposes. Anonymous blood samples were banked and used for research at VIR Bellinzona in the context of study protocols approved by the local Institutional Review Boards (Canton Ticino Ethics Committee, Switzerland).B cell isolation and stimulationMemory B cells from the selected donors were isolated from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as follow: CD19+ B cells were enriched from PBMCs by staining with phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7-labelled anti-human CD19 (BD Biosciences) on ice for 30 min, followed by staining with anti-PE beads (Miltenyi Biotec) on ice for 20 min and, finally, positive selected on MACS-separation LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). NA1 from IAV (N1-IAV) reactive memory IgG+ B cells were isolated by staining with a biotinylated recombinant N1 (H5N1 IAV-NA; VIVA Biotech) in complex with streptavidin-AF647 (Life Technologies), anti-human IgA PE (Southern Biotech), anti-human IgM PE (BioLegend) and anti-human IgD PE (BD Bioscience) on ice for 45 min and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Cells were resuspended in IMDM with 10% FBS in the presence of 2.5 μg ml−1 CpG 2006, 500 U ml−1 IL-2, 5 ng ml−1 IL-6 (BD Pharmingen), 50 ng ml−1 IL-10 (ImmunoTools) and 10 ng ml−1 IL-21 (ImmunoTools) and seeded under clonal conditions on a monolayer of mesenchymal stem cells in 384-well microtitre plates (Corning). After 8–10 days, the supernatants were screened for their NAI activity in a high-throughput ELLA. The B cell supernatants that were having NAI activity were re-tested in a secondary screening against N1, N2 and N9 (VIVA Biotech) in a NAI assay MUNANA (NI-MUNANA). Cross-reactive memory B cells were lysed, and the variable regions of the heavy and light chain were cloned.Sequence analysis of mAbsComplementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from selected B cell culture and both the heavy and the light chain variable region (VH and VL) sequences were retrieved by PCR as previously described52. Using the database IMGT (http://www.imgt.org), the VH and VL gene family and the number of somatic mutations were determined by analysing the homology of the VH and VL sequences to known human V, D and J genes. Unmutated common ancestor (UCA) sequences of the VH and VL were constructed using IMGT/V-QUEST.The DNA sequences of the VH and VL regions of 14 clonally related mAbs (FNI1–FNI20) were aligned using the online multiple sequence alignment program Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Subsequently, the UCA sequence was generated using the UA inference application, and the generation and analysis of the phylogenetic tree were performed with dnamI software and AncesTree software53, respectively. A phylogenetic tree of the concatenated heavy and light chain sequences was generated assuming the same single somatic substitution process across both genes. Each heavy chain sequence was appended to the light chain sequence of the same clone for the purpose of phylogenetic reconstruction under the assumption of a single substitution process. A phylogenetic tree and ancestral states were inferred using raxml-ng with the Blosum62 amino acid substitution model54.Production of recombinant mAbsThe VH and VL regions were cloned into IgG1 and IgΚ expression vectors52 and expressed recombinantly by transient transfection of ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the ExpiFectamine CHO transfection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 8 days, cell culture supernatants were purified by protein A chromatography on ÄKTA Xpress Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (Cytiva) using HiTrap Protein A columns (Cytiva) followed by buffer exchange to histidine buffer using HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns (Cytiva). The purified antibodies were quantified using the MAbPac protein A column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The FNI17 and FNI19 Fabs were recombinantly produced by transient transfection of ExpiCHO using the same conditions reported for the full IgG antibodies. The FNI9 Fab was produced in HEK293 suspension cells. Purification was performed using CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 resin (5943462005, Thermo Scientific) followed by buffer exchange into PBS. The 1G01 Fab was obtained by fragmentation of the corresponding IgGs using the FabALACTICA Fab kit (A2-AFK-025, Genovis) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Transient expression of NA proteins on Expi cellsIAV and IBV NA protein coding sequences were cloned into the phCMV1 expression plasmid (Genlantis) under the control of the human CMV promoter. Immediately before transfection, ExpiCHO-S or Expi293F cells were seeded at 6 × 106 cells per millilitre or 3 × 106 cells per millilitre, respectively, in a volume of 5 ml in a 50-ml bioreactor. Cells were transfected with 5 µg NA plasmids using the ExpiFectamine CHO or ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the protocol provided with the transfection kit. Transfected cells were then incubated at 37 °C at 8% CO2 with an orbital shaking speed of 250 rpm (orbital diameter of 25 mm) for 48 h.Flow cytometry analysisSelection of cross-reactive plasma against group 1 and group 2 IAV NAs and the evaluation of the breadth of the best FNI mAbs were performed by binding to NA proteins expressed on the cell surface by flow cytometry. NA expressing ExpiCHO-S or Expi293F cells were harvested, washed twice in FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 2 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), counted and distributed into 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning). The sera or mAbs were serially diluted and incubated with the cells for 45 min on ice and then washed in FACS buffer. Alexa Fluor 647-labelled goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) was added at 1 µg ml−1 to the cells, following 20 min of incubation on ice. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and analysed on a ZE5 Flow Cytometer (Bio-Rad). Data were normalized to the NA-positive cell fractions and analysed with FlowJo software.Pseudoparticles productionNA-only based particles (NA-VLPs) were produced by transfecting HEK293T/17 cells in 56.7-cm2 cell culture dishes (NUNC). Cells were co-transfected using X-tremeGENE HP (Roche) with 1 µg of NA-expressing plasmid and with 8 µg of a complementing viral-genome reporter vector, pNL4-3.Luc+.E-R+. A 1:3 DNA:X-tremeGENE HP ratio was used and the transfection was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells were incubated for 72 h, then the supernatant was harvested and stored at −80 °C into aliquots. The pseudoparticles used in this study were generated with NAs from H1N1 A/swine Hebei/0116/2017, H1N2 A/swine/Kansas/A02246977/2021, H7N3 A/Ck/Ja/PAVX17170/2017, H7N3 A/Canadav504/2004, H6N4 A/mallard duck/Netherlands/30/2011, H6N5 A/aquatic bird/Korea/CN5/2009, H4N6 A/swine Ontario/01911-1/99, H5N6 A/Hangzhou/01/2021, H5N6 A/Ck/Suzhou/j6/2019, H7N7 A/Ck/621572/03, H5N8 A/Ck/Russia/3-29/2020 and H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013.Production of recombinant NA proteinsNA proteins containing an N-terminal IgK light chain secretion sequence, a 6×His-Tag, AviTag, a tetrabrachion tetramerization domain and a thrombin or tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site were expressed in Expi293F cells at 37 °C and 8% CO2. Cell culture supernatant was collected 4 days post-transfection and proteins were purified using Nickel-NTA agarose (Qiagen). Proteins were buffer exchanged into 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0) by dialysis or size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL Increase or Superdex 200 (16/600) (Cytiva) column. NA from A/Tanzania/205/2010, NA B/Perth/211/2001 and NA B/Malaysia/2506/2004 were buffer exchanged into PBS (136.8 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) by dialysis.ELLA384-Well (NUNC) or 96-well half-area ELISA (Corning) plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 25 µg ml−1 of fetuin. Plates were blocked with a 1% w/v solution of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS containing Ca2+Mg2+ (Gibco) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. In the meantime, mAbs were serially diluted and mixed with a fixed amount of recombinant NA proteins or NA-VLPs and the mix was transferred to fetuin-coated plates, previously washed. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the plates were washed and 1 µg ml−1 lectin from peanut-agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) labelled with horseradish peroxidase was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After further washing, SureBlue Reserve TMB 1-Component (KPL) was added, and plates were read at 450 nm after blocking the reaction with 1% hydrochloric acid solution.MUNANAmAbs were serially diluted and mixed with a fixed amount of recombinant NA proteins in 96-well black plates (Greiner) or 384-well black plates (TTP Labtech) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the MUNANA substrate (Sigma Aldrich) was added at a final concentration of 16.7 µM. The plates were incubated for 2.5–5 h at 37 °C, then the reaction was stopped with MUNANA stop solution (0.2 M glycine/50% Et-OH, pH 10.7) and the NA activity was measured by fluorescence using Cytation5 (excitation at 365 nm and emission at 445 nm).SPR assays to measure binding of Avi-tagged NA proteins by FabsMeasurements were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument. A CM5 chip with covalently immobilized anti-Avi tag polyclonal antibody (A00674-40, GenScript) was used for surface capture of NA proteins bearing the Avi tag (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE). Running buffer was filtered with HEPES-buffered saline with added P-20 and calcium chloride (HBS P+ CaCl2: 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% w/v P-20 and 10 mM CaCl2). The regeneration condition was two injections of 75 mM phosphoric acid for 1 min each. Measurements were performed at 25 °C. Experiments were performed with a fourfold dilution series of monomeric Fabs (800, 200, 50 and 12.5 nM) and were run as single-cycle kinetics.Data were double-reference subtracted and fit to a binding model using Biacore Insight software. The 1:1 binding model with a constant Rmax was used to estimate the kinetic parameters. For each ligand (NA protein), a constant Rmax, which is the maximum of all Rmax values for all Fab analytes from the default 1:1 binding analysis, was applied, under the assumption that all Fabs have the same Rmax for a specific NA protein ligand. The consistent capture level of each ligand over all cycles (within 8%) justifies this assumption. The experiment was performed twice with two technical replicates for each ligand (NA protein). Kd values were reported as the average of two replicates. For measurements in which the dissociation constant Kd is slower than the detection range of the instrument (Kd < 10−6 s−1), the binding affinity (Kd) is denoted as less than 0.01 nM.Virus titration and in vitro neutralization assaysVirus titres were determined by FFU assay on MDCK-LN cells, using immunofluorescence staining. MDCK-LN cells were seeded into flat-bottom tissue culture 96-well plates (3904, Corning) at 25,000 cells per well and cultured overnight at 37 °C in growth medium. Twenty-four hours later, fivefold dilutions of viral stocks were prepared in infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin, with each dilution tested in quadruplicate. Cells were washed with DMEM medium and then infected with 50 µl of diluted virus. After absorption at 37 °C for 30 min, inoculum was removed, cells were washed once in DMEM medium and 100 µl infection medium with 2.4% colloidal cellulose overlay (435244, Sigma) and 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin was added to each well. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C for IAV and 35 °C for IBV, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (AA233689L, Fisher) for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with wash/perm buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) to remove residual paraformaldehyde, then the cells were permeabilized with 100 µl wash/perm buffer for 30 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with 50 µl anti-influenza A or anti-influenza B nucleoprotein antibody (ab128193 or ab20711, Abcam) at 1:1,000 and 0.5% BSA in wash/perm buffer followed by three washes with wash/perm buffer. The cells were then incubated with 50 µl goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor Plus 647 (A-32728, Invitrogen) at 1:1,000 with 2 µg ml−1 Hoechst dye (10 mg ml−1; H3570, Invitrogen) in wash/perm buffer for 1 h and then three additional washes with wash/perm buffer. Plates were imaged on a S6 Universal M2 Plate Imager and resulting FFU titres were calculated by counting wells that contained 10–20 distinct foci.Microneutralization was evaluated in a multicycle assay by adapting a protocol previously described55. In brief, MDCK-LN cells were seeded into flat-bottom tissue culture 96-well plates at 25,000 cells per well and cultured overnight at 37 °C in growth medium. Twenty-four hours later, virus stocks were diluted in infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin for a final concentration of 70 FFU per well, cells were washed once with DMEM medium, then 50 µl of diluted virus was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. A nine-point 1:5 serial dilution of mAb was prepared in infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin, with each dilution tested in triplicate (final range: 50,000–0.128 ng ml−1). Diluted antibody was mixed 1:1 with colloidal cellulose overlay (final concentration of 2.4%) resuspended in infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin, then infected cells were washed once with DMEM medium and 100 µl antibody with cellulose overlay was added to the wells. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for IAV, 35 °C for IBV B/Victoria/2/87-like viruses and 35 °C for 48 h for IBV B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses in a tissue culture incubator. Viral replication was measured following the same procedure as described above for the virus titration assay. Plates were imaged on a Cytation5 plate reader. Whole-well images were acquired (12 images at ×4 magnification per well) and nucleocapsid-positive cells were counted using the manufacturer’s software. To control for background, the mean count of positive cells in uninfected wells was calculated and subtracted from all data points. All positive cell counts were normalized to the no-antibody treatment control. Data were analysed and graphed using GraphPad Prism software (v9.0.0). The IC50 values were calculated using a non-linear regression model (variable slope model, four parameters) of log(inhibitor) versus response and the IC50 values were interpolated from the curve at y = 50. The geometric mean of two independent experiments in which the antibody was tested in triplicate was calculated in Excel.To confirm the actual TCID50 of the input virus used in the neutralization assay for each viral strain, a TCID50 viral assay was carried out in parallel. For this assay, a twofold serial dilution of input virus in 50 μl was added to duplicate wells containing MDCK-LN cells and incubated in parallel to the microneutralization assay at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed once with DMEM, and 100 µl infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin was added to the cells and incubated with the neutralization plates. Viral replication was measured following the same procedure as described above for the virus titration assay. Infected wells were observed with the Cytation5 and resulting titres were calculated using the Reed–Muench method56. The target viral input for each experiment was 100 TCID50 per well.Assessment of synergyCell plating and virus infections were carried out using the in vitro virus neutralization procedure described above with all infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin. To assess the synergy between the two monoclonal antibodies, a seven-point 1:3 serial dilution of MEDI8852 was prepared in infection medium (final concentration: 10–0.01372 µg ml−1). Subsequently, a nine-point 1:3 serial dilution of FNI9 was prepared in infection medium (final concentration: 7.5–0.001143 µg ml−1) and mixed at 1:1 ratio with MEDI8852 in 2-ml deep-well plates creating a drug combo checkerboard matrix. The diluted drug combination was then mixed 1:1 with a colloidal cellulose overlay (final concentration of 2.4%). The infected cells were washed once with DMEM and 100 µl of antibody–drug combination with cellulose overlay was added to the wells, with each condition tested in triplicate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a tissue culture incubator. Viral replication was measured following the same procedure as described above in the virus titration assay and plates were imaged on the Cytation5 plate reader. Neutralization synergy was calculated by normalizing the signal of the treatment wells to no-antibody virus control wells and no-virus cell control wells and the values were imported to the web-based software SynergyFinder. The zero interaction potency statistical model was utilized to calculate total synergy scores, with values greater than 10 indicating likely synergy between the two drugs. Two independent experiments were performed with three technical replicates for each virus.In vitro resistance studiesAntibody-resistant mutants were isolated by screening the viral population in bulk or by serial passaging the virus in the presence of an escalating dose of antibody. For the former approach, MDCK cells were plated into 96-well plates (CON3596, Corning) at 30,000 cells per well in 100 μl of culture medium (MEM + GlutaMAX (41090-028, Thermo Fisher) + 10% FBS Hyclone (SH30070.03, VWR) + 50 U ml−1 penicillin–50 ng ml−1 streptomycin (4-01F00-H, Bioconcept) + 100 µg ml−1 kanamycin (15160047, Life Technologies) + 1% NEAA (5-13K00-H, Bioconcept) + 1% sodium pyruvate (11360039, Life Technologies) + 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol (5-69F00-E, Bioconcept)) and cultured overnight at 37 °C at 5% CO2. The day after, A/Hong Kong/1/1968 virus input was pre-incubated with 100 μg ml−1 of FNI19 antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. The virus–antibody mix was then limiting diluted in infection medium (MEM supplemented with 1 μg ml−1 TCPK-trypsin (LS003750, Bioconcept) and 10 μg ml−1 kanamycin) to infect MDCK cells at MOI of 0.001 in 100 μl, after two washing steps with 200 μl per well of PBS (D8537-500ML, Sigma-Aldrich). Three hours later, 100 μl per well of infection medium containing 100 μg ml−1 FNI19 was added, and cells were incubated for a further 72 h. After the incubation time, a 20 mM MUNANA substrate (69587-5MG, Sigma) solution was prepared in MUNANA buffer (32.5 mM MES and 4 mM CaCl2, pH 6.5) and 50 μl per well dispensed into 96-well plate to be incubated with an equal amount of assay culture supernatant for 1 h at 37 °C. Of stop solution (0.2 M glycine and 50% Et-OH, pH 10.7), 100 μl per well was added and fluorescence at 445 nm was measured with a Cytation5 (Biotek-Agilent). Fluorescence threshold was set to 5× the signal of not infected cells and supernatants above that cut-off were processed for NA sequencing. Viral genomic RNA was extracted from 140 μl of culture supernatant using the Qiagen QIAmp Viral RNA kit (52904, Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA was synthetized using the SuperScript III RT kit (18080044, Life Technologies) with the primer Uni12 (5′-AGC RAA AGC AGG-3′). The gene encoding NA was amplified by PCR using the Q5 HotStart DNA polymerase kit (M0493L, Bioconcept) with a specific primer forward: 5′-caattggctctgtctctct-3′ and reverse: 5′-atgaaattgatgttcgccc-3′. PCR product was purified from 1.5% agarose gel and sequenced with the three different primers: 5′-caattggctctgtctctct-3′, 5′-gaagagccgatactagaa-3′ and 5′-ttctagtatcggctcttc-3′. Sequence alignment with A/Hong Kong/1/1968 NA was performed with CLC Main Workbench 22 software.For the serial passaging resistance experiment, MDCK-LN cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 120,000 cells per well and cultured overnight at 37 °C in growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.01 M HEPES and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–100 µg ml−1 streptomycin). Twenty-four hours later, H1N1 A/California/07/2009 or A/New Caledonia/20/99 virus stock and FNI9 were diluted and mixed 1:1 in infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin for a final concentration of 1,000 PFU per well virus and 0.5× IC50 of FNI9 (47.35 ng ml−1). The virus–antibody mixture was placed at 37 °C and precomplexed for 30 min. Cell and virus control wells were included for cytophatic effects (CPE) comparators. The cells were washed twice in DMEM and then 100 µl of the virus–antibody complexed mixture, virus and cell controls were added to the wells for 1 h at 37 °C. After virus adsorption, the cells were washed twice in DMEM, then 500 µl of diluted antibody or infection medium containing 0.5 µg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin was added back to their respective wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and the virus was collected once there was over 50% CPE in the virus–antibody well. The virus supernatant was frozen in 120 µl aliquots at −80 °C, one aliquot was used for the next resistance passage, one aliquot was added to 360 µl of DNA/RNA Shield for RNA extraction, and one aliquot was saved for additional propagations. For passage 2, the process was repeated with the original 0.5× and a 1× IC50 concentration of FNI9, with the highest concentration of antibody showing CPE being selected for the next passage. For each additional passage, the concentration from the selected well was repeated along with a 2× concentration. For the CA09 study, there were eight passages of virus and a final concentration of 64× the IC50 of FNI9 (3,200 ng ml−1).For identification of genomic mutations, viral genomic RNA was extracted using the Zymo QuickRNA Viral Kit (R1034) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the RNA concentration was measured using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Q10210, Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III One-Step RT–PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (12574018, Invitrogen) using the MBTuni-12 (5′-ACGCGTGATCAGCAAAAGCAGG-3′) and MBTuni-13 (5′-ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG-3′) primers, and the PCR fragments were purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (A63880, Beckman Coulter). Next, the amplicons were fragmented using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E6177L, NEB), then adaptors and indexes were added using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (7335L, NEB). DNA samples were purified using NEBNext Sample purification beads and then quantified using the Qubit DNA HS Assay kit (Q32854, Invitrogen), and verified using a D500 tape station (G2964AA, Agilent). Finally, the samples were diluted and pooled, then sequenced using a MiSEQ analyser with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (MS-102-3003) and PhiX Control v3 (FC-110-3001). The NA mutations I223R and S247N first appeared in passages 6 and 7, respectively, and each reached 50% of the total next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads by passage 8.Measurement of Fc-effector functionsTo evaluate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC assay), MDCK-LN cells were infected with A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) at an MOI of 6. After 18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, cells were detached with trypsin, washed and dispensed into flat-bottom 384-well plates. Antibodies were serially diluted in AIM-V medium, mixed with infected target cells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After the incubation, guinea pig low tox complement (Cedarlane) previously diluted 1:5 with AIM-V medium was added to each well. Control wells containing target cells and complement with 50 µl of 2% Triton X-100 to measure maximal lysis or target cells and complement only to evaluate spontaneous lysis were also included. Cell death was quantified after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release using the LDH detection kit (11644793001, Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Using a kinetic protocol, the absorbance at 490 nm and 650 nm was measured once a minute for 8 min, and the percent specific lysis was determined.Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity was performed on A549 cells infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) at an MOI of 6. After 18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, infected target cells were detached with trypsin, washed and dispended into round-bottom 384-well plates (7.5 × 103 per well in AIM-V). The serial dilutions for antibodies were prepared in AIM-V, added onto cells, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Human natural killer (NK) cells were isolated from fresh blood using the MACSxpress WB NK cell isolation kit, human (130-127-695, Miltenyi Biotec) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. After the incubation, NK cells were added at a cell density of 4.5 × 104 per well, to reach an effector to target ratio of 6:1. Control wells to measure maximal lysis (containing target cells with 3% Triton X-100) and spontaneous lysis (containing target cells and effector cells without antibody) were also included. Cell death was determined after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 by measuring LDH release using a LDH detection kit (11644793001, Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Using a kinetic protocol, the absorbance at 490 nm and 650 nm was measured once every 2 min for 8 min, and the percent specific lysis was determined. Determination of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis was performed using ExpiCHO transiently expressing NA from A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and labelled with PKH67 (Sigma-Aldrich). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor were labelled with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) and used as a source of phagocytic effector cells. Antibodies were serially diluted in RPMI-1640 medium. Labelled target cells (1 × 104 per well) were incubated with the diluted mAbs for 10 min and then mixed with labelled PBMCs (1.8 × 105 per well). Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were stained for 20 min with APC-labelled anti-CD14 mAb (BD Pharmingen), BV605-labelled anti-CD16 mAb (BioLegend), BV711-labelled anti-CD19 mAb (BioLegend), PerCP/Cy5.5-labelled anti-CD3 mAb (BioLegend) and APC/Cy7-labelled anti-CD56 mAb (BioLegend) for the identification of CD14+ monocytes. After the incubation, cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before acquisition on a ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Bio-Rad). Data were analysed using FlowJo software. The percentage of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis was calculated as the percentage of monocytes (CD14+ cells) positive for PKH67. The assays were performed on two different donors and the area under the curves were calculated.Cryo-EM sample preparationA summary of sample preparation is provided in Supplementary Table 5. In brief, NA proteins were mixed with a 1.3–1.5-fold molar excess of FNI Fabs and incubated on ice for 1 h. Complexes were purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL Increase (Cytiva) column equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2. Complex containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore Sigma) before vitrification. Of 0.2–0.25 mg ml−1 of each NA–Fab complex with or without n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM) at 0.70× critical micelle concentration (CMC), 3 µl were loaded onto a freshly glow discharged 1.2/1.3 UltrAuFoil grids before plunge freezing using a Vitrobot MarkIV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a blot force of 3 and a blot time of 7 s at 100% humidity and 4 °C.Cryo-EM data collectionThe FNI9–NA (N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010) dataset was collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios equipped with a Gatan K3 direct detector and Gatan BioQuantum energy filter, operated with a slit width of 30 eV. Semi-automated data collection was carried out using SerialEM57 at a nominal magnification of ×81,000 in super-resolution mode giving a pixel size of 0.53 Å. The dose was 48 e− Å−2, fractionated over 40 frames of 75 ms each.For other datasets, data were acquired on either a 200 kV FEI Glacios transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a Falcon 4 camera, or a 300 kV FEI Titan Krios TEM equipped with a Gatan K3 Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon58 at a nominal magnification of ×150,000 and a pixel size of 0.927 Å for the Glacios datasets, and ×105,000 magnification and a pixel size of 0.823 Å for the Krios datasets. The dose rate was adjusted to 1.4 counts per pixel per second, and each movie was fractionated in 24 frames for 110 ms for Glacios datasets, and 35 or 38 frames for 40 ms for the Krios datasets.For each dataset, between 1,089 and 5,433 movies were collected with a defocus range comprised between −1.0 and −2.5 μm. A summary of data collection is provided in Supplementary Table 5.Cryo-EM data processingFor the FNI9–NA (N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010) dataset, Relion59,60 was used for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data processing. Dose-weighted movie frame alignment was done using a Relion implementation of MotionCor2 (ref. 61) to account for stage drift and beam-induced motion. The contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated for each micrograph using CTFFIND4 (ref. 62). A Laplacian-of-Gaussian algorithm was used for template-free automated particle picking. Extracted particles were subjected to 2D classification and only those contributing to detailed views of a NA–Fab average were used for further analysis. An initial 3D map was generated ab initio from all selected particles using Relion. An NA–Fab complex with four Fabs bound was used as input to 3D classification where 3-Fab and 4-Fab complexes were separated. These separate 3D classes were submitted to further refinement that included CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing and masking. No symmetry (C1) was applied for the further refinement of the NA–3-Fab map, but C4 symmetry was applied for the NA–4-Fab refinement.For all other datasets, dose-weighted movie frame alignment was done using MotionCor2 (ref. 61) or full-frame or Patch motion correction in cryoSPARC63 to account for stage drift and beam-induced motion. The CTF was estimated for each micrograph using CTFfind4 (ref. 62), gCTF64 or Patch CTF in cryoSPARC. Individual particles are selected using automated picking protocols and extracted into particle stacks in either Relion59,60 or cryoSPARC. Extracted particles and/or 2D classes showing intact particles from Relion 3.0 were subjected to 2D and/or 3D classification in cryoSPARC. Initial maps were generated ab initio from all selected particles. The best 3D classes were submitted to homogeneous 3D refinement that included dynamic masking and either C1 (for 1-Fab or 3-Fab bound NAs) or C4 (for 4-Fab bound NAs) symmetry applied.Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation of 0.143 criterion65. A summary of cryo-EM data statistics is provided in Supplementary Table 5.Cryo-EM model building and analysisAtomic model of N2 NA from A/Tanzania/205/2010 H3N2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 4GZX) or NA from B/Phuket/3073/2013 (PDB: 6V4O) were used as the initial model to fit into cryo-EM maps by UCSF Chimera66. Coot67 and ISOLDE68 were used to manually rebuild amino acid mutations and glycans on NAs and build the Fabs. Models were self-restrained by ProSMART69 and refined by Refmac Servalcat70 in the ccpem v1.6.0 software suite71. Model validation and map-model FSC were generated by validation: model tool in ccpem v1.6.0.Figures were generated using Pymol72. Epitopes in all NA complexes were identified by determining NA residues within 5.0 Å of any atoms in FNI Fabs, 1G01, SA or oseltamivir using MOE (v2020.0901; https://www.chemcomp.com) contact analysis with default settings. MOE QuickPrep was used to prepare the NA complexes for static epitope analysis.Glycan profiling of NA with peptide mapping LC–MSPeptide mapping with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) was used to profile the site-specific glycosylation sites on two NAs (A/Tanzania/205/2010 and A/Hong Kong/2671/2019). Glycopeptides containing only one specific glycan were achieved by selectively digesting with trypsin, Glu-C, Lys-C or Asp-N protease, depending on the sequence context. Of each digest product (peptide with a single glycan), 25 µg was analysed by LC–MS (Agilent AdvanceBio peptide mapping column and Thermo Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS). Peptide mapping data were analysed on Biopharma Finder 3.2 data analysis software. Technical replicates were performed by injecting 25 µg of digested product three times from the same sample vial into the LC–MS.MD methodsThe coordinates of FNI17–NA (Tanzania/2010) and FNI9–NA (Tanzania/2010) were obtained from cryo-EM (see above) with glycans determined by peptide mapping LC–MS (Extended Data Fig. 7) modelled using ISOLDE as previously described68,73. The resulting model was then prepared using QuickPrep (MOE v2020.0901; https://www.chemcomp.com).The FNI9–NA tetramer and FNI17–NA tetramer complex structures were each parameterized for MD using tleap in AMBER74 with the ff14SB protein force field75, the GLYCAM_06j-1 glycan force field76 and the TIP3P water force field77; the Joung and Cheatham force field78 was used for ions.We generated 11.5 μs of aggregate MD for each of the two FNI–NA complexes—23 μs in total—by performing ten independent MD simulations each seeded with different initial velocities. Each of these 20 simulations was minimized and equilibrated as previously described79. Specifically, all heavy atoms resolved in the experimental data were restrained: during minimization, 100 ps of MD heating to 300 K; 100 ps of MD at 300 K; 250 ps of MD with a tenfold weaker restraint force constant at 300 K. With all backbone atoms resolved in the structure restrained: 10,000 steps of minimization; 100 ps of MD at 300 K; 100 ps of MD at 300 K (tenfold weaker restraint force constant); 100 ps of MD at 300 K with a further tenfold reduced force constant; 100 ps of MD at 300 K with another tenfold reduced force constant (0.1 kcal per mol Å2). Finally, 2.5 ns of unrestrained MD at 300 K. Production MD involved 0.8 μs of unrestrained MD simulation for each of the 20 independent simulations, followed by an additional 0.7 μs for five of the FNI9–NA and five of the FNI17–NA simulations for an aggregate of 11.5 μs of MD for FNI17–NA and 11.5 μs of MD for FNI9–NA.Simulations were processed using cpptraj80 as previously described79. Epitope–paratope interactions were computed using contact analysis in MOE (CCG MOE 2020.09) in which all hydrogen bond, metal, ionic, arene and distance-based interactions (within 5 Å) were accounted for. This analysis was performed on MD frames sampled every 10 ns. The MOE energy scores reported are the average energy for each interaction pair in the aggregate MD. The percent occupancy reported reflects the percentage of frames in the 11.5-μs MD simulation datasets in which a particular contact was present.In vivo studiesProphylactic efficacy of muFNI9 and muFM08 in BALB/C mice infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 was assessed at Burleson Research Technology Inc. (North Carolina) following approval of animal procedures by the Testing Facility’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Seven-to-eight-week-old BALB/c female mice (Charles River Laboratories) received a single dose of muFNI9, muMEDI8852, muFNI9(N297Q), muMEDI8852(N297Q) or vehicle control on day −1 via intravenous injection, 24 h before infection, based on day −2 individual body weight. On day 0, animals (n = 6 per group) were infected intranasally with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (VR-95PQ, ATCC). Mice were monitored once daily from days 0–3, and twice daily from days 4–14. Body weight was measured daily from day 4 to day 14, and serum was collected at day 0 (pre-infection) for mAb quantitation.The prophylactic activity of MEDI8852 and FNI17 mAbs administered singly or in a 1:1 combination on the response to H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 infection or human MEDI8852, FNI19 and muMEDI8852 and muFNI9 mAbs on the response to H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968 was assessed in BALB/c female mice at 0.25 or 0.125 mg kg−1. Body weight loss and survival from days 0 through to day 14 post-infection were used as major end point. The area of the negative peaks, defined as the area between the body weight line of each animal over the 14 days and the 0% body weight loss baseline, was calculated using GraphPad prism 9 and used to compare the prophylactic activity of the anti-HA stem, anti-NA and the combination of the two mAbs.The prophylactic efficacy of FNI9 to influenza B/Victoria/504/2000 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 was assessed in 7–8-week-old BALB/c female mice by administering a single dose of FNI9 or vehicle control on day −1 via intravenous injection, 24 h before infection. Mice in the oseltamivir (MedChemExpress) treatment groups received 10 mg kg−1 of small drug via oral gavage 2 h pre-infection, 6 h post-infection and then once daily until day 3 post-infection based on day −2 individual body weight. Animals were infected intranasally with influenza B/Victoria/504/2000 or influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 (ViraPur) virus on day 0. Serum was collected 2 h before infection on day 0 for IgG quantitation. Animals were euthanized on day 3 and lung and body weights were recorded. Infectious virus titres were measured in lung homogenate supernatants collected on day 3 (PFU per gram of lung) using a plaque assay.The in vivo prophylactic studies involving human FNI9 IgG mAb and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and A/Singapore/INFHH-16-19/2016 viruses were performed in compliance with federal laws and institutional guidelines and have been approved by the Washington University in St. Louis IACUC. Seven-to-nine-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomized based on age before antibody treatment and virus infection. Anti-NA mAbs were administered as a single intravenous injection 24 h before virus infection. For oseltamivir treatment, the mice were orally dosed with 10 mg kg−1 of oseltamivir phosphate 2 h before infection and then once daily for 5 days. On the day of infection, mice were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane and intranasally infected with 5 times the lethal dose 50 (5 LD50) of viruses diluted in 50 μl of PBS. After infection, mice were monitored daily, and their weights were recorded. To determine lung viral titres, mice were killed 4 days post-infection. Lungs were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of MEM, and serial dilutions of homogenates were incubated on MDCK-LN cells for 1 h at 37 °C followed by two PBS washes. Of infection medium (MEM with 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 50 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 100 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 0.5 μg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin), 200 µl was added to the cells. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, 50 µl of supernatants were removed and added to 50 µl of 0.5% turkey red blood cells and the end point dilution of haemagglutination was scored. TCID50 titres were calculated using the Spearman–Karber formula.IgG quantification was performed using an electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay. Standard curve and quality controls were diluted in BALB/C mouse serum (Biovit) and stored at −20 °C in aliquots until needed for the quantitation assay. Reagents and samples were equilibrated to room temperature for at least 30 min. Sera, standard curve and QCs were then centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min before use. For the murine mAbs quantification, multi-array 96-well standard plates (Meso Scale Discovery) were coated with NA protein (N9) or HA protein (H5) at 4 µg ml−1 or 2 µg ml−1, respectively. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, then washed with PBS–0.05% Tween (PBS-T) and blocked with casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher) at room temperature for 2 h. Sera were diluted 1:20 with BALB/C mouse serum, followed by a 1:50 (for anti-NA mAb) or 1:100 (for anti-HA mAb) dilution with casein, that was performed for standard curve and QCs as well. Plates were washed with PBS-T, then 50 µl of diluted samples, standard curve and QCs were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse-SULFO TAG (Meso Scale Diagnostics) was used for detection at a concentration of 1 µg ml−1 for FNI9 and 0.75 µg ml−1 for muMEDI8852 to the plates previously washed with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h. After final washes with PBS-T, 150 µl of MSD Read buffer was added per well, and plates were read on an MESO Quickplex SQ 120. Human mAbs were quantified with the same method but using an anti-LS antibody for capture and anti-CH2-SULFO TAG for detection.Deep mutational scanning profilingA deep mutational scanning approach was used to determine how NA amino acid mutations affect mAb binding. A cell-surface display library based on N1 A/California/07/2009 was generated with all variants for 170 select amino acids included. The mutated residues include epitope residues within 8.0 Å distance from bound Fabs obtained from cryo-EM (FNI17–Fab and FNI19–Fab in complex with N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010; this study) and crystal structures (FNI3–Fab with N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010 (unpublished), 1E01–Fab (PDB: 6Q20), Mem5–Fab (PDB: 2AEP) and B10–Fab (PDB: 6N6B)). In addition, residues with known sequence variation in GISAID in the past 20 years for H1N1 and H5N1 were included.Library construction, lentivirus production, next-generation sequencing and data deconvolution were performed by the Genetic Perturbation Platform (GPP) of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. A detailed description of each of these methods has been previously described81. For library synthesis, the lentiviral vector pMT025 encoding the wild-type N1 A/California/07/2009 open reading frame with the addition of a C-terminal minimal HA tag via a 2×G4S linker was synthesized and used as a template to generate the variant library pool. The full-length variant pool with 5′ and 3′ flanking adapters containing NheI and MluI, respectively, was synthesized at Twist Biosciences. Following restriction digest cloning and pDNA amplification, the variant composition of the pDNA library was assessed by NGS using the Illumina Nextera XT platform. All 3,472 designed variants were detected, and the distribution of the variants was approximately log-normal with a 1.3-fold standard deviation in the read counts across the variants. Lentiviral particles were produced according to protocols available through the GPP (http://www.broadinstitute.orgnai/publicesources/protocols). The library was transduced into FreeStyle 293-F Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a MOI of approximately 0.3 and maintained at an average representation of 2,000 cells per variant.For the screen, mAb binding to cell-surface-displayed NA was determined by flow cytometry. mAbs were directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through free amine conjugation to enable fluorescence-based detection. 293-F cells containing the NA variant library were harvested 5–7 days after puromycin selection, washed in PBS containing 3% BSA and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mAbs for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then sorted in technical duplicate on two separate sorters (BD Aria Fusion or Sony MA900). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A minimum of 60 million cells were prepared for FACS per technical replicate. 293-F cells expressing the NA variant library were sorted by FACS into negative, low and high mAb-binding bins, and the distribution of variants in each bin was determined by NGS as described below. The NA open reading frame includes a minimal C-terminal HA tag, which was also screened against using the Alexa Fluor 488 anti-HA.11 epitope tag antibody (BioLegend) to determine how mutations at each of the 170 selected residues affect general protein expression. For each screen, a minimum of 5 million unsorted library cells were collected to serve as unsorted controls.Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted samples and unsorted controls with the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (with the following modification: 0.3 M NaCl was added to the lysis buffer and incubation at 56 °C extended to 4 h) and the QIAamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen), respectively. Genomic DNA was prepared for NGS as previously described81. In brief, the open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with the following primers (forward: 5′-ATTCTCCTTGGAATTTGCCCTT-3′ and reverse: 5′-CATAGCGTAAAAGGAGCAACA-3′) and processed for NGS using the Illumina Nextera XT kit. Samples were sequenced using the Nextseq2000 sequencing platform to obtain paired-end reads with 2 × 150 cycles. Sequence data processing and variant calling using the mutant detection software ASMv1.0 was performed as previously described81. Normalized reads for each sample are log2 transformed. log2 fold-change values comparing the negative sorted bin to the unsorted pool and the low-binding and high-binding FACS-sorted bins for each library variant were computed and then averaged both for the anti-HA tag and the anti-NA antibody. Potential escapes were defined as those having an HA tag signal close to the silent mutations (maximum of two standard deviations away from the mean of the silent mutations) and having an anti-NA signal close to the stop codon mutations (maximum of three standard deviations away from the mean of the stop codon mutations).Sequence conservation analysisH3N2 (IAV), H1N1 (IAV), H5N1 (IAV), H7N9 (IAV), H5N8 (IAV), H5N6 (IAV), Victoria (IBV) and Yamagata (IBV) NA protein sequences were retrieved from GISAID (www.gisaid.org). Protein sequences were aligned to a reference NA sequence using MAFFT82. For Fig. 2, the sequences used were retrieved from the GISAID repository from January 2000 to October 2022, and the respective reference used for alignment was A/California/07/2009 (NC_026434.1) for H1N1 sequences, A/NewYork/392/2004 (YP_308842.1) for H3N2 sequences and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (AAN39803.1) for Victoria and Yamagata IBV sequences. For Extended Data Fig. 5, the sequences used were retrieved in July 2022 and the respective reference used for alignment was A/NewYork/392/2004 (YP_308842.1) for H3N2, H1N1, H5N1, H7N9 H5N8 and H5N6 sequences, and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (AAN39803.1) for Victoria and Yamagata IBV sequences. The multiple sequence alignments were analysed with R (https://www.R-project.org/) v.4.0.4. The logo plots were generated with the R package ‘ggseqlogo’ v.0.1 (ref. 83). The conservation per residue was computed with the R package ‘Biostrings’ v.2.58.0 (https://bioconductor.org/packages/Biostrings).Statistical analysisAll statistical tests were performed as described in the indicated figure legends using Prism v9.0. The number of independent experiments performed is indicated in the relevant figure legends.Material availabilityMaterials generated in this study can be available on request from the corresponding authors and may require a material transfer agreement.Ethical statementAll experiments involving animals reported in Fig. 5a–d,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 9 were approved by the Burleson Research Technologies, Inc. (BRT) Animal Care and Use Committee (study number: BRT20220306, BRT 2022072 and BRTQ20220307) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (PHS assurance number D16-00898). The BRT has been accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International. The IACUC chair who approved the protocols was also the Lead Veterinarian for these studies, and together with the Study Director was kept apprised of body weight loss and clinical observations for these studies daily. In addition, both the Lead Veterinarian and the Study Director personally checked on the status of study mice throughout each of the studies.On the basis of extended experience with the influenza model at the BRT, specific weight loss limits were not set for the study reported in Fig. 5a–d and Extended Data Fig. 9 (BRT20220306 and BRTQ20220711), as mice with 30% (or greater) body weight loss had normal cage activity levels indicated by the ability to climb to access the food hoppers and build nests and to interact with cage mates as expected. In addition, mice with weight loss that exceeded 30% were shown to be able to recover from infection in this model. In such scenarios, the BRT would not euthanize the mouse but instead would wait until the next observation period to reassess behaviour along with any further body weight loss. At each observation period, both the Lead Veterinarian and the Study Director specifically checked for animals that met euthanasia requirements as listed in both the study protocol and the IACUC protocol.Given the nature of the study and the weight loss involved, measures were undertaken to minimize pain, distress and discomfort as much as possible, including providing DietGel to aid in providing hydration and nutrition from the time of infection through to day 14, increased frequency of animal observations (twice daily, at least 5 h between observations on days 4–14 and on other days if adverse clinical signs were observed), daily body weight and clinical observation updates provided to the Study Director and veterinarian, and humane euthanasia if animals were deemed unlikely to recover from infection.In addition to protocol-driven euthanasia requirements, although body weight loss was not used as an end point, it was used to further evaluate the mice and help to inform euthanasia decisions. If, for example, body weight loss was high and was not stabilizing and/or if body weight loss was high and other clinical signs (especially a strong decrease in movement or activity) were observed, animals were immediately humanely euthanized as either scenario was generally a good indication that the mouse was unlikely to recover from infection.Procedures, facilities and housing were in compliance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were euthanized at 3 days post-infection (Fig. 5g,h; BRT 2022072) or throughout a 14-day observation period (Fig. 5a–d and Extended Data Fig. 9; BRT20220306 and BRTQ20220711) according to the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2020 edition and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws.All experiments involving animals reported in Fig. 5e,f were approved by Washington University in St. Louis IACUC (Animal Welfare Assurance D16-00245). All facilities involving animal research were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Procedures, facilities and housing were in compliance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were euthanized at 4 days post-infection according to the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2020 edition and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws.A power analysis (80%) with type 1 error set at 5% based on an estimated effect size and historical data were used to determine animal numbers for experiments and to keep the number of animals used to a minimum.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

In addition to burden of disease and vaccine characteristics, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the systematic consideration of programmatic factors in developing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels. The additional factors to be systematically considered by NACI include: economics, ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability. Not all NACI Statements will require in-depth analyses of all programmatic factors. While systematic consideration of programmatic factors will be conducted using evidence-informed tools to identify distinct issues that could impact decision-making for recommendation development, only distinct issues identified as being specific to the vaccine or vaccine-preventable disease will be included. This statement contains NACI's independent advice and recommendations, which are based upon the best current available scientific knowledge. This document is being disseminated for information purposes. People administering the vaccine should also be aware of the contents of the relevant product monograph. Recommendations for use and other information set out herein may differ from that set out in the product monographs of the Canadian manufacturers of the vaccines. Manufacturer(s) have sought approval of the vaccines and provided evidence as to its safety and efficacy only when it is used in accordance with the product monographs. NACI members and liaison members conduct themselves within the context of PHAC's Policy on Conflict of Interest, including yearly declaration of potential conflict of interest. Summary of information contained in the NACI statement The following highlights key information for immunization providers on seasonal influenza vaccine. Several influenza vaccines are authorized in Canada and the evidence on influenza immunization is continually evolving. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence and update its recommendations as needed. Please refer to the remainder of the statement for details. What Influenza in humans is a respiratory infection caused primarily by influenza A and B viruses. Seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually in Canada, generally in the late fall and winter months. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza had an annual attack rate estimated at 5 to 10% in adults and 20 to 30% in children worldwideFootnote 1. Symptoms of influenza can range from mild to severe, and typically come on suddenly. They can include fever, cough, and muscle aches. Other common symptoms include headache, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur, especially in children. Most people will recover within a week to 10 days, but some people are at greater risk of severe complications, such as pneumonia. Influenza infection can also worsen certain chronic conditions, such as heart diseaseFootnote 2. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) and inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) (which include standard dose [SD], high dose [HD], cell culture-based [cc] or adjuvanted vaccines [Adj]) are all authorized for use in Canada; some protect against 3 strains of influenza virus (i.e., trivalent formulations: IIV3) and some protect against 4 strains of influenza virus (i.e., quadrivalent formulations: IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4). See Appendix A for a list of abbreviations used in this document for the different influenza vaccines. The influenza vaccines are safe and well-tolerated. The IIVs and RIV cannot cause influenza illness because they do not contain live virus. The live attenuated influenza vaccines contain weakened viruses. Who NACI makes the following recommendations for individual-level and public health program-level decision making. Individual-level recommendations are intended for people wishing to protect themselves from influenza and for vaccine providers advising individual patients about preventing influenza. Program-level recommendations are intended for provinces and territories responsible for making decisions on publicly funded immunization programs. Individual-level and program-level recommendations may differ, as the important factors to consider when recommending a vaccine for a population (e.g., population demographics, economic considerations) may be different than for an individual. Recommendation for individual-level decision making NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine, with focus on the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended. These groups include: People at high risk of severe disease, influenza-related complications, or hospitalization; People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk; People who provide essential community services; and People in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations. In infants less than 6 months of age, evidence is lacking to demonstrate that influenza vaccine would be effectiveFootnote 3. Currently, authorized influenza vaccines are not indicated for use in infants less than 6 months of age. For these reasons, NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should not be offered to infants less than 6 months of age. Since infants less than 6 months of age are at high risk of influenza-related illness, the influenza vaccine should be offered to individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, and any household contacts and care providers of young infants. Recommendation for public health program-level decision-making The national goal of the annual influenza immunization programs in Canada is to prevent serious illness caused by influenza and its complications, including death. Programmatic decisions to provide influenza vaccination to target populations as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs depend on many factors, such as cost-effectiveness evaluation and other programmatic and operational factors. NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered as a priority to the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended. How The benefits and risks of influenza vaccination should be discussed prior to vaccination, including the risks of not being immunized. Choice of influenza vaccine A variety of influenza vaccines are authorized for use in Canada, some of which are authorized for use only in specific age groups. Furthermore, not all products will necessarily be made available in all jurisdictions and availability of some products as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs may be limited. Therefore, the choice of influenza vaccine has become more complex. Dose and route of administration The dose and route of administration vary by influenza vaccine product: Most IIVs are administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection IIV4-HD (Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent) is administered as a 0.7 mL IM injection and authorized for adults 65 years of age and older. MF59-adjuvanted IIV3-Adj (Fluad®) is administered as a 0.5 mL IM injection and authorized for adults 65 years of age and older. A pediatric formulation is also available (Fluad Pediatric®), and is administered as a 0.25 mL IM injection for children 6 to 23 months of age. RIV4 (Supemtek™) is administered as a 0.5 mL IM injection and authorized for adults 18 years of age and older. LAIV (FluMist® Quadrivalent) is administered as 0.2 mL given intranasally (0.1 mL in each nostril) and authorized for individuals 2 to 59 years of age. See Appendix B for information on characteristics of all influenza vaccines expected to be available for use in Canada for the 2023–2024 influenza season. Schedule NACI recommends that: Adults and children 9 years of age and older should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine each year; and Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have never received the seasonal influenza vaccine in a previous influenza season should be given 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the current season, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have been vaccinated with one or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in any previous season should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season thereafter. Contraindications For all influenza vaccines (IIV, RIV and LAIV), NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should not be given to: People who have had an anaphylactic reaction to a specific influenza vaccine, or to any of the components of a specific influenza vaccine, with the exception of egg Egg allergy is not a contraindication for influenza vaccination, as there is a low risk of adverse events (AEs) associated with the trace amounts of ovalbumin allowed in some influenza vaccines manufactured using eggs. Egg-allergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using any age-appropriate product, including LAIV, without prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg, and in any setting where vaccines are routinely administered. Cell culture-based (IIV4-cc) and recombinant (RIV4) vaccines are egg-free (ovalbumin-free). As with any vaccine product, all vaccine providers should be prepared to manage possible allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and have the necessary equipment to respond to a serious adverse event at all times. If an individual is found to have an anaphylactic reaction to a component in one influenza vaccine, consideration may be given to offering another influenza vaccine that does not contain the implicated component, in consultation with an allergy specialist. Individuals who have an allergy to substances that are not components of the influenza vaccine are not at increased risk of allergy to influenza vaccine. People who have developed Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination, unless another cause was found for the GBS For these people, the potential risk for a recurrent episode of GBS associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the benefits of influenza vaccination. For LAIV, in addition to the above-mentioned contraindications, NACI also recommends that LAIV should not be given to: People with severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing) or medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to the proposed date of vaccination, due to increased risk of wheezing following administration of LAIV LAIV is not contraindicated for people with a history of stable asthma or recurrent wheeze which is not active. Children less than 24 months of age, due to increased risk of wheezing following administration of LAIV Children 2 to 17 years of age currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy, because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection Pregnant individuals, because it is a live attenuated vaccine and there is a lack of safety data at this time LAIV is not contraindicated in breastfeeding (lactating) individuals; however, there are limited data for the use of LAIV in this population. People who are immunocompromised due to underlying disease and/or therapy LAIV is not considered to be contraindicated for children living with stable HIV infection on anti-retroviral therapy (ART; also sometimes referred to as highly active anti-retroviral therapy [HAART)]) and with adequate immune function. NACI previously concluded that the quantity of evidence available on the immunogenicity and safety of LAIV in adults with HIV is insufficient to justify a recommendation for the use of LAIV in this group. In addition, NACI considered that most studies found LAIV to have similar or slightly lower efficacy than IIV in adults and consequently recommends IIV for adults with chronic conditions. Refer to the Recommendation on the Use of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) in HIV-Infected Individuals for additional information. LAIV should not be administered until 48 hours after the last dose of an antiviral agent active against influenza (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir), and such antiviral agents, unless medically indicated, should not be administered until 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV so that the antiviral agents do not inactivate the replicating vaccine virus. If these antiviral agents are administered within this time frame (i.e., from 48 hours pre-vaccination with LAIV to 2 weeks post-vaccination), re-vaccination should take place at least 48 hours after the antivirals are stopped, or a parenteral inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine could be given at any time. Precautions NACI recommends that: Influenza vaccination should usually be postponed in people with serious acute illnesses until their symptoms have abated; Influenza vaccination should not be delayed because of minor or moderate acute illness, with or without fever. Immunizers should refer to Guidance on the use of influenza vaccine in the presence of COVID-19 for additional advice on this issue from PHAC. More information on vaccinating individuals during acute illness can be found in the Canadian Immunization Guide's section on Contraindications and precautions associated with specific conditions: Acute Illness. If significant nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of LAIV to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, parenteral inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine can be administered or LAIV can be deferred until resolution of the congestion; LAIV recipients should avoid close contact with people with severe immune compromising conditions (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for at least 2 weeks following vaccination, because of the theoretical risk for transmitting a vaccine virus and causing infection; and LAIV recipients who are less than 18 years of age should avoid the use of aspirin-containing products for at least 4 weeks after receipt of LAIV because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin-containing products and wild-type influenza infection. Concurrent administration with other vaccines NACI recommends that: Administration of COVID-19 vaccines may occur concurrently with (i.e., same day), or at any time before or after seasonal influenza immunization for those aged 6 months and older. Readers should consult the Canadian Immunization Guide COVID-19 chapter for updated NACI guidance on the concurrent administration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines as the number of authorized COVID-19 vaccines and the age groups eligible to receive them expand. It should be noted that no studies have been conducted on the co-administration of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) with adjuvanted or high-dose influenza vaccine. No immune response interference or safety concerns have been demonstrated when RZV is administered concurrently with standard, un-adjuvanted vaccineFootnote 4. Different injection sites and separate needles and syringes should always be used for concurrent parenteral injections. If multiple injections in the same limb are required, the injection sites should be separated by at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). Why Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccination can help prevent the spread of influenza from person-to-person. Although most people will recover fully from influenza infection in 7 to 10 days, influenza can lead to severe disease, complications, or both, including hospitalization and death. Influenza is the most common vaccine preventable disease leading to hospitalization and death in adults. Annual vaccination is required because the specific strains in the vaccine are reviewed each year by WHO and are often changed to provide a better match against the viruses expected to circulate in that given year, and because the body's immune response to influenza vaccination may be transient and may not persist beyond a year. I. Introduction The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides PHAC with annual recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, which reflect identified changes in influenza epidemiology, immunization practices and influenza vaccine products authorized and available for use in Canada. This document, the "National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2023–2024", updates NACI's recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines. I.1 New or updated information for 2023–2024 Use of seasonal influenza vaccine in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Guidance on the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in the presence of COVID-19 Seasonal influenza presents an ongoing disease burden in Canada during the fall and winter months. Influenza vaccine is the most effective way to prevent influenza illness and influenza-related complications and is an important component of managing health care system capacity during the influenza season, particularly in the context of ongoing COVID-19 activity. PHAC, in consultation with NACI and the Canadian Immunization Committee, has developed guidance on the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to support provincial and territorial vaccine programs and primary care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Guidance on the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in the presence of COVID-19 The guidance on this page is based on currently available scientific evidence and expert opinion and will be updated as necessary throughout the influenza season. This web page should be considered in concert with recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines provided in this NACI Statement. Guidance on concurrent administration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines NACI guidance outlines that administration of COVID-19 vaccines may occur at the same time as, or at any time before or after influenza immunization (including all parenteral or intranasal seasonal influenza vaccines) for those aged 6 months of age and older. Readers should consult the COVID-19 vaccine: Canadian Immunization Guide chapter for updated NACI guidance and further information on concurrent administration of COVID-19 vaccines with influenza vaccines and across all eligible age groups. Updated recommendations on the use of mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4-cc) Flucelvax® Quad (IIV4-cc) is a standard dose mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine that was first authorized for use in Canada in adults and children 9 years of age and older on November 22, 2019 with authorization extended to children 2 years of age and older on March 8, 2021. Recommendations and supporting evidence on the use of Flucelvax Quad in adults and children 9 years of age and older can be found in the NACI Supplemental Statement – Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza Vaccines and were also incorporated into the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022. Recommendations and supporting evidence on the use of Flucelvax Quad in adults and children 2 years of age and older were incorporated into the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023. On March 8, 2022, Health Canada approved an expanded age indication for the use of Flucelvax Quad in children down to 6 months of age and older. Based on a review of Health Canada assessments of clinical trial evidence submitted by the manufacturer in support of the age indication extension, NACI has concluded that Flucelvax Quad is safe and has non-inferior immunogenicity compared to standard quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines. Therefore, NACI recommends that Flucelvax Quad may be considered among the quadrivalent influenza vaccines offered to adults and children 6 months of age and older. (Discretionary NACI recommendation). Updated recommendations on the use of egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD) Influvac® Tetra (IIV4-SD) is a split virus standard quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine that was first authorized for use in Canada in adults on March 1, 2019 and subsequently in children 3 years of age and older on February 20, 2020. Recommendations and supporting evidence on the use of Influvac Tetra in adults and children 3 years of age and older were incorporated into the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022. On November 30, 2021, Health Canada approved an expanded age indication for the use of Influvac Tetra in children 6 months of age and older. Based on a review of Health Canada assessments of clinical trial evidence submitted by the manufacturer in support of the age indication extension, NACI has concluded that Influvac Tetra appears to be safe and well-tolerated (relative to the control non-influenza vaccines) based on direct evidence in children 6 to 35 months of age. However, there is currently insufficient evidence that Influvac Tetra is effective and elicits a protective immune response against seasonal influenza in children 6 to 35 months of age. Therefore: NACI recommends that Influvac Tetra may be considered among the standard dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines offered to individuals 3 years of age and older. (Discretionary NACI recommendation) At this time, NACI concludes that there is insufficient evidence for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra in children younger than 3 years of age. (Discretionary NACI recommendation). NACI will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges, and update recommendations as needed. Standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD) authorization and availability All standard dose, egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines authorized and available in Canada for the 2023–24 season are expected to be quadrivalent. There are no trivalent formulations (IIV3-SD) authorized (discontinued post-market) or available, but data that involve these vaccines continue to be included for reference. Updated presentation of the statement The presentation of this document has been updated from previous seasons' statements to improve readability and access to information. The content in some sections has been reduced in length, while maintaining a focus on key information required for decision making. Links to other published NACI documents containing the more detailed content removed from the current statement have been integrated. For a summary of clinical information on seasonal influenza vaccine administration for vaccine providers, please refer to the new Influenza vaccine chapter of the Canadian Immunization Guide. I.2 Background The World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines are typically available in February of each year for the upcoming season in the Northern Hemisphere. The WHO recommends that three influenza strains be included in the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine: one influenza A(H1N1), one influenza A(H3N2), and one influenza B. Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines should contain the three strains recommended for the trivalent vaccine, as well as an influenza B virus from the lineage that is not included in the trivalent vaccine. Health care providers in Canada should offer the seasonal influenza vaccine as soon as feasible after it becomes available and is delivered in the fall, since seasonal influenza activity may start as early as October in the Northern Hemisphere. Decisions regarding the precise timing of vaccination in a given setting or geographic area should be made according to local epidemiologic factors (influenza activity, timing, and intensity), opportune moments for vaccination, as well as programmatic considerations. Further advice regarding the timing of influenza vaccination programs may be obtained through consultation with local public health agencies. Although vaccination before the onset of the influenza season is strongly preferred, influenza vaccine may still be administered up until the end of the season. Delayed administration may result in lost opportunities to prevent infection from exposures that occur prior to vaccination; therefore, individuals seeking or considering vaccination should be informed that vaccine administered during an influenza outbreak may not provide optimal protection. Vaccine providers should use every opportunity to administer influenza vaccine to individuals at risk who have not already been vaccinated during the current season, even after influenza activity has been documented in the community. Every year, individuals with influenza and influenza-related complications increase the pressures on the healthcare system in the fall and winter months. Particularly given the added burden on the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic, effective prevention of influenza by vaccination is a critical tool to mitigate on-going health system stress. II. Methods Details regarding NACI's evidence-based process for developing a statement are outlined in Evidence-based recommendations for immunization − Methods of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. In brief, the broad stages in the preparation of this NACI advisory committee statement included: Knowledge synthesis Synthesis of the body of evidence of benefits and harms, considering the quality of the synthesized evidence and magnitude and certainty of effects observed across the studies Translation of evidence into recommendations Annual influenza vaccine recommendations are developed by the Influenza Working Group (IWG) for consideration by NACI. Recommendation development includes review of a variety of issues including the burden of influenza illness and the target populations for vaccination; safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and effectiveness of influenza vaccines; vaccine schedules. In addition, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the consideration of programmatic factors in developing their recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels. These programmatic factors include cost-effectiveness, as well as ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability (EEFA). NACI uses a published, peer-reviewed framework and evidence-informed tools to ensure that issues related to EEFA are systematically assessed and integrated into its guidance. The NACI Secretariat applied this framework with accompanying evidence-informed tools (Ethics Integrated Filters, Equity Matrix, Feasibility Matrix, Acceptability Matrix) to systematically consider these programmatic factors for the development of clear, comprehensive, appropriate recommendations for timely, transparent decision-making. For details on the development and application of NACI's EEFA Framework and evidence-informed tools, please see A framework for the systematic consideration of ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability in vaccine program recommendations. The annual update of the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine led by the NACI Influenza Working Group (IWG) involves a thorough review and evaluation of the literature as well as discussion and debate at the scientific and clinical practice levels. In the preparation of the 2023–2024 seasonal influenza vaccine recommendations, NACI's IWG identified the need for evidence reviews for new topics, and then reviewed and analyzed the available evidence, and proposed new or updated recommendations according to the NACI evidence-based process for developing recommendations. For the 2023–2024 influenza season, the NACI IWG reviewed evidence and developed new recommendations regarding the use of two vaccines with changes in authorization (expanded use in individuals six months of age and older): 1) Influvac Tetra, an egg-based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD) and 2) Flucelvax Quad, a mammalian cell culture-based, inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4-cc). The NACI IWG reviewed and analyzed the available pre-licensure clinical trial data and Health Canada's Clinical Review Reports for these two vaccines. On October 3rd, 2022, the available evidence and the new recommendations proposed by the IWG were presented for consideration and approval by NACI. Following a thorough review of the evidence, the committee voted on specific recommendations. The description of relevant considerations, rationale for specific decisions, and identified knowledge gaps are described in this statement. III. Epidemiology Disease description Influenza is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza A and B viruses in humans and can cause mild to severe illness, including hospitalization or death. Certain populations, such as young children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions, are at higher risk for serious influenza complications such as viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, and worsening of underlying medical conditions. Infectious agent There are two main types of influenza virus that cause seasonal epidemics in humans: A and B. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Three subtypes of HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of NA (N1 and N2) are recognized among influenza A viruses as having caused widespread human disease over the past decades. Immunity to the HA and NA proteins reduces the likelihood of infection and together with immunity to the internal viral proteins, lessens the severity of disease if infection occurs. Influenza B viruses have evolved into two antigenically distinct lineages since the mid-1980s, represented by B/Yamagata/16/88-like and B/Victoria/2/87-like viruses. Viruses from both the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages have contributed variably to influenza illness each year. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a reduction in seasonal influenza virus diversity has been observed globallyFootnote 5Footnote 6. In particular, an absence of B/Yamagata detections has been notedFootnote 5. Over time, antigenic variation (antigenic drift) of strains occurs within an influenza A subtype or a B lineage. The possibility of antigenic drift, which may occur in one or more influenza virus strains, requires the formulation of seasonal influenza vaccines be re-evaluated annually, with one or more vaccine strains changing in most seasons. Transmission Influenza is primarily transmitted by aerosols and droplets spread through coughing or sneezing, and through direct or indirect contact with respiratory secretions. The incubation period of seasonal influenza is usually about 2 days but can range from 1 to 4 daysFootnote 7. Adults may be able to spread influenza to others from 1 day before symptom onset to approximately 5 days after symptoms start. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be infectious longer. Risk factors The people at greatest risk of influenza-related complications are adults and children with chronic health conditions (see List 1), residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities, adults 65 years of age and older, children 0 to 59 months of age, pregnant individuals, and Indigenous peoples. Seasonal and temporal patterns Influenza activity in Canada is usually low in the late spring and summer, begins to increase over the fall, and peaks in the winter months. Depending on the year, one or more peaks may occur as early as the fall and into the spring. Influenza season in Canada usually begins in December and lasts 12 to 16 weeks but can start as early as October or as late as February, and last for as long as 20 weeks. Although one strain often predominates, more than one influenza strain typically circulates each season. Spectrum of clinical illness Classically, symptoms of influenza include the sudden onset of fever, cough, and muscle aches. Other common symptoms include headache, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur, especially in children. However, influenza can cause a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic infection through mild acute respiratory illness (a "cold") to severe influenza pneumonia. Most people will recover within a week or 10 days. More rarely, central nervous system manifestations, acute myositis, myocarditis, or pericarditis have been described. In addition, complications including pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiovascular complications, or worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions may occur. Influenza is also associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in the 7 to 14 days after infection, and with Guillain-Barre syndrome with onset 1 to 6 weeks after infectionFootnote 8. Disease incidence Global Before the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide annual epidemics resulted in approximately one billion cases of influenza, three to five million cases of severe illness, and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. The global annual attack rate is estimated to be 5 to 10% in adults and 20 to 30% in childrenFootnote 1. Global influenza circulation was at a historical low during the 2020-2021 influenza season, when public health measures (e.g., masking, social distancing) effectively suppressed seasonal influenza activity. During the 2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere season, influenza activity returned to varying degrees in different jurisdictions. During the 2022 Southern Hemisphere season, activity appeared to return to a pre-pandemic level, although incomplete data for the season, changes in testing associated with the pandemic, and the substantial inter-season variability of influenza activity make it difficult to make definitive conclusions. For current international influenza activity information, refer to WHO's Global Influenza Program website. National Together, influenza and pneumonia are ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in CanadaFootnote 9. Nationally, influenza has been estimated to cause approximately 12,200 hospitalizations and approximately 3,500 deaths annuallyFootnote 10Footnote 11. The FluWatch program is Canada's national surveillance system, which monitors the spread of influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) continually throughout the year. In the five seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (2014–2015 to 2018-2019 season), an average of 40,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were reported to FluWatch each year. However, most influenza infections are not laboratory-confirmed, so the number of cases reported to FluWatch is a significant underestimate of the true number of infections. The burden of influenza-associated illness and death varies every year, depending on various factors such as the type of circulating viruses in the season and the populations affectedFootnote 12. Notably, Canada's 2020-2021 seasonal influenza activity did not reach seasonal threshold and was at a historical low in the context of the public health measures that were implemented to reduce COVID-19 transmissionFootnote 13Footnote 14Footnote 15. Only 69 confirmed cases of influenza were identified during the 2020-2021 seasonFootnote 13, whereas over 50,000 laboratory confirmed cases are reported on average in a typical influenza seasonFootnote 13. During the 2021-2022 season, influenza circulation in Canada reached the national seasonal threshold that signals the start of seasonal influenza activity for the first time since the spring of 2020. The 2021-2022 influenza epidemic onset was in April 2022, which is an unusually late start to the influenza season. Although the potential impact of upcoming influenza seasons in the context of COVID-19 is unknown, future influenza outbreaks may be characterized by higher infection rates and severityFootnote 14Footnote 15. Influenza infection susceptibility may increase due to low immunity in the population given the extended periods of decreased influenza exposure and infection caused by the implementation of COVID-19-related public health measuresFootnote 13Footnote 16Footnote 17Footnote 18. Moreover, disease severity may be exacerbated due to the co-circulation and simultaneous infection of COVID-19 and influenza viruses. Additionally, the resurgence of seasonal influenza may not follow usual seasonal patternsFootnote 19Footnote 20. Information about current influenza activity can be found on the FluWatch website. It should be noted that the incidence of influenza is often underreported since the illness may be confused with other viral illnesses and many people with ILI do not seek medical care or have viral diagnostic testing done. IV. Seasonal influenza vaccines IV.1 Vaccine products authorized for use in Canada The following sections describe the influenza vaccine products that are authorized for use in Canada for the 2023–2024 season. All influenza vaccines available in Canada have been authorized by Health Canada. However, not all products authorized for use are available in the marketplace. The vaccine manufacturers determine whether they will make any or all of their products available in each market. Provincial and territorial health authorities then determine which of the products available for purchase will be used in their respective publicly funded influenza immunization programs and for which population groups. Not all products will be made available in all jurisdictions and availability of some products may be limited. Officials in individual provinces and territories should be consulted regarding the products available in individual jurisdictions. The antigenic characteristics of circulating influenza virus strains provide the basis for selecting the strains included in each year's vaccine. Vaccine selection by the WHO generally occurs in February for the fall's Northern Hemisphere influenza season to allow time for the vaccine manufacturers to produce the required quantity of vaccine. All manufacturers that distribute influenza vaccine products in Canada confirm to Health Canada that the vaccines to be marketed in Canada for the upcoming influenza season contain the WHO's recommended antigenic strains for the Northern Hemisphere. Vaccine producers may use antigenically equivalent strains because of their growth properties. The strains recommended for egg-based products may differ somewhat from the strains chosen for cell culture-based products to account for differences in the production platforms. There are three categories of influenza vaccine authorized for use in Canada: IIV, RIV, and LAIV. Trivalent (3-strain) vaccines contain one A(H1N1) strain, one A(H3N2) strain, and one influenza B strain from one of the two lineages. Quadrivalent (4-strain) vaccines contain the strains in the trivalent vaccine plus an influenza B strain from the other lineage. Most influenza vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada are made from influenza viruses grown in chicken eggs. However, there are two exceptions. The influenza viruses used to produce Flucelvax Quad are propagated in a mammalian cell line (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney [MDCK] cells), while the Supemtek vaccine technology uses recombinant HA produced in a proprietary insect cell line using a baculovirus vector for protein expression. A summary of the characteristics of influenza vaccines available in Canada during the 2023–2024 influenza season can be found in Appendix B. For complete prescribing information, readers should consult the product monographs available through Health Canada's Drug Product Database. Should additional vaccine preparations become available for use in Canada after the release of this statement and prior to the 2023-24 influenza vaccine season, NACI will communicate relevant information regarding the new vaccine preparations if required. Refer to Contents of immunizing agents available for use in Canada in Part 1 of the CIG for a list of all vaccines authorized for use in Canada. Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) IIVs contain standardized amounts of the HA protein from representative seed strains of the two human influenza A subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1) and either one (for trivalent vaccines) or both (for quadrivalent vaccines) of the two influenza B lineages (Yamagata and Victoria). IIVs currently authorized for use in Canada are a mix of split virus and subunit vaccines, both consisting of disrupted virus particles. In split virus vaccines, the virus has been disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components. The amount of neuraminidase (NA) in the vaccines is not standardized and not reported. HA-based serum antibody produced to one influenza A subtype provides no protection against strains belonging to another subtype. The potential for trivalent vaccine to stimulate antibody protection across B lineages requires further evaluation and may be dependent upon factors such as age and prior antigenic experience with the two B lineages Footnote 21Footnote 22 Footnote 23Footnote 24 Footnote 25Footnote 26. All IIVs currently available in Canada are produced in eggs, except for Flucelvax Quad (IIV4-cc), which is a mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent inactivated, subunit influenza vaccine that is prepared from viruses propagated in mammalian cell lines [proprietary 33016-PF Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell lines] adapted to grow freely in suspension in culture medium. The production of IIV4-cc does not depend on egg supply as it does not require egg-grown candidate vaccine viruses. The IIVs available in Canada are in a standard dose formulation or in a formulation designed to enhance the immune response in specific age groups, using a higher dose of HA antigen or the inclusion of an adjuvant. Refer to Basic immunology and vaccinology in Part 1 of the CIG for more information about inactivated vaccines. Standard-dose IIVs are available in Canada as quadrivalent formulations (IIV4-SD: Afluria® Tetra, Flulaval® Tetra, Fluzone Quadrivalent, and Influvac Tetra; IIV4-cc: Flucelvax Quad). These vaccines are un-adjuvanted, contain a standard dose of antigen (15 µg HA per strain), and are administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection. Influvac Tetra may be administered by IM or deep subcutaneous injection. Trivalent formulations of standard dose unadjuvanted IIVs are no longer authorized or available for use in Canada. The adjuvanted IIV currently authorized for use in Canada is a trivalent subunit vaccine (IIV3-Adj) that contains the adjuvant MF59, which is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene as the oil phase that is stabilized with the surfactants polysorbate 80 and sorbitan triolate in citrate buffer. IIV3-Adj contains 7.5 µg HA per strain administered as a 0.25 mL dose by IM injection for children 6 to 23 months of age (Fluad Pediatric) or 15 µg HA per strain administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection for adults 65 years of age and older (Fluad). Other IIVs do not contain an adjuvant. There is one high-dose IIV (IIV-HD) currently authorized for use in Canada; a quadrivalent unadjuvanted, split virus IIV that contains 60 µg HA per strain and is administered as a 0.7 mL dose by IM injection (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent). Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) There is currently only one RIV authorized for use in Canada: Supemtek (RIV4), a quadrivalent unadjuvanted, baculovirus-expressed seasonal influenza vaccine that contains 45 µg HA per strain and is administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection for adults 18 years of age and older. RIV contains recombinant HAs produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses. The production of RIV does not depend on egg supply as it does not require egg-grown candidate vaccine viruses. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) LAIV contains standardized quantities of fluorescent focus units (FFU) of live attenuated influenza virus reassortants. The virus strains in LAIV are cold-adapted and temperature sensitive, so they replicate in the nasal mucosa rather than the lower respiratory tract, and they are attenuated, so they do not produce ILI. There have been no reported or documented cases, and no theoretical or scientific basis to suggest transmission of vaccine virus would occur to the individual administering LAIV. As a live replicating whole virus formulation administered intranasally by spray, it elicits mucosal immunity, which may more closely mimic natural infection. A quadrivalent product (LAIV4; FluMist Quadrivalent) is authorized for use in Canada for children 2 to17 years of age and adults 18 to 59 years of age and is given as a 0.2 mL dose (0.1 mL in each nostril). The trivalent formulation (LAIV3) is no longer available in Canada. IV.2 Efficacy, effectiveness, and immunogenicity Efficacy and effectiveness Influenza vaccine has been shown in randomized controlled clinical trials to be efficacious in providing protection against influenza infection and illness. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine—that is, how it performs in settings that are more reflective of usual health care practice—can vary from season to season and by influenza vaccine strain type and subtype. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) depends on how well the vaccine strains match with circulating influenza viruses, the type and subtype of the circulating virus, as well as the health and age of the individual receiving the vaccine. Even when there is a less-than-ideal match or lower VE against one strain, the possibility of lower VE should not preclude vaccination, particularly for people at high risk of influenza-related complications and hospitalization, since vaccinated individuals are still more likely to be protected compared to those who are unvaccinated. Immunogenicity Antibody response after vaccination depends on several factors, including the age of the recipient, prior and subsequent exposure to antigens, and the presence of immune compromising conditions. Protective levels of humoral antibodies, which correlate with protection against influenza infection, are generally achieved by 2 weeks after vaccination; however, there may be some protection afforded before that time. Additional information Refer to Appendix C for further information on the efficacy and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccines that are authorized for use in Canada by type: IIV, RIV and LAIV. Because of potential changes in the circulating influenza virus from year to year and waning immunity in vaccine recipients, annual influenza vaccination is recommended. Although some studies suggest vaccine induced protection may be greater in individuals who have no recent vaccine history, overall, the evidence shows no difference in the effectiveness of repeated influenza vaccination compared to vaccination in the current season only. Importantly, optimal protection against influenza is best achieved through annual influenza vaccination, as repeated vaccination including the current season is consistently more effective than no vaccination in the current seasonFootnote 27Footnote 28. Additional information regarding the effects of repeated influenza vaccination on vaccine effectiveness, efficacy, and immunogenicity can be found in the NACI Recommendation on Repeated Seasonal Influenza Vaccination. NACI will continue to monitor this issue. NACI acknowledges that evidence related to influenza vaccine performance, particularly with respect to vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, is constantly evolving with advances in research methodology and accumulation of data over many influenza seasons. Therefore, the evidence summarized in Appendix C may not include the latest studies. However, NACI continues to closely monitor the emerging evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccines to update and make recommendations when warranted. IV.3 Vaccine administration Dose, route of administration, and schedule With the variety of influenza vaccines available for use in Canada, it is important for vaccine providers to note the specific differences in age indication, route of administration, dosage, and schedule for the products that they will be using (see Table 1). Key relevant details and differences between vaccine products are also highlighted in Appendix B. For influenza vaccines given by the IM route, the anterolateral thigh muscle is the recommended site in infants 6 to 12 months of age. The anterolateral thigh or the deltoid muscle can be used for toddlers and older children. The deltoid muscle of the arm is the preferred injection site in adolescents and adults. For more information on vaccine administration, please refer to Vaccine Administration Practices in Part 1 of the CIG. The first time that children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receive seasonal influenza vaccination, a two-dose schedule is required to achieve protectionFootnote 29Footnote 30Footnote 31. Several studies have looked at whether these two initial doses need to be given in the same seasonFootnote 23Footnote 24Footnote 32. Englund et al. reported similar immunogenicity in children 6 to 23 months of age whether 2 doses were given in the same or separate seasons when there was no change, or only minor vaccine strain change, in vaccine formulation between seasonsFootnote 23Footnote 24. However, seroprotection rates to the B component were considerably reduced in the group that received only one dose in the subsequent season when there was a major B lineage change, suggesting that the major change in B virus lineage reduced the priming benefit of previous vaccinationFootnote 22Footnote 24. Issues related to effective prime-boost when there is a major change in influenza B lineage across sequential seasons require further evaluationFootnote 33. Because children 6 to 23 months of age are less likely to have had prior priming exposure to an influenza virus, special effort is warranted to ensure that a two-dose schedule is followed for previously unvaccinated children in this age group.

This moderate improvement in antibody response without an increase in reactogenicity is the basis for the full dose recommendation for unadjuvanted inactivated vaccine for all ages. For more information, refer to Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012. Return to Table 1 Footnote g referrer Table 1 - Footnote h Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receiving seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time in their life should be given 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have been properly vaccinated with one or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in the past should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season thereafter. Return to Table 1 Footnote h referrer Booster doses and revaccination Booster doses are not required within the same influenza season. However, children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have not previously received the seasonal influenza vaccine require 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum of 4 weeks between doses. Only one dose of influenza vaccine per season is recommended for everyone else. Two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in older adults do not appear to improve the immune response to the vaccine compared to one doseFootnote 34. Serological testing Serologic testing is not necessary or recommended before or after receiving seasonal influenza vaccine. IV.4 Storage requirements Influenza vaccine should be stored at +2°C to +8°C and should not be frozen. Refer to the individual product monographs for further details. Refer to Storage and Handling of Immunizing Agents in Part 1 of the CIG for additional information. IV.5 Concurrent administration with other vaccines All seasonal influenza vaccines, including LAIV, may be given at the same time as, or at any time before or after administration of other vaccines (either live or inactivated), including COVID-19 vaccines for those aged 6 months of age and older as. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence base, including ongoing and anticipated trials investigating influenza vaccines administered at the same time as, or any time before or after, COVID-19 vaccines and update its recommendations as needed. Refer to the COVID-19 vaccine: CIG chapter and latest NACI COVID-19 vaccine guidance for any additional emerging guidance on concurrent administration with COVID-19 vaccines as new products are authorized or there are COVID-19 age eligibility expansions. No studies were found on potential immune interference between LAIV and other live attenuated vaccines (oral or parenteral) administered within 4 weeks. Studies on concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV); or live oral polio vaccines did not find evidence of clinically significant immune interferenceFootnote 35Footnote 36Footnote 37. One study reported a statistically significant but not clinically meaningful decrease in seroresponse rates to rubella antigen when administered concomitantly with LAIV. In theory, the administration of two live vaccines sequentially within less than 4 weeks could reduce the efficacy of the second vaccine. Possible immune mechanisms include: the inhibitory and immunomodulatory effects of systemic and locally produced cytokines on B- and T-cell response and viral replication; immunosuppression induced by certain viruses (such as measles); and direct viral interference as a result of competition for a common niche. Mucosal vaccines may have less impact on a parenteral vaccine and vice versa. The immune response with a mucosal vaccine may be compartmentalized to the mucosa while that to a parenteral vaccine is systemic. It is likely that there is some interaction between the systemic and mucosal compartments; however, the extent to which this interaction occurs is not known. Given the lack of data for immune interference, and based on expert opinion, NACI recommends that LAIV can be given together with or at any time before or after the administration of any other live attenuated or inactivated vaccine. However, some vaccine providers may continue to choose to give LAIV and other live vaccines separated by at least 4 weeks, based on the theoretical possibility of immune interference, although NACI does not believe that this precaution is necessary for LAIV. The use of a parenteral inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine would avoid this theoretical concern. Note that the timing rules related to two parenteral live vaccines (e.g., MMR and varicella vaccines) still apply. For more information regarding vaccination administration timing rules, please refer to Timing of Vaccine Administration in Part 1 of the CIG. The target groups for influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines overlap considerably. A recent study showed that compared to administration alone, concurrent administration of IIV4 with PCV15 in adults demonstrated non-inferiority of pneumococcal- and influenza-specific antibody responsesFootnote 38. The immune response to many PCV components was decreased, but not influenza virus components. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known precisely. Vaccine providers should take the opportunity to vaccinate eligible people against pneumococcal disease when influenza vaccine is given. When more than one injection is given at a single clinic visit, it is preferable to administer them in different limbs. If it is not possible to do so, injections given in one limb should be separated by a distance of at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). A separate needle and syringe should always be used for each injection. Concurrent administration with other adjuvanted vaccines Data are limited regarding concurrent administration of newer adjuvanted influenza vaccines with other adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccines. RZV is an example of a recombinant adjuvanted subunit herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix®, GlaxoSmithKline) that is authorized for use in Canada in adults 50 years of age and older, and adults 18 years of age or older who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy; therefore, the target age group for herpes zoster vaccine and influenza vaccine overlap. RZV has been shown to be safe and effective when given concurrently with unadjuvanted, standard dose influenza vaccinesFootnote 4. However, no studies have been conducted that have assessed the concurrent administration of RZV with adjuvanted or high dose influenza vaccineFootnote 39. It should be noted that RZV and IIV-adj currently authorized for use in Canada contain the adjuvants AS01B and MF59 respectively. How these adjuvants may interact when RZV and IIV-adj are administered concurrently is not known. NACI will continue to review the evidence and update guidance accordingly. IV.6 Vaccine safety and adverse events Post-marketing surveillance of influenza vaccines in Canada has shown that seasonal influenza vaccines have a safe and stable profile. In addition to routine surveillance, every year during the seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns, PHAC and the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Vaccine Vigilance Working Group (VVWG) of the Canadian Immunization Committee conduct weekly expedited surveillance of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for current influenza vaccines to identify vaccine safety signals in a timely manner. Refer to the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) web page for more information on post-marketing surveillance and AEFIs in Canada. In addition, the Canadian National Vaccine Safety (CANVAS) Network, a national network of sites across Canada for active vaccine safety surveillance, collects and analyzes information on AEFIs after influenza vaccination to provide influenza vaccine safety information to public health authorities during the core weeks of the annual influenza vaccination campaign. All influenza vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada are considered safe for use in people with latex allergies. The multi-dose vial formulations of inactivated influenza vaccine that are authorized for use in Canada contain minute quantities of thimerosal, which is used as a preservativeFootnote 40Footnote 41 to keep the product sterile. Large cohort studies of administrative health databases have found no association between childhood vaccination with thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autistic-spectrum disordersFootnote 42. All single dose formulations of IIV, RIV and LAIV are thimerosal-free. Refer to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG for additional information. Common adverse events With IM administered influenza vaccines, injection site reactions are common but are generally classified as mild and transient. IIV3-Adj tends to produce more extensive injection site reactions than un-unadjuvantedIIV3, but these reactions are also generally mild and resolve spontaneously within a few days. IIV-HD tends to induce higher rates of systemic reactions compared to IIV-SD, but most of these reactions are mild and short-lived. Recombinant vaccines appear to have a similar safety profile to IIVs. The most common AEs experienced by recipients of LAIV are nasal congestion and runny nose. Less common and serious or severe adverse events Serious adverse events (SAEs) are rare following influenza vaccination, and in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association. Allergic responses to influenza vaccine are a rare consequence of hypersensitivity to some components of the vaccine or its container. Other reported adverse events and conditions Egg-allergic individuals After careful review of clinical and post-licensure safety data, NACI has concluded that egg-allergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using any influenza vaccine, including egg-based vaccines and LAIV, without prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg and without any particular consideration, including vaccination setting. The amount of trace ovalbumin allowed in influenza vaccines that are authorized for use in Canada is associated with a low risk of AE, and in addition, two of the authorized products do not contain any ovalbumin. The observation period post-vaccination is as recommended in Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG. As with all vaccine administration, vaccine providers should be prepared with the necessary equipment, knowledge, and skills to respond to allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, at all times. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for safety data supporting this recommendation for IIV and LAIV. Guillain-Barré syndrome In a review of studies conducted between 1976 and 2005, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that the 1976 "swine flu" vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of GBS. However, evidence was inadequate to accept or to reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccinationFootnote 43. The attributable risk of GBS in the period following seasonal and monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza vaccination is about one excess case per million vaccinationsFootnote 44Footnote 45. In a self-controlled study that explored the risk of GBS after seasonal influenza vaccination and after influenza health care encounters (a proxy for influenza illness), the attributable risks were 1.03 GBS admissions per million vaccinations compared with 17.2 GBS admissions per million influenza-coded health care encountersFootnote 45. These findings suggest that both influenza vaccination and influenza illness are associated with small attributable risks of GBS, but the risk of GBS associated with influenza illness is notably higher than with influenza vaccination. The self-controlled study also found that the risk of GBS after vaccination was highest during weeks 2 to 4, whereas for influenza illness, the risk was greatest within the first week after a health care encounter and decreased thereafter but remained significantly elevated for up to 4 weeks. Although the evidence considering influenza vaccination and GBS is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccination, avoiding subsequent influenza vaccination of individuals known to have had GBS without other known etiology within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination appears prudent at this time. However, the potential risk of GBS recurrence associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the benefits of influenza vaccination Footnote 46Footnote 47 Footnote 48Footnote 49. Oculorespiratory syndrome Oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS), the presence of bilateral red eyes and one or more associated respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or sore throat) that starts within 24 hours of vaccination, with or without facial oedema, was identified during the 2000–2001 influenza seasonFootnote 50. Since then, there have been far fewer cases per year reported to CAEFISSFootnote 51. ORS is not an allergic response. People who have an occurrence or recurrence of ORS upon vaccination do not necessarily experience further episodes with future vaccinations. Individuals who have experienced ORS without lower respiratory tract symptoms may be safely revaccinated with influenza vaccine. Individuals who experienced ORS with lower respiratory tract symptoms should have an expert review. Health care providers who are unsure whether an individual previously experienced ORS versus an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity immune response should seek advice. Data on clinically significant AEs do not support the preference of one vaccine product over another when revaccinating those who have previously experienced ORS. Allergic reactions to previous vaccine doses Expert review of the benefits and risks of vaccination should be sought for those who have previously experienced severe lower respiratory symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) within 24 hours of influenza vaccination, an apparent significant allergic reaction to the vaccine, or any other symptoms that could indicate a significant allergic reaction (e.g., throat constriction, difficulty swallowing) that raise concern regarding the safety of revaccination. This advice may be obtained from experts in infectious disease, allergy, and immunology, or public health that can be found in various health settings, including the Special Immunization Clinic (SIC) network. In view of the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and rarity of true vaccine allergy, a diagnosis of allergy to an influenza vaccine should not be made without confirmation, which may involve consultation with an allergy or immunology expert. Drug interactions Although influenza vaccine can inhibit the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, clinical studies have not shown any adverse effects attributable to these drugs in people receiving influenza vaccine. Statins have effects on the immune system in addition to their therapeutic cholesterol-lowering actions. Two published studies have found that adults who are regular statin users (at least 65 years of ageFootnote 52 in one study and 45 years and older in the otherFootnote 53) had a decreased response to influenza vaccination as measured by reduced geometric mean titres (GMT)Footnote 52 or reduced VE against medically attended acute respiratory illnessFootnote 53. Statins are widely used in the same adult populations who are also at-risk for influenza-related complications and hospitalizations. Therefore, if these preliminary findings are confirmed in future studies, concurrent statin use in adult populations could have implications for influenza VE and how this use is assessed in the measurement of VE. NACI will continue to monitor the literature related to this issue. Guidance on reporting adverse events following immunization To ensure the ongoing safety of influenza vaccines in Canada, reporting of AEFIs by vaccine providers and other clinicians is critical, and in most jurisdictions, reporting is mandatory under the law. An AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that follows vaccination whether or not there is a causal relationship with the usage of a vaccine. The AEFI may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease. Any AEFI temporally related to vaccination and for which there is no other clear cause at the time of reporting should be reported. Of particular importance are those AEFIs which are serious or unexpected. A serious AEFI is an adverse event that is life threatening or results in death, requires hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization, results in residual disability or causes congenital malformationFootnote 54. An unexpected AEFI is an event that is not listed in the approved product monograph but may be due to the vaccination, or one whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not consistent with the term or description used in the product monographFootnote 54. Vaccine providers are asked to report AEFIs through local public health officials and to check for specific AEFI reporting requirements in their province or territory. If there is any doubt as to whether or not an event should be reported, a conservative approach should be taken, and the event should be reported. For influenza vaccines, the following AEFIs are of particular interest: ORS; and GBS within 6 weeks following vaccination Refer to Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in Canada for additional information about AEFI reporting and to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG for general vaccine safety information, including information on the management of adverse events. V. Recommendations NACI makes the following recommendations for individual-level and public health program-level decision making. Individual-level recommendations are intended for people wishing to protect themselves from influenza or for vaccine providers wishing to advise individual patients about preventing influenza. Program-level recommendations are intended for provinces and territories responsible for making decisions on publicly funded immunization programs. Individual-level and program-level recommendations may differ, as the important factors to consider when recommending a vaccine for a population (e.g., population demographics, economic considerations) may be different than for an individual. Recommendation for individual-level decision making NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine, with focus on the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended (see List 1). Recommendations for public health program-level decision making The national goal of the annual influenza immunization programs in Canada is to prevent serious illness caused by influenza and its complications, including death. Programmatic decisions to provide influenza vaccination to target populations as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs depend on many factors, such as cost-effectiveness evaluation and other programmatic and operational factors, such as implementation strategies. NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered as a priority to the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended (see List 1 in the section below). List 1: Groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization All children 6 to 59 months of age Adults and children with the following chronic health conditionsList 1 Footnote a: Cardiac or pulmonary disorders (includes bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, and asthma); Diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases; Cancer, immune compromising conditions (due to underlying disease, therapy, or both, such as solid organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients); Renal disease; Anemia or hemoglobinopathy; Neurologic or neurodevelopmental conditions (includes neuromuscular, neurovascular, neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental conditions, and seizure disorders [and, for children, includes febrile seizures and isolated developmental delay], but excludes migraines and psychiatric conditions without neurological conditions)List 1 Footnote b Morbid obesity (defined as BMI of 40 kg/m² and over); and Children 6 months to 18 years of age undergoing treatment for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid, because of the potential increase of Reye's syndrome associated with influenza All individuals who are pregnant; People of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities; Adults 65 years of age and older; and Indigenous peoples. People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk Health care and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk Household contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated: household contacts of individuals at high risk household contacts of infants less than 6 months of age, as these infants are at high risk but cannot receive influenza vaccine members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season; Those providing regular child care to children 0 to 59 months of age, whether in or out of the home; and Those who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to people at high risk (e.g., crew on a cruise ship). Others People who provide essential community services; and People who are in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations List 1 - Footnote a Refer to Immunization of Persons with Chronic Diseases and Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons in Part 3 of the CIG for additional information about vaccination of people with chronic diseases. Return to List 1 Footnote a referrer List 1 - Footnote b Refer to the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for rationale supporting the decision to include persons with neurologic or neurodevelopment conditions among the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended and the Literature Review on Individuals with Neurologic or Neurodevelopment Conditions and Risk of Serious Influenza-Related Complications for additional details of the evidence reviews that were conducted. Return to List 1 Footnote b referrer V.1 Choice of seasonal influenza vaccine With the recent availability of a number of new influenza vaccines, some of which are designed to enhance immunogenicity in specific age groups, the choice of product is now more complex. Table 2 provides age group-specific recommendations for the age-appropriate influenza vaccine types authorized and available for use in Canada for individual and public health program-level decision making. Additional information for these recommendations are provided in the section below. Table 2: Recommendations on choice of influenza vaccine type for individual- and public health program-level decision making by age group Recipient by age group Vaccine types authorizedTable 2 Footnote aTable 2 Footnote b and available for use Recommendations on choice of influenza vaccine 6 to 23 months IIV3-Adj IIV4-SD IIV4-cc A quadrivalent influenza vaccine authorized for this age group should be used in infants and young children without contraindications, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, a trivalent vaccine licensed for this age group should be used. 2 to 17 yearsTable 2 Footnote c IIV4-SD IIV4-cc LAIV4 An age-appropriate quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD, LAIV4, or IIV4-cc) should be used in children without contraindications or precautions (see text below applicable to LAIV), including those with chronic health conditions, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. LAIV4 may be given to children with: stable, non-severe asthma; cystic fibrosis who are not being treated with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., prolonged systemic corticosteroids); and stable HIV infection, i.e., if the child is currently being treated with ART (i.e., HAART) for at least 4 months and has adequate immune function. LAIV should not be used in children or adolescents for whom it is contraindicated or for whom there are warnings and precautions such as those with: severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing); medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination; current receipt of aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy; immune compromising conditions, with the exception of stable HIV infection, i.e., if the child is currently being treated with HAART for at least 4 months and has adequate immune function; pregnancy in pregnancy, IIV4-SD or IIV4-cc should be used instead. 18 to 59 years IIV4-SD IIV4-cc RIV4 LAIV4 Any of the available influenza vaccines authorized for this age group should be used in adults 18-59 years without contraindications or precautions, noting the following consideration and exceptions: There is some evidence that IIV may provide better efficacy than LAIV in healthy adults; and LAIV is not recommended for: Pregnant individuals in pregnancy, IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc or RIV4 should be used instead. adults with any of the chronic health conditions identified in List 1, including immune compromising conditions; and health care workers 60 to 64 years IIV4-SD IIV4-cc RIV4 Any of the available influenza vaccines authorized for this age group should be used in adults 60 to 64 years without contraindications. 65 years and olderTable 2 Footnote d IIV3-Adj IIV4-SD IIV4-HD IIV4-cc RIV4 Individual-level decision-making Public health program-level decision-making IIV-HD should be used over IIV-SD, given the burden of influenza A(H3N2) disease and the good evidence of IIV3-HD providing better protection compared to IIV3-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. Other than a recommendation for using IIV-HD over IIV-SD formulations, NACI has not made comparative individual-level recommendations on the use of the other available vaccines in this age group. In the absence of a specific product, any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccines should be used. Any of the available influenza vaccines authorized in this age group should be used. There is insufficient evidence on the incremental value of different influenza vaccines (i.e., cost-effectiveness assessments have not been performed by NACI) to make comparative public health program-level recommendations on the use of the available vaccines.

Return to Table 2 Footnote d referrer V.2 Children Burden of disease in children Children experience a higher burden of disease due to influenza B infection compared to other age groups. Although children less than 24 months of age comprise approximately 2% of the Canadian populationFootnote 55, children 0 to 23 months of age averaged 10.8% of reported influenza B cases (range: 8.3 to 13.7%), using case-based laboratory data from 2001–2012 (excluding 2009). With respect to severe outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death), influenza B was confirmed in 15.5 to 58.3% (median: 38.4%) of pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations (children 16 years of age and younger) reported by the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT) surveillance network between 2004–2005 and 2012–2013 (excluding the 2009–2010 pandemic season)Footnote 56. From 2010-2011 to 2018-2019, inclusively, 29% of IMPACT influenza admissions were for influenza B. The IMPACT study also found that the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza (any strain) was significantly greater for children admitted to hospital with influenza B (1.1%) than for those admitted with influenza A (0.4%). The proportion of hospitalizations due to influenza B relative to all influenza hospitalizations has been generally similar to the proportion of influenza B detections relative to all influenza infections in the general population during the same time period. Additional information can be found in the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2014–2015. In the NACI Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines, a review of B lineage antigens included in the Canadian influenza vaccines and the circulating strains each season indicates a match in five of the 12 seasons from 2001–2002 through to 2012–2013, a moderate match (about 50% from each lineage) in 1 season, and a mismatch in remaining 6 influenza seasons (i.e., 70% or more of the characterized B strains were of the opposite lineage to the antigen in that season's vaccine). Children 6 to 23 months of age Three types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in children 6 to 23 months of age: IIV3-Adj, IIV4-SD, and IIV4-cc. Given the burden of influenza B disease in children and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine, NACI recommends that a quadrivalent influenza vaccine should be used. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, an available age-appropriate trivalent vaccine (IIV3-Adj) should be used. The current evidence is insufficient for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. Children 2 to 17 years of age Three types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in children 2 to 17 years of age: IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, and LAIV4. The current evidence does not support a recommendation for the preferential use of LAIV in children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age. Refer to the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for information supporting this recommendation. The current evidence is insufficient for recommending vaccination with Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) in children younger than 3 years of age. Children 2 to 17 years of age with chronic health conditions NACI recommends that any age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) may be considered for children 2 to 17 years of age with chronic health conditions; however, LAIV should not be used for children with severe asthma (as defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or with active wheezing), those with medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination, those currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy, and those with immune compromising conditions, excluding those with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. LAIV is also contraindicated in adolescents who are pregnant. Children and adolescents for whom LAIV is contraindicated should receive IIV. If IIV is used, NACI recommends that a quadrivalent vaccine should be used. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, an age-appropriate trivalent vaccine should be used. NACI recommends that LAIV may be given to children with stable, non-severe asthma, children with cystic fibrosis who are not treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as prolonged systemic corticosteroids, and children with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for additional information supporting these recommendations. Summary of vaccine characteristics for decision making IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, and LAIV4 are authorized for use in Canada for children 2 to 17 years of age. The comparison of the vaccine characteristics of IIV and LAIV, in Table 3 below, may be considered in deciding on the preferred vaccine option(s) for use by an individual or a public health program. Note that although data comparing LAIV to IIV4-cc are not available, IIV-cc is comparable to egg-based IIV. Table 3: Vaccine characteristics of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) compared with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 2 to 17 years of age ConsiderationsTable 3 Footnote a LAIVTable 3 Footnote b compared with IIVTable 3 Footnote c Efficacy and effectiveness There was early evidence of superior efficacy of LAIV3 compared with IIV3-SD in children less than 6 years of age from randomized controlled trials, with weaker evidence of superior efficacy in older children. However, later post-marketing and surveillance studies across multiple influenza seasons found comparable protection against influenza for LAIV and IIV, with findings of reduced effectiveness for LAIV against A(H1N1) in some studies. Like IIV4-SD, LAIV4 is expected to provide additional protection against the influenza B strain not contained in IIV3-SD. Immunogenicity LAIV3 has been shown to be as immunogenic as IIV3-SD, depending on age, with LAIV4 being non-inferior to LAIV3. Safety Rhinitis (runny nose) and nasal congestion are more common with LAIV. Clinical studies and post-marketing studies showed a similar safety profile to IIV. Contraindications There are vaccine contraindications specific to LAIV. LAIV is contraindicated for children with severe asthma, medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination, and immune compromising conditions (with the exception of children with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function), as well as those currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy. LAIV is also contraindicated for pregnant adolescents. Acceptability Delivery of LAIV as a nasal spray may be preferable for children who are averse to receiving the vaccine by needle injection. Abbreviations: HAART: highly active antiretroviral therapy; IIV: inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3-SD: standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV4-SD: standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; LAIV: live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV3: trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV4: quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine. Table 3 - Footnote a NACI has not assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness of authorized influenza vaccine types for children 2 to 17 years of age. Return to Table 3 Footnote a referrer Table 3 - Footnote b The trivalent formulation of LAIV (LAIV3) received a Notice of Compliance from Health Canada in June 2010 and was first used in publicly funded immunization programs in Canada for the 2012–2013 influenza season. The quadrivalent formulation (LAIV4) was approved for use in Canada for the 2014–2015 season and has been in use since that time. LAIV3 is no longer available in Canada. Return to Table 3 Footnote b referrer Table 3 - Footnote c The trivalent IIV3-SD formulations are not expected to be authorized or available in Canada for the 2023-2024 influenza season. Data comparing LAIV to IIV4-cc are not available, however IIV-cc is comparable to egg-based IIV. Return to Table 3 Footnote c referrer V.3 Adults Burden of disease in adults A study focusing on estimates of deaths associated with influenza in the United States has established that the average annual rate of influenza-associated deaths for adults aged 65 years of age and older was 17.0 deaths per 100,000 (range: 2.4 to 36.7)Footnote 57. The study also states that of deaths coded as being influenza- or pneumonia-related, persons 65 years of age and older accounted for 87.9% of the overall estimated annual average number of deaths. When influenza-related deaths among adults 65 years of age and older were estimated using codes for underlying respiratory and circulatory causes of death, these estimates increased to 66.1 deaths per 100,000 (range: 8.0 to 121.1) and 89.4%, respectively. This study described a wide variation in the estimated number of deaths from season to season, which was closely related to the influenza virus types and subtypes in circulation. Estimates presented in the study of yearly influenza-associated deaths with underlying pneumonia and influenza causes (1976 to 2007) reveal a large difference between influenza type A and B with a calculated median of greater than 6,000 deaths associated with influenza type A and half of that number for influenza type B (approximately 3,360) for persons 65 years of age and older. During the 22 seasons in which influenza A(H3N2) was the prominent strain, the average influenza-associated mortality rates were 2.7 times higher than for the nine seasons that it was not (all age groups combined), and on average, there were about 37% more annual influenza-associated deaths, regardless of the primary medical cause of death. A higher risk of hospitalization and death was also reported by Cromer et al. in adults 65 years of age and older, compared to younger adults in their assessment of the burden of influenza in England by age and clinical risk groupFootnote 58. Canadian surveillance data show that hospitalization rates among adults 65 years of age and older were higher during the A(H3N2)-predominant 2014–2015 season compared to the previous five influenza seasons and also compared to the 2012–2013 season when A(H3N2) also predominated; 2014–2015 was a season in which there was a vaccine mismatch with the circulating A(H3N2) strain. Similar to the hospitalization rates, death rates among older adults were highest in the 2014–2015 season compared to the previous five seasons and compared to the previous A(H3N2) season in 2012–2013. Mortality rates among other age groups were similar to or lower than the previous five influenza seasons. Laboratory detections over this same time period showed that influenza seasons in which influenza subtype A(H3N2) predominated, disproportionally affected adults 65 years of age and older, while seasons with greater A(H1N1) detections resulted in a higher proportion of positive cases in younger age groups. Adults 18 to 59 years of age Four types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in adults 18 to 59 years of age: IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, RIV4, and LAIV4. NACI recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines should be used in adults without contraindications to the vaccine. NACI previously found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of LAIV in adults with chronic health conditions due to the potentially better immune response following IIV compared to LAIV in healthy adults in some studies. As such, IIV or RIV should be used for adults with chronic health conditions identified in List 1, HCWs or individuals who are pregnant (noting that limited published clinical data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy is currently available to inform vaccine-associated risks for this population). For further information, refer to Recommendations on the use of live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist®) Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011-2012. Adults 60 to 64 years of age Three types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in adults 60 to 64 years of age: IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, and RIV4. NACI recommends that any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccines should be used. Adults 65 years of age and older Five types of influenza vaccine are authorized and available for use in adults 65 years of age and older: IIV3-Adj, IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, IIV4-HD, and RIV4. Recommendation for individual-level decision making When available, IIV-HD should be used over IIV-SD, given the burden of influenza A(H3N2) disease and the good evidence of better protection of IIV3-HD compared to IIV3-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. Based on a review of pre-authorization trials, IIV4-HD is non-inferior to IIV3-HD and is therefore expected to provide the same enhanced protection against A(H3N2) compared to SD IIV, including IIV4-SD. Although IIV-HD is expected to provide better protection against influenza A(H3N2) for adults 65 years of age or older, the benefit of providing this vaccine to all adults 65 and over as opposed to any other influenza vaccine is not clear (refer to the next section). NACI is currently conducting an updated review of influenza vaccines in this population. Any of the available influenza vaccines would be preferable to remaining unvaccinated or requesting individuals to return for vaccine. Therefore, in the absence of a specific product, NACI recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines authorized for this age group should be used. Recommendation for public health program-level decision making IIV3-HD is expected to provide better protection compared to IIV3-SD. Similarly, IIV4-HD is expected to provide better protection compared to IIV4-SD. The previous assessment completed by NACI demonstrated insufficient evidence to make a comparative recommendation on the use of IIV3-HD over IIV3-SD at the programmatic level and a complete assessment that includes economic considerations has not yet been conducted for IIV4-HD. Therefore, NACI currently recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines should be used for public health programs. NACI is in the process of completing an updated assessment on influenza vaccines for adults 65 years of age and older. Refer to the NACI Literature Review Update on the Efficacy and Effectiveness of High-Dose (Fluzone® High-Dose) and MF59-Adjuvanted (Fluad) Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines in Adults 65 Years of Age and Older for additional information supporting these recommendations. Summary of vaccine characteristics for decision making There are four types of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3-Adj, IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, and IIV4-HD) and one type of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) authorized for use in Canada for adults 65 years of age and older. The comparison of vaccine characteristics across vaccine types, in Table 4 below, may be considered when deciding on the preferred vaccine option(s) for use by an individual or a public health program. Due to the limited available data directly comparing the performance of IIV3-Adj, IIV-HD, IIV4-SD, IIV4-cc, or RIV4, considerations for these vaccines in Table 4 are compared to IIV3-SD for which comparative data on efficacy, effectiveness, and/or immunogenicity with each of IIV3-Adj and IIV4-SD are available. Data directly comparing IIV4-cc and IIV4-HD to IIV3-SD are not available. Comparative data on efficacy, effectiveness, and/or immunogenicity of IIV3-cc and IIV3-SD are available.

Therefore, information presented here is expected to apply to IIV3-SD as well. Return to Table 4 Footnote e referrer Adults with chronic health conditions NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV or RIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to adults with chronic health conditions identified in List 1, including those with immune compromising conditions. Pregnant individuals NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV or RIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to pregnant individuals (noting that limited published clinical data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy is currently available to inform vaccine-associated risks). Due to a lack of safety data at this time, LAIV should not be administered to pregnant individuals due to the theoretical risk to the fetus from administering a live virus vaccine. LAIV can be administered to breastfeeding individuals. Health care workers NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV or RIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to HCWs. Comparative studies in healthy adults have found IIV to be similarly or more efficacious or effective compared with LAIVFootnote 60. In addition, as a precautionary measure, LAIV recipients should avoid close association with people with severe immune compromising conditions (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for at least 2 weeks following vaccination, because of the theoretical risk for transmitting a vaccine virus and causing infection. Travellers Influenza occurs year-round in the tropics. In temperate northern and southern countries, influenza activity generally peaks during the winter season (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere and April to October in the Southern Hemisphere). NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older, including travellers, who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine, with focus on the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended (see List 1). Vaccines prepared specifically for use in the Southern Hemisphere are not available in Canada, and the extent to which recommended vaccine components for the Southern Hemisphere may overlap with those in available Canadian formulations will vary. A decision for or against revaccination (i.e., boosting) of travellers to the Southern Hemisphere between April and October, if they had already been vaccinated in the preceding fall or winter with the Northern Hemisphere's vaccine, depends on individual risk assessment, the similarity between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere vaccines, the similarity between the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strains and currently circulating strains in the Southern Hemisphere, and the availability of a reliable and safe vaccine at the traveller's destination. Refer to Immunization of Travellers in Part 3 of the CIG for additional general information. V.4 Particularly recommended vaccine recipients The groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended are presented in List 1. Additional information regarding these particularly recommended recipients is provided below. All children 6 to 59 months of age On the basis of existing data, NACI recommends the inclusion of all children 6 to 59 months of age among those for whom influenza vaccine is particularly recommended. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for additional details on children 6 to 23 months of age and to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2012–2013 for children 24 to 59 months of age. Adults and children with chronic health conditions As noted in List 1, a number of chronic health conditions are associated with increased risk of influenza-related complications and can be exacerbated by a flu infection. Influenza vaccination can induce protective antibody levels in a substantial proportion of adults and children with immune-compromising conditions, including transplant recipients, those with proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems, and HIV-infected people. Vaccine effectiveness may be lower in people with immune compromising conditions than in healthy adults. All individuals who are pregnant NACI recommends the inclusion of all individuals who are pregnant, at any stage of pregnancy, among those who are particularly recommended to receive IIV or RIV. This is due to the risk of influenza-associated morbidity amongst those who are pregnant Footnote 61Footnote 62 Footnote 63Footnote 64 Footnote 65, evidence of adverse neonatal outcomes associated with respiratory hospitalization during pregnancy or influenza during pregnancyFootnote 66Footnote 67 Footnote 68Footnote 69, evidence that vaccination of individuals who are pregnant protects their newborns from influenza and influenza-related hospitalization Footnote 70Footnote 71 Footnote 72Footnote 73, and evidence that infants born during influenza season to vaccinated individuals are less likely to be premature, small for gestational age, and of low birth weight than if born to individuals that had not received an influenza vaccine Footnote 74Footnote 75 Footnote 76Footnote 77. The risk of influenza-related hospitalization increases with length of gestation (i.e., it is higher in the third trimester than in the second). The safety of IIV during pregnancy has been reviewedFootnote 76. Active studies of influenza vaccination during pregnancy have not shown evidence of harm to the pregnant individual or fetus associated with influenza vaccinationFootnote 78. Although the cumulative sample size of active studies of influenza vaccination in pregnant individuals is relatively small, particularly in the first trimester, passive surveillance has not raised any safety concerns despite widespread use of IIV during pregnancy over several decades Footnote 63Footnote 64 Footnote 79Footnote 80. Surveillance following the use of both adjuvanted and un-adjuvanted 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccines in more than 100,000 pregnant women in Canada and more than 488,000 pregnant women in EuropeFootnote 81 has not revealed any safety concerns. Very limited peer-reviewed, published data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy is currently available to inform vaccine-associated risks. Refer to the Supplemental Statement on Recombinant Influenza Vaccines for more information. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 and the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2012–2013 for further details on influenza vaccination during pregnancy. People of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities Residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities often have one or more chronic health condition and live in institutional environments that may facilitate the spread of influenza. Adults 65 years of age and older Hospitalization attributable to influenza in this age group is estimated at 125 to 228 per 100,000 healthy peopleFootnote 82, and influenza-attributed mortality rates increase with increased ageFootnote 83. Indigenous peoples Based on a body of evidence indicating a higher rate of influenza-associated hospitalization and death among Indigenous peoples, NACI recommends the inclusion of this population among those for whom the influenza vaccine is particularly recommended. It has been proposed that the increased risk of severe influenza outcomes in the Indigenous populations is a consequence of many factors, including high prevalence of chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, chronic lung disease, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity)Footnote 84, delayed access to health care, and increased susceptibility to disease because of poor housing and overcrowdingFootnote 85Footnote 86Footnote 87. A review of the available evidence and update to the recommendations for Indigenous peoples as a group at high-risk of influenza-related complications is planned, with inclusion and consideration of key stakeholder engagement. V.5 People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization People who are potentially capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk should receive annual vaccination, regardless of whether the high-risk individual has been vaccinated. Vaccination of Health Care Workers (HCWs) decreases their own risk of illnessFootnote 88Footnote 89, as well as the risk of death and other serious outcomes among the individuals for whom they provide care Footnote 90Footnote 91 Footnote 92Footnote 93. Vaccination of HCWs and residents of nursing homes is associated with decreased risk of ILI outbreaksFootnote 94. People who are more likely to transmit influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization include: HCWs and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk; and Contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated Health care workers and other care providers in facilities and community settings Vaccination of health care workers and other care providers For the purposes of this statement, HCWs and other care providers in facilities and community settings refers to HCWs, essential care providers, emergency response workers, those who work in continuing care or long-term care facilities or residences, those who provide home care for people at high risk, and students of related health care services. HCWs include any person, paid or unpaid, who provides services, works, volunteers, or trains in a hospital, clinic, or other health care facility. Transmission of influenza to patients at high risk of influenza-associated complications results in significant morbidity and mortality. Four cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in geriatric long-term care settings have demonstrated that vaccination of HCWs is associated with substantial decreases in influenza-like illnessFootnote 91Footnote 92Footnote 93 and all-cause mortalityFootnote 90Footnote 91 Footnote 92Footnote 93in the residents. In addition, due to their occupation and close contact with people who may be infected with influenza, HCWs are themselves at increased risk of infectionFootnote 95. As previously stated, children 0 to 59 months of age, adults and children with chronic health conditions, pregnant individuals, people of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities, and adults 65 years of age and older are at greater risk of more severe complications from influenza or worsening of their underlying condition. Given the potential for HCWs and other care providers to transmit influenza to individuals at high risk and knowing that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza, NACI recommends that, in the absence of contraindications, HCWs and other care providers in facilities and community settings should be vaccinated against influenza annually. NACI considers the receipt of influenza vaccination to be an essential component of the standard of care for all HCWs and other care providers for their own protection and that of their patients. This group should consider annual influenza vaccination as part of their responsibilities to provide the highest standard of care. Although the current influenza vaccine coverage rate for HCWs is higher than for the general publicFootnote 96Footnote 97, it remains below the national goal of 80% coverage for HCWs in CanadaFootnote 98. Comprehensive vaccination programs should be adopted that address HCWs' acceptance of the vaccine and facilitate the process of vaccinating HCWs to improve uptake of the influenza vaccine beyond the current level. HCW influenza vaccination programs that have successfully increased vaccine coverage of HCWs have included a combination of education, increased awareness, accessible on-site vaccination delivery options for all HCWs, visible support from senior staff and other leaders, and regular review and improvement of vaccination strategies Footnote 99Footnote 100 Footnote 101Footnote 102 Footnote 103Footnote 104. Outbreak management in health care facilities As noted in PHAC's Guidance: Infection Prevention and Control Measures for Healthcare Workers in Acute Care and Long-term Care Settings for seasonal influenza, all health care organizations should have a written plan for managing an influenza outbreak in their facilities. Inherent in such plans should be policies and programs to optimize HCW's influenza vaccinationFootnote 105. As part of outbreak management, the above-mentioned PHAC guidance suggests consideration of chemoprophylaxis for all unvaccinated HCWs, unless contraindications exist. Refer to the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada (AMMI Canada) website for guidelines regarding the use of antiviral medications for prophylaxis. Contacts of individuals at high risk of influenza complications Vaccination is recommended for contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization (see List 1), whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated. These contacts include: household contacts and care providers of individuals at high risk, household contacts and care providers of infants less than 6 months of age (as these infants are at high risk of complications from influenza but cannot receive influenza vaccine), members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season, household contacts and care providers (whether in or out of the home) of children 0 to 59 months of age, and providers of services within closed or relatively closed settings with people at high risk of influenza-related complications (e.g., crew on a passenger or cruise ship). V.6 Others People who provide essential community services Vaccination for these individuals should be encouraged to minimize the disruption of services and routine activities during annual influenza epidemics. People who provide essential community services, including healthy working adults, should consider annual influenza vaccination, as this intervention has been shown to decrease work absenteeism due to respiratory and related illnesses Footnote 88Footnote 89 Footnote 106Footnote 107 Footnote 108. People in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations Poultry handlers Although seasonal influenza vaccination will not prevent avian influenza infection, some countriesFootnote 109 and provinces have recommended influenza vaccination on a yearly basis for those working with poultry, based on the rationale that preventing infection with human influenza strains may reduce the theoretical potential for human-avian reassortment of genes, should such workers become co-infected with human and avian influenza virusesFootnote 110. NACI recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for people who may be in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations, as these individuals may be at increased risk of avian influenza infection because of exposure during the culling operation Footnote 111Footnote 112 Footnote 113Footnote 114. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2013–2014 for further information supporting this recommendation. Direct contact may be defined as sufficient contact with infected poultry to allow transmission of an avian virus to the exposed person. The relevant individuals include those performing the cull, as well as others who may be directly exposed to the avian virus, such as supervising veterinarians and inspectors. It is recommended that biosecurity measures such as personal protective equipment and antivirals be used. Refer to Human Health Issues Related to Avian Influenza in Canada for PHAC recommendations on the management of domestic avian influenza outbreaks. Swine workers NACI has concluded that there is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend routine influenza vaccination specifically for swine workers; however, NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should be offered to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2013–2014 for further information supporting this recommendation.

Return to Appendix B Footnote b referrer Appendix C: Additional information on vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) Immunological considerations related to children Young children have a high burden of illness and their vaccine-induced immune response is not as robust as older children. However, some studies suggest moderate improvement in antibody response in young children, without an increase in reactogenicity, with the use of a full vaccine dose (0.5 mL) for IIV-SDsFootnote 115Footnote 116Footnote 117. Based on this moderate improvement in antibody response without an increase in reactogenicity, NACI recommends the use of a 0.5 mL dose for all recipients of IIV-SDs, including young children. Immunological considerations related to older adults and those with immune compromising conditions The initial antibody response in older adults is lower to some influenza vaccine components [particularly A(H3N2) antigens when compared to those in other age groups, a literature review identified no evidence for a subsequent antibody decline that was any more rapid in older adults than in younger age groupsFootnote 118. Influenza vaccination can induce protective antibody levels in a substantial proportion of adults and children with immune compromising conditions, including transplant recipients, those with proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems, and HIV-infected patients Footnote 119Footnote 120 Footnote 121Footnote 122. Most studies have shown that administration of a second dose of influenza vaccine in the same season to older adults or other individuals who may have an altered immune response does not result in a clinically significant antibody boost Footnote 35Footnote 123 Footnote 124Footnote 125. Standard-dose, egg-based, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD) The following trivalent formulations of standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines have recently been discontinued and are no longer authorized or available for use in Canada: Agriflu®(Seqirus) Influvac®(BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan, doing business as (d.b.a.) Viatris Canada) All IIV-SD products expected to be available in Canada for the 2023-2024 season are quadrivalent. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022-2023 for more detailed information on the use of IIV3-SD and a summary of efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety evidence across eligible age groups. Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-Adj) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Fluad®(Seqirus) Fluad Pediatric®(Seqirus) Fluad® (adults 65 years of age and older) Efficacy and effectiveness There is fair evidence that the MF59-adjuvanted Fluad (IIV3-Adj) may be effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in older adults compared to unvaccinated individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence that IIV3-Adj is more effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in older adults compared to those who received un-adjuvanted subunit IIV3-SD. Refer to the NACI Literature Review Update on the Efficacy and Effectiveness of High-Dose and MF59-Adjuvanted Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines in Adults 65 Years of Age and Older for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. Immunogenicity The mechanism of action of MF59 is not fully determined and has primarily been studied using in vitro and mouse models. From these studies, it appears that MF59 may act differently from aluminum-based adjuvants. These studies show that MF59 acts in the muscle fibres to create a local immune-stimulatory environment at the injection siteFootnote 126. MF59 allows for an increased influx of phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, monocytes) to the site of injection. The recruited phagocytes are further stimulated by MF59, thereby increasing the production of chemokines to attract more innate immune cells and inducing differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cellsFootnote 127Footnote 128. MF59 further facilitates the internalization of antigen by these dendritic cellsFootnote 127Footnote 129. The overall higher number of cells available locally increases the likelihood of interaction between an antigen presenting cell and the antigen, leading to more efficient transport of antigen to the lymph nodes, with resulting improved T cell primingFootnote 127. There is evidence from RCTs that IIV3-Adj elicits non-inferior immune responses compared to the unadjuvanted subunit and split virus IIV3-SDs; however, superiority of IIV3-Adj to these vaccines by pre-defined criteria has not been consistently demonstrated. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. Safety IIV3-Adj produces injection site reactions (pain, erythema, and induration) significantly more frequently than IIV3-SD, but they are classified as mild and transient. Systemic reactions (myalgia, headache, fatigue, and malaise) are comparable or more frequent with IIV3-Adj compared to IIV3-SD and are rated as mild to moderate and transient. SAEs were uncommon and were comparable to IIV3-SD. Refer to the Recommendations on the use of MF59-adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (Fluad®): Supplemental Statement of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older. Fluad Pediatric® (children 6 to 23 months of age) Efficacy and effectiveness A pre-licensure efficacy trial in children 6 to 71 months of age found a higher relative efficacy for IIV-Adj than the unadjuvanted IIV3-SDFootnote 130. However, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. The comparator unadjuvanted IIV3 used in this trial was shown, in an unrelated study, to induce a lower immune response compared to another unadjuvanted IIV3-SD. There were concerns raised by a European Medicines Agency inspection about the quality of diagnostic laboratory testing and validity of ascertainment of influenza cases. The study administered 0.25 mL doses of the comparator unadjuvanted IIV3-SD for children less than 36 months of age, which is lower than the dose of 0.5 mL of unadjuvanted IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD that is recommended for this age group in Canada. Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6 to 72 Months of Age for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in children. for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in children. Immunogenicity In children, there is limited but consistent evidence that IIV3-Adj is more immunogenic than IIV3-SD against both influenza A and B Footnote 130Footnote 131 Footnote 132Footnote 133 Footnote 134Footnote 135. In particular, a single dose of IIV3-Adj is more immunogenic than a single dose of IIV3-SD and has been shown in one study to produce greater GMTs than 2 doses of IIV3-SD against influenza AFootnote 135. However, similar to IIV3-SD, IIV3-Adj generally induced a weaker hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response against B strains compared to A strains and therefore 2 doses of IIV3-Adj are still necessary for first-time recipients to achieve a satisfactory immune response against influenza B. Almost all of the pre-licensure pediatric studies used vaccine formulations of 0.25 mL in children 6 to 35 months of age, both for IIV3-Adj and the comparator unadjuvanted influenza vaccine (NACI recommends 0.5 mL dosage of IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD for all age groups). There is limited immunogenicity evidence comparing IIV3-Adj at 0.25 mL dose to IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD at 0.5 mL dose in the 6 to 23 month age group. Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6 to 72 Months of Age for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in children. for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in children. Safety The safety data in children are consistent with what is known about IIV3-Adj's safety profile in adults. In pediatric trials, IIV3-Adj was more reactogenic than IIV3-SD, with recipients experiencing 10 to 15% more solicited local and systemic reactions. However, most reactions were mild and resolved quickly. A dose-ranging study of MF59-Adj and unadjuvanted IIV3 and IIV4 did not find an increased risk of AEs associated with increased MF59 dose, antigen dose, or the addition of a second B strain; however, the reactogenicity of 15 µg formulations were slightly higher for both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines compared to the corresponding 7.5 µg formulationsFootnote 133. There are currently no data on the effects of long-term or repeated administration of adjuvanted influenza vaccines in children. The most significant experience with an adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children was the AS03-Adj A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine that has been associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy. A study comparing two AS03-Adj A(H1N1) vaccine products (Pandemrix and Arepanrix) has suggested that the underlying immune mediated mechanism associated with the increased narcolepsy risk may not be initiated by the adjuvant, but by the A(H1N1) nucleoprotein viral antigen, given that the study found significant antigenic differences between the two A(H1N1) pandemic vaccinesFootnote 136. However, the pandemic vaccine was a single strain adjuvanted vaccine administered only during one season, and it is unknown what effects a multi-strain adjuvanted vaccine or an adjuvanted vaccine administered for more than one season may have in young children. Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6-72 Months of Age for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in children. Standard-dose, egg-based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Afluria® Tetra (Seqirus) Flulaval® Tetra (GlaxoSmithKline) Fluzone® Quadrivalent (Sanofi) Influvac® Tetra (BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan, d.b.a. Viatris Canada) Literature review on quadrivalent influenza vaccines (IIV4) In July 2014, NACI published a systematic literature review of the efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of IIV4 to inform recommendations on immunization against influenza in adults and children 6 months of age and older using quadrivalent influenza vaccines. Refer to the Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines for additional details. Efficacy and effectiveness One study assessed the efficacy of IIV4-SD in children 3 to 8 years of age. In this study, efficacy was estimated to be 59%, in comparison to children who received hepatitis A vaccineFootnote 137. Immunogenicity The results of phase II and III trials that compared trivalent formulations to quadrivalent formulations generally showed non-inferiority of the quadrivalent products for the A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B strain contained in the trivalent formulations. As expected, these studies showed that the immune response to the B strain that was not in the trivalent formulation was better in subjects who received the quadrivalent vaccine, which contained the additional B strain. Safety Pre-licensure clinical trials (refer to Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines) and post-marketing surveillance showed that IIV4-SD had a similar safety profile to IIV3-SDFootnote 138. Influvac® Tetra (BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan, d.b.a. Viatris Canada) Following the vaccination recommendations on the use of standard-dose, egg based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) published in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023, an expanded age indication for the use Influvac Tetra was authorized. Influvac Tetra was first authorized by Health Canada for use in adults 18 years of age and older on March 1, 2019. Subsequently, an expanded age indication down to children 3 years to 17 years of age was authorized on February 20, 2020, based on a review of the Health Canada assessment of data from phase 3 RCTs conducted in several European countries. One RCT was conducted in adults 18 years of age and older (n=1,980), and one RCT was conducted in children 3 to 17 years of age (n=1,200). Both RCTs compared Influvac Tetra to its trivalent formulation (Influvac; IIV3-SD), which had previously been authorized for use in persons 18 years of age and older. Recommendations on the use of Influvac Tetra in adults and children three years of age and older can be found in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022. A second age indication extension to children 6 to 35 months was authorized on March 8, 2022. NACI reviewed the Health Canada assessment of the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of Influvac Tetra compared to non-influenza vaccines (NIVs) in children 6 to 35 months of age (n=2,007). The RCT was conducted across Europe and Asia over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2019 and the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons). Refer to the product monograph for further details and supporting evidence on the use of Influvac Tetra in the various age groups mentioned above. Efficacy and effectiveness The absolute vaccine efficacy of Influvac Tetra compared with NIV against any seasonal strain in children 6 to 35 months was 54% (VE: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.66%). The estimated vaccine efficacy was higher for antigenically matching strains (VE: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81%). Vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 21% in children 6 to 11 months of age (VE: 0.21; 95 % CI: -0.70 to 0.64%); however, the study was not powered for subgroup analyses by age groupFootnote 139. Immunogenicity Results from the two pivotal trials conducted in adults and children 3 years of age and older demonstrated that Influvac Tetra met the non-inferiority criteria for the adjusted GMT ratio for all tested influenza strains when compared to the trivalent formulation. Recipients of the trivalent formulations showed, to a lesser degree, some immune response to the B strain not contained in the trivalent formulation. In the RCT conducted in adults, seroconversion and seroprotection rates for all four strains in the Influvac Tetra group were higher than the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria for influenza vaccines. In the RCT conducted in children 3 to 17 years of age, seroconversion rates were over 60% across all vaccination groups for all four strains. A review of clinical data submitted to Health Canada by the manufacturer was conducted to examine the use of Influvac Tetra in children 6 months to less than 3 years (i.e., 35 months) of age. Specifically, the immunogenicity of Influvac Tetra was assessed in a phase 3 RCT conducted in children 6 to 35 months of age. Participants experienced a substantial increase in hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres in response to vaccination against influenza type A [A(H1N1) and A(H3N2)], based on GMTs, geometric mean fold increase (GMFI), seroconversion rates and seroprotection rates. However, immunogenicity results for influenza type B (B/Yamagata lineage and B/Victoria lineage) were noted to be low for the four immunogenicity outcomes included in the study. Refer to the product monograph for additional details. Safety The analysis of vaccine safety across all three phase 3 clinical trials including adults and children 6 months of age and older, demonstrated that Influvac Tetra was well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed. The incidence of solicited (local and systemic), unsolicited AEs and SAEs were generally comparable between the two intervention groups. AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Notably, no deaths were reported across the three clinical trials. Standard dose mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-cc) Vaccine currently authorized for use: Flucelvax® Quad (Seqirus) Methods Following the IIV4-cc vaccination recommendations published in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023, an expanded age indication for the use of IIV4-cc in children 6 months to 47 months was authorized. Flucelvax Quad was first authorized for use in adults and children 9 years of age and older on November 22, 2019. In support of this, NACI conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety data for children in this age group. Refer to the NACI Supplemental Statement on Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza Vaccines and to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023 for further details. An age indication extension for the use of Flucelvax Quad in adults and children 2 years and older was authorized on March 8, 2021.Recommendations were developed based on a review of the Health Canada assessment of a multi-country phase 3/4 RCT on the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Flucelvax Quad in children 2 years to less than18 years of age conducted over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 influenza season and the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons). Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023 for further details. A second age indication extension to children 6 months to 47 months was authorized on March 8, 2022. To support this age indication extension, NACI reviewed the Health Canada assessment of a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial of the immunogenicity and safety of IIV4-cc compared to Afluria Tetra (IIV4-SD) in healthy children (N=2402) 6 to 47 months of age submitted by the manufacturer. The clinical trial was conducted in 47 sites across the United States during the 2019-2020 influenza season. The analysis of vaccine immunogenicity and safety in children 6 months to 47 months were consistent with the findings of the previous NACI systematic literature review and the Health Canada clinical assessment. Efficacy and effectiveness Evidence for the effectiveness of IIV4-cc is based on the studies included in the systematic review presented in the NACI Supplemental Statement on Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza Vaccines and the Health Canada assessment of clinical trial evidence supporting the extended age indication for the use of the vaccine in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Evidence related to the efficacy of the trivalent formulation, IIV3-cc, was used to supplement existing evidence for the efficacy of IIV4-cc. For further details refer to the NACI Influenza and Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022–2023. Immunogenicity In support of extended age indication for the use of the vaccine in adults and children 6 months of age and older, immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of the phase 3/4 RCT study participants 6 months to 47 months of age during the Northern Hemisphere 2019-2020 influenza season. Non-inferiority criteria were met for all tested influenza strains [A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Yamagata lineage, B/Victoria lineage], based on GMT ratios and seroconversion rates. Overall, there is fair evidence that IIV4-cc has non-inferior immunogenicity to IIV4-SD. Safety The analysis of vaccine safety in a clinical trial in children 6 to 47 months of age demonstrated that IIV4-cc is well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed. The majority of solicited (local and systemic) were short in duration. There were no observable differences in the occurrence of AEs between participants who received Flucelvax Quad and versus those who received the comparator vaccine. A small proportion of participants experienced at least one SAE in each study arm. No SAE were determined to be related to receipt of the study vaccines. Overall, there is fair evidence that IIV4-cc is a safe and well-tolerated alternative to conventional egg-based influenza vaccines for children and adults. High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-HD) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Sanofi) The trivalent formulations of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccines have recently been discontinued and are no longer authorized or available for use in Canada. All IIV-HD products expected to be available in Canada for the 2023-2024 season are quadrivalent. Methods In 2018, NACI published a literature review on the efficacy and effectiveness of high dose trivalent inactivated vaccines (IIV3-HD) in older adults. Refer to NACI's Literature review update on the efficacy and effectiveness of high-dose (Fluzone® High-Dose) and MF59-adjuvanted (Fluad®) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older for further details. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) builds on the clinical development of its trivalent predecessor Fluzone High-Dose (IIV3-HD) since both vaccines have the same manufacturing process and overlapping compositions. Therefore, data on the efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of IIV3-HD are relevant and inferred to IIV4-HD. Efficacy and effectiveness There is good evidence that Fluzone High-Dose (IIV3-HD) provides better protection compared with IIV3-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. Two studies found that IIV3-HD may provide greater benefit in adults 75 years of age and older compared to adults 65 to 74 years of ageFootnote 140Footnote 141. The efficacy results for IIV3-HD are inferred to IIV4-HD based on the non-inferior immunogenicity, described in the next section. Immunogenicity There is evidence that immunization with IIV3-HD elicits a higher immune response compared to immunization with IIV3-SD in older adults Footnote 142Footnote 143 Footnote 144Footnote 145 Footnote 146Footnote 147 Footnote 148Footnote 149. Across all three influenza vaccine strains, rates of seroconversion were found to be about 19% higher (ranging from 8 to 39% higher) for the IIV3-HD group. The post-vaccination GMT ratios (GMTR) of participants' responses to IIV3-HD was about 1.5 to 1.8 times higher than those receiving IIV3-SD (cite). There is good evidence that the immunogenicity for Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) is non-inferior to IIV3-HDFootnote 150Footnote 151. In a pivotal RCT, IIV4-HD met all non-inferiority criteria set by the US Food and Drug Administration, based on GMTR and seroconversion rates when compared to IIV3-HDFootnote 151. Immunogenicity for IIV4-HD was superior for the influenza B strain not contained within the trivalent high dose vaccineFootnote 151. Safety IIV3-HD has been observed to produce a higher rate of some systemic and local reactions than IIV3-SD. Studies have reported higher rates of malaise, myalgia, and moderate to severe fever. Most systemic reactions were mild and resolved within 3 days. SAEs were rare and similar in frequency between standard-dose and high-dose vaccines. When comparing the two high dose vaccine products, IIV4-HD has been shown to produce a comparable rate of systemic and local reactions compared to IIV3-HD. A comparable proportion of study participants also experienced unsolicited and serious AEsFootnote 151. Recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) Vaccines currently authorized for use: Supemtek™ (Sanofi) Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted on the vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of RIV4 in adults 18 years of age and older. NACI used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to review the evidence and develop relevant recommendations on the use of RIV4. Further information on this framework can be found in the GRADE handbook. The complete details of this review, rationale, relevant considerations and additional information supporting this recommendation can be found in the NACI Supplemental Statement – Recombinant Influenza Vaccines and the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022-2023. Efficacy and effectiveness One RCT that evaluated the efficacy of RIV4 demonstrated that Supemtek was statistically significantly more efficacious than egg-based IIV4-SD in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza illness in adults 50 years of age and olderFootnote 152. Non-inferiority assessments suggested that RIV4 may be more effective than IIV4-SD influenza vaccines against laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection, but not laboratory-confirmed influenza B virus infection in older adults. Overall, there is fair evidence (of low certainty) that the efficacy of RIV4 is non-inferior to traditional egg-based comparators, based on data in adults aged 50 years and older. Immunogenicity Eight RCTsFootnote 152Footnote 153 Footnote 154Footnote 155 Footnote 156Footnote 157 Footnote 158Footnote 159 assessed the immunogenicity of RIV4. The immunogenicity outcomes reported included seroconversion rates Footnote 152Footnote 153 Footnote 154Footnote 155 Footnote 156Footnote 157 Footnote 158Footnote 159, seroprotection rates Footnote 152Footnote 153 Footnote 154Footnote 159, and GMTR Footnote 152Footnote 155 Footnote 159Footnote 160. Across the eight studies, Supemtek demonstrated non-inferiority compared to previously authorized IIVs (IIV3-HD, IIV3-Adj, IIV4-SD, and IIV4-cc) against A(H1N1), most strains of A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage. In some studies, RIV4 did not meet non-inferiority criteria against B/Victoria lineage compared to previously authorized IIVs based on seroconversionFootnote 152Footnote 155, seroprotectionFootnote 152, and GMTRFootnote 161. Pooled seroconversion data from threeFootnote 152Footnote 154Footnote 157 of the eight RCTs conducted in adult participants 50 years of age and older identified that RIV4 induced similar antibody responses compared to IIV4-SD, IIV3-HD, and IIV3-Adj. Overall, there is fair evidence (of moderate certainty) that the immunogenicity for RIV4 is non-inferior to traditional egg-based comparators, based on data in adults aged 18 years and older. Safety Six studiesFootnote 152Footnote 154 Footnote 155Footnote 157 Footnote 162Footnote 163 assessed the safety of RIV4 in adults, including five RCTs and one post-marketing surveillance study using data from the United States Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)Footnote 162. The five RCTs found RIV4 to be safe and well-tolerated compared to conventional egg-based IIVs (noting that no published clinical data pertaining to safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy were available at the time of the review). Most AE reported to VAERS following RIV4 administration were non-serious. When data from two RCTsFootnote 152Footnote 154 conducted among adult participants 50 years of age and older were pooled, no difference in the odds of experiencing a SAE following administration of RIV4 and traditional egg-based IIV3-HD and IIV4-SD vaccine comparators was detected. Overall, there is evidence of moderate certainty that RIV4 is a safe and well-tolerated alternative to conventional egg-based influenza vaccines for adults. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) Vaccine currently authorized for use: FluMist® Quadrivalent (AstraZeneca) All LAIV products expected to be available in Canada for the 2023-2024 season are quadrivalent. Efficacy and effectiveness After careful review of the available Canadian and international LAIV VE data over many influenza seasons, NACI concluded that the current evidence is consistent with LAIV providing comparable protection against influenza to that afforded by IIV and does not support a recommendation for the preferential use of LAIV in children 2 to 17 years of age. Additionally, NACI concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the immunogenicity and safety supporting the use of LAIV in adults with immunocompromised conditions and does not support the use of LAIV in this group. Observational studies from the United States found low effectiveness of LAIV against circulating post-2009 pandemic A(H1N1) [A(H1N1)pdm09], in 2013–2014 and 2015–2016; however, reduced LAIV effectiveness was not observed in Canada or any other countries that have investigated the issue. Manufacturer investigation identified potential reduced replicative fitness of the A(H1N1)pdm09-like LAIV viruses in the nasal mucosa from the two affected A(H1N1)-dominant seasons compared to pre-2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) LAIV viruses as contributing to the poor LAIV effectiveness against circulating A(H1N1)Footnote 60. This finding led to the manufacturer replacing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of LAIV with new strains, with the A/Slovenia/2903/2015 being the strain that has been used since the 2017–2018 season. In adults, studies have found IIV-SD to be similarly or more efficacious or effective compared with LAIV. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018–2019 for detailed information supporting this recommendation. Immunogenicity LAIV, which is administered by the intranasal route, is thought to result in an immune response that mimics that induced by natural infection with wild-type viruses, with the development of both mucosal and systemic immunity. Local mucosal antibodies protect the upper respiratory tract and may be more important for protection than serum antibody. Studies have demonstrated that the presence of a hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response after the administration of LAIV3 is predictive of protection. However, efficacy studies have shown protection in the absence of a significant antibody response as wellFootnote 164. In these studies, LAIV3 has generally been shown to be equally, if not more, immunogenic compared to IIV3-SD for all 3 strains in children, whereas IIV3-SD was typically more immunogenic in adults than LAIV3. Greater rates of seroconversion to LAIV3 occurred in baseline seronegative individuals compared to baseline seropositive individuals in both pediatric and adult populations, because pre-existing immunity may interfere with response to a live vaccine. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for further details regarding the immunogenicity of LAIV3. LAIV4 has shown non-inferiority based on immunogenicity compared to LAIV3 in both children and adults. The immune response to the B strain found only in the quadrivalent formulation was better in children who received the quadrivalent vaccineFootnote 165Footnote 166Footnote 167. Safety The most common AEs experienced by recipients of LAIV3 are nasal congestion and runny nose, which are also reported for LAIV4. In a large efficacy trial, rates of wheezing were statistically higher among children 6 to 23 months of age for LAIV3 compared to IIV3-SDFootnote 164. This finding is expected to be the same for recipients of LAIV4; however, pre-licensure clinical studies for LAIV4 were conducted only in adults and children 2 years of age and older. LAIV4 is not authorized in children less than 2 years of age. Studies on LAIV3 have shown that vaccine virus can be recovered by nasal swab in children and adults following vaccination (i.e., "shedding"). The frequency of shedding decreases with increasing age and time since vaccination. Shedding is generally below the levels needed to transmit infection, although in rare instances, shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated people. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist®): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011–2012 for more information on LAIV and viral shedding. Considerations related to children living with HIV infection Following a review of the literature regarding the use of LAIV in individuals living with HIV, NACI concluded that LAIV is immunogenic in children with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. In addition, NACI concluded that LAIV appears to have a similar safety profile as IIV in children on HAART and with stable HIV infection with regard to frequency and severity of AEsFootnote 168. As expected, injection site reactions were seen only with IIV and nasal symptoms were more common with LAIV. However, the evidence base is too small to effectively detect uncommon, rare, and very rare AEs related to the use of LAIV in in this population. Nasal spray may be preferable to IM injection for some individuals who are averse to receiving the vaccine by injection. Therefore, NACI recommends that LAIV may be considered as an option for children 2 to 17 years of age with stable HIV infection on HAART and with adequate immune function. LAIV should be considered only in children with HIV who meet all of the following criteria: Receiving ART for 4 months or longer CD4 count equal to or greater than 500/µL if 2 to 5 years of age, or ≥200/µL if 6 to 17 years of age (measured within 100 days before administration of LAIV) HIV plasma RNA less than 10,000 copies/mL (measured within 100 days before administration of LAIV) IM influenza vaccination is still considered the standard for children living with HIV by NACI and the Canadian Pediatric and Perinatal HIV/AIDS Research Group, particularly for those without HIV viral load suppression (i.e., plasma HIV RNA >40 copies/mL). However, if IM vaccination is not accepted by the individual or substitute decision maker, LAIV would be a reasonable option for children meeting the criteria listed above. Refer to the NACI Statement on the Use of LAIV in HIV-Infected Individuals for more information on the use of LAIV in this population. References Footnote 1 World Health Organization.

Moreover, these viruses’ high capacity for mutation makes them particularly elusive and hard to combat. Now, a team of researchers led by the University of Geneva (UNIGE) has discovered that the influenza A virus manages to penetrate and infect cells by attaching itself to a receptor on the cell surface and hijacking the organism’s iron transport mechanism to start its infection cycle. Since, by blocking this particular receptor, the experts managed to significantly reduce the virus’ ability to invade cells, this finding could potentially be exploited to combat flu infections and mitigate epidemics.What the researchers learned “We already knew that the influenza A virus binds to sugar structures on the cell surface, then rolls along the cell surface until it finds a suitable entry point into the host cell. However, we did not know which proteins on the host cell surface marked this entry point, and how they favored the entry of the virus,” explained study senior author Mirco Schmolke, an associate professor of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine at UNIGE.At first, the researchers identified cell surface proteins from the vicinity of the viral haemagglutinin, the protein the influenza A virus uses to enter the cells. One of these proteins – called “transferrin receptor 1” – which helps transporting iron molecules that are essential for many physiological functions into the cell was found to play a major role in how the virus succeeds in penetrating the cells.“The influenza virus takes advantage of the continuous recycling of the transferrin receptor 1 to enter the cell and infect it,” said lead author Béryl Mazel-Sanchez, a senior scientist at the biopharmaceutical company CSL Behring and a former post-doctoral researcher in Schmolke’s lab. “To confirm our discovery, we genetically engineered human lung cells to remove the transferrin receptor 1, or on the contrary to overexpress it. By deleting it in cells normally susceptible to infection, we prevented influenza A from entering. Conversely, by overexpressing it in cells normally resistant to infection, we made them easier to infect.”Promising resultsIn a follow-up experiment, the scientists managed to use a chemical molecule to reproduce this mechanism by inhibiting the transferrin receptor 1. “We tested it successfully on human lung cells, on human lung tissue samples and on mice with several viral strains. In the presence of this inhibitor, the virus replicated much less. However, in view of its potentially oncogenic characteristics, this product cannot be used to treat humans,” Mazel-Sanchez explained. Nonetheless, anti-cancer therapies based on the inhibition of the transferrin receptor could potentially benefit from these discoveries.In addition to this particular receptor, the researchers have also identified about 30 other proteins that may play a role in how the influenza A virus enter the cells. Although it is likely that the virus uses a combination involving other receptors to infect cells, further research is needed to clarify these mechanisms.“Although we are still far from a clinical application, blocking the transferrin receptor 1 could become a promising strategy for treating influenza virus infections in humans and potentially in animals,” the authors concluded.The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.More about the influenza virus Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that primarily spreads through the upper and/or lower respiratory tract. It is more commonly known as the flu. The influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are categorized into four types: A, B, C, and D.Flu typesInfluenza A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the four influenza types and cause the most severe disease. The influenza A virus can be broken down into different subtypes based on the chemical structure of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins on their surface. For instance, H1N1 and H3N2 are subtypes of influenza viruses that have caused human pandemics.Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but can be broken down into lineages and strains. Currently circulating influenza B viruses belong to one of two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria. Influenza B is less common but can still cause outbreaks of seasonal flu.Influenza C viruses cause only mild respiratory illness, or no symptoms at all, so they do not cause epidemics or pandemics. Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause illness in people.Flu viruses can change through a process called antigenic drift and shift. Antigenic drift happens gradually over time as the virus makes small changes to its genetic composition, while antigenic shift is an abrupt, major change to the influenza A viruses, resulting in new hemagglutinin and/or new neuraminidase proteins.Symptoms of infection Influenza is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, aching muscles, headache, severe malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. But influenza can cause severe illness or death in high-risk populations such as the very young, elderly, and individuals with certain chronic health conditions.Flu vaccinationVaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes caused by influenza viruses. Antiviral drugs are also available and can make your illness milder and make you feel better faster. They can also prevent serious flu complications.Despite the availability of vaccines, the flu virus remains a major public health concern, largely due to its ability to change and mutate over time. Scientists are actively researching ways to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against all strains of the virus.—-By Andrei Ionescu, Earth.com Staff WriterCheck us out on EarthSnap, a free app brought to you by Eric Ralls and Earth.com.RELATED NEWS11-11-2024Deer mice shed light on adaptive evolution11-11-2024DNA evidence reveals new clues about Pompeii's eruption victims11-11-2024How did the COVID pandemic influence the seasonal flu?11-11-2024Elephant seal colony lost 95% of its pups to bird flu11-11-2024Frogs exposed to radiation show no signs of accelerated aging11-11-2024Proba-3: A mission to see the Sun like we've never seen it before11-11-2024Plants have sophisticated strategies to balance defense and growth11-11-2024Coaches who show compassion help athletes perform better11-11-2024Oil profits could save the planet if governments tax them now11-11-2024Social media is helping save wild animals like caracals11-11-2024Why do Australian finches have bright red and yellow bills?11-10-2024Memory is stored in cells throughout the body, not just the brainhomenewsnews-category/scienceNews coming your wayThe biggest news about our planet delivered to you each daySUBSCRIBEAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceSite MapStaffEARTH.COMNewsVideosImagesEarthpediaTake actionEARTHPEDIAArticlesAnimals EncyclopediaEndangered AnimalsPlants EncyclopediaEndangered PlantsEARTH NEWSBreaking NewsEnvironmentLifesyleVoicesAnimalsPlantsEarthsnapGet the appPrivacy PolicyTerms of serviceGET IN TOUCHContact Us© 2024 Earth.comAll rights reservedCanada reports first H5N5 avian flu in a mammal; US reports more H5N1 in animals | CIDRAP Skip to main content University of Minnesota Main navigationMain content University of Minnesotahttp:/win-cities.umn.edu/612-625-5000 Go to the U of M home page Main navigation News Antimicrobial Resistance COVID-19 Chronic Wasting Disease Influenza Mpox All Topics A-Z Resilient Drug Supply Influenza Vaccines Roadmap CIDRAP Leadership Forum Roadmap Development Coronavirus Vaccines Roadmap . .

In other developments, the United States reported several more detections involving H5N1 in mammals, and H5N1 outbreaks continue in wild birds and poultry on different continents. Raccoon deaths follow wild bird detections The raccoons were found in early April near Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island, which is located north of Nova Scotia in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, according to a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). The fully Eurasian H5N5 virus had been found earlier in wild birds on Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, according to the report. In an earlier risk assessment on intensifying spread of avian flu outbreaks in wild birds and poultry, WOAH warned that unprecedented genetic variability of avian flu subtypes in birds is creating an epidemiologically challenging landscape. "H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, or H5N8 are the subtypes currently circulating in poultry and wild bird populations across the world," it said. More H5N1 in US mammals In an update, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported 11 more H5N1 detections in mammals, bringing the total since April 2022 to 191. The animals that tested positive are from eight states. One was a black bear from Minnesota's Cass County, located in the north-central part of the state. Other states reporting cases include New York (red foxes), California (raccoon, mountain lion, Utah (mountain lion), Pennsylvania (red fox), Maine (red fox), Oregon (red fox), and Colorado (skunk). Health officials continue to monitor H5N1 spillovers from birds to animals, because the currently circulating clade in multiple world regions has a mutation that makes it more easily recognized by mammalian airway cells, including those of humans. These factors make it a potential pandemic threat. Scientists have developed candidate vaccine strains that target H5N1 in case immunization is needed for humans. For example, Japan's health ministry recently announced a plan to stockpile enough H5N1 vaccine for 10 million people, according to a media report. More global H5N1 detections in birds In related developments, countries in multiple world regions continue to report detections in wild birds and poultry. In Africa, Guinea reported H5N1 in wild birds—mostly terns and pelicans—at a nature park located on the country's Atlantic shore, according to a WOAH report. Russia last week reported more H5N1 detections in wild birds from three regions, and the United Kingdom reported H5N1 at another commercial poultry farm, a second affected facility in Lincolnshire.

Yes, you can get your flu vaccine and COVID booster safely at the same time, saving you a trip to the GP, nurse or pharmacy. Read more: Haven't had COVID or a vaccine dose in the past six months?

This is because we didn’t have adequate data of the individual and long-term effects of the new COVID vaccines. After examining the latest available evidence on safety and efficacy, the World Health Organization updated its interim guidelines. It suggests getting an influenza vaccine and any dose of any approved COVID vaccine at the same time is a practical option. However, until more data becomes available, the WHO advises using different arms for vaccination. This is to prevent the ingredients of the vaccines mixing and to limit the initial immune response to a different group of lymph nodes. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation updated its vaccination guidelines in March 2022, advising that influenza and COVID vaccines can be administered on the same day. It’s practical to get both at once. Shutterstock What happens when you get two shots at once? Getting multiple vaccinations at once isn’t new. Childhood vaccinations are routinely and safely administered at the same time. For COVID and flu vaccines, randomised controlled trials show no significant difference in the immune responses of the people who had both vaccines at once compared to those who had them on different days. Participants who had both vaccines at once reported the same types of side effects from the body’s inflammatory response to vaccination (injection-site pain, redness, swelling at the injection site) as well as general symptoms associated with both COVID and flu vaccines, such as fever, muscle pain and a headache. These minor side-effects were of similar intensity and duration to those who had either vaccine administered alone. Side effects are similar when you have the vaccines individually or at once. Annie Sprat/Unsplash Getting both COVID and flu vaccines is also more cost-effective, the uptake is higher when people don’t have to make multiple trips, and it saves health practitioners’ time. Read more: Should I get a flu vaccine this year? Here's what you need to know What about the viruses? Can you get COVID and the flu at the same time? Although simultaneous infections with two different viruses are common, SARS-CoV-2 has been infecting humans for a relatively short time. We therefore have limited data on how influenza strains and SARS-CoV-2 interact with the host at the same time, and if there is any interaction between the viruses. However, one large study in England reported that people positive for influenza had lower odds of also testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was attributed to possible cross-reactive immunity between viruses. It did, however, find people infected with both viruses at the same time had worse outcomes and were twice as likely to die as those who were only infected with SARS-CoV-2. Some experimental evidence suggested prior infection with type A influenza virus promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectiousness. This could be due to a unique feature of the influenza A virus which allows COVID to take hold more easily.

Influenza and COVID vaccines are available at GP clinics and pharmacies. Australians aged five years and over are eligible for a free COVID vaccination. The flu vaccine is free for people at higher risk of complications, including: pregnant women people six months and older with selected chronic conditions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For the rest of the population, the flu vaccine costs around A$20-30. Some practitioners also charge a consultation fee. Read more: I'm over 65 and worried about the flu. Which vaccine should I have?

Respiratory tract infections, including RSV and influenza, are not only a leading cause of hospitalization in children, but they are also associated with high mortality in children. Patients who are 2 years and younger and with underlying health conditions are at the greatest risk. However, the severity and presentation of RSV and influenza compared with COVID-19 infection have been areas with little research. The present study aimed to “compare demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes of children with RSV, influenza, or [COVID-19] in hospitalized children.”A retrospective cohort study was conducted in children who had been hospitalized with RSV, COVID-19, or influenza. Data were used from the CDC’s Emerging Infections Program Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, which collects data about laboratory-confirmed influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 in the Denver metropolitan. The population of the study was limited to children admitted to Children’s Hospital Colorado from October 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022. These dates corresponded to a period in which all children needed to be tested for COVID-19 via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on admission.The cohort included both symptomatic and asymptomatic children who had at least 1 positive PCR test within 14 days of admission or during admission. Children who were 18 years or older at admission, had a discharge diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or were coinfected with influenza, RSV, or COVID-19 were excluded from the study. Children who had a known coinfection of other respiratory pathogens were not excluded.Vaccination status was obtained from the Colorado Immunization Information System state vaccine registry data, electronic health record data, and primary care provider outreach. Partially vaccinated individuals were defined as a child who had only received 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or received their second dose within 2 weeks of thei test date. Vaccinated individuals for influenza were defined as children 6 months and older who had received at least 1 dose of influenza vaccine for a season.There were 899 inpatient stays from 867 children included in this study. There were 490 cases of RSV, 306 with COVID-19, and 51 with influenza; the children had a median (IQR) age of 1.5 (0.4-4.1) years.Children with RSV were younger (median age, 1 year) compared with children with COVID-19 (2.7 years) and influenza (6.1 years). Children with RSV also had high rates of diagnosed bronchiolitis (69.2%), pneumonia (16.1%), asthma exacerbation (8.8%), and acute respiratory failure (9.2%). Among children with COVID-19, however, there were lower rates of bronchiolitis (15.0%), pneumonia (10.1%), and acute respiratory failure (13.7%). Further, those with influenzaa higher rate of diagnosed acute asthma exacerbation (21.6%), but lower rates of pneumonia (7.8%) and acute respiratory failure (7.8%).Length of stay was longest for children with a diagnosis of RSV, with a median length of 4 days compared with 3 days for COVID-19 and influenza. The median age of children admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 1.86 (0.44-5.96) years for COVID-19, 6.09 (2.05-8.68) years for influenza, and 0.56 (0.11-1.61) years for RSV. High flow use (22.9%) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (18.6%) were highest in children with RSV. There were also 2 deaths in children with RSV vs 1 death in children with COVID-19 and no deaths in influenza.A multivariable log-binomial regression analysis found that the risk of ICU admission was highest in children with influenza (relative risk [RR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.22-3.19). Risk of pneumonia (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.54-3.52) and bronchiolitis (RR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.28-3.78) were higher in children with RSV. Children with RSV were also more likely to have a length of stay longer than 4 days (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.76) and require higher oxygen support (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.54-2.63).Data from this study were from a single center and retrospective, the study was limited to hospitalized children, and population-based estimates of disease burden could not be provided, marking limitations on generalizability of these findings.The researchers concluded that a season with circulation of RSV, influenza, and COVID-19 contained hospitalizations that were primarily due to RSV and from respiratory illnesses, and required higher levels of oxygen.ReferenceRao S, Armistead I, Tyler A, Lensing M, Dominguez SR, Alden NB.

Study: Interim 2022/23 influenza vaccine effectiveness: six European studies, October 2022 to January 2023. Image Credit: LeighPrather/Shutterstock.com Background Different types (A or B) or subtypes (e.g., A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09) of influenza viruses exist. In the European continent, between 2022 and 2023, several influenza virus subtypes have been circulating. Research is required to improve our understanding of the immune protection conferred by the influenza vaccine during this period, considering the influence of individual ages, settings, and viral subtypes. About the study In the present study, researchers presented interim influenza VE estimates for the 2022-2023 influenza season from six studies conducted in outpatient (primary healthcare facilities), inpatient (hospitals), and emergency care settings in Europe to inform measures of influenza control and prevention for the remaining season. The included studies used a similar (test-negative) study design but differed in characteristics such as patient selection, data sources, age groups, and case definitions. Logistic regression modeling was performed to estimate influenza subtype-specific and overall vaccine effectiveness for every study, adjusting for potential confounding. Data were obtained through electronic database linkage and prospective patient recruitment. In primary care facilities, nasopharyngeal or salivary specimens were obtained from individuals with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. The patients were admitted to the emergency care departments if they had undergone influenza swab tests from two weeks before one week after the emergency department visit for influenza infections and associated complications.

Meta-analysis highlights potential ICU reductionHexavalent vaccine can reduce spread of whooping coughSwabs were obtained from SARI patients in hospitals. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the influenza virus. Individuals receiving the 2022-2023 influenza vaccine ≥two weeks before symptom onset were vaccinated. The team excluded individuals vaccinated before two weeks of symptom onset or with unknown vaccination dates. Influenza virus-positive samples were selected for genome sequencing and haemagglutinin genome segment analysis. Subsequently, phylogenetic analysis was performed for genetic clade determination. VE (age-specific, study setting-specific, and overall) was computed based on the adjusted odds ratio (OR) values for vaccination, determined by logistic regression modeling. In addition, the team performed a sensitivity analysis using penalized logistic regression (PLR) to analyze data from studies including less than 10 cases or controls per parameter. Results In total, 20,477 individuals with influenza were enrolled, 81% of whom (n=16,589) were infected with the influenza A virus, and 19% (3,913) were infected with the influenza B virus. Among the participants, 44 were coinfected with influenza A and B, and 15 were coinfected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). VE estimates against influenza A ranged between 27% and 44%, irrespective of age and setting. For all age groups and study settings, VE point estimates ranged between 28.0% and 46.0% for preventing A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and were higher for children at 49.0% to 77.0%. The overall VE of the influenza vaccine in preventing A(H3N2) infection ranged between 2.0% and 44.0% and was higher for children (between 62.0% and 70.0%). The overall and age-specific estimated VE in preventing influenza B/Victoria infection were ≥50.0% (between 87% and 95% for children). Among the 175 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses sequenced, all but one 99% (n=174) belonged to genetic clade 6B.1A.5a.2, the same as the vaccine virus. The viruses had undergone the K54Q, A186T, Q189E, E224A, R259K, and K308R mutations compared with the vaccine virus A/Victoria/2570/2019. Of the 570 influenza A(H3N2) viruses sequenced, all belonged to the same clade as the vaccine strain (3C.2a1b.2a.2). Of the influenza B/Victoria viruses sequenced (n=82), all belonged to the V1A.3a.2 clade, represented by B/Austria/1359417/2021, which is also the vaccine virus. Results with small sample sizes were subject to sensitivity analyses, most of which gave similar results. Conclusions The study findings showed a ≥27% decrease in influenza A infections and a ≥50% decrease in influenza B infections across ages due to influenza vaccines, with a higher VE among children. The findings indicated that the vaccine conferred some immune protection against the influenza virus and its subtypes in primary care facilities, emergency departments, and hospitals. The VE estimates were higher for influenza B and among children. Although the study provides interim results, the findings underpin the continuation of influenza vaccination as the influenza season unfolds, following national recommendations. Future studies must include the genetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses and the determination of VE at the season's end to enhance our knowledge of the differences in VE results by influenza subtype and inform policymaking and strategy development to improve preparedness and reduce the disease burden in Europe.

They include some birds around Summerside, but also some dead raccoons found on the North Shore. (Wilfredo Lee/The Associated Press)Social SharingA new subtype of the avian influenza virus has been detected in birds and raccoons on Prince Edward Island.H5N5 is a subtype of the bird flu virus. It's closely related to the H5N1 virus that has caused mass death among seabird populations in Atlantic Canada in the past year or so.On the Island, H5N5 cases have been discovered in Prince County. They include some birds around Summerside, but also some dead raccoons found on the North Shore.This is the first time H5N5 has been found in mammals.5,500 sick or dead birds recorded in New Brunswick last year, scientist saysHunters in N.L. warned to take precautions with avian influenza "It has been detected in some crows, in a red-tailed hawk in the winter ... And then recently, beginning of April, we received some raccoons which it was found in," said Megan Jones, director of the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative for the Atlantic region, and an assistant professor at the Atlantic Veterinary College."It's a new virus in name, but it's actually very closely related to H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has been circulating in our region for over a year now."Jones said it was likely that one or more of the infected raccoons ate the carcass of a bird that had been infected with the virus.Migration from Europe likely culpritJones said scientists at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg determined the virus to be identical to one circulating in Europe recently.Gannets nest on the rocks at the Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve in Newfoundland. Some dead birds can be seen among the flock. (Darryl Murphy/CBC)"It's completely Eurasian," she said. "This virus is most closely related to one from Norway from 2022. So what we think is that birds migrating from Europe brought it over sometime in the fall to our region. We detected it in crows in January."Jones said there have been a few cases of H5N5 in New Brunswick as well. She said Islanders shouldn't handle any sick or dead bird or animal they might come across. Instead, they should contact provincial Fish and Wildlife officials at 902-368-4683 for help.Pet owners advised to keep dogs and cats away from dead birdsThe birds are back in town. Spring migration could fuel spread, evolution of avian flu, scientists warnMeanwhile, avian influenza continues to circulate among seabird colonies in Atlantic Canada, with outbreaks showing no sign of stopping as the spring migration continues.Experts say that movement will give the virus further chances for transmission. Jones said scientists hope the birds develop some sort of immunity, so mortality levels will be lower than last year."[H5N5] shouldn't behave very differently or any differently at all from the virus that's already here," Jones said. "It's an important virus overall, but H5N1 is too — and that virus hasn't gone away."With files from Nancy RussellCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Key points:New research finds a garlic variety that helps reduce infections related to COVID and influenza AThe garlic extract combines with the virus and prevents it from infecting cells in the digestive tractThe Peter Doherty Institute tested 20 varieties of garlic in different forms, but only one variety was effectiveA study by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (the Doherty Institute) and farming company Australian Garlic Producers has found that extracts of an as-yet-to-be-named garlic, have the ability to stop the spread of viral cells from SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A in the digestive system.The potentially flu-busting garlic is from a commercial crop grown in Merbein, near Mildura, in north-western Victoria. Doctor Julie McAuley from the Doherty Institute, which is a joint venture between the University of Melbourne and the Royal Melbourne Hospital, led the study.The team tested about 20 varieties of garlic in different forms, but the laboratory trials found only one type of garlic was effective in curbing the infectivity of the viruses. Dr McAuley said if this variety of garlic was taken as a dietary supplement it would "combine with the [COVID] virus and prevent it from infecting the cells in our digestive tract". Dr Julie McAuley says the garlic extract combines with the virus and prevents it from infecting the cells in the digestive tract. (Supplied: Australian Garlic Producers)"We know that [COVID] and flu can both infect our digestive tract, and when outbreaks occur we monitor water waste to see where the virus is being excreted from," Dr McAuley said."So we know that people actually have it as a part of their stomach and intestines."She said the garlic supplement could slow down the virus "so our immune system can actually go on and attack the virus where it mainly infects us — in our respiratory tract".'It's something about the garlic'Dr McAuley said the effective variety of garlic was tested from two different sites, one in the Northern Territory and other in Mildura.Loading..."So that kind of eliminates any kind of soil impact, because they're two very different environments and different soils," she said."Because this one garlic variety held the same properties [despite being] grown in two different places, it makes us think it's something about the garlic itself rather than how it was grown."So if you have COVID or the flu and feel like your gastrointestinal system is feeling really icky, it will help keep the viral load down there."But as a preventative, it's an antioxidant that will help with your normal gut flora."The specific garlic variety must be ingested raw to receive the health benefits. (Supplied: Australian Garlic Producers)Health benefits if eaten rawAustralian Garlic Producers chief executive Nick Diamantopolous said that as a result of the discovery his company would be developing dietary supplements."Garlic is certainly healthy for you, but not all garlic is the same," Mr Diamantopolous said."There are some varieties that are good for flavour, but they don't necessarily all have health benefits."Over the past 18 months, he has been working with the Peter Doherty Institute to test a wide variety of garlic samples."We've got about 309 varieties in our collection, and out of the 20-odd garlic varieties that we tested, one in particular actually had 99.9 per cent viricidal properties," he said.Mr Diamantopolous said the product must be ingested raw."You have to have it fresh like in a salad, or uncooked form, the minute you cook it you'll destroy all the health benefits," he said.Australian Garlic Producers supply more than 90 per cent of Australia's garlic — 3,000 tonnes per year.Posted Wed 31 May 2023 at 5:04amWednesday 31 May 2023 at 5:04amWed 31 May 2023 at 5:04am, updated Wed 31 May 2023 at 6:37amWednesday 31 May 2023 at 6:37amWed

In response to severe influenza virus infection, adoptively transferred naïve hemagglutinin-specific CD4+ T cells from CD4+ TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice drive an IFN-γ-producing Th1 response in wild-type mice. It helps in virus clearance but also causes collateral damage and disease aggravation. The donor 6.5 mice have all the CD4+ T cells with TCR specificity toward influenza hemagglutinin. Still, the infected 6.5 mice do not suffer from robust inflammation and grave outcome. The initial Th1 response wanes with time, and a prominent Th17 response of recent thymic emigrants alleviates inflammation and bestows protection in 6.5 mice. Our results suggest that viral neuraminidase-activated TGF-β of the Th1 cells guides the Th17 evolution, and IL-17 signaling through the non-canonical IL-17 receptor EGFR activates the scaffold protein TRAF4 more than TRAF6 during alleviation of lung inflammation in severe influenza.

The clinical outcome depends on the interplay between the invading virus and the host immune response. Viral invasion causes a cytopathic effect that leads to tissue injury in the respiratory tract. The host immune system reacts to clear the virus, but the response also contributes to inflammation. If the immune activation and inflammation abate with the virus clearance, the infected individual recovers efficiently from an infection. However, immune activation and inflammation may persist beyond the virus clearance. Prolonged and exaggerated immune activation causes aggravation of the disease. The undesirable outcome of seasonal or pandemic influenza virus infections, SARS, MERS, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics are examples1. Modulation of the inflammation with overwhelming immune reactions is always a goal in disease management. Corticosteroid as a commonly implemented agent to quell lung inflammation also impairs pathogen clearance with suppressed inflammation and may aggravate the disease, as seen in severe influenza2,3,4,5, SARS6, MERS7, and COVID-19 patients8.Targeting cytokines is another option for suppressing inflammation. Tocilizumab and sarilumab target interleukin (IL)−6, and may help COVID-19 patients9. IL-17 is also a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine10. The high IL-17 levels in patients with severe diseases of COVID-191,11,12, SARS13, MERS14, and influenza15, make IL-17 a possible target of manipulation16. We detected IL-17 in the sera of our patients with severe COVID-1911, and also in lung-infiltrating influenza antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in our experimental mouse model of severe influenza17,18.In our influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen-specific mouse model, the influenza virus drives a Th1 response of adoptively transferred naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cells in the lungs17,18,19,20,21,22. The 2.5 × 106 adoptively transferred donor cells help in virus clearance but boost inflammation in the lungs and enhance mortality. Influenza virus infection of the donor mice, the HA-specific CD4+ T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic 6.5 mice23, drives activation of all CD4+ T cells in these mice, as all their CD4+ T cells have the TCRs specific to the HA of the influenza virus. We expected a grave outcome with such a massive Th1 response of all CD4+ T cells in the infected 6.5 mice. Although they lost more body weight at first, they suffered from mild lung inflammation and recovered well. Their recovery was associated with a prominent Th17 response on days 6 and 9. Here we studied the role of Th17 response in protection of mice against severe influenza. We demonstrated a Th1 guided evolution of Th17 response. Our results suggest that viral neuraminidase-activated TGF-β of the Th1 cells guides the Th17 evolution. IL-17 signaling through the non-canonical IL-17 receptor EGFR activates the scaffold protein TRAF4 more than TRAF6 during alleviation of lung inflammation in severe influenza.ResultsTh17 response is associated with the protection against severe influenzaIn our influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen-specific mouse model17,18,19,20,21,22, wild-type mice received adoptive transfer of 2.5 × 106 naïve HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells from 6.5 donor mice (WT mice + 6.5 cells) and got 2.5 × 103 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) PR8 strain of H1N1 influenza virus infection. Lung-infiltrating HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells (donor 6.5 cells) produced IFN-γ with the induction of Th1 transcription factor T-bet (Fig. 1a). There was base level IL-17 production with negligible Th17 transcription factor ROR-γt (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Adoptive transfer aggravated the disease of wild-type mice with influenza virus infection. Lungs were inflamed (Fig. 1b), and lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 cells acquired effector function on day 6. These cells augmented the HA peptide-stimulated proliferation of cognate naïve CD4+ T cells in vitro (Fig. 1b). Virus burden also decreased in the lung from day 3 to day 9, as revealed in the plaque assay (Fig. 1c). The mice continued to lose body weight up to day 8, when some of them started to die (Fig. 1c).Fig. 1: IL-17 response of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice is associated with improved recovery and survival benefit against severe influenza.a–c Th17 response and alleviated lung inflammation in HA-specific CD4+ TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice. a Th1 and Th17 responses of lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells, b Upper panels: gross lung pathology on day 6; Lower panels: naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro with infection-responding cells from lungs or spleens (c) virus burden in the lungs, body weight loss, and survival.

Photographs are representatives, and other values are means ± s.d. of at least 3 experiments (n = 6/group; ***p < 0.0001; NS non-significant, p > 0.05; two-tailed P values for unpaired t-test to compare two groups at a specific time point, Two-way ANOVA for body weight curves, and Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test for survival curves).Full size imageThe donor mice of the naïve HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells, the 6.5 TCR transgenic mice, have monotonous TCR on their CD4+ T cells, with the same α/β TCR responding to an MHC Class II I-Ed restricted epitope of the HA from A/PR/8/34 (PR8) strain H1N1 influenza virus23. We expected a grave outcome of influenza virus infection in the donor 6.5 mice, with a massive Th1 response of all CD4+ T cells in the infected 6.5 mice. In contrast to our anticipation, the prominent Th1 response with IFN-γ production was noted on day 3 only, but not thereafter on days 6 and 9 after 2.5 × 103 p.f.u. PR8 virus infection (Fig. 1a). On days 6 and 9, with activation of Th17 transcription factor ROR-γt in 30 ~ 50% of the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells, 25 ~ 40% of them produced IL-17 instead (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 2). Infected 6.5 mice displayed alleviated lung inflammation (Fig. 1b), and their lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells acquired regulatory function on day 6. These cells suppressed the HA peptide-stimulated proliferation of naïve cognate CD4+ T cells in vitro (Fig. 1b). Infected 6.5 mice lost significant body weight on day 3. They recovered from weight loss and all mice survived the infection (Fig. 1c). There was no live virus in the lungs on day 9 (Fig. 1c).IL-17 (interleukin-17A) is a well-claimed pro-inflammatory cytokine which contributes to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases11,12,13,14,15,16. But, a prominent IL-17 response of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells is associated with alleviated lung inflammation here in the infected 6.5 mice. The alleviation of lung inflammation and protection from influenza virus infection was lost in IL-17 knockout (KO) 6.5 mice. With 2.5 × 103 p.f.u. PR8 influenza virus, IL-17KO 6.5 mice incurred severe disease. The lung-infiltrating IL-17KO CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produced more inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α on day 6 (Fig. 1d).Th17 is the response of recent thymic emigrantsActivated CD4+ T cells expand at first, followed by contraction of the pool of cells. Influenza virus-driven activation of the adoptively transferred naïve HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells also followed a similar trend in infected wild-type mice (WT mice + 6.5 cells) during our experiments. The donor 6.5 cell pool expanded initially and then contracted in the lungs of wild-type mice (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cell population decreased in the infected 6.5 mice in the first 4 days. It then started to increase and return to the level prior to infection by day 11 post-infection (Fig. 2a). Cells from the thymus of 6.5 mice, the new thymic emigrants, may replenish the population of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells. We thus tested CD24 and Qa2 expression profile of the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in infected 6.5 mice. The matured thymocytes are known to express high-level CD24 and minimal Qa2. The CD4+ or CD8+ T cells lose CD24 and gain Qa2 expressions with time after being released to the periphery24. Among the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells of the infected 6.5 mice, we found a higher CD24 and lower Qa2 expressions on the surface of IL-17-producing than the IFN-γ-producing cells on day 6 (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Th17 is the response of recent thymic emigrants in TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice.a Recent thymic emigrants secrete more IL-17 and less IFN-γ in the infected lungs of 6.5 mice: Left panel: lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cell population kinetics in infected 6.5 mice. WT mice with adoptively transferred cells served as controls, as described in text. Middle and right panels: CD24 and Qa2 expression profiles of IL-17 or IFN-γ producing lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in infected 6.5 mice. b–d Thymectomy abolishes the supply of recent thymic emigrants and thymectomized 6.5 mice suffer from severe disease with less IL-17 production: b IL-17 and IFN-γ production with ROR-γt and T-bet induction of lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells and c Virus burden in the lungs on day 7. d Body weight loss after infection. Non-thymectomized 6.5 mice served as controls. WT mice with adoptively transferred cells served as another group of control mice, as described in text. Histograms and dot-plots are representatives, and other values are means ± s.d. of at least 3 experiments (n = 6/group; ***p < 0.0001; two-tailed P values for unpaired t-test to compare two groups at a specific time point, Two-way ANOVA for body weight curves).Full size imageTo validate the above finding that suggests the recent thymic emigrants as the source of IL-17 in the lungs of infected 6.5 mice, we did thymectomy in 2-week-old 6.5 mice and infected the thymectomized 6.5 mice after 2 weeks of recovery from the surgery. Thymectomy is the surgical removal of the thymus gland. It thus abolishes the supply of thymic emigrants. After 2.5 × 103 p.f.u. PR8 influenza virus infection, thymectomized 6.5 mice had less ROR-γt induction and IL-17 production in the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells on day 7 (Fig. 2b). The proportions of IFN-γ-producing cells were not changed by thymectomy, and ~15% of the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells produced IFN-γ in the thymectomized and non-thymectomized 6.5 mice by this time (Fig. 2b). As a result, thymectomy obliterated the IL-17 dominance in infected 6.5 mice and reverted the distribution between IL-17 and IFN-γ back to the pattern similar to that of donor 6.5 cells in infected wild-type mice (Fig. 2b). With this altered Th response, thymectomy caused higher virus burden in the lungs (Fig. 2c), and aggravated disease with more bodyweight loss (Fig. 2d) in the infected 6.5 mice. These results corroborate our findings that suggest Th17 is a protective response of recent thymic emigrants in infected 6.5 mice.Waning Th17 with aging-related thymic involution and severe disease of influenza virus infection in older than younger adult miceThymic involution causes decreased supply of thymic emigrants with age. Similar to wild-type mice, there were about 50 million thymocytes in 4-week-old 6.5 mice. The number decreased to 40 million in 8-week-old and 20 million in 12-week-old 6.5 mice. There were only 10 million thymocytes in 40-week-old 6.5 mice (Fig. 3a). In addition, there were less CD4+CD8+ double-positive cells in CD3+ thymocytes with age (Fig. 3b). Influenza virus infection induced less Th17 response in aged 6.5 mice compared to young 6.5 mice. About 30% of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells produced IL-17 in 4 or 8 week-old 6.5 mice on day 7 after the infection with 2.5 × 103 p.f.u. of PR8 influenza virus. The number decreased to less than 20% in 12-week-old and to around 10% in 40-week-old 6.5 mice (Fig. 3c, d). However, the percentage of IFN-γ producing cells did not change with age, and about 10–12% lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells produced IFN-γ in the 4–40-week-old 6.5 mice (Fig. 3c, d). As the percentage of IFN-γ producing cells did not change with age, the IL-17 dominance over IFN-γ production also decreased with age (Fig. 3e). Virus burden in the lungs was higher in old than young 6.5 mice on day 7 after infection (Fig. 3f). Old 6.5 mice suffered from disease of more severity than young 6.5 mice, with delayed recovery of the weight loss (Fig. 3g).Fig. 3: Waning Th17 with aging-related thymic involution and severe disease of influenza virus infection in older than younger adult 6.5 mice.a Thymocyte numbers and b CD4+CD8+ cell percentage in CD3+ thymocytes in healthy non-infected 6.5 mice of stated ages. c Dot-plots and d bar graphs display waning IL-17 and maintained IFN-γ responses of lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells with age of 6.5 mice on day 7 after infection. e Lost dominance of IL-17 response over the IFN-γ response of lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells with age of 6.5 mice on day 7 after infection. f Higher virus burden in the lungs on day 7 after infection, and g delayed recovery of bodyweight loss with age in infected 6.5 mice.

The donor 6.5 cells transferred with infection differentiated into IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells, and the donor 6.5 cells transferred 4 days later differentiated into IL-17-producing Th17 cells on day 8 after infection in the lungs of wild-type mice (Fig. 4a–c, Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 3). In the presence of Th1 cells derived from first transfer, 30% of the second transfer cells produced IL-17 and only less than 2% produced IFN-γ. About 5% of IL-17-producing cells produced IFN-γ as well (Fig. 4d). The second transfer cells also modified the phenotype of first transfer cells. There was a 40% reduction of IFN-γ production on day 8 after infection (Fig. 4d). In single transfer controls (WT mice + single-batch 6.5 cells), the donor 6.5 cells transferred with infection or on days 4 post infection were prominent IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells on day 8 post infection in the lungs of wild-type mice. There was only a marginal decrease of IFN-γ production and a marginal increase of IL-17 production of the day 4 transferred cells compared to the cells transferred with infection.

There were comparable TCR signal transduction from ZAP-70 phosphorylation to the induction of hallmark Th1 transcription factor T-bet in donor 6.5 cells of both transfers (Fig. 5c). With the substantial T-bet induction, there was a strong activation of Th17-associated transcription factor ROR-γt in the donor 6.5 cells of the second transfer (Fig. 5d). The donor 6.5 cells of the second transfer produced IL-17 instead of IFN-γ with the reduced T-bet dominance over ROR-γt (Fig. 5b–d). In addition, there was higher expression of the induced regulatory T (iTreg) cell marker LAG-3 in the donor 6.5 cells of the second transfer (Fig. 5e).Fig. 5: Th1-guided Th17 response with reduced dominance of T-bet over ROR-γt alleviates lung inflammation and bestows protection in infected wild-type mice.a Schematic diagram and Th17 response with b reduced dominance of T-bet over ROR-γt of the second-batch donor cells in the two-batch naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cell adoptive transfer experiment in infected wild-type mice. c Comparable strength of TCR signaling from ZAP70- phosphorylation to T-bet induction in the first-batch Th1 and second-batch Th17 cells in the lungs on day 8 after infection.

Improved protection was there with less pathology (Fig. 5g), and lower viral load in the lungs on day 8 after infection (Fig. 5h).We further defined the protective role of IL-17 from the second batch cells in the experiment with two adoptive transfers, by using donor 6.5 cells from naïve IL-17KO 6.5 mice in the second adoptive transfer ((WT mice + 1st batches 6.5 cells + 2nd batch IL-17KO 6.5 cells; Fig. 6a). Replacement of the second transfer cells with IL-17KO donor 6.5 cells abolished the protection with two transfers of IL-17 competent donor 6.5 cells (Fig. 6b). Despite facilitated virus clearance with the donor IL-17KO 6.5 cells (Fig. 6c), the mice suffered from aggravated disease with higher mortality with less IL-17 (Fig. 6d, f) and more inflammatory IFN-γ production in donor 6.5 cells of both transfers (Fig. 6e, f).Fig. 6: Lost protection of two-batch adoptive transfer experiment with the use of naïve IL-17KO HA-specific CD4+ T cells in the second-batch cell.a Schematic diagram and b lost protection of two-batch adoptive transfer experiment in infected wild-type mice with the adoptive transfer of naïve IL-17KO HA-specific CD4+ T cells in the second batch. c Day 8 virus burden in the lungs of infected wild-type mice in two-batch naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cell transfer experiment, with IL-17KO or IL-17 competent second-batch cells. d Unaltered IL-17 production by the first-batch cells, and e boosted IFN-γ production by both first- and second-batch cells with the second-batch naïve IL-17KO HA-specific CD4+ T cell transfer. f Representative dot-plots of IL-17 and IFN-γ production by both first- and second-batch cells with the second-batch naïve IL-17-competent or IL-17KO HA-specific CD4+ T cell transfer.

Naïve HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred into wild-type mice (WT mice + 6.5 cells) and the mice got infection of 2.5 × 103 p.f.u. of PR8 virus. The lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 cells had activated TGF-β on day 4 after infection in wild-type mice (Fig. 7a). They were retrieved from the recipient mice at that time for co-culture with naïve 6.5 CD4+ T cells in vitro. Without co-culture, the naïve 6.5 CD4+ T cells were Th1 cells and 16% of them produced IFN-γ after 48 h stimulation with PR8 virus in vitro. When co-cultured with the day 4 lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 cells, the naïve 6.5 CD4+ T cells were skewed to Th17 cells. Around 20% of them produced IL-17 and only 7% of them produced IFN-γ (Fig. 7b). Recombinant mouse TGF-β augmented and anti-TGF-β antibody attenuated the IL-17 production of the 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7c). Vaccinia virus carrying HA (Vac-HA) activated adoptively transferred naïve HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells in vivo to comparable amplitude as PR8 influenza virus. As Vac-HA does not have neuraminidase, donor 6.5 cells did not get activated TGF-β. After retrieval from the recipient mice on day 4, these Vac-HA activated lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 cells did not skew the Th1 cells into Th17 cells in the in vitro culture (Fig. 7).Fig. 7: Lung cells from influenza virus infected mice guides Th17 response of naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cells, and the response is facilitated by additional TGF-β.a TGF-β activation in the HA-specific CD4+ T cells by influenza virus, but not by HA-inserted vaccinia (Vac-HA) virus. Upper panel: Splenocytes from HA-specific TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice were stimulated overnight with influenza or Vac-HA virus. Lower Panel: Wild-type mice received naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cell adoptive transfer with influenza or Vac-HA virus infection, and lung cells were analyzed on day 4. b The Day 4 lung cells were mixed with naïve splenocytes from HA-specific TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice and stimulated with influenza virus for 48 h in vitro. c Addition of recombinant mouse TGF-β boosted, and anti-mouse TGF-β antibody attenuated IL-17 production by the HA-specific CD4+ T cells in the co-culture. Histograms and dot-plots are representatives.Full size imageInfluenza virus-activated TGF-β of the Th1 cells guide naïve cells to respond with Th17 phenotypeIn our earlier report, we demonstrated augmented TGF-β activation of the HA-specific CD4+ T cells in the absence of IL-1018. Here in, we tried two transfers of IL-10KO donor 6.5 cells into IL-10KO mice (IL-10KO mice + 2-batches of IL-10KO 6.5 cells; IL-10KO set), first transfer with PR8 influenza virus infection and second transfer on 4 days post infection. Two transfers of IL-10-competent donor 6.5 cells into wild-type mice (WT mice + 2-batches of 6.5 cells; WT set) served as controls (Fig. 8a, Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). There was higher active-TGF-β in the IL-10KO donor 6.5 cells of the first transfer in IL-10KO setting with no IL-10, compared to the IL-10-competent donor 6.5 cells of the first transfer in WT setting with IL-10 (Fig. 8b). In addition, there was higher IL-17 in the IL-10KO donor 6.5 cells of the second transfer in IL-10KO setting with no IL-10, compared to the IL-10-competent donor 6.5 cells of second transfer in the WT setting with IL-10. About 60% of the second transfer cells produced IL-17 in the absence of IL-10 on day 8 post infection, compared to 25% in the setting with IL-10 (Fig. 8c), and the IL-17 production of the second transfer cells was linked to the protection against influenza virus infection in IL-10KO mice (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 4).Fig. 8: Influenza virus-activated TGF-β of the Th1 cells guides Th17 response of naïve cognate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.a–c Two-batch adoptive transfer experiment in the absence of IL-10. a Schematic diagram: naïve IL-10KO HA-specific CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred into IL-10KO mice on days 0 and 4 after infection (IL-10KO set). Infected WT mice with IL-10 competent HA-specific CD4+ T cells (WT set) served as control. b More TGF-β of first-batch IL-10KO donor cells and c intensified Th17 response of the second-batch IL-10KO donor cells in IL-10KO set on day 8. d, e Two-batch adoptive transfer experiment in wild-type mice with HA-inserted vaccinia (Vac-HA) virus infection. d No Th17 response of the second-batch donor cells in mice with Vac-HA infection. Histograms and dot-plots are representatives, and other values are means ± s.d. of at least three experiments (n = 6/group; ***p < 0.0001; two-tailed P values for unpaired t-test).Full size imageWe next performed a similar two-transfer experiment in WT setting (WT mice + 2-batches of 6.5 cells) with HA-inserted vaccinia virus (Vac-HA) instead of PR8 influenza virus infection (Fig. 8d). The donor 6.5 cells of both transfers, transferred with infection and transferred on day 4, were activated into Th1 phenotype by the Vac-HA infection, as expected with the absence of active-TGF-β on the first transfer donor 6.5 cells (Fig. 8e).IL-17 signaling through the non-canonical IL-17 receptor EGFR activates the scaffold protein TRAF4 more than TRAF6 in the lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cellsIL-17 signaling through its well-known receptor IL-17RA contributes to inflammation26. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR; ErbB-1; HER1) has been described as a non-canonical receptor for IL-17. IL-17 signaling with EGFR has been demonstrated to participate in wound healing process27. We infected 6.5 mice with 2.5 × 103 p.f.u. of PR8 strain of influenza virus. Wild-type mice received adoptive transfer of naïve 6.5 donor cells with the infection (WT mice + 6.5 cells; WT set), and IL-17KO mice received adoptive transfer of naïve IL-17KO 6.5 donor cells with the infection (IL-17KO mice + IL-17KO 6.5 cells; IL-17KO set). There was up-regulation of both IL-17RA and EGFR on the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in 6.5 mice after the influenza virus infection. IL-17RA was up-regulated only on day 3 post infection, but not thereafter. EGFR was up regulated gradually from day 3 to day 6 and day 9-post infection (Fig. 9a). EGFR was more abundant than IL-17RA on the cell surface from day 6 to day 9 post infection (Fig. 9b). Up-regulation of IL-17RA and EGFR were also there on lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 and IL-17KO 6.5 cells of WT set and IL-17KO set, respectively (Fig. 9a, b, Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig. 5). However, there was EGFR dominance over IL-17RA on lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cell surfaces on day 6 but not on day 9 in WT set. There was no EGFR dominance over IL-17RA on days 6 and 9 in IL-17KO set (Fig. 9b).Fig. 9: The higher activation of TRAF4 than TRAF6 is associated with the abundance of EGFR over IL-17RA in influenza virus infected 6.5 mice.a EGFR and IL-17RA expressions on the surface of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in infected TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice, wild-type mice and IL-17KO mice.

(n = 6/group; ***p < 0.0001; NS non-significant, p > 0.05; two-tailed P values for unpaired t-test).Full size imageInfected 6.5 mice had an abundance of EGFR on the surface of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells, and it was associated with higher phosphorylation of EGFR on day 9 than day 6 and day 3. In contrast, only a base level phosphorylated-EGFR was detected in the lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 cells of WT set and donor IL-17KO cells of IL-17KO set on days 3, 6, and 9 (Fig. 9c). Upon stimulation of splenocytes from naïve 6.5 mice, IL-17KO 6.5 mice, or WT mice with 0.03 MOI influenza virus for 48 h in vitro, there was more EGFR phosphorylation of 6.5 CD4+ T cells than that of IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 9d). IL-17 supplement augmented EGFR phosphorylation of IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells in a dose dependent manner, more augmentation with 1.0 than 0.1 μg/ml of recombinant mouse IL-17 (Fig. 9e). EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib mitigated EGFR phosphorylation of 6.5 CD4+ T cells and IL-17-induced EGFR phosphorylation of IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 9e). Wild-type CD4+ T cells from naïve WT mice served as controls, in which, IL-17 supplement augmented and Gefitinib attenuated EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 9e).Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factors (TRAF) family (TRAF 1 to 7) of seven scaffold proteins are involved in various cellular physiological processes28. TRAFs, as adapter molecules, moderate many signaling pathways. TRAF4 and TRAF6 share the same TRAF binding sites, but they play different roles in the pathogenesis29,30. A real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR study of Day 6 lung cells revealed up-regulation of TRAF4 and TRAF6 in the infected 6.5 mice. The TRAF4 was dominant over TRAF6 in the lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells of infected 6.5 mice (Fig. 9f). In contrast, TRAF6 was dominant over TRAF4 in the lung-infiltrating donor 6.5 CD4+ T cells of infected wild-type (WT mice + 6.5 cells; WT set) or donor IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells of infected IL-17KO mice (IL-17KO mice + IL-17KO 6.5 cells; IL-17KO set; Fig. 9f). Upon similar in vitro stimulation, as described above, flow cytometry revealed more up-regulation of TRAF4 protein in 6.5 than IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 9g). IL-17 supplement augmented TRAF4 up-regulation in IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells in a dose dependent manner, more augmentation with 1.0 than 0.1 μg/ml of recombinant mouse IL-17 (Fig. 9g). EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib mitigated TRAF4 up-regulation in 6.5 CD4+ T cells and IL-17-induced TRAF4 up-regulation in IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 9g). Wild-type CD4+ T cells from naïve WT mice served as controls, in which, IL-17 supplement augmented and Gefitinib attenuated TRAF4 up-regulation (Fig. 9g).Confocal microscopy revealed TRAF4 translocation to EGFR signaling complex in the 6.5 CD4+ T cells, upon stimulation of splenocytes from naïve 6.5 mice with 0.03 MOI influenza virus for 48 h in vitro (Fig. 9h). The co-localization of TRAF4 and EGFR was more significant in the 6.5 CD4+ T cells than that of IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells. IL-17 supplement augmented TRAF4 and EGFR co-localization in the stimulated IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 9h). EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib mitigated TRAF4 and EGFR co-localization in 6.5 CD4+ T cells and IL-17-induced TRAF4 and EGFR co-localization in IL-17KO 6.5 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 9h).Treatment with EGFR inhibitor, Gefitinib, aggravates the disease of severe influenzaGefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor, which interrupts signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in target cells. Gefitinib aggravated the disease of influenza virus infection in mice. The impact of EGFR inhibition with Gefitinib was highest in infected 6.5 mice, moderate in infected wild-type mice, and negligible in infected IL-17KO mice (Fig. 10a). In the infected wild-type mice, intranasal IL-17 supplement bestowed some protection, and the protection was lost with the treatment of Gefitinib (Fig. 10b). The lost benefit was associated with altered up-regulation of TRAF4 and TRAF6 in the lungs. The IL-17 supplement altered the TRAF6 dominance over TRAF4 in the lungs of infected wild type mice, and the alteration was restricted when the IL-17 supplement was given with Gefitinib treatment (Fig. 10b).Fig. 10: Disrupted IL-17-EGFR axis with Gefitinib treatment alters TRAF4 dominance and disease severity in acute influenza.a EGFR inhibition with Gefitinib resulted in more body weight loss and higher mortality of influenza virus infected 6.5 mice. Infected wild-type and IL-17KO mice served as controls. b Gefitinib treatment also diminished the protection conferred by IL-17 supplement, and resulted in more body weight loss and higher mortality of infected wild-type mice. The alterations were associated with altered TRAF4 dominance over TRAF6 mRNA levels. Values are means ± s.d. of at least three experiments.

IL-17 signaling through the non-canonical IL-17 receptor EGFR activates the scaffold protein TRAF4 more than TRAF6 during alleviation of lung inflammation in severe influenza. Adoptively transferred HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells caused collateral damage with their IFN-γ-producing Th1 response to the infection in wild-type mice. The donor mice of the naïve HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells, the 6.5 TCR transgenic mice, have all the CD4+ T cells responsive to the HA antigen of the influenza virus. The overwhelming CD4+ T cell response in the infected 6.5 mice would cause more damage and disease of more severity. There was aggravated illness at first, but the subsequent evolution of a prominent Th17 response mitigated the disease and the 6.5 mice had better survival than wild-type mice. Both Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cells were activated for Th1 commitment with comparable TCR signaling from ZAP-70 phosphorylation to T-bet induction. The Th17 evolution was associated with ROR-γt upregulation and reduced T-bet dominance over ROR-γt. Thymectomy, aged mice experiments, and repetitive adoptive transfer experiments revealed the Th1 CD4+ T cells guided Th17 evolution, associated with viral neuraminidase activated TGF-β on the Th1 cells. IL-17 signaling through the EGFR happened with relative abundance of EGFR to IL-17RA in 6.5 CD4+ TCR-transgenic mice. The signaling activates the scaffold protein TRAF4 more than TRAF6. Gefitinib blockade documented the significance of IL-17 signaling through EGFR in alleviation of lung inflammation in severe influenza.Both IFNγ and IL-17 are fundamental constituents of the cytokine storm in severe influenza with pneumonia31. IFN-γ is a hallmark Th1 cytokine essential for viral clearance32. In our experimental system, lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells produce IFN-γ in response to the infection17,18. The transcription factor T-bet directs commitment to the Th1 lineage and IFN-γ production33,34. Here we found our Th17 evolution was also preceded by Th1 commitment with a comparable strength of TCR signaling from ZAP-70 phosphorylation to T-bet induction. TGF-β is indispensable for Th17 polarization of naïve CD4+ T cells in vitro25. We revealed viral neuraminidase-activated TGF-β of the Th1 CD4+ T cells is essential for the Th1 guided evolution of Th17 cells. The Th1 CD4+ T cells steered activation of Th17-specific transcription factor ROR-γt and production of Th17-specific cytokine IL-17.The Th1 transcription factor T-bet has been shown to suppress Th2 and Th17 differentiation35,36. However, co-production of IFN-γ and IL-17 has been detected in human CD4+ T cells25,37 and co-production IFN-γ and IL-10 has been documented in murine CD4+ T cells18. Relative expression levels of the transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3, and ROR-γt may fine tune a balance among different lineages of the conventional Th1/Th2/Th17 paradigm. A diminished T-bet dominance over GATA-3 and ROR-γt obliterates IFN-γ production of lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells in our experimental system17. Here, in the same experimental system of severe influenza, we demonstrated Th17 differentiation with diminished dominance of T-bet over ROR-γt. This excessive ROR-γt activation drove the Th1 committed CD4+ T cells into the Th17 lineage and abolish the IFN-γ production.The role IL-17 remained uncertain. IL-17 is linked to localized inflammation and pathogenic in certain autoimmune diseases, in which IL-17 binds to its canonical receptor IL-17RA and activates TRAF6 and the subsequent signaling cascade26,28,38. IL-17 is anti-inflammatory in other diseases39,40,41. IL-17 is highly versatile and has been implicated in other non-pathogenic conditions including tissue repair and cancer as well42, in which IL-17 binds to recruited EGFR in the receptor complex and activates TRAF4 and subsequent signaling cascade27,39. TRAF4 activation may restrict IL-17-mediated pathogenic processes30. Our HA-specific Th17 cells were similar to the non-pathogenic Th17 cells25, as they do not produce IFN-γ and do not boost inflammation. There was also signaling through EGFR and subsequent activation of TRAF4. The Th17 response alleviated inflammation in our mouse model of severe influenza.Aged people are at higher risk of severe influenza43. They also suffered from excessive mortality during SARS and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics44,45, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncoveed-extra-precautions/index.html; accessed August 23, 2022. Their comorbidities contribute to this fact but it may also involve the derangement of the immune system. Age related thymic involution and decreased thymic output may be the problem. At 50 years of age, the human thymus generates only 15–20% of the T cells compared to the young. It is almost unable to make new T cells by the age of 65 (Ref: 46). Thymic involution starts from three months of age in mice47. The disease alleviating Th17 cells displayed the surface markers of recent thymic emigrants. Thymectomy abolished the Th17 response and the Th17 waned with age. The aged people may suffer from severe disease because of loss of the disease modifying Th17 cells. Our results raise alarms regarding modulating IL-17 response in severe respiratory tract infections. We have to be cautious to avoid inappropriate cytokine manipulation as IL-17 is not necessarily always proinflammatory.MethodsMice and influenza virus infectionAll experiments involving mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the “Animal Care and Use Committee” of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Approval number: IACUC 2016030301). The committee certified that all experiments involving mice were carried out in strict accordance with the Animal Protection Law by the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, R.O.C., and the guidelines contained in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as promulgated by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, U.S.A.All mice were of C57BL/10.D2 genetic background, and 8–12-week-old mice of both sexes, except in experiments with aged mice, were used for experiments. The TCR-transgenic mouse line 6.5 expresses a TCR recognizing an I-Ed-restricted HA epitope (110SFERFEIFPKE120) of HA of PR8 influenza virus (generously provided by H. Von Boehmer, Harvard University, Boston, MA). The 6.5 mice were crossed with syngeneic IL17KO or IL10KO mice to generate 6.5 IL17KO TCR-transgenic, or 6.5IL10 KO TCR-transgenic mice, respectively. Syngeneic IL17KO mice were generated by breeding IL17KO mice of B6 genetic background (generously provided by Y-C. Day, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan) into mice with a C57BL/10.D2 genetic background for >9 generations. Syngeneic IL10 KO and 6.5 IL10 KO TCR-transgenic mice were described earlier18. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions.The PR8 (A/PR/8/34) strain of influenza virus was produced in the allantoic fluid of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, and characterized by a core facility at Chang Gung University, Taiwan. Mice were inoculated via the intranasal route during light isoflurane (Aesica Queenborough Ltd., Kent, UK) anesthesia with 2.5 × 103 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.s) in 50 μl of PBS17,18,19,20,21,22,34.Infection with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding HA of PR8 strain of H1N1 influenza virusThe HA-inserted vaccinia virus48,49,50 was amplified using BCS-1 cells. An infective dose of 1 × 106 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.s) was injected intraperitoneally in 100 μl of PBS.IL-17 supplement & EGFR blockadeRecombinant mouse IL-17A (carrier free) was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA; Cat# 576006). An appropriate concentration of IL-17A in 20 μl PBS was supplemented daily through intranasal route for 5 days during isoflurane (Aesica Queenborough Ltd., Kent, UK) anesthesia.The EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib was purchased from AstraZeneca. A stock solution in DMSO was first made and aliquots were kept in −80 °C. A fresh final solution was prepared every day in PBS and 100 mg/kg Gefitinib in 100 μl was fed by oral gavage.Adoptive transfer and CFSE stainingClonotypic HA-specific CD4+ TCR transgenic T cells were prepared from pooled spleens and lymph nodes of HA-specific CD4+ TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice17,18,19,20,21,22,34,48,49. Clonotypic IL17 KO or IL10 KO HA-specific CD4+ TCR-transgenic T cells were prepared from pooled spleens and lymph nodes of 6.5 IL17 KO or 6.5 IL10 KO TCR-transgenic mice, respectively. Clonotypic percentages were determined by flow cytometric analysis. Naïve phenotype was confirmed by assessing profiles of the activation markers CD44 (anti-mouse CD44; 553133, BD Biosciences; dilution = 1 in 100) and CD62L (anti-mouse CD62L; 553150, BD Biosciences; dilution = 1 in 100). Infection-responding 6.5 CD4+ T cells were retrieved from the lungs of infected HA-specific CD4+ TCR-transgenic 6.5 mice. CD4+ T cells were enriched by negative selection using magnetic beads, and donor cells were identified using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD90.1 (Thy1.1; anti-mouse CD90.1; 554898, BD Biosciences; dilution = 1 in 1000) or CD90.2 (Thy1.2; anti-mouse CD90.2; 553006; BD Biosciences; dilution = 1 in 200). For single-batch transfer experiments, 2.5 × 106 clonotypic 6.5 CD4+ T cells were injected via tail vein into Thy1.2/Thy1.2+ wild-type recipient mice in 0.2 ml of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). For two-batch transfer experiments, a first batch of 0.5 × 106 clonotypic 6.5 CD4+ T cells was injected at the time of infection, and a second batch of 1.5 × 106 clonotypic 6.5 CD4+ T cells was injected on day 4 of infection in Thy1.2/Thy1.2+ wild-type mice.Clonotypic T cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were stained with 5 μM CFSE (5, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetatesuccinimidyl ester; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) in HBSS for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with HBSS, and CFSE-stained 6.5 CD4+ T cells (2.5 × 106) were transferred via tail vein into recipient mice.Flow cytometryCell suspensions were incubated on ice with saturated concentrations of fluorochrome-labeled mAbs in FACS buffer (PBS plus 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3) as recommended by the manufacturers. Donor CD4+ T cells were identified using the following mAbs: biotin-conjugated anti-clonotypic 6.5 TCR (provided by H. Von Boehmer; dilution = 1 in 100), avidin-PE (A1204, Caltag, Burlingame, CA; dilution = 1 in 200), or Streptavidin-APC (SA 1005, Caltag, Burlingame, CA; dilution = 1 in 200), and PerCP or FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 (553052 or 553047, BD Biosciences; dilutions = 1 in 100 for both). All fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were from BD Biosciences, except for T-bet, and mouse IgG1κ isotype control (45–5825, 45–4714, eBiosciences; dilution = 1 in 50 for both), FITC-Phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) Rabbit anti-Human, Mouse (MA5-27995, Invitrogen; dilution = 1 in 10), and PE-TRAF4 (SC-390232, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; no dilution). Cells were acquired using FACS CALIBUR, and analysis was performed using CellQuest Pro (BD Biosciences), FACSuite (BD Biosciences), or FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.) software.Intracellular cytokine stainingSingle cell suspensions (5–10 × 106 cells well−1 in 24 well plates) from harvested organs were re-stimulated for 5 h with 10 μg ml−1 MHC class II restricted HA peptide (SFERFEIFPKE) in the presence of 5 μg ml−1 Brefeldin A (SI-B7651, Sigma-Aldrich). The Brefeldin-A concentration was maintained throughout intracellular cytokine staining. Re-stimulated cells were surface-stained with anti-CD90.1 and anti-CD4 as described above, fixed in IC fixation buffer (00–8222, eBiosciences), washed, and stained in permeabilization buffer (00–8333, eBiosciences) containing fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against target cytokines. For Foxp3 (11–5773, eBiosciences; dilution = 1 in 50) and T-bet, cells were surface-stained, fixed, and permeabilized in fixation/permeabilization buffer (00-5523, eBiosciences), washed, and stained in permeabilization buffer (00-8333, eBiosciences) containing fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. In some experiments, cells were analyzed ex vivo and stained without re-stimulation.In vitro proliferation of naïve HA-specific CD4+ T cellsSingle cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens of HA-specific TRC transgenic 6.5 mice. Splenocytes (2.5 × 105) were re-stimulated for 72 h with class-II restricted HA peptide (SFERFEIFPKE) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Tritiated thymidine was added 18 h prior to harvest. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into DNA in each well was measured in a scintillation counter, as described earlier17,34. We co-cultured lung-infiltrating HA-specific CD4+ T cells retrieved from infected mice as described in the text, to measure their impact on proliferation.Cytokine production and expression of TRAF4 and p-EGFR following in vitro stimulationFor cytokine production, single-cell suspensions of splenocytes (2.5 × 106 cells per well) from IL-17-competent (IL-17+/+) 6.5 mice were stimulated with influenza virus (PR8 strain; 0.03 (MOI) Multiplicity of Infection) in complete RPMI-1640 for 48 h in vitro, in the presence of lung-infiltrating HA-specific 6.5 CD4+ T cells from day 4 infected mice at 1:5 ratio. Naïve splenocytes without cells from the infected mice served as controls. Recombinant mouse TGF-β (10 ng ml−1, GF346, Millipore) or anti- TGF-β (10 μgml−1, MAB1835, R&D) was added to the culture at the onset. Cognate HA peptide (100 μgml−1) was added to the culture for last 5 h. Brefeldin-A was added for last 3 h of stimulation and cells were then processed for intracellular staining.For TRAF4 staining, single-cell suspensions of splenocytes (2.5 × 106 cells per well) from naive WT, IL-17-competent (IL-17+/+) 6.5, or IL-17 knockout (IL-17−/−) 6.5 mice were stimulated with influenza virus (PR8 strain; 0.03 (MOI) Multiplicity of Infection) in complete RPMI-1640 for 48 h in vitro. Recombinant mouse IL-17 (0.1 or 1.0 μgml−1; 576006, Biolegend) and/or Gefitinib (0.1 or 1.0 μgM; Iressa, AstraZeneca) was added to the culture at the onset. Cognate HA peptide (100 μgml−1) was added to the culture for last 5 h. Brefeldin-A was added for last 3 h of stimulation and cells were then processed similarly, as we did for intracellular staining.For phosphorylated-EGFR staining, single-cell suspensions of splenocytes (2.5 × 106 cells per well) from naive WT, IL-17-competent (IL-17+/+) 6.5, or IL-17 knockout (IL-17−/−) 6.5 mice were stimulated with influenza virus (PR8 strain; 0.03 (MOI) Multiplicity of Infection) in complete RPMI-1640 for 48 h in vitro. Recombinant mouse IL-17 (0.1 or 1.0 μgml−1; 576006, Biolegend) and/or Gefitinib (0.1 or 1.0 μgM; Iressa, AstraZeneca) was added to the culture at the onset. Cognate HA peptide (100 μgml−1) was added to the culture for last 5 h. Brefeldin-A was added for last 3 h of stimulation and cells were then processed for staining. In brief, cells were first placed in cold perm buffer-III (558050, BD Biosciences) for 30 min, washed with stain buffer (554657, BD Biosciences), and stained with FITC-Phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) Rabbit anti-Human, Mouse (MA5-27995, Invitrogen; dilution = 1 in 10) in stain buffer. Cells were acquired with BD LSRFortessa™ Cell Analyzer for flow cytometry or visualized in confocal microscopy (Leica).Plaque assay for virus titerWe measured live influenza virus titers in the organs of infected mice using a modified Madin-Darby canine kidney cell (MDCK; The American Type Culture Collection) plaque assay, as described earlier17,18,19,20,21,22,34. The organs were collected at the indicated times in 1 mL DMEM, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Ten-fold dilutions of tissue homogenates were prepared in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotic-antimycotic (15240-062, GIBCO BRL), and 0.00025% trypsin. A total of 500 μl of each dilution was added to confluent monolayers of MDCK cells in 6 well plates and incubated for 1 h at 35 °C with 5% CO2. Each well then received 2 mL of agar overlay (0.3%) and was incubated for 3 days. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin, agar overlay was removed, and fixed monolayers were stained with crystal violet (0.02% in 2% ethanol). The results were presented as plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml = (mean number of plaques × 2) × (dilution factor−1).HistopathologyThe lungs from experimental mice were harvested on day 7 post-infection, and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. Following fixation, lungs were embedded in paraffin and 5 μm sections were cut. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and scored blindly. Infiltration of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and plasma cells, was separately scored by pathologists as negative, 1+, 2+, or 3+ according to the density of infiltration. Vasculitis and fibrosis were also scored as negative, 1+, 2+, or 3+ based on severity, as described earlier17,18,19,20,21,22,34. Overall inflammation in the lungs was represented by the average of these scores.Statistics and reproducibilityData are expressed as mean ± s.d. We used Graphpad Prism version 8 for Student’s t test analyses to compare two groups at a specific time point. We also analyzed Two-way ANOVA for the body weight curves and Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test for survival curves. We considered p values < 0.05 as significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

It can cause the sudden onset of a fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain. In Australia, the flu is responsible for more than 5,000 hospitalisation and 100 deaths a year. The highest rates are among those over 65, whose immune systems aren’t as effective as they used to be, and children under five, whose immune systems are yet to mature. To combat the decline in immunity as we age, specific vaccines are available for people aged 65 and over. So how do they work, and why exactly are they needed? Read more: Should I get a flu vaccine this year? Here's what you need to know Remind me, how does the immune system work? The immune system uses multiple mechanisms to fight viral infections, which can be divided into two major arms of the immune system, called innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity involves multiple inflammatory cells and chemicals that are triggered immediately, or within hours of encountering an infection. They activate the immune system to clear the infection. Adaptive immunity takes a little longer (weeks) to work and involves memory T cells and antibody-producing B cells, which can be reactivated when the body encounters a virus or other pathogen. The combined innate and adaptive immune response determines how well we respond to an invading virus like influenza. Why are older people more at risk from the flu? Generally, as we age past 65, the innate cells become less effective at their job of clearing infections. They also start producing more inflammation. New T and B cell numbers also decrease with increasing age and hence the adaptive immune response is also not as effective as when we are younger. This immune system decline is called immunosenescence, which leads to increased susceptibility, hospitalisation and death from influenza. As we age, our immune system can’t clear infections as effectively. Mariia Chalaya/Unsplash Certain medical conditions, such as cancer and heart and lung conditions, increase susceptibility to severe influenza, with older people being more likely to have additional medical conditions than younger people. What flu vaccines are available? Annual flu vaccines are recommended to protect against the common circulating strains of influenza, which can differ from year to year. The standard flu vaccines offered to adults aged under 65 consist of surface proteins of the virus or inactivated (killed) virus from four influenza strains: two A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and two B strains. When you’re vaccinated, your immune system makes antibodies from B cells which protect you if you become exposed to these strains of the virus. However, the standard influenza vaccine is less effective in older people. The standard flu vaccines aren’t as effective for older people. Katarzyna Grabowska Two stronger or augmented vaccines have been made targeting this age group. They contain the same components as the standard vaccine, but one vaccine – called Fluad – uses a strong adjuvant (an agent used to increase the immune response to vaccination) called MF59 to stimulate better immunity. The other augmented vaccine, called Fluzone, uses a four-fold higher dose of each influenza strain to increase immunity. Read more: Why can you still get influenza if you've had a flu shot? How do they compare? Studies comparing Fluad and Fluzone show both vaccines stimulate stronger immunity against influenza than the standard flu vaccine and are therefore likely to provide better protection. Studies directly testing for improved clinical outcomes with vaccines for over-65s show a small benefit of receiving either of the vaccines over the standard vaccine, including a modest decrease in lab-confirmed influenza, hospitalisations and emergency department visits compared to the standard influenza vaccine. They are however yet to show and impact on flu-related deaths. Fluad and Fluzone provide better protection for older people against the flu than the regular vaccine. Raychan/Unsplash In the few studies comparing Fluad and Fluzone directly, there is little evidence of a difference between them in reducing influenza and serious flu outcomes. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation therefore recommends using either Fluad or Fluzone. While both have been Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved since 2020, only Fluad is available for free on the National Immunisation Program for people aged 65 and over. Fluzone is only available with a private prescription if you’re 60 years and over, at a cost of around A$65-70. If neither augmented vaccine is available, a standard influenza vaccine is also acceptable for older people, since any influenza vaccine is preferable to receiving none. Flu vaccines can also be given at the same time as COVID vaccines. How else can we protect against the flu? While influenza vaccination is the single most effective way of preventing influenza, other measures such as social distancing and wearing a mask or N95 respirator can also provide some community protection. Wearing a mask or N95 respirator significantly reduces the risk of infecting others when infected. The evidence for protecting oneself against infection is less conclusive, mainly because it’s linked to early, consistent and, importantly, the correct use of masks.

But just as it was winding down, a little-known virus that causes many of the same symptoms – a lower lung infection, hacking cough, runny nose, sore throat and fever – was just picking up steam. Cases of human metapneumovirus, or HMPV, spiked this spring, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s respiratory virus surveillance systems. It filled hospital intensive care units with young children and seniors who are the most vulnerable to these infections. At its peak in mid-March, nearly 11% of tested specimens were positive for HMPV, a number that’s about 36% higher than the average, pre-pandemic seasonal peak of 7% test positivity. Most people who caught it probably didn’t even know they had it, however. Sick people aren’t usually tested for it outside of a hospital or ER. Unlike Covid-19 and the flu, there’s no vaccine for HMPV or antiviral drugs to treat it. Instead, doctors care for seriously ill people by tending to their symptoms. An underestimated threat Studies show that HMPV causes as much misery in the US each year as the flu and a closely related virus, RSV. One study of patient samples collected over 25 years found that it was the second most common cause of respiratory infections in kids behind RSV. A study in New York conducted over four winters found that it was as common in hospitalized seniors as RSV and the flu. Like those infections, HMPV can lead to intensive care and fatal cases of pneumonia in older adults. Diane Davison caught human metapneumovirus during a family celebration in early April. Two weeks later, she was coughing so violently, she couldn’t talk on the phone. Last year, the number of brain abscesses in children in and around Las Vegas, Nevada, rose from the expected four or five to 17. BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Doctors watching for more cases after mysterious cluster of brain infections strikes kids in southern Nevada “I couldn’t get out more than a couple of words,” said Davison, 59, an entertainment lawyer in Baltimore. “I would go into violent, violent coughing to the point where I was literally almost throwing up.” Her cough was so constant and deep, she was convinced she had finally caught the coronavirus after managing to avoid it throughout the pandemic. But she took six rapid tests for Covid-19, and all came back negative. Davison is immunocompromised, so she has been cautious throughout the pandemic. Concerned about pneumonia, she got a X-ray from a radiology clinic near her home and was told it was clear. Her doctor wasn’t satisfied, however, and sent her to an emergency room for more testing. Blood tests determined that she had HMPV. “I was like, ‘what?’ Because it sounds really dire,” Davison said. “I’ve never heard of it.” Human metapneumovirus was discovered by Dutch virus hunters in 2001. They had 28 samples from children in the Netherlands with unexplained respiratory infections. Some of the children had been very ill and required mechanical ventilation, but they didn’t test positive for any known pathogens. The researchers cultured the samples in various types of cells from monkeys, chickens and dogs, and then they looked at the cultures under an electron microscope. They saw something that seemed structurally related to the paramyxoviridae family, a group of viruses known to give people respiratory disease like measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. A closer look at the virus’ genes showed a close relative: avian metapneumovirus, which infects birds. The new virus was dubbed human metapneumovirus. Scientists believe it probably jumped from birds to humans at some point and evolved from there. When the researchers tested blood samples from 72 patients that had been stored since 1958, all showed evidence of exposure to the mystery virus, indicating that it had been circulating in humans, undetected, for at least the previous half-century. Doctors and patients in the dark Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death for children around the world and the No. 1 reason kids are hospitalized in the United States, but scientists don’t know what causes a good chunk of them, says Dr. John Williams, a pediatrician at the University of Pittsburgh who has spent his career researching vaccines and treatments for HMPV. Williams says there were sweeping epidemiological studies conducted in the 1950s and ’60s, looking into the causes of respiratory infections. “Basically, they could only identify a virus in people about half the time. And so the question was, ‘OK, what about that other half?’ ” he said. Human metapneumovirus doesn’t account for all the unknown viruses, but it’s a significant proportion – about as many cases as RSV or influenza. But no one knows about it. Williams calls it “the most important virus you’ve never heard of.” “Those are the three major viruses,” he said. “Those are the big three in kids and adults, the most likely to put people in the hospital and cause severe disease, most likely to sweep through nursing homes and make older people really sick and even kill them.” Because testing for HMPV is rarely done outside hospitals, it’s hard to know the true burden of the disease. Blood tests indicate that most children have had it by the age of 5. A 2020 study in the Lancet Global Health estimated that among children younger than 5, there were more than 14 million HMPV infections in 2018, more than 600,000 hospitalizations and more than 16,000 deaths.

The infection generates weak or incomplete immune protection, however, and humans get reinfected throughout their lives. Companies are working on vaccines against it. Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna just finished an early study of an mRNA vaccine against HMPV and parainfluenza, according to the website clinicaltrials.gov. The CDC recommends that doctors consider testing for HMPV in the winter and spring, when it tends to peak. Doctors don’t test for it mostly because of a lack of awareness of the virus, Williams said, but also because a test probably wouldn’t change the care they would give a patient. It would help them rule out other causes that do have dedicated treatments, like Covid or the flu. Davison said HMPV gave her a serious bout of bronchitis. She was admitted to the hospital briefly for observation. She eventually got better, but she was sick for a month. She’s had respiratory infections before, of course, but she’s particularly glad to be on the other side of human metapneumovirus, she said – “This was really kind of the worst I’d ever experienced.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Learn about BHG's Fact Checking Process Cold and flu season is upon us, and it's almost inevitable that someone in your family will get sick. But even after they've bounced back to health, your work isn't finished. Proper cleaning is essential to prevent the spread of germs to other members of the household. We asked experts from top cleaning-product companies to weigh in on which surfaces and household items are most important to disinfect after an illness—and how exactly to go about cleaning them. Naked King/Getty Images Which rooms should I disinfect first? A whole-house cleaning spree may not be necessary, according to Mary Gagliardi, also known as Dr. Laundry, a cleaning expert at The Clorox Company. "Most people who have the flu tend to lay low, so you can skip cleaning your home from top to bottom," she says. "Instead, focus on the bathroom and the kitchen, and any shared surfaces in the bedroom." Clean each space where the sick person has spent time and try to retrace his or her steps as you clean. If they ventured into the kitchen for some soup, for example, remember to disinfect the countertops, refrigerator handles, faucet, cabinet hardware, and any other areas they may have touched. Which surfaces are most important to disinfect? Commonly touched hard surfaces, such as TV remotes and door handles, can become breeding grounds for germs. While these areas should be regularly cleaned year-round, it's especially important when someone in your household falls ill. In fact, the flu virus can live on these surfaces for up to 48 hours, says Joe Rubino, a microbiologist and the research and development director at Lysol. "Disinfecting frequently-touched, non-porous surfaces and items around the home like tabletops, remote controls, light switches, and doorknobs should become part of a daily routine during cold and flu season to help prevent the spread of illness," he says. Is there anything else that needs to be cleaned after an illness? Sick people tend to spend a lot of time in bed, so it's essential to disinfect sheets, pillowcases, and other bedding after an illness. Cell phones and tablets can also harbor bacteria, so don't forget to clean any electronic devices the person handled while sick. And, according to the CDC, washing your hands frequently with soap and warm water—or using an alcohol-based hand rub, if that's not an option—is another effective way to stop the spread of germs. When should I start cleaning after being sick? For hard surfaces that other family members frequently touch, don't delay cleanup. "Start disinfecting those high-touch surfaces as soon as you know a family member or roommate has the flu—don't wait for a regular cleaning day!" Gagliardi says. However, she suggests waiting until flu symptoms subside to wash sheets and blankets. What cleaning products should I use to disinfect? Choosing the right product for each cleaning job is key to effectively eliminating lingering germs. "Preventing the spread of the flu is serious business, and you absolutely need EPA-registered disinfectants that target flu germs," Gagliardi says. To sterilize the bathroom, bleach does the trick. Gagliardi suggests using a half-cup of bleach mixed with one gallon of water to wipe down all toilet surfaces (including the handles), as well as other bleach-safe spots like sinks, counters, and faucets. To disinfect clothing and bedding after a family member has been sick, Rubino suggests washing them with laundry sanitizer, which kills bacteria that regular detergents could leave behind. Gagliardi also suggests disinfecting wipes for a multitude of bacteria-harboring areas, including light switches, doorknobs, refrigerator handles, and more. "These are great for disinfecting surfaces that aren't safe for bleach or are just more difficult to clean," she says. "Make sure surfaces stay wet after wiping for 15 seconds to kill influenza germs; that's all it takes!" The One Disinfecting Step You're Probably Doing Wrong Dealing with an illness under your roof is never fun, but these cleaning steps will help stop the flu from spreading any further. With proper disinfecting, you can get your household back to full health. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

BETHLEHEM, Pa. — A red fox earlier this month became the first mammal in the Lehigh Valley infected with avian flu.A red fox collected from Northampton County tested positive for bird fluIt's the first bird flu case in a mammal in the Lehigh ValleyBird flu, highly contagious and often fatal in birds, can also be dangerous, deadly for mammalsThe red fox was collected April 28 in Northampton County, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website. The strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was found to be H5N1, and it was detected May 16."The finding of HPAI in mammals is not unexpected given that many species are susceptible to influenza viruses and wildlife often come into direct contact with wild birds," said USDA spokesperson Mike Stepien. "Many of these species were likely infected after consuming dead birds that were infected with HPAI. Most mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, meaning they do not spread HPAI to other susceptible species."Although most mammals do not appear to spread HPAI, the USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service does not recommend touching or collecting sick or dead animals, Stephien said. If contact does occur, immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after:Having direct contact with animals, their food, or supplies, waste/feces. Cleaning up after animals, including any body fluids or waste. Leaving areas where animals are housed (even if you did not touch an animal). HPAI, commonly referred to as bird flu, is caused by an influenza type A virus, is highly contagious and often fatal in birds. While some wild bird species can carry the virus without becoming sick, HPAI has been affecting both wild waterfowl as well as domestic poultry species since 2022. USDA / CourtesyHighly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, commonly referred to as bird flu, is caused by an influenza type A virus, is highly contagious and often fatal in birds. the USDA has been tracking cases in mammals. So far, only three other commonwealth mammals have tested positive for bird flu — all red foxes collected in early April from Huntingdon County, according to the USDA’s website. HPAI infection in mammals can cause illness, including severe disease, and, in some cases, death. HPAI infection in mammals can cause illness, including severe disease, and, in some cases, death. U.S. Department of Agriculture While bird flu viruses do not normally infect people, these have been cases reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Illnesses in humans from bird flu virus infections have ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe disease (e.g., pneumonia) that resulted in death," according to the CDC's website. "Human infections with bird flu viruses have most often occurred after close or lengthy unprotected contact (i.e., not wearing gloves or respiratory protection or eye protection) with infected birds or places that sick birds or their saliva, mucous and feces have touched."While bird flu is a nationwide issue, Pennsylvania’s first case in domestic poultry was recorded April 15, 2022. It was found in a flock of commercial layer chickens on a Lancaster County poultry farm.So far, more than 100 wild birds in Pennsylvania have tested positive, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. More than 3 million birds in the commonwealth’s commercial and barnyard flocks also have been affected.

With the changing season, we are sure all of you must have caught flu at least once till now. Though the season is now settling down but still the flu cases aren't easy to beat down. Be it in public transport or at the office, you can catch it anywhere. But have you ever thought what if you or your partner get down with cold and still wish to have some action? Sounds normal? But maybe it is not. Read on to know if it is safe to have sex while you are down with flu.2/10​Can the infection be passed on?CAN THE INFECTION BE PASSED ON? To know if the infection can be passed on or not, first we need to know what are the ways that virus can be transmitted. The flu virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets. These droplets can spread through breathing, coughing, sneezing, kissing and even by shaking hands.3/10​How long do they live?HOW LONG DO THEY LIVE? The droplets that carry the virus can live up to 24 hours on counter-tops, 15-30 minutes on hands and 1-2 hours on bedsheets, explains Dr Brahmbhatt, MD, urologist and Sexual Health expert in Florida.4/10​Is sex a thumbs up or thumbs down?IS SEX A THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN? The general rule, according to MD of ob-gyn at Boston University, is to stay six feet away from anyone who has flu. Needless to mention, being intimate requires you be a lot more closer than 6 feet for sure. So, sex is absolutely not a good idea if one of you has flu.5/10​What are the chances of catching the infection?WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF YOU CATCHING THE INFECTION? The chances of you not catching the infection from your coughing and sneezing partner while having sex is highly low, which means that of getting one are fairly high. So, do not do it if you don’t want to catch the flu too.6/10​What if you have had a flu shot?WHAT IF YOU HAVE HAD A FLU SHOT? Being intimate while your partner who has cold and flu is not advised even if you have had a flu shot. If you know, flu shot vaccine only lowers the risk of getting the infection and does not completely eliminate it.7/10​ComplicationsCOMPLICATIONS: What is more problematic is that a flu victim can be contagious a week before even they show any symptoms. So, it’s pretty possible that you may catch the infection from a partner who appears to be perfectly healthy. Also, a person can be contagious a week after they have recovered from flu. You cannot do anything about the first problem but you can at least refrain from having sex a week after your partner has recovered from flu.8/10​Can not kissing help?CAN NOT KISSING HELP? If you think you can get intimate and may not kiss your partner during flu and this can help, you are wrong. Don’t count on it. There is no way people can get intimate as the risk of transmission from the face is still there.9/10​Use a face maskUSE A FACE MASK: Using a face mask while you travel, in your office and maybe at home as well (if your partner has flu) can help you in not visiting the doctor’s cabin.10/10​The safest way to have sex while you have fluTHE SAFEST WAY TO HAVE SEX WHILE YOU HAVE FLU: Oral sex is one the of safest ways to get intimate while you are down with flu. Mouth to genital contact has lesser chances of transmitting the germs as there is no mouth to mouth contact. And you cannot catch flu via your sex organs (thank goodness). But taking another person’s genitals in the mouth is not what many of us want, specially if they are the ones with flu as their nose is already more than stuffed and they can barely breathe. So, prefer patience and know that the world will not end in a week.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous8 golden rules of a happy marriageindiaStunning pictures of Sai PallaviindiaAvneet Kaur’s perfect statement winter looksindia​10 unique things only Penguins can doindia8 signs your children are driving you into social isolationindiaMalavika Mohanan captures hearts with her breathtaking photos​indiaAnanya Panday's stylish striped saree look is a perfect addition to your ethnic wardrobeindiaKeerthy Suresh shines with her radiant and irresistible charmindiaShruti Haasan channels vintage elegance in a classic satin black sareeindia Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Alice accuses Vivian for suggesting to use 'Women’s Card'BB18: Chum asks Karan about his struggles in the gameExcl- Nyrraa on BB18: Why Eisha, Alice weren't confronted?BB18: Vivian and Kashish clash over coffeeBB18: Rajat's controversial fights in the showBB18: Nouran slams trolls over rumours of Vivian consuming 'gutka'BB18's Hema had to sell her earrings to cover expensesBB18: Vivian orders Rajat to keep an eye on housematesArfeen refuses to shake hands with Avinash as he leaves BB18123 Photostories 5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf waterExclusive- Nyrraa M Banerjii reacts to Weekend Ka Vaar episode: Why Eisha Singh and Alice Kaushik weren't confronted for the kind of things they spoke​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​How tall are Trump family members​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from school​10 Countries with lowest IQ in the worldFrom Shoaib Ibrahim calling Bigg Boss no more a personality show to Divyanka Tripathi admitting it is not her cup of tea: Celebs who have refused to do the show'Bigg Boss18': From his intense brawl with Avinash Mishra to arguments with Vivian Dsena; Rajat Dalal's controversial fights in the show8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich123lifestyle videos03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

By Eva Botkin-Kowacki Posted on May 30, 2023 4:00 PM EDT HIV particles, in red and yellow, are budding from an infected cell in a electron micrograph. NIAID/NIH Share Over the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the coronavirus directly or indirectly killed about 15 million people worldwide, according to estimates from the World Health Organization. In the United States, more people died in 2020 and 2021 than during the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was widely called the most deadly in recorded history. The word “deadly” certainly applies to the virus that causes COVID-19. And yet, epidemiologists hesitate to give SARS-CoV-2 the superlative of deadliest virus in human history. To them, the raw number of mortalities caused by a given virus doesn’t always paint the full picture of a pathogen’s danger—especially when comparing viral outbreaks across time. Raw mortality numbers have to be taken in the context of the world’s total population, says Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people talk about how COVID deaths eclipsed what we saw in 1918,” she says. “It’s really important to remember that the population of 1918 was a fraction of what it is today.” In that context, the flu of 1918 rises back up in the ranks in terms of deadliness. Defining the deadliest virus Instead of just looking at tallied mortalities, epidemiologists use a metric called the “case fatality rate” or “case fatality ratio” as a measure of how likely a virus is to be lethal. Essentially, it’s the proportion of infected people who end up dying, and therefore represents the likelihood that an infection will end in death. Using the “case fatality rate” metric to determine what virus is the deadliest, rabies would likely come out on top. That’s because, if an infection becomes symptomatic, rabies is fatal to humans in more than 99 percent of cases. Globally, approximately 59,000 people die from rabies every year. Very few of those deaths—an average of two in the US—occur in the developed world because of rabies vaccines for household pets and swift medical interventions after bites. But “a virus doesn’t have to have a very high case fatality ratio to cause a tremendous amount of death and disruption,” Nuzzo says. “It’s more about looking at the environments in which the viruses are spreading, and our social and human vulnerabilities to it.” A virus with a lower case fatality rate can kill more people if it’s highly transmissible, with a long period of time before severe or obvious symptoms set in. This allows an infected person to expose many others. That’s why SARS-CoV-2 caused such a rapid and devastating outbreak around the globe. It’s easily transmitted via airborne droplets, and doesn’t always or immediately cause severe illness. [Related: Can viruses be good for us?] Globalization sped it along, too. “When a virus spreads at the pace of a human being walking, that’s very different than when you can hop on an airplane and be anywhere in the world in 36 hours,” Nuzzo says. During large outbreaks such as epidemics or pandemics, epidemiologists look at another metric, called excess deaths: how many more people died during a period of time than typically do over that same window. Excess deaths can account for other indirect ways that a virus causes death, Nuzzo says, such as patients who need critical care but can’t get it in overburdened hospitals. Here’s how some of the most devastating viruses in human history tell different stories of how high a death toll can rise: Influenza The 1918 influenza pandemic still far and away ranks as the deadliest global outbreak of the 20th century. Thought to be caused by an H1N1 virus, it spread globally in 1918 and 1919. An estimated 500 million people were infected (approximately a third of the global population) and 50 million people died worldwide, about 675,000 of whom were in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Without sophisticated testing and tracking, death toll estimates rely heavily on excess death calculations. Some suggest the true toll was closer to 17 million, while others set it much higher at 100 million. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, cautions against over-interpreting comparisons between the historic flu data and modern viral outbreaks. [Related: Can you get diseases from bad bathroom smells?] “We are determining cases and even counting deaths with much more precision now than we did then,” he says. At the time, there were also no flu vaccines and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, which likely drove the excess death toll higher. St. Louis Red Cross Motor Corps on duty in October 1918 during the influenza epidemic. Library of Congress Today, the youngest and oldest people are most likely to die from influenza. But during the pandemic over 100 years ago, Schaffner says, deaths bore a different signature: mortality peaked among young and middle-aged adults, too. Why that happened is still unclear, he says, but it contributed to the historic toll of that pandemic. Influenza continues to hold its place as one of the deadliest viruses, despite the availability of vaccines. Variants of the influenza virus have led to other pandemic-level events, such as the 2009 outbreak colloquially called the swine flu pandemic. But the virus is also endemic in our society, and infects an estimated 1 billion people globally every year, according to the World Health Organization. Of those cases, the WHO reported in 2019, somewhere between 290,000 to 650,000 result directly or indirectly in deaths. HIV/AIDS The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been an ongoing epidemic since the 1980s. The virus, which attacks the body’s immune system, can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), leaving a person susceptible to other infections as well. An estimated 40.1 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS. That is nearly half of the number of people estimated to have become infected with HIV since the start of the epidemic, at an estimated 84.2 million. The case fatality rate of HIV/AIDS was historically quite high. Some estimates put it around 80 percent without treatment. But much has changed since the 1980s. Today, there are ways to manage HIV and mitigate the immunodeficiencies associated with an infection, and most patients are diagnosed sooner after an infection. In the United States, the rate of HIV-related deaths fell by nearly half from 2010 to 2017, according to the CDC. SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Death toll estimates for the COVID-19 pandemic are still difficult to come by. The WHO keeps an official tally of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19, which puts the death toll at just shy of 7 million globally. However, the actual toll is certainly much higher, especially given inconsistent reporting around the world. In fact, the WHO also estimated that over the course of 2020 and 2021 the virus caused 15 million deaths worldwide directly or indirectly. That excess deaths metric likely reached a much higher number by the time officials declared the public health emergency over in early May. The Omicron wave that swept around the globe in late 2021 and early 2022 saw one of the largest surges in cases of COVID-19 and, although the variant didn’t seem to be more deadly than previous variants, with millions of people infected, a high death toll in the hundreds of thousands was inevitable. Early in the pandemic, the case fatality rates calculated for SARS-Cov-2 varied considerably. Many estimates were likely higher than the true number, as researchers scrambled to devise tests for the virus and milder cases slipped through the cracks. In early 2020, estimates of the case fatality rate by country ranged as high as 25 percent or more. Since then, case fatality rates have dropped, and now, according to Johns Hopkins University, they are as high as 4.9 percent. In the US, the case fatality rate is 1.1 percent. Smallpox “In its day, smallpox was thought to be one of the great pestilences of humankind,” Schaffner says. Smallpox likely wreaked havoc for millennia. Fourth-century writings describe a disease similar to smallpox, and some Egyptian mummies appear to have smallpox-like rashes. Mortalities continued to stack up into the 20th century, with an average of three out of every 10 people infected dying. The disease, which is caused by variola virus, is estimated to have killed more than 300 million people from 1900, until a global vaccination campaign halted its path of devastation in 1977. It was the first disease ever to be eradicated. [Related: The first honeybee vaccine could protect the entire hive, starting with the queen] But it was the very thing that made it particularly fearsome that was its downfall, Schaffner says. “It created such a distinctive rash that people could identify it and fear it. And that was one of its Achilles heels,” he says. Because it was so easily identifiable, and spread so slowly, vaccinating the local population near an outbreak swiftly curtailed transmission. Such an approach, he says, was part of the vaccination strategy that eradicated the great pestilence. Other killer viruses Another virus that is often cited as particularly deadly is Ebola. Approximately 34,600 people were infected with Ebola from 1976 to 2020, according to one count, and about 15,200 died. That virus carries an average case fatality rate of around 50 percent. But the chance of survival rises steeply if you have access to medical treatment, Nuzzo says. And because Ebola is typically spread through direct contact, not airborne transmission like SARS-CoV-2, overall case rates are lower. Marburg virus is similar to Ebola and also carries a high case fatality rate, which ranges from 24 to 90 percent. However, recorded cases number only in the 100s, so the raw number of deaths is quite low.

(ANTARA/HO-Sutterstockst) Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Indonesian Ministry of Health has warned that various airborne diseases have the potential to become Disease X, which could trigger future pandemics. "Global diseases are usually transmitted through the air, and it is difficult to prevent them compared to transmission through blood or water. It is impossible for people to stop breathing," stated Siti Nadia Tarmizi, the head of the ministry's communication and public services bureau, in Jakarta on Wednesday. Tarmizi mentioned that one of the diseases that can be transmitted through the air is influenza, similar to COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic. "That's why influenza always has the potential to become a pandemic. We do not have a cure for all types of influenza yet. The most possible way to deal with it is through vaccination," Tarmizi explained. In addition to influenza, she also mentioned several other potential candidates for Disease X, categorized as zoonoses, which are diseases transmitted from animals to humans, such as Ebola, acute hepatitis, and monkeypox. "Like Ebola, it has been speculated to become a global outbreak for several years, but it hasn't reached that stage yet," she remarked. Tarmizi explained that Disease X is a term adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 to represent hypothetical diseases that are not yet known but have the potential to cause future pandemics. During the 76th World Health Assembly meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 22, the WHO drew attention to the possibility of the emergence of Disease X . Tarmizi stated that Disease X is caused by unknown pathogens in humans, such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi, with no known treatment. The term Disease X has been used by the WHO since 2018 for unknown diseases. One year later, COVID-19 emerged as a new pandemic. "The current readiness is for anticipating and preparing the whole country. The problem is, we still do not know the drug to cure it or the trigger that starts it all," she concluded.

By Noor AdatiaTrending ReporterJun. 2, 2023|Updated 6:38 a.m. CDT|3 min. readHMPV, or human metapneumovirus, cases peaked this spring, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(iStock / Getty Images/iStockphoto)It felt like almost everyone was battling a cold this winter. Amid a season of coughing, sneezing and runny noses, a string of respiratory viruses were at the forefront of people’s attention, as cases of influenza, COVID-19 and RSV surged across North Texas.These viruses spiked much earlier than usual, causing a massive wave of hospitalizations, especially in children. But another little-known virus — perhaps more quietly — spiked this spring just as others winded down, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.AdvertisementRelated:North Texas COVID-19 and flu hospitalizations on the riseAdvertisementAcross the country, young children and older adults, who are most vulnerable to HMPV, or human metapneumovirus, filled up hospital beds during the virus’s peak in mid-March — when almost 11% of tested specimens came back positive for HMPV. This was up from a pre-pandemic seasonal peak of 7% test positivity, according to the CDC.Breaking NewsGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyWhile it’s hard to say exactly why the virus saw an uptick this year, it may be in part because of better testing capabilities and diagnostics to measure the virus, said Dr. Trish Perl, infectious disease expert at UT Southwestern. In her own practice, she witnessed some adult patients undergoing HMPV.“This was also a time when we were still doing a little bit more aggressive surveillance for respiratory illnesses, and so we may have been picking up stuff that we didn’t really see in the past because we weren’t looking for it,” Perl said.AdvertisementAdditionally, ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the environment caused illness to behave differently, Perl said. Over the past few years, the seasonality and duration of traditional pathogens has altered.“Since COVID, the traditional respiratory virus seasons have been all messed up,” she said. “Two summers ago, we saw a spike in RSV, which we don’t see in the summer.”What is HMPV?In short, HMPV is a respiratory virus that resembles a cold. But it’s not entirely new or rare — it was discovered in 2001 and belongs to the same family of viruses that cause RSV, measles and mumps.AdvertisementHowever, information about how it affects adults is somewhat limited due to a lack of sufficient surveillance systems, Perl said.Advertisement“It turns out that the places where it’s well-tracked are generally in children’s hospitals, and sometimes in oncology units,” she said. “So there’s not enough general information about the virus in adults.”More recent surveillance data from the CDC shows that the virus is most active from the late winter to early spring, but it’s not as seasonal as some other respiratory diseases, Perl noted.Similar to COVID-19, the pathogen can be spread through respiratory droplets such as coughing or sneezing, close personal contact or touching objects that contain the virus and then rubbing your nose, eyes or mouth.AdvertisementSymptoms resemble those of a common cold, and in healthy individuals, the virus resolves in around two to four days, Perl said. There is no treatment or vaccination available for HMPV.“For the average person, it’s really like a cold,” she said.But in more severe cases, the virus can develop into pneumonia. Fatal cases are extremely rare or unusual, often occurring as a result of secondary infections.“All of these respiratory viruses can have complications and in certain patients can have pretty severe manifestations,” Perl added. Immunocompromised patients, premature children and transplant patients are all vulnerable to developing severe disease from HMPV.AdvertisementCould the virus spike again?There is a chance the virus could spike again, given the unpredictable nature of illnesses over the past few years, Perl said.“A lot will depend on what epidemiology the CDC is able to report on,” she said, adding more information can help better guide people on what steps they need to take.In a post-COVID world, Perl said that as respiratory viruses gain traction, it’s important to continue monitoring them to protect vulnerable groups from developing severe complications.Advertisement“This is really nascent in our understanding of this particular virus,” she said. “And we’re going to see a lot more come out, given that this health warning was released.”By Noor AdatiaNoor Adatia is a trending news reporter on the breaking team.

A world-first study reportedly shows certain Australian garlic varieties can kill COVID-19 and the common flu with “99.9 percent efficacy.” The new research was released on Wednesday by The Peter Doherty Institute, reported The Australian Financial Review. 2/6​Antiviral properties in garlic​Scientists at Doherty have been researching garlic properties over the past 18 months. They found that a certain Australian grown garlic variety has antiviral properties with up to 99.9 per cent efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza type A viruses.3/6​About the research​The research involved in-vitro testing against the SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza type A viruses using garlic ingredients extracted from exclusive Australian grown garlic varieties.4/6​What researchers say​“We wanted to know if these strains had the possibility of killing COVID-19,” Dr. Julie McAuley, manager of the Doherty’s high containment facility COVID-19 research lab, told The Australian Financial Review. “I thought it might fail miserably. We blindly tested over 20 varieties. We found one of AGP’s products could reduce the infectious titre of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza by 3-log-fold (99.9 per cent). We barely detected any remaining virus genome, indicating nearly complete virucidal activity.”Dr McAuley said the variety was tested across different sites to ensure the results were not related to the environment, nutrients, water or any other factors.5/6​Yet to test impact on humans​Stringent clinical trials are required to determine if the findings of this research translates from test tubes to humans, said the Doherty Institute.Epidemiologist at the University of Wollongong Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz added, “We won’t know if this product helps with COVID-19 or influenza until we run clinical trials in real people, rather than petri dishes in a lab.”Read more: Coronavirus and Bell’s palsy: COVID vaccine could be linked to paralysis on one side of the face6/6​Garlic pills for your immunity​The most efficacious garlic varieties and their extracted proprietary garlic ingredients are being commercialized, as per reports.
