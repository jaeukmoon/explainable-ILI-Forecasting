Vaccination is the main countermeasure against influenza virus spread, however, the effectiveness of vaccines is variable. Current seasonal influenza virus vaccines mostly rely on the immunodominant hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein on the viral surface, which usually leads to a narrow and strain-specific immune response. The HA undergoes constant antigenic drift, which can lead to a dramatic loss in vaccine effectiveness, requiring the annual reformulation and readministration of influenza virus vaccines. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the subdominant glycoprotein, neuraminidase (NA), is an attractive target for vaccine development. Here, we tested a newly developed recombinant influenza virus N1 neuraminidase vaccine candidate, named N1-MPP, adjuvanted with CpG 1018, a TLR9 agonist. Additionally, N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP vaccine constructs have been generated to cover the range of influenza viruses that are seasonally circulating in humans. These constructs have been characterized in vitro and in vivo regarding their functionality and protective potential. Furthermore, a trivalent NA-MPP mix was tested. No antigenic competition between the individual NA constructs was detected. By adjuvating the recombinant protein constructs with CpG 1018 it was possible to induce a strong and robust immune response against the NA, which provided full protection against morbidity and mortality after high lethal challenges in vivo. This study provides important insights for the development of a broadly protective NA-based influenza virus vaccine candidate.

According to the World Health Organization, seasonal influenza viruses cause up to five million cases of severe influenza virus infection, including up to 650,000 deaths each year globally. The influenza virus contains two glycoproteins on its viral surface, which include the immunodominant hemagglutinin (HA) and the immunosubdominant neuraminidase (NA). Current available seasonal influenza virus vaccines mostly target the HA as the NA content in the vaccines is not standardized and can vary significantly. While the HA of the influenza virus is known to induce a strong neutralizing antibody response in humans, it is more susceptible to antigenic drift. This can lead to a mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains, resulting in a significant loss of effectiveness of the annual vaccines.Over the past few years, the NA has emerged as an attractive target for vaccine development since it is less prone to undergo antigenic drift and therefore is antigenically more stable. In addition, it has been demonstrated in animal models as well as in humans that anti-NA immunity correlates with protection and reduces viral shedding1,2,3,4,5. The main obstacles to using NA as a vaccine antigen are its lack of standardization in seasonal vaccine preparations as well as its fragile stability. Indeed, the amount of NA in seasonal vaccines usually varies in quality and quantity6 and it is likely that the structural integrity in current vaccine formulations is suboptimal. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that antigenic competition occurs between HA and NA in vaccine formulations, making the NA immunosubdominant7. The anti-NA immunity acquired after vaccination with live attenuated or inactivated vaccines is mediocre at best8. Stable, recombinant NA protein has been shown to be immunogenic and protective in animal models5,6,9 and may enhance NA-based immunity in humans by standalone administration or as an admixture to seasonal influenza virus vaccines. Recently, we have developed a recombinant NA vaccine candidate, named N1-MPP10. This vaccine candidate utilized the tetramerization domain of the phosphoprotein of the measles virus to multimerize and stabilize the NA protein. N1-MPP can form fully enzymatically active NA tetramers which are highly protective in vivo in a mouse model and induce high titers of neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies after vaccination. The tetramerization of the protein is a crucial factor in generating an NA-based vaccine since it has been previously shown that only multimeric but not monomeric protein confers protection in vivo11,12.In general, the efficiency of a vaccine depends on the magnitude, duration, and quality of the immune response that is induced. However, recombinant protein vaccines usually tend to induce a lower immune response compared to whole virus vaccines due to the lack of molecules that engage innate immune receptors. Here, we tested N1-MPP—as well as novel N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP constructs in a trivalent formulation—adjuvanted with the GMP-produced TLR9 agonist CpG 1018 (ODN1018) in the mouse model. CpG 1018 is currently used in the licensed hepatitis B virus vaccine HEPLISAV-B®13,14. The work described here was performed in preparation for the clinical testing of N1-MPP with CpG 1018.ResultsA prime-boost regimen with N1-MPP is required to achieve full protection in a naive mouse modelTo assess the adjuvant effect of CpG 1018 on the N1-MPP antigen in a prime-only or prime-boost vaccination regimen, naive female 6–8 week old BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were either vaccinated once with 3 μg N1-MPP, 3 μg N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018, or 3 μg of an irrelevant protein, or twice with the same formulations in a 3-week interval (Fig. 1A). Three weeks post boost, mice were then challenged with 10 x the 50% mouse lethal dose (mLD50) of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180, this virus is antigenically equivalent to A/Michigan/45/15) virus, and weight loss and survival were monitored over a 14-day period. As shown in Fig. 1B, mice that only received one vaccination with non-adjuvanted N1-MPP or irrelevant protein all succumbed to infection around day 8 post challenge. Mice vaccinated once with N1-MPP + CpG 1018 experienced high weight loss (approximately 20%) and 4 out of 5 mice succumbed to infection around day 10 post challenge. Nevertheless, mice vaccinated with the adjuvanted formulation survived significantly longer (p = 0.0143). However, groups of mice that received two vaccinations of N1-MPP or N1-MPP + CpG 1018 did not experience any weight loss and all animals in these groups survived the challenge. All mice in the negative control group succumbed to infection around day 8 (Fig. 1B, C). To assess serological characteristics of the serum antibodies induced after vaccination, the serum was tested via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against recombinant Mich15 N1-VASP protein. This protein containing a different tetramerization domain was used to avoid the detection of antibodies induced against the MPP tetramerization domain. After the prime, only a low antibody response against the NA was detectable, with slightly higher levels in the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group (Fig. 1D). Serum from mice vaccinated with the prime-boost regimen showed a strong increase in N1-specific antibodies, with N1-MPP + CpG 1018 performing the best (Fig. 1D). The same trend was observed in a NI assay using an H7N1Mich15 virus, which contains an irrelevant HA and the N1 of A/Michigan/45/15. Mice vaccinated with the prime-boost regimen showed high levels of NI active antibodies in their serum with the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group performing best (geometric mean 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) = 7046) indicating that the CpG 1018 adjuvant leads to a more robust immune response to the antigen (Fig. 1E). The NI results also indicated a statistically significant difference between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups in the prime-boost regimen.Fig. 1: Proof of principle experiment to assess if one vaccination is sufficient to induce a robust and protective immune response in vivo.A Mice (n = 5 per group, except for Neg. Contr. 2× Vacc where n = 3) were vaccinated either once (prime) or twice (prime-boost) with 3 μg of N1-MPP, 3 μg N1-MPP + ODN1018 or irrelevant protein following a challenge with 10xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180). Weight loss and survival were monitored over a 14-day time period. Mice were bled on day 21 and 42 post prime for serological analysis.

Weight loss and survival were monitored over a 14-day period. Mice which received N1-MPP serum showed ~10% weight loss, with one mouse succumbing to infection on day 6 post challenge. Mice that received N1-MPP + CpG 1018 experienced slightly less weight loss than the N1-MPP group and experienced no mortality (Fig. 2A, B). The negative control group succumbed to infection by day 8 post challenge.Fig. 2: Passive transfer of N1-MPP sera.BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) received a passive serum transfer intraperitoneally and were challenged with 5xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180).

To test if CpG 1018 would improve NA immunogenicity, even in a mixture with QIV, naive female 6–8 week old BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were vaccinated IM in a prime-boost regimen. Mice received either 3 µg of N1-MPP, 3 µg N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018, QIV (matched with the challenge virus), QIV + 3 μg CpG 1018, 3 µg N1-MPP admixed with QIV, 3 µg N1-MPP admixed with QIV and 3 μg CpG 1018, 3 µg of N1-MPP given in the right leg and QIV at the same time in the left leg (N1-MPP (r) + QIV (l)), 3 µg of N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018 given in the right leg and QIV + 3 μg CpG 1018 given in the left leg at the same time (N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018 (r) + QIV + 3 μg CpG 1018 (l)) or 3 µg of irrelevant protein (Fig. 3A). Following vaccination, mice were challenged with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 H1N1 (IVR-180). Weight loss and survival was monitored over a 14-day period. The non-adjuvanted N1-MPP group showed the highest post challenge weight loss of ~10% and one mouse in the group succumbed to infection on day 6 post infection. All mice in the negative control group succumbed to infection on day 6 post infection. The remaining groups did not experience any morbidity or mortality (Fig. 3B, C).Fig. 3: Preclinical assessment of N1-MPP and seasonal QIV in combination with CpG 1018.A Vaccination scheme, mice (n = 5 per group) were vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen and then challenged either with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) to monitor weight loss and survival over a 14-day period or with 1xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) to determine viral lung titers. B Weight loss curve (mean plus standard deviation) and C survival after viral challenge are shown. Differences in survival were analyzed using a Mantel–Cox log-rank test. N1-MPP vs Neg. Ctrl. p = 0.0404, all other groups vs. Neg. Ctrl. p = 0.0082, all other comparisons were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). D Viral lung titers obtained on day 3 (n = 3 per group) and E day 6 (n = 3 per group) post challenge. Statistical analysis in D and E was performed using an one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons, shown is mean plus standard deviation.Full size imageTo observe the effect of CpG 1018 on the reduction of viral load in the lungs, a subset of mice was infected with a lower challenge dose of 1xmLD50 A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180). Lungs were extracted on day 3 (Fig. 3D) and day 6 (Fig. 3E) post infection and the viral titers were determined. On day 3, the negative control group showed the highest viral titer (7.8 × 105 pfu/ml), followed by the N1-MPP group (5.1 × 104 pfu/ml), the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 (5.0 × 103 pfu/ml) and the QIV groups (1.0 × 103 pfu/ml). In the remaining groups, no virus was detectable. On day 6, the virus cleared out in the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group as well as in the QIV group. The viral titer remained detectible in the N1-MPP group (8.5 × 103 pfu/ml) but was lower than in the negative control group (2.4 × 105 pfu/ml).Since it is known that high titers of NI active antibodies correlate with reduction of viral replication as well as a less severe disease outcome, we wanted to assess the level of NI active antibodies induced after vaccination with N1-MPP and QIV in combination with CpG 1018. NI assays were performed with H7N1Mich15 virus, which contains the matching NA component to the vaccine antigen, and with H7N1Cal09 virus to observe if cross-reactive NI antibodies can be induced. Against H7N1Mich15, N1-MPP + CpG 1018 induced the highest level of NI antibodies (ID50 = 62309), followed by N1-MPP + CpG 1018 (r) and QIV + CpG 1018 (l) (ID50 = 17602), N1-MPP + QIV + CpG 1018 admixed (ID50 = 15954) and unadjuvanted N1-MPP (ID50 = 15409) (Fig. 4A). Of note, the N1-MPP + CpG 1018, N1-MPP + CpG 1018 (r) and QIV + CpG 1018 (l) and N1-MPP + QIV + CpG 1018 group NI activity were not significantly different suggesting that both administration of HA and NA containing vaccine in different limbs as well as co-administration in the presence of adjuvant may induce similar immune responses while this is not the case when recombinant NA is admixed with QIV without adjuvant. In case of the heterologous H7N1Cal09 virus, N1-MPP + CpG 1018 had the highest NI inhibition potential (ID50 = 4585), followed by the unadjuvanted N1-MPP group (ID50 = 1479) (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4: Crossreactivity of serum antibodies against different N1 proteins in NI and ELISA.A NI using a reassortant H7N1Mich15 virus containing the N1 of A/Michigan/45/2015 or B containing the N1 of A/California/04/09. Geometric mean plus standard deviation is shown. Statistical analysis in A and B was performed using an one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons, shown is mean plus standard deviation. ELISA crossreactivity testing against C Mich15 N1-VASP protein, D NC99 N1-VASP protein, E PR8 N1-VASP protein, F Cal09 N1-VASP protein, G Bris18 N1-VASP protein, and H Vn04 N1-VASP protein. For C to H, mean and standard deviation are shown. N = 5 per group.Full size imageWe also wanted to test if antibodies induced through vaccination with N1-MPP would induce N1 subtype cross-reactive antibodies. The serum was tested in ELISAs against recombinant Mich15 N1-VASP protein (Fig. 4C) matching the vaccine antigen strain, and against NC99 N1 (pre-pandemic N1, Fig. 4D), PR8 N1 (prototype N1, Fig. 4E), Cal09 N1 (Fig. 4F), Bris18 N1 (Fig. 4G) and Vn04 N1 (avian N1, Fig. 4H). Overall, the same trend was seen as in the NI assay, with N1-MPP + CpG 1018 performing the best, followed by N1-MPP + ODN1018 (r) and QIV + CpG 1018 (l) and N1-MPP + QIV + CpG 1018 admixed. This underscores that CpG 1018 is beneficial in inducing a strong and robust antibody response, which appears to be cross-reactive within the N1 subgroup. N1-MPP + QIV admixed induced only a low N1-specific antibody response as well as lower titers of NI active antibodies, underlining the antigenic competition between HA and NA.Antigen dose de-escalation shows a clear adjuvant effect of CpG 1018In the previous animal experiments described above, a standard amount of 3 μg N1-MPP protein per vaccine dose was used in a prime-boost regimen. Using this quantity of NA protein, it was observed that mice vaccinated with unadjuvanted N1-MPP, experienced approximately 10% weight loss (Fig. 5A), with one mouse which succumbing to infection on day 7 post challenge (Fig. 5B). However, mice which received N1-MPP + CpG 1018 did not experience any significant morbidity or mortality. To assess if this trend could be maintained with a reduced amount of N1-MPP, we performed a dose de-escalation study. Mice (n = 4–5 per group) were vaccinated IM in a prime/boost regimen with different amounts of antigen and challenged three weeks after the boost with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180). Mice were vaccinated with 1 µg, 0.3 µg, or 0.1 µg of N1-MPP, N1-MPP + CpG 1018 or an irrelevant protein. Mice which received 1 μg of N1-MPP experienced around 20% weight loss (Fig. 5C), with two mice succumbing to infection on day 6 and 7 post challenge (Fig. 5D). However, the 1 μg N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group experienced only 5% weight loss and showed full protection. When vaccinated with 0.3 μg of non-adjuvanted N1-MPP, all mice succumbed to infection by day 7 similar to the negative control group (Fig. 5E, F). The 0.3 μg N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group experienced high weight loss of almost 20% and three mice succumbed to infection by day 8. Vaccination with 0.1 μg of antigen, no matter if adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted, failed to protect mice against viral challenge and all mice succumbed to infection by day 7 (Fig. 5G, H). In terms of serological responses, there was a high level of N1-specific antibodies detectable via ELISA (against Mich15 N1-VASP protein) in mice which received 3 μg (Fig. 5C) and 1 μg (Fig. 5G) of antigen. Even though vaccination with 0.3 μg (Fig. 5K) and 0.1 μg (Fig. 5J) failed to induce protection in vivo, serological analysis revealed that there was still an N1 antibody response detectable, albeit only at low levels. In terms of NI activity, there were bigger differences detected between individual dose groups than in ELISA. After vaccination with 3 μg of N1-MPP + CpG 1018, the ID50 was 5000 (geometric mean) (Fig. 5I). Once the dose was reduced to 1 µg, the ID50 dropped to 324 for the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group and to 119 for the non-adjuvanted N1-MPP group (Fig. 5I). For mice that received 0.3 μg of antigen, the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group showed an ID50 of 113 (Fig. 5I). In the case of the 0.1 μg group, the ID50 level decreased to below the limit of detection (Fig. 5I). In general, while binding antibodies were present, these antibodies had little to no NI activity in groups which received low amounts of NA protein.Fig. 5: Dose testing of N1-MPP.Mice (n = 4–5 per group) were vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen with different doses of antigen (3 µg, 1 µg, 0.3 µg, 0.1 µg) and then challenged with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180). Weight loss (mean plus standard deviation) and survival were monitored over a 14-day period. Blood was obtained 42 days after prime and serological testing via ELISA and an NI assay was performed.

Therefore, we generated N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP constructs in addition to the N1-MPP construct. We cloned the sequences encoding for N2 of A/Kansas/14/17 (H3N2) and influenza B-NA of B/Colorado/6/17 into a pFastBac Dual vector containing a measles virus phosphoprotein tetramerization domain10. The constructs were expressed in insect cells and purified via an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Structural integrity of the proteins was verified by visualizing them on a sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Under reducing conditions, N1, N2, and B-NA-MPP were visible as monomers at an expected size of ~60 kDa (Fig. 6A). By adding BS3 crosslinker, which cross-links primary amines, it was possible to confirm successful tetramerization of the N2-MPP and the B-NA-MPP protein. The tetramers were detectable at a size of ~240 kDa (Fig. 6B), which is comparable to the already established N1-MPP construct which was included as a control. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) served as monomeric control. To confirm that the NA-MPP proteins present the correct antigenic epitopes, an ELISA was performed using a broad panel of N2 (Fig. 6C)15 and B-NA (Fig. 6D)16 specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). An irrelevant anti-Lassa antibody KL-AV-1A12 was included as negative control. All mAbs showed strong binding to N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP suggesting that the probed epitopes are presented in a native-like conformation. Next, we wanted to determine if the proteins are enzymatically active. For this, a standard NA-Star assay was performed. N1-MPP was included as a positive control. It was observed that N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP had high enzymatic activity comparable to the already established N1-MPP construct (Fig. 6E). However, the NA activity significantly varied between N1, N2, and B-NA-MPP which is not surprising since the different NA subtypes are known to have varying enzymatic activity based on the strain of origin17.Fig. 6: Structural analysis of N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP.A SDS-PAGE under denaturating conditions, all proteins show monomeric structures at an expected size of ~60 kDa.

C ELISA against rec. N2-MPP using a broad panel of human anti-N2 mAbs to verify correct presentation of epitopes. D ELISA against rec. B-NA-MPP using a broad panel of human anti-B-NA mAbs to verify correct presentation of epitopes. E Enzymatic activity of N1-MPP, N2-MPP, B-NA-MPP was determined via NA-Star assay. Assays in C to E were run once in duplicates and the duplicates were used to calculate one area under the curve (AUC) value.Full size imageVaccination with recombinant N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP provides full protection against lethal influenza virus challenge in the mouse modelTo test if the recombinant N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP could induce a protective immune response, we vaccinated mice IM with 3 μg of the respective antigen (n = 5 per group) in a prime-boost regimen. The protein was either given non-adjuvanted or supplemented with CpG 1018. Irrelevant protein was administered as negative control. Vaccination with N1-MPP was included as a positive control. Following vaccination, mice were challenged either with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 (H1N1), A/Switzerland/9715293/13 (H3N2, mouse adapted) or B/New York/PV01181/18. Mice vaccinated with N1-MPP alone experienced a weight loss of around 10%, whereas the N1-MPP + CpG 1018 group did not show any morbidity or mortality (Fig. 7A, B). In case of N2-MPP vaccination, both the non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted group showed ~10% weight loss (Fig. 7D). However, the N2-MPP + CpG 1018 group did not experience any mortality, whereas in the N2-MPP group one mouse succumbed to infection on day 8 post challenge (Fig. 7E). For the B-NA-MPP vaccination, the unadjuvanted group experienced 10% weight loss, with two mice succumbing to infection on day 3 and 5 post challenge (Fig. 7G, H). However, the B-NA-MPP + CpG 1018 group did not show any morbidity or mortality. The antibody response against the individual NA-MPP antigens was tested via ELISA. In general, non-adjuvanted groups induced a lower immune response compared to the groups receiving NA protein with CpG 1018 (Fig. 7C, F, I).Fig. 7: Testing the protective potential of N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP in vivo.Female 6–8 week old BALB/c (A–C, G–I) or DBA.2 (D–F) mice (n = 5 per group) were vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen with the respective recombinant protein.

For this reason, mice (n = 5 per group) were vaccinated either with N1-MPP, N1-MPP + CpG 1018, N1 + N2 + B-NA-MPP, N1 + N2 + B-NA-MPP + CpG 1018 or influenza B virus HA protein (negativ control) in a prime-boost regimen. After vaccination, mice were challenged with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 (H1N1). The group which received N1-MPP alone experienced ~10% weight loss with one mouse which succumb to infection on day 6 (Fig. 8A, B). The other groups did not show any morbidity or mortality. To test if vaccination would also protect against challenge with a heterologous N1 virus, another subset of mice was challenged with 5xmLD50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1, 6:2 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 reassortant, HA polybasic cleavage site removed). While all groups experienced weight loss of ~20%, partial protection was observed in all vaccinated groups with the trivalent, adjuvanted formulation performing best (Fig. 8C, D). In terms of serology, mice which had been vaccinated with N1 + N2 + B-NA-MPP + CpG 1018 had the strongest antibody response in ELISA against recombinant Mich15-VASP protein (Fig. 8E). In an NI assay using H7N1Mich15 the inhibition potential of groups N1-MPP + CpG 1018 and N1 + N2 + B-NA-MPP + CpG 1018 was the highest (Fig. 8F).Fig. 8: In vivo testing of a trivalent NA-MPP vaccine.Female, 6–8 week old BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen with the respective antigens.

In addition, seasonal influenza virus vaccines induce an unbalanced immune response mostly targeting the HA but not the NA of the virus6,15. However, NA undergoes somewhat slower antigenic drift8 and anti-NA immunity can be highly protective in animal models and humans1,2,3,4,5,6,9,11,23,24,25,26,27,28. Several factors may influence this lack of immunogenicity of NA in seasonal vaccines, including non-standardized amounts of NA in the vaccine preparations, instability of conformational epitopes on the NA in the formulations, and HA immunodominance over NA. Vaccination with stable, tetrameric recombinant NA could overcome these issues, either when used as a standalone vaccine or when admixed to current seasonal vaccines. We have previously reported recombinant NA constructs based on N1 NA fused to a measles virus phosphoprotein tetramerization domain10. Here we have expanded this work to N2 and influenza B virus NA and have shown that these proteins are also immunogenic and protective in the mouse model, especially when used with a TLR9 adjuvant, CpG 1018. Importantly, mixing these three components into a trivalent formulation did not decrease the immune response to the N1 component or protection from challenge with H1N1 or H5N1 viruses. Through passive transfer experiments we also demonstrated that the induced humoral immune response is sufficient for protection, even though cellular immune responses to NA may contribute to protection as well. For initial experiments we used a 3 μg dose of recombinant NA. The rationale behind this was that split vaccine with 1 μg of HA per dose is often used by us and others in the mouse model. The human dose is 15 µg, so 1/15th of the human dose is used. Recombinant HA-based vaccines for humans contain 45 μg of HA per subtype and since the vaccine tested here is a recombinant protein vaccine, we used 1/15th of 45 μg for the recombinant NA as well, resulting in a 3 μg dose. In a dose de-escalation study performed here the 3 μg dose worked indeed better than lower doses. However, it is unclear if increasing the dose further would lead to an improvement in terms of protection. For humans, we are planning to give only one dose (because they are primed) and we will not test doses above 45 μg rNA per shot since we do not think that higher amounts of recombinant NA per dose would be commercially feasible.The main focus of this study was to explore the combination of an adjuvant with our recombinant NA constructs. The TLR9 agonist CpG 1018 was selected as adjuvant since it has an extensive safety record and is currently used in a licensed hepatitis B virus vaccine13,14 which are important pragmatic reasons to include it as adjuvant and which facilitate clinical development significantly. Here we show, that CpG 1018 has a significant adjuvant effect in terms of the induced immune response, protection from the challenge as well as in terms of antigen sparing. In addition, we detected strong crossreactivity to heterologous N1 NAs, especially in the adjuvanted groups, and the adjuvanted trivalent NA vaccine showed the highest degree of protection against H5N1 challenge. The adjuvanted recombinant NA vaccine consistently outperformed the non-adjuvanted recombinant NA vaccine in our study. Previously, we have shown that even when recombinant NA is admixed to seasonal vaccine preparations, HA dominates over NA and suppresses a robust anti-NA response10. By administering seasonal vaccine into one leg of the mice and recombinant NA into another leg this could be partially circumvented and led to a strong NA response. However, this is of course less practical for a vaccine product. Here we observed that the addition of CpG 1018 to the seasonal vaccineecombinant NA admixture at least partially broke the immunodominance of the HA, making it possible to just administer one shot that still resulted in robust anti-NA immunity. The mechanism behind this is so far unclear but could be as simple as attracting more immune cells to the injection side and providing an innate immune trigger that enhances the immune response in general. If this effect is unique to CpG 1018 remains to be determined. In the future, we plan to explore this and also conduct an analysis of innate and T-cell immune responses after vaccination with adjuvanted recombinant NA immunogens. Of course, an important caveat of our study which needs to be pointed out is, that it was performed in naive mice and that so far we have not tested the vaccine candidate in other animal models like hamsters and ferrets. Humans are already immunologically primed for NA and will therefore likely respond differently than naive mice.In summary, we show that the combination of recombinant NA with CpG 1018 is inducing robust anti-NA immunity and protection in the mouse model. This warrants further clinical development of the combination and will hopefully result in a next-generation seasonal influenza virus vaccine with more resistance to antigenic drift, which may also partially protect from emerging pandemic influenza virus subtypes.MethodsCells and virusesMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC #CCL-34) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics mix (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin; Gibco) and 1% hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES; Gibco). BTN-TN-5B1-4 (Trichoplusia ni, High Five) cells were maintained in Express Five media (Gibco) containing 1% L-glutamine (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics mix. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were maintained in Trichoplusia ni medium – Fred Hink (TNM-FH; Gemini Bioproducts) containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics mix, and 1% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma Aldrich). For passaging of baculovirus stocks in Sf9 cells, the medium was switched to TNM-FH containing 3% FBS, 1% Pluronic F-68 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics mix. The reassortant viruses used in this study were grown in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories). The H7N1 viruses used in NA inhibition assay, contain the internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 an exotic H7 HA of A/mallard/Alberta/24/01 H7N3 and either the N1 of A/Michigan/45/2015 H1N1 (H7N1Mich15) or A/California/04/09 H1N1 (H7N1Cal09). The challenge virus A/Singapore/GP1908/15 (H1N1, IVR-180 strain) possesses the internal proteins of A/Texas/1/77 (H3N2) and the surface glycoproteins of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 (pH1N1). A/Switzerland/9715293/13 (H3N2) and B/New York/PV01181/18 are based on wild type backbones but are mouse-adapted; A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) is a reassortant virus with the internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 and has a deleted polybasic cleavage site.Recombinant proteinsRecombinant proteins used in this study were generated by using the baculovirus expression system. Briefly, coding sequences for N1-MPP, N2-MPP and B-MPP were cloned into a modified pFastBac vector. The vectors where then transformed into DH10Bac, appropriate clones were picked based on blue/white screening, the clones were grown and midiprepped and the resulting bacmids were transfected into Sf9 cells for baculovirus rescue. Rescued baculovirus was then propagated in Sf9 cells and used to infect High Five cells for protein expression at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Three days post infection, the High Five cell supernatant was harvested and recombinant NAs were purified using Ni2+ chelate chromatography. The recombinant N1-MPP, N2-MPP and B-MPP proteins used for animal vaccination studies are structured into an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a hexahistidine purification tag, a measles virus phosphoprotein tetramerization domain, a thrombin cleavage site and either the N1 globular head domain (A/Michigan/45/15), the N2 globular head domain (A/Kansas/14/17 (H3N2)) or an influenza B NA globular head domain (B/Colorado/6/17)). Influenza B virus HA of B/Malaysia/2506/04 (B-Mal-HA) served as a negative control except for experiments with an influenza B virus challenge where a Lassa glycoprotein was used instead, the constructs were designed as described previously. The recombinant NA proteins of A/New Caledonia/20/99 H1N1 (NC99), A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8), A/Brisbane/02/18 H1N1 (Bris18), A/California/04/09 (Cal09) H1N1, A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 (Vn04), A/Kansas/14/17 H3N2 (Kansas17), B/Colorado/6/17 (Colorado17) and A/Michigan/45/15 H1N1 are designed in the same way as the N1-MPP construct with the difference that they contain a vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (Mich15-VASP) tetramerization domain instead of a MPP domain. Protein concentrations were measured using Quick Start™ Bradford 1× Dye Reagent (BioRad). The proteins were stored at −80 °C.Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)To confirm protein integrity, an SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions and by using a bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3; ThermoFisher) crosslinker. For the BS3 crosslinker SDS-PAGE, the proteins were treated with the crosslinker according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For the SDS-PAGE 1.5 μg of the respective NA protein was mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli loading buffer (BioRad) supplemented with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then heated for 10 minutes at 95 °C prior to loading them on a sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel (4–20% Mini-PROTEAN®TGX™ Precast Protein Gels, BioRad). Afterwards, the gels were stained with Coomassie blue (ThermoFisher) for 1 hour at room temperature and destained with distilled water to visualize the proteins. BSA was used as a monomeric control.Animal workAll animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For all animal experiments conducted, female 6–8 week old BALB/c or DBA.2 mice (Jackson laboratories, n = 5 per group) were used, unless otherwise mentioned. The adjuvant, CpG 1018 (TLR9 agonist), used in this study was provided by Dynavax Technologies and administered at a dose of 3 μg per mouse. Seasonal QIV used in these experiments was Flucelvax (LOT 252380, season 2017/18). To observe if two vaccinations are required to induce a robust protective immune response, mice were primed intramuscularly (IM) or primed and boosted (with a 3-week interval) with 3 μg N1-MPP, 3 µg N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018 or 3 µg of an irrelevant protein (B-Mal-HA). Six weeks after the prime, mice were intranasally challenged with 10× the 50% mouse lethal dose (mLD50) of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180). Weight loss and survival were monitored over a period of 14 days. Mice were euthanized if they lost more than 25% of their initial body weight. Blood was taken from each mouse on day 21 and day 42 post prime.In addition, a passive serum transfer was performed using serum from mice previously vaccinated with N1-MPP, N1-MPP + CpG 1018 and B-Mal-HA. Naive mice received 200 μl of serum intraperitoneally. After 2 hours, the mice were intranasally challenged with 5xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) and weight loss and survival were monitored over 14 days.To assess the effect of CpG 1018 in more detail, mice were vaccinated IM in a follow up experiment in a prime/boost regimen separated into the following groups: 3 µg N1-MPP, 3 µg N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018, QIV (1 µg of each HA), QIV + 3 μg CpG 1018, 3 µg N1-MPP admixed with QIV, 3 µg N1-MPP admixed with QIV and 3 μg CpG 1018, 3 µg N1-MPP given in the right leg and QIV given in the left leg at the same time (N1-MPP (r)/QIV (l)), N1-MPP + 3 μg CpG 1018 (r)/QIV + 3 μg CpG 1018 (l) or 3 µg B-Mal-HA. Mice were then challenged intranasally with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180). Weight loss and survival were monitored over 14 days. Blood was obtained on day 21 and day 42 after prime. Mice were euthanized if they lost 25% or more of their initial body weight.To determine the viral load in murine lung tissues, mice were vaccinated using the same regimen but with the difference that they were challenged with a reduced challenge dose of 1xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) to gain a better resolution. Lungs were taken on day 3 and day 6 post challenge, homogenized and the viral titer determined via standard plaque assay5.To assess if the amount of N1-MPP protein could be potentially reduced yet still induce a protective immune response, mice were vaccinated IM in a prime-boost regimen with different doses of N1-MPP. Mice received either 3 µg, 1 µg, 0.3 µg, or 0.1 µg of N1-MPP, N1-MPP + the matching amount of CpG 1018 or irrelevant B-Mal-HA protein. Mice were then challenged with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) and weight loss and survival were monitored over 14 days. Mice were euthanized if they lost more than 25% of their initial body weight.To observe the protective potential of N2-MPP and B-NA-MPP, mice were vaccinated IM in a prime-boost regimen with 3 μg N2/B-NA-MPP, 3 μg N2/B-NA-MPP + CpG 1018, or 3 μg B-Mal-HA (or Lassa glycoprotein for mice challenged with influenza B virus). Vaccination with N1-MPP in the same setup was included as a positive control. Mice were then either challenged with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) or 25xmLD50 of B/New York/PV01181/18. For the challenge with 25xmLD50 of A/Switzerland/9715293/13 (H3N2) female DBA/2 J mice were used. Weight loss and survival were monitored over 14 days. Mice were euthanized if they lost more than 25% of their initial body weight. Blood was obtained on day 21 and day 42 after prime.To determine if there would be antigenic competition between the individual NA-MPP proteins when combined in one vaccination, mice were vaccinated IM in a prime-boost regimen either with 3 μg N1-MPP, 3 μg N1-MPP + CpG 1018, 3 μg of each N1, N2 and B-NA-MPP, 3 μg of each N1, N2 and B-NA-MPP + CpG 1018 or 3 μg of B-Mal-HA. Mice were then challenged either with 25xmLD50 of A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) or 5xmLD50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1, 6:2 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 reassortant, HA with deleted polybasic cleavage site). Weight loss and survival were monitored over 14 days. Mice were euthanized if they lost more than 25% of their initial body weight. Blood was obtained on day 21 and day 42 after prime.NA-star assayThe NA enzymatic activity of the NA-MPP proteins was determined by using the NA-Star™ Influenza NA Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit (ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. As a starting concentration, 10ug/ml of the respective protein was used and then serially diluted 1:3 across the plate. The signal was based on luminescence read-out and was measured using a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek). The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)ELISAs were conducted as described previously12. Briefly, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Immulon 4 HBX plates, ThermoFisher) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 µl/well of the respective recombinant protein at a concentration of 2 µg/ml diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4; Gibco). On the next day, the coating solution was removed and the plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with 100 µl/well of 3% milk mixed with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). The blocking solution was discarded and the serum samples were diluted to a starting concentration of 1:50 in 1% milk/PBST followed by a 1:3 dilution across the plate. The samples were then incubated on the plate for 2 h at RT. For ELISAs which were performed using mAbs, the antibodies were diluted to a start concentration of 30 µg/ml and then serially diluted 1:3 across the plate. The antibodies were incubated on the plate for 1 h at RT. For the N2-MPP epitope testing a broad panel of human derived N2-specific mAbs was used including 229-1B05, 229-1F06, 229-2E02, 235-1E06, 228-2D04, 229-1G03, 220-1D05, 229-2C0615. In the case of the B-MPP epitope testing the human B-NA specific antibodies 3C01, 2H09, 2E01, 2D10, 1G05, 1D05, and 1A0316 were used. Afterwards, plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated for 1 h at RT with the secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG H&L peroxidase-conjugated (Rockland, 610-1302, used 1:3000) or anti-human IgG Fab-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma Aldrich, A0293-1ML, used 1:5000). The antibody was diluted 1:3000 in 1%milk/PBST and 100 µl/well were added to the plate. The plates were washed again three times with PBST and then developed by adding 100 µl/well of SigmaFast o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl/well of 3 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). The signal was read using a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek) at an optical density of 490 nm. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 software and values were expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). The cutoff value was defined as the average of all blank wells plus three times the standard deviation of the blank wells.Neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assayThe NI assay was conducted as described previously12. Briefly, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Immulon 4 HBX plates, ThermoFisher) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 150 µl/well of fetuin (50 µg/ml; Sigma Aldrich). The next day, serum samples were heat inactivated for 1 h at 56 °C and then diluted to a starting concentration of 1:100 in PBS. The samples were diluted 1:2 across a fresh 96-well plate. The reassortant viruses used in this assay, H7N1Cal09 and H7N1Mich15, were diluted in PBS and then added to the serum dilution at 2× the 50% effective concentration (EC50) for 1 h 45 min shaking at RT. In the meantime, the fetuin coated plates were washed three times with PBST and blocked with 200 µl/well of 5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT. The plates were washed three times with PBST and 100 µl of the serum-virus mixture was transferred and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBST and 100 µl/well of peanut agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (PNA 5 µg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) were added for 1 h 45 at RT. The plates were washed three times with PBST and developed by adding 100 µl/well of SigmaFast OPD developing solution. The reaction was stopped after 7 minutes by adding 50 µl/well of 3 M HCl. The signal was measured by using a Synergy 4 plate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm and the individual inhibitory concertation 50 (IC50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.Lung titersPlaque assays for virus titration have been conducted as described previously5. Briefly, confluent MDCK monolayers were infected with different sample dilutions (1:10–1:1.000.000) of homogenized lung tissues diluted in 1× minimum essential medium (MEM) ((1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics mix, 1% HEPES, 1% L-glutamine and 1% sodium-bicarbonate (Gibco)) for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterwards, the virus dilution was removed and an overlay consisting out of 2% Oxoid agar (ThermoFisher), H2O, 2× MEM, diethylaminoethyl (0.1% (wt/vol) DEAE) dextran and N-p-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (1 µg/ml) was added to the cells. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C and then fixed using 10% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Afterwards, the agar overlay was carefully removed, and the plaques visualized by immunostaining. Plates were blocked for 1 h at RT with 3% milk/PBS. The blocking solution was discarded, and the plates incubated with primary antibody (anti-N1 mAb 4A5) diluted 1:3000 in 1% milk/PBS for 1 h at RT. The plates were washed three times with PBS and the secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG H&L peroxidase-conjugated (Rockland)) was added for 1 h at RT. The plates were washed three times with PBS and then developed by adding KPL TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate (SeraCare). The number of plaques was counted (n = 3 per group) and the virus titers presented as the log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. The limit of detection for the assay was at 125 PFU/ml. The graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 8.Statistical analysisTiters were compared using a one-way analysis of variance corrected for multiple comparisons. Survival was compared using a Mantel–Cox log-rank test. All statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.0.1.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) combined with oseltamivir (TCMIs + oseltamivir) are the representative therapeutic strategies for influenza, which is a compliant with clinical applications in China. The aim of this study was to describe the comparative efficacy and safety of TCMIs + oseltamivir in patients with influenza, based on the current evidence.Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, VIP information resource integration service platform databases, and the Chinese biomedical literature service system were searched to find randomized controlled trials where TCMIs + oseltamivir are the representative therapeutic strategies for influenza, from inception until October 2021, without language restriction. Two investigators independently screened eligibility criteria, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias with the same criteria. We conducted a network meta-analysis using the Bayesian random method for each outcome and performed the sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and Egger’s and Begg’s tests for the reliability and robustness of our results.Results: Thirty-one trials including 2,893 participants proved eligible and reported on four TCMIs + oseltamivir versus oseltamivir. Network meta-analysis showed Yanhuning (YHN) +oseltamivir (MD = −1.7, 95% CrI: −2.5 to −0.88; SUCRA = 0.89; low certainty of evidence) in fever disappearance time, Tanreqing (TRQ) +oseltamivir (MD = −1.9, 95% CrI: −2.8 to −1; SUCRA = 0.97; low certainty of evidence) in cough disappearance time, and Xiyanping (XYP) +oseltamivir (OR = 5.9, 95% CrI: 3.1 to 11; SUCRA = 0.82; very low certainty of evidence) in the response rate to be more efficacious than oseltamivir alone with the best SUCRA. Based on the combined SUCRA value for primary outcomes, TRQ + oseltamivir is probably better in cough disappearance time, and XYP + oseltamivir and YHN + oseltamivir may be better in fever disappearance time than others. No significant difference in safety between the treatments.Conclusion: In patients with influenza, TCMIs + oseltamivir only partially improve flu symptoms. Overall therapeutic efficacy and safety are inconclusive, based on low to very low certainty of evidence. However, the safety remains uncertain, and TCMI treatments for influenza should be considered with caution. More high-quality studies examining the efficacy and safety of TCMIs are needed.Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD420212869941 IntroductionInfluenza is one of the most prevalent causes of respiratory tract infections, which remains a public threat to health-related quality of life worldwide and further intensifies the considerable clinical and socioeconomic burden (Gilbert, 2018). Influenza viruses result in not only a series of symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, cough, nasal congestion, muscle soreness, and fatigue) in acute episodes of respiratory disease (Ghebrehewet et al., 2016; Uyeki 2017) but also gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting (Minodier et al., 2015). Influenza virus infections were associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide each year, and its true mortality rate was higher than that reported by the World Health Organization (Simonsen et al., 2013; Coates et al., 2015). It is noteworthy that influenza is a leading cause of hospitalizations in pulmonary respiratory diseases, and it remains a significant health burden for the elderly, neonatal, and children (Thompson et al., 2004; Lafond et al., 2016; Cromer, 2014). Also, influenza viruses can contribute to the risk of secondary non-respiratory diseases, particularly in the cardiovascular and nervous systems (Sellers et al., 2017).Neuraminidase inhibitors are still globally approved as currently used antiviral therapeutic agents for influenza, mainly including oseltamivir and zanamivir, and it is recommended to intervene early in the development of disease (Kumar 2011; Muthuri et al., 2014). In clinical practice, oseltamivir is a powerful antiviral drug widely used to treat influenza A and B infections (Davies, 2010). Oseltamivir has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms such as cough, headache, nasal congestion, and fatigue, and reduce other respiratory complications and hospitalization risks, as well as the mortality of hospitalized patients with influenza (Jefferson et al., 2014; Muthuri et al., 2014; Dobson et al., 2015). With the widespread clinical application of oseltamivir, a proportion of outpatients and inpatients developed the oseltamivir resistance (Hayden 2009; Nguyen et al., 2012; Gubareva et al., 2017). In particular, when people with waning immunity use long-term usage of antiviral treatment, it will result in an increased incidence of drug resistance (Krammer et al., 2018).As an important alternative therapy for influenza treatment, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an essential role in global public health and is efficacious in reducing the patients fever and other related symptoms (Xiong et al., 2020). With the in-depth research, Chinese herbal medicines and related TCM extracts have been confirmed to exert their antiviral and immunoregulation, thereby effectively treating and preventing influenza (Xiong et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, TCM can inhibit viral infection by directly targeting influenza viruses (Zhou et al., 2015). The active extracts and derivatives of the Chinese herbal medicines can inhibit oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus strains through broad-spectrum activity (Chung et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2015), and provide a novel treatment insight for the synergistic treatment of oseltamivir resistance with the Chinese medicine. When combined with oseltamivir, TCM does not affect the antiviral effect of oseltamivir, even increasing the drug absorption rate of oseltamivir (Zhang et al., 2019).Traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs), as the representative therapeutic interventions of antiviral drugs in the Chinese patent medicine, have been recognized and registered by the National Medical Products Administration and widely used in clinical practice for years in China. Although current clinical guidelines reported the clinical efficacy of oral Chinese patent medicines for treating influenza (Wu et al., 2020), there is still a lack of robust evidence regarding the TCMIs to date. Therefore, based on the actual clinical setting, we conduct this network meta-analysis to analyze the clinical efficacy and safety of various TCMIs combined with oseltamivir (TCMIs + oseltamivir) for influenza.2 MethodsThis systematic review and network meta-analysis were reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), PRISMA protocols, and the PRISMA-extension statement for network meta-analysis (Moher et al., 2009; Hutton et al., 2015; Shamseer et al., 2015). We registered and published our protocol for this network meta-analysis in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) (registration number: CRD42021286994).2.1 Eligibility CriteriaWe included randomized controlled trials of patients with influenza and compared various TCMIs + oseltamivir and oseltamivir alone, without the language, geographical, and publication status restrictions. Eligible studies that focus on TCMIs were approved by the National Medical Products Administration with the detailed information on the drug, as of our retrieved date. Eligible treatment interventions were different TCMIs combined with oseltamivir, compared with oseltamivir alone as a control. There were no age, sex, or race restriction in our literature search.Studies needed to be excluded when existing conditions were as follows: Patients suffering from serious life-threatening diseases and drug-resistant strains affect the research purposes for treating influenza. We also excluded ineligible studies, including retrospective cohort studies, population-based cross-sectional studies, case–control studies, and non-randomized trials. We excluded randomized controlled trials evaluating the non-oseltamivir antiviral treatment (amantadine, zanamivir, and ribavirin), oral traditional Chinese medicines (Chinese medicine decoction, granules, capsules, and pills), and non-pharmacologic treatments (acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and electrical stimulation). Studies were excluded because of missing data, duplicate publications, or significant errors.2.2 Search Strategy and Selection CriteriaThe search included main Chinese databases [China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP information resource integration service platform databases, and Chinese biomedical literature service system (SinoMed)] and English databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) without language restriction to find randomized controlled trials from database inception until October 2021. Clinicaltrials.gov, the Chinese clinical trial registry, and reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews also were manually researched to cross-check the records, and to identify and supplement the potential eligible articles. The main searched terms (including MeSH words and text words) related to influenza, seasonal influenza, seasonal flu, flu, traditional Chinese medicine injection, and randomized controlled trials. Supplementary File S1 presents the detailed search strategy.2.3 Data ExtractionTwo investigators (YP and ZC) independently screened the titles and abstracts for the potentially eligible studies. We evaluated the full text of these articles in more detail by using the standardized and predesigned data extraction forms, according to our eligibility criteria, followed by a cross-check. When disagreements occurred in the literature screening and data extraction, the consensus was performed by discussion among two investigators or by consultation with a third reviewer (XL) if necessary. Investigators extracted information on the study characteristics (first author, publication time, study design, country, and duration), participant characteristics (age, sex, sample size, diseases, and disease course), intervention characteristics (interventions status, intervention duration, dose, drug class, and pharmaceutical company), and the description of outcomes (binary outcomes and dichotomous outcomes).2.4 Outcome AssessmentWe selected the outcomes that followed the importance to patients and crucial features of influenza, and the primary and secondary outcomes were informed after discussion by our professional panel. Selected primary outcomes included the response rate {calculated as [(number of total patients−number of invalid patients)umber of total patients] × 100%. Patients with unchanged or worsening symptoms (e.g., fever and cough) were considered invalid.}, disappearance time of fever, and disappearance time of cough. The negative time of nucleic acid and length of hospitalization could not be comprehensively assessed in this network comparison, due to the few numbers of included studies and missing information in certain TCMIs. Thus, secondary outcomes of this network meta-analysis included the negative time of nucleic acid and length of hospitalization as in this network meta-analysis, and safety with adverse events (dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting).2.5 Risk of Bias AssessmentTwo investigators (XW and HC) independently assessed the quality of all eligible studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool (Higgins et al., 2011) to rate each item criterion of studies as either at low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias, and high risk of bias, across the following seven domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. Any disagreements in the risk of bias assessment were resolved and evaluated by a discussion with a third investigator (XL).2.6 Data Synthesis and Statistical MethodsWe summarized the effect of interventions on dichotomous outcomes (response rate and safety: adverse events) using odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrI) and continuous outcomes (i.e., improvement in fever and cough, negative time of nucleic acid, and length of hospitalization) using the mean differences (MDs) with corresponding 95% CrI. I2 statistics were used to assess the statistical heterogeneity in direct and indirect comparisons. We used a Bayesian random method based on the consistency assumption for network meta-analysis accounting for the combined direct within each study and indirect comparisons across studies. A vague prior was used for between-study heterogeneity, and MDs and log(OR) values were derived from the posterior distribution of the model. We choose the models that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with a weighted sample size to run in four Markov chains with set as least 2,00,000 iterations. All interventions were calculated by ranking probabilities using the surface under the curve cumulative ranking (SUCRA).We performed sensitivity analyses that focus on children population to further explore and check the reliability and robustness of our findings. To resolve potential heterogeneity, we also conducted the univariate meta-regression (regressors: sample size, percentage male, mean age, and course of treatment) and used predictive mean matching imputations to fill the missing data for regressors. We performed the comparison-adjusted funnel plots by Egger’s and Begg’s tests to assess the publication bias in primary outcomes when 10 or more studies were included in the network comparison. The node splitting approach within each loop was not conducted to test the inconsistency and to obtain indirect estimates, as all including TCMI interventions were directly compared with oseltamivir alone. To assess the evidence certainty of interventions in all outcomes, we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to identify the cumulative evidence, including the seven items (downgraded because of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, intransitivity, and incoherence) and four grades of evidence certainty (very low, low, moderate, and high certainty of evidence) (Guyatt et al., 2011; Brignardello-Petersen et al., 2018).We conducted this network meta-analysis with the Bayesian framework using R (version 4.0.5) for all outcomes, and the risk of bias was generated by RevMan (version 5.4) for all included studies.3 Results3.1 Search ResultsWe identified 967 initial articles from the English and Chinese database search and did not find any potentially additional studies from other sources. After title and abstract screening and full-text reviewing, 31 trials were deemed eligible for inclusion in our systematic review and network meta-analysis (Supplementary File S2). Figure 1 shows the detailed literature search process.FIGURE 1 FIGURE 1. Summary of evidence search and selection.3.2 Study CharacteristicsSupplementary Table S1 presents detailed characteristics of the included studies. Thirty-one eligible studies enrolled a total of 2,893 participants (TCMIs + oseltamivir: 1452; oseltamivir alone as control: 1441) with a median sample size (93 participants) ranging from 36 to 200 participants, mean age ranging from 2.92 to 46.6 years, the percentage of male ranging from 42.5 to 64.4%, and average time of interventions ranging from 3 to 10 days. Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 list the detailed chemical and raw material characterizations of all involved TCMIs. All publications of eligible randomized trials were conducted in China. We evaluated various TCMIs + oseltamivir compared with oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza with four direct comparisons: Xiyanping injections combined with oseltamivir (XYP + oseltamivir), Reduning injections combined with oseltamivir (RDN + oseltamivir), Tanreqing injections combined with oseltamivir (TRQ + oseltamivir), and Yanhuning injections combined with oseltamivir (YHN + oseltamivir).3.3 Methodological Quality AssessmentMost of the included studies had the unclear risk of bias across all domains and proved at low risk of bias for at least one domain. Included studies reported the “random” assignment (32.26% present the specific methods of random sequence generation) and were judged to have the unclear risk of bias for blinding and allocation sequence concealment, and other bias in most or all studies. The risk of bias from the missing data posed the lowest risk (low risk of bias) due to all data being completely reported; 24 studies (77.42%) were at low risk of bias in the domains of selected outcomes reporting. The risk of bias assessments for each study are available in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2.3.4 OutcomesFigure 2 (primary outcomes) and Supplementary Figure S3 (other outcomes) show the network of interventions included in all outcome analyses for the direct comparisons between TCMIs + oseltamivir and oseltamivir.FIGURE 2 FIGURE 2.

Meta-analysis results with ranking according to the SUCRA value are as follows: XYP + oseltamivir (OR = 5.9, 95% CrI: 3.1 to 11; SUCRA = 0.82; very low certainty of evidence), TRQ + oseltamivir (OR = 4.3, 95% CrI: 2.2 to 8.9; SUCRA = 0.59; very low certainty of evidence), RDN + oseltamivir (OR = 4.2, 95% CrI: 2.3 to 8.3; SUCRA = 0.57; very low certainty of evidence), and YHN + oseltamivir (OR = 4.1, 95% CrI: 2.5 to 7; SUCRA = 0.52; very low certainty of evidence) were associated with significant difference in the response rate when compared with oseltamivir (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure S4A, and Supplementary Table S4). Table 1 (top panel) shows that there were no significant differences among TCMIs + oseltamivir for the response rate.FIGURE 3 FIGURE 3. Forest plots of primary outcomes.

League table of response rate and disappearance time of fever.3.5.2 Disappearance Time of FeverTwenty-four trials including 2,194 participants reported the disappearance time of fever. Meta-analysis results with SUCRA showed that YHN + oseltamivir (MD = −1.7, 95% CrI: −2.5 to −0.88; SUCRA = 0.89; low certainty of evidence), XYP + oseltamivir (MD = −1.3, 95% CrI: −2.2 to −0.5; SUCRA = 0.71; low certainty of evidence), and TRQ + oseltamivir (MD = −1.0, 95% CrI: −1.7 to −0.35; SUCRA = 0.5; low certainty of evidence) were more efficacious than oseltamivir with significant difference (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure S4B, and Supplementary Table S4). Table 1 (under panel) shows that there were no significant differences among TCMIs + oseltamivir in the disappearance time of fever.3.5.3 Disappearance Time of CoughFourteen trials including 1,290 participants reported the disappearance time of cough. Meta-analysis results with SUCRA showed that TRQ + oseltamivir (MD = −1.9, 95% CrI: −2.8 to −1; SUCRA = 0.97; low-certainty of the evidence) was more efficacious than oseltamivir with significant difference (Figure 3C, Supplementary Figure S4C, and Supplementary Table S4). Table 2 (top panel) shows that TRQ + oseltamivir reduced the duration of cough symptoms with a high probability than YHN + oseltamivir.TABLE 2 TABLE 2. League table of disappearance time of cough.3.5.4 Biplot of Primary OutcomesBased on the SUCRA value of the network analysis results in primary outcomes, we performed the biplots that combined the response rate with the disappearance time of fever and cough to find the best interventions with combined effect for influenza. The results showed that XYP + oseltamivir (combination response rate and disappearance time of fever: 0.58) and TRQ + oseltamivir (combination response rate and disappearance time of cough: 0.57) had the highest combined SUCRA effect (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S5).FIGURE 4 FIGURE 4.

SUCRA, the surface under the curve cumulative ranking.3.6 Other Outcomes3.6.1 Length of HospitalizationNine trials including 678 participants reported the length of hospitalization. Three TCMIs + oseltamivir has significant differences compared with oseltamivir (Supplementary Figure S5A): RDN + oseltamivir (MD = −1.6, 95% CrI: −3.1 to −0.014), TRQ + oseltamivir (MD = −1.6, 95% CrI: −2.8 to −0.25), and XYP + oseltamivir (MD = −2.0, 95% CrI: −3.1 to −0.89). There were no significant differences between these TCMIs + oseltamivir (Supplementary Table S6).3.6.2 Negative Time of Nucleic AcidFive trials including 557 participants reported a negative time of nucleic acid. YHN + oseltamivir (MD = −2.4, 95% CrI: −4.5 to −0.27) have significant differences compared with oseltamivir in Supplementary Figure S5B. There were no significant differences between involved TCMIs + oseltamivir (Supplementary Table S6).3.6.3 SafetyTen trials including 878 participants reported adverse events. Meta-analysis showed TRQ + oseltamivir in total adverse events with the wide 95%Crl for the unstable estimates. Therefore, compared with oseltamivir, there were no significant differences among involved interventions for total adverse events, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (Supplementary Figure S6). We summarized the detail information of safety in Supplementary Table S7 to supplement: XYP + oseltamivir (4 trials, 12 AEs), RDN + oseltamivir (1 trial, 3 AEs), TRQ + oseltamivir (1 trial, 2 AEs), YHN + oseltamivir (4 trial, 28 AEs), and oseltamivir (10 trial, 38 AEs). In all reported AEs, diarrhea was reported in XYP + oseltamivir and YHN + oseltamivir with higher incidence rate than in other interventions.3.7 Additional AnalysesWe performed the sensitivity analysis for populations based on children in this current study with sufficient data. In sensitivity analysis, the pooled results showed significant changes in the response rate (OR of TRQ + oseltamivir become 9.4) for including studies that focus on children and found no substantial change in other interventions (Supplementary Figure S7). Furthermore, we conducted the biplots of sensitivity analysis results to find the potential interventions with the highest combined SUCRA value: TRQ + oseltamivir with 0.71 in the combined response rate and disappearance time of cough, and YHN + oseltamivir with 0.55 in the combined response rate and disappearance time of fever (Supplementary Figure S8 and Supplementary Table S5).Network meta-regression for primary outcomes showed that regressors had no statistically significant effects in most interventions. However, we found some heterogeneity in TRQ + oseltamivir (the disappearance time of fever: course of treatment; disappearance time of cough: course of treatment and age). Supplementary Table S8 summarizes the results of meta-regression for details.3.8 Publication BiasWe conducted funnel plots using Begg’s and Egger’s tests to identify the potential publication bias in primary outcomes. The results of funnel plots showed that there were no significant asymmetry distributions in the disappearance time of fever and cough (Figure 5). We found some asymmetry distributions in the response rate (Egger: p = 0.0164).FIGURE 5 FIGURE 5. Funnel plots of primary outcomes. XYP, Xiyanping; RDN, Reduning; TRQ, Tanreqing; YHN, Yanhuning. (A) Response rate; (B) disappearance time of fever; (C) disappearance time of cough.4 Discussion4.1 Principal FindingsOur systematic review and network meta-analysis, including 31 trials with 2,893 participants, provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of various TCMIs + oseltamivir for influenza. In brief, low to very low certainty of evidence showed that XYP + oseltamivir, TRQ + oseltamivir, and YHN + oseltamivir probably appeared to be more effective than oseltamivir alone, after weighing the results of sensitivity analysis and meta-regression. Among them, results demonstrated potential therapeutic benefits of TRQ + oseltamivir for reducing cough, and XYP + oseltamivir and YHN + oseltamivir for improving fever in people with influenza, based on the interventions ranking with the SUCRA value and combined SUCRA value. We may have been unable to adequately assess the length of hospitalization and negative time of nucleic because of the evidence with insufficient included studies involving all interventions. Harms were still unclear, with no significant differences between TCMIs + oseltamivir over oseltamivir in the observed adverse events, while XYP + oseltamivir and YHN + oseltamivir may increase the risk of diarrhea due to a higher incidence rate than others. Taken together, these results in benefits and harms from our systematic review have some implications for TCM clinical practice in treating influenza.4.2 Relation and Comparison With Other StudiesTo our knowledge, this network meta-analysis compares the effectiveness and safety of various TCMIs + oseltamivir and oseltamivir alone for influenza first and in a comprehensive manner. Previously published systematic reviews of TCM for treating patients with influenza concluded that integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine probably had greater reduction in the time of fever and other symptoms over western medicine alone (Wang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016). This in turn could lead to uncertainty and imprecision about outcomes because of clinical heterogeneity in interventions between different TCM treatments (e.g., decoction, self-prescription, soup, powder, and mixed TCM treatments) in these systematic reviews. Therefore, we focused on TCMIs combined with oseltamivir vs. oseltamivir alone across more RCTs to resolve the heterogeneity from interventions in our systematic reviews. It is noteworthy that in the clinical practice guideline on treating influenza with Chinese patent medicines (Wu et al., 2020), there was a lack of evidence for TCMIs with oseltamivir for influenza. TRQ, as one of the common TCMIs, could be beneficial for reducing the flu symptoms as observed by a previous meta-analysis published in 2019 (Qu et al., 2020). As evidence about other TCMIs remained insufficient, we evaluated various TCMIs more comprehensively in this systematic review. Our findings based on absolute estimates of important clinical outcomes of various TCMIs were important and timely for influenza, and provided support for the treatment regimen to TCM guidelines.4.3 Policy ImplicationsFor patients who have influenza symptoms, the combined administration of TCMIs with oseltamivir may have beneficial treatment effects in fever and cough disappearance time. XYP could effectively inhibit the function of influenza virus hemagglutinin to block viral replication, and induce immune regulation through AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways (Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, multicomponent anti-influenza bioactive components in TRQ inhibited influenza virus replication in vivo by inhibiting hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza A virus to play a role in the anti-influenza effects (Zhu et al., 2018). Also, harms in rare and high risk cases may not be detected in this network meta-analysis. The potential risk of adverse events (e.g., diarrhea) that may be caused by TCMIs in our findings should not deter their clinical use for treating influenza. Our results can assist in clinical practice guidelines of TCM and update TCM treatment for influenza.Clinical physicians must carefully weigh the potential benefits and harms in the TCMI treatment progress, and weigh against influenza patients’ comorbidities and willingness to use TCMIs. Discussing the therapeutic regimen with patients considering and receiving TCMIs is of great importance during treatment. Furthermore, future research necessitates large numbers of participants and high evidence in TCMIs to facilitate the detection of the potential harms; it was also important for physicians and patients.4.4 Strengths and LimitationsOur systematic review focuses on updated TCM treatments for influenza and incorporates the best and latest evidence on various TCMIs combined with oseltamivir to facilitate and refine the current TCM guidelines. This network meta-analysis was conducted by a professional team of clinical physicians and methodological experts to ensure expertise in the overall review process. The strengths include a comprehensive search strategy with explicit eligibility criteria and adjudication of risk of bias by two investigators with uniform criteria. As all including TCMI interventions were compared with oseltamivir directly, estimates were not affected by transitivity and consistency. For potential clinical heterogeneity that may affect our results, to the best of our efforts, we conducted sensitivity analysis and multiple covariant meta-regression as additional analyses to diminish this concern. We also comprehensively evaluated the primary outcomes based on the combined SUCRA value to provide more strong evidence for our findings. Apart from TRQ + oseltamivir in the response rate, we did not find other interventions with significant changes among original analysis and sensitivity analysis, which present our results more robustness in most interventions. We also use funnel plots to evaluate the publication bias by two tests (Begg’s and Egger) in each comparison.Despite these strengths, our study had some limitations. The main limitations of methodological quality assessment in most of the included studies were the unclear risk of bias in domains of blinding and allocation sequence concealment. Although without geographical restrictions in the retrieval process, all eligible included studies in this systematic review were conducted in mainland China, reducing the generalizability of our results. In meta-regression, confounders (age and intervention time) may remain in this network meta-analysis and affect the stability of TRQ + oseltamivir results based on the unavoidable clinical heterogeneity. Moreover, various disease severities of influenza and different flu viruses were the important heterogeneity for our results, but we do not identify the adequate data from the primary literature to explore. The measurement methods of the effectiveness may be different among different studies, which may affect our results with potential biases. We also found less precise estimation in OR with a wide 95% CrI for TRQ + oseltamivir in the sensitivity analysis. Some asymmetry distributions were found in the funnel plot of the response rate. Insufficient data on the length of hospitalization and negative time of nucleic acid were reported in several eligible trials for full analysis, which means results might not be as robust for the clinic and require additional clinical studies on these outcomes.5 ConclusionsEvidence from this network meta-analysis showed that TCMIs + oseltamivir only partially improve symptoms in patients with influenza. Overall therapeutic efficacy and safety are inconclusive, based on low to very low certainty of evidence and no definitive evidence of safety, weighing the potential benefits and harms. Therefore, TCMIs should be used with great care in clinical practice and require further research for more high-quality evidence.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Author ContributionsYP and ZC are responsible for the study concept, study design, and writing of the first version of the manuscript.

Log out Cancel News > Medscape Medical News COVID Booster Plus Flu Shot Ups Reactions, but Most Are Mild Pam Harrison July 21, 2022 Simultaneous administration of a COVID-19 mRNA booster shot and the seasonal influenza vaccine slightly increased the risk of systemic reactions during the following week compared with a booster shot alone, but most of the reactions were mild, a retrospective cohort study shows. "Local injection site reactions, such as pain and redness, and systemic reactions, such as fever and muscle aches, are common reactions to many types of vaccines but are generally mild and resolve quickly," Anne Hause, PhD, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, told Medscape Medical News in an email. "So the CDC continues to recommend that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines, including the COVID-19 booster and flu vaccination at the same visit," added Hause, the lead author. The study was published online July 15 in JAMA Network Open. Dual Vaccination, Double Protection In an invited commentary, Kathyrn Hall, PhD, MPH, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues also argue in favor of concomitant administration of a COVID-19 booster and influenza vaccine. Coadministration could support uptake of both vaccines, they note, and it could augment protection against both infectious diseases. "Vaccine coadministration could also introduce efficiencies in currently overburdened health care settings," they write. Moreover, a 2021 phase 4 trial that evaluated the simultaneous administration of the Pfizer BioNTech and influenza vaccines raised no safety concerns. "Nationally, during the 2020 to 2021 season, influenza vaccination coverage was only 50.2%," Hall and colleagues point out. Thus, despite the slightly elevated risk of systemic events with dual vaccination, public health campaigns to increase dual vaccination should be undertaken, along with efforts to provide both vaccines in clinical and community-based settings, they write. "Given the small increase in rate of adverse events reported by Hause et al, health care systems should be encouraged to develop routine and streamlined processes for coadiministration of these vaccinations," they state. They also note that clinical trials have found reactogenicity to vaccination is not wholly attributable to the contents or the delivery of a vaccine but to so-called "nocebo" effects prompted by anxiety and expectation of adverse events on the part of recipients. V-Safe Study To probe the safety of simultaneous vaccination, Hause and her colleagues turned to v-safe, the large CDC vaccine surveillance self-report registry. Of nearly one million participants in the smartphone-based monitoring system, 92,023 received a seasonal influenza vaccine together with either the Pfizer BioNTech or the Moderna booster between September 2021 and May 2022. The booster was defined as the third dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine given at least 5 months after the second dose. In the week following dual vaccination, 58.9% of respondents who received the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 booster plus the flu shot and 68.6% of those who received the Moderna COVID-19 booster shot plus the flu shot reported mild to moderate reactions. The most common reactions were fatigue, headache, and myalgia, the authors note. After controlling for sex, age, and week of vaccination, respondents who simultaneously received the Pfizer BioNTech booster and the flu shot were found to have an 8% increased risk of having a systemic reaction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06 – 1.10), compared to those who received the mRNA booster alone. Those who received the Moderna booster shot had an 11% increased risk of having a systemic reaction (aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08 – 1.14), compared to those who received the booster alone. The slight increase in reactions to the paired vaccinations had little health impact with the Moderna booster and none with the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 booster, as measured by normal daily activities, an inability to work or attend school, or the need for medical care, telehealth, a clinic or emergency visit, or hospitalization. "Providers should offer their patients all age-appropriate recommended vaccines and counsel patients that some people experience reactions like fever, body aches or tiredness more frequently after receiving more than one vaccine," Hause told Medscape Medical News. "But [if they do develop] symptoms, symptoms can be managed with an antipyretic or analgesic medication," she added. Hause noted that the CDC does not recommend that patients take an antipyretic or analgesic medication prior to receiving a vaccine to prevent post-vaccination symptoms, largely because it's not certain whether these medications can affect the immune response to vaccination. "However, these medications may be taken after vaccination to treat symptoms," she said. She cautioned that aspirin is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. Hause and Hall have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Researchers stated that microbes can colonize on tooth surfaces forming intractable biofilms, causing severe dental caries. For oral diseases, the major source of pathogen transmission occurs through saliva droplets and aerosolized particles. Study: Debulking different Corona (SARS-COV-2 delta, omicron, OC43) and influenza (H1N1, H3N2) virus strains by plant viral trap proteins in chewing gums to decrease infection and transmission. Image Credit: Billion Photos/Shutterstock Background The causal organism of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), replicates predominantly in the salivary glands. This leads to a loss of taste and smell. Other viruses transmitted orally include influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV), Ebola virus, et cetera. Genomic mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 are responsible for prolonging the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this virus is transmitted through nasal and oral routes, oral transmission holds higher orders of magnitude than nasal transmission. Hence, researchers believe that lowering oral viral load could substantially reduce virus transmission. There is a need for a novel method to debulk pathogens present in the oral cavity, which could, in turn, reduce the transmission rate of the virus. Previous studies related to SARS-CoV-2 reported that mouth rinses do not significantly change the viral load in saliva. However, qPCR may detect non-viable viral particles in the saliva samples obtained after two hours of mouth rinse. A previous study reported that the expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the chloroplast could be utilized for treating individuals with pulmonary hypertension. Currently, this strategy is being evaluated in clinical trials to determine its effectiveness in treating COVID-19 patients. According to a previous study, CTB-ACE2 chewing gum can significantly debulk SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva or swab samples of COVID-19 patients. The plant lectin FRIL is a protein that can entrap viruses that express complex-type N-glycans on the outer envelope. Typically, enveloped viruses express a high level of complex N-linked glycans, mannose, and simple polysaccharides. Importantly, both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza (Flu) viruses express complex-type N-glycans on the outer envelope. A new study In a new study, scientists developed chewing gum tablets containing ground CTB-ACE2 lettuce plant powder or Lablab purpureus bean powder by the compression process, which preserved the efficacy of active ingredients. This study, available as pre-proof in Biomaterials, has explored the entrapment efficacy of CTB-ACE2 chewing gum against different strains of SARS-CoV-2. It optimized protein release kinetics from chewing gum to evaluate proteins in the oral cavity before starting clinical trials. Researchers used microbubbling (N-antigen) and RAPID (spike protein) assays in this study. They evaluated the effectiveness of the virus trap plant protein lectin (FRIL) against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. The neutralizing ability of FRIL was determined using a plaque reduction assay, and the entrapment mechanism was studied using electron micrography.

Hence, these drugs are less affordable and show low levels of compliance. Several studies have addressed these challenges and developed oral delivery systems for protein drugs. This method involves the encapsulation of protein drugs in plant cells, which effectively reduces the problems associated with storage and transportation. Findings Researchers reported that the plant materials used to prepare gum tablets showed no bacterial or fungal growth. Additionally, the moisture content of the clinical grade CTB-ACE2 lettuce powder (5.5%) met the requirement of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for orally delivered plant powder. Scientists reported that all four strains of Omicron variants were effectively debulked using CTB-ACE2 gum. The authors compared the doses between both plant-based anti-viral trap proteins and revealed that both CTB-ACE2 (0.46 µg dose) and FRIL (20 µg) showed significant debulking. It was observed that CTB-ACE2 chewing gum could effectively trap viral particles and reduce viral load in all test samples. The antiviral activity of purified FRIL protein and lablab bean powder was also examined against the Influenza H1N1, H3N2, and Coronavirus HCoV-OC43 via plaque reduction assays. Scientists observed that purified FRIL protein exhibited 50% inhibition against H1N1 and H3N2, at 95 ng and 96 ng, respectively. The current study reported that FRIL protein also inhibited OC43. A dose-dependent 50% plaque reduction was also observed using lablab bean powder and CTB-ACE2 chewing gum. Electron micrographs showed large, densely packed clumps of overlapping influenza particles and FRIL protein. Scientists performed chewing simulator studies and reported that CTB-ACE2 release was time/dose-dependent. The release of active ingredients was linear up to 20 minutes of chewing. Conclusion Currently, a phase I/II placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial is in progress to determine the effect of CTB-ACE2 gum in reducing viral load in saliva. Researchers stated that plant-based proteins present in gum exhibited incredible stability at high temperatures and enabled long-term storage at ambient temperatures. Hence, the new strategy of delivering viral trap proteins via chewing gum to reduce SARS-CoV-2 or influenza oral viral load could also be effectively used for other oral pathogens.

These noisy outcrops usually stink of bird poo. However, this year has been different. “Instead of the smell of guano, it’s the smell of death,” says Gwen Potter, a National Trust countryside manager working on the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland. “It’s completely horrendous.”This annual congregation of life has turned into a super-spreader event, as a highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1 – also known as bird flu – sweeps through populations of breeding birds, causing devastating losses. More than 300 outbreaks have been reported in UK seabird colonies, and dozens of coastal sites have closed to the public.The Farne Islands are home to 200,000 seabirds, including Arctic terns, Atlantic puffins, guillemots, kittiwakes and razorbills. Potter is one of many conservationists swapping binoculars for a hazmat suit, picking up the bodies of birds she has spent her career trying to protect. Birds will sit on the ground, unable to move, twisting into unnatural positions, before dying. It is happening with chicks, too, still gently trying to flap as they die. “It sweeps through, takes everything in its path. It doesn’t seem to spare anything, really … We’ve collected thousands of dead birds, and that’s the tip of the iceberg. It’s just the scale of it which is hard to grasp,” she says.Early observations suggest that how closely the birds nest is a key factor in how quickly the virus is transmitted. Guillemots nest quite densely, and kittiwakes are often next to them, which makes them vulnerable, although there is more space between them. Terns also nest densely and already 25% of the 350 sandwich terns on the Farne Islands are thought to have died, according to Potter. Some seabird chicks jump into the sea prematurely if their parents have died, while others starve in the nest.Most seabirds will fly away in the coming weeks once their chicks are raised, but the true impact on populations will not be known for a few years, with concerns that some may never recover. “I don’t want to contemplate that because it will make me cry,” says Potter.A slider showing an image of Bass Rock in Scotland in September 2020, almost completely covered with northern gannets and in June 2022 with only a few gannets.Avian flu has swept through the world’s largest northern gannet colony. Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, Scotland, is home to more than 150,000 breeding gannets each year. But stark images between September 2020 and June 2022 show the drastic change in the numbers nesting and caring for their young. The Scottish Seabird Centre has suspended all of its landing trips to Bass Rock to avoid causing disturbance to the colony.Britain has about 8 million seabirds, including 90% of the world’s Manx shearwater and about two-thirds of northern gannets and great skuas. Any impact on these populations is of global conservation significance. “Tens of thousands of birds must have died, maybe hundreds of thousands. It seems as though this breeding season will have been a disaster. Many will have died on remote islands, but the monitoring is nowhere near good enough,” says the ornithologist Mark Avery, who describes the deaths so far as an international disaster. “Already, it looks very serious and I fear this is just the start.”Seabirds are particularly vulnerable because they are typically long-lived animals that don’t reach breeding age until they are about five years old. They generally only have a few chicks, so populations take longer to recover. Nationally, the three species that are most at risk are the great skua, gannet and sandwich tern, according to Niall Burton, from the British Trust for Ornithology.We are talking about very long-term recovery. It’s something that is unprecedented, certainly in my lifetimeThe world population of great skua is about 16,000 and early research on the impact of the disease suggests that between 64% and 85% of the population at some sites has died, mainly in Shetland, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides. Burton says it will take several years for populations to recover but that it was too early to be more exact.The biggest population of gannets on the planet, at Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, in East Lothian, Scotland, has been badly impacted. Gannets nest in large colonies and there are few of them in the UK as a whole. Bird flu seems to be present in most of them, with a few exceptions in Ireland and Wales.Across the Channel, 10% of France’s total breeding population of sandwich terns is believed to have died in the space of a week, with high casualties also reported in the Netherlands. Coquet Island, off the Northumberland coast, is the UK’s only colony for breeding roseate terns, with about 150 breeding pairs. More than two-thirds of chicks have died.“We are talking about very long-term recovery. It’s something that is unprecedented, certainly in my lifetime,” says Burton.The story of this latest bird flu epidemic dates back to 1996 when the H5N1 strain was found in a population of commercial geese in Asia. In 2005, wild birds started dying en masse. The current wave of the H5N1 strain has resulted in more than 77 million domestic birds being culled. About 400,000 non-poultry birds – which includes wild birds – are reported to have died, which is double the number of deaths in the previous wave, in 2016-17.For the first half of this year, H5N1 was a problem for domestic poultry, leading all chickens to be shut inside between November last year and May, with the result that at one point it was impossible to get UK free-range eggs. Already there were reports of the disease’s impact on wild wintering populations, including the death of more than one-third of the Svalbard barnacle goose population on the Solway Firth (16,500 out of a total population of 43,000). There were reports of birds “falling from the sky in distress”.With the arrival of spring, the problem escalated. It is now considered to be the worst ever bird flu outbreak in the UK, noted for the large area it has affected but also high levels of chick mortality. Almost every country in Europe has had cases in the latest outbreak, as well as those in North America, west Africa and Asia.View image in fullscreenWildlife officials collect birds thought to have died of avian influenza at the Pong Dam reservoir lake, a popular spot for migratory bird watching, in Nagrota Surian, Kangra District, India, 5 January 2021. Photograph: Sanjay Baid/EPAFragmented bird populations are most at risk. There are about 8,000 Dalmatian pelicans left in the world, and more than 2,000 have already died from bird flu. “We are facing an event of mass extinction of animals. Entire populations are affected by this virus,” says Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority.Early observations suggest that about 50% of birds infected with the virus die from it, but Prof Diana Bell, a conservation biologist at the University of East Anglia, who studied the H5N1 strain back in 2007, says the figure is more like 100%. “Anything that gets infected is not going to survive, unless the H5N1 has attenuated in its virulence during that time, but I don’t think so,” she says.Geese, skuas, cranes and even foxes: avian flu takes growing toll on wildlife Read more“I look in horror at what it is doing to our birds … We just have to really hope there are a decent number that have survived, but I don’t think it’s because they’ve had it and they’ve recovered.” Bell’s research suggests it affects birds in most orders. Tigers have been fed infected poultry and died, she says, and there have recently been reports of seals dying from it in the US.In terms of how the virus will spread, Prof Paul Digard, the chair of virology at the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, says it is impossible to generalise from one species to another, so he doesn’t believe it will kill 100% of those it infects, partly because of intrinsic genetic differences, and partly because of factors such as stress, age and other traits in specific populations.He says H5N1 is causing a huge amount of damage because it is spreading among populations that have not had the virus before, but that this will change in the future because some will survive. “My guess is that things will calm down over time as populations gain immunity to this circulating strain of virus. I would hope not to see the same levels of mortality in the coming years, but that’s something of a guess,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe avian flu outbreak has now spread to many species, including this eider in Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. Photograph: Peter StronachThe main factors contributing to its spread are international trade, the farming and sale of birds, and the migration of wild birds, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Birds that have no symptoms could be super-spreaders because they can still fly long distances.However, Bell says she has never heard of an asymptomatic bird with the virus and therefore doesn’t think wild birds would be able to spread it over long distances. She believes the international poultry trade is the main driver of the virus and says stopping imports of chicks and birds for the trade would be an important step in reducing the risk of future outbreaks. “Originally, it was poultry to wild birds; it was not wild birds which were spreading it. It was frustrating to see wild birds being blamed … We’ve got to get out of our heads that the wild birds are the bad guys here,” she says.The public should keep their distance from any carcasses and report them to the government helpline. At the moment it does not appear to be infecting humans, but previous strains of the virus have. “If you see a sick bird, leave it be, I’m afraid,” says Digard. “Don’t take it to an animal shelter. You are potentially signing a death warrant for all the other birds in that shelter.”The most important thing would be better surveillance of the situation, says Potter, who believes there needs to be a government-led plan for all four UK countries, with guidance for effective carcass collection and testing, and better biosecurity on poultry farms. Seabirds have already been hit by a range of threats, including habitat loss, overfishing and climate change; their populations have halved since the 1980s. Reducing these other pressures would make them more resilient to bird flu.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “There are limited effective actions that can be taken to protect wild birds, as opposed to captive bird flocks. Due to the migratory habits of wild birds, it will only be with breeding season monitoring next year that the full impact will become apparent. However, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds, and clear public guidance has been issued not to handle their carcasses.” This article was amended on 3 & 5 August 2022 because an earlier version was wrong to say that St Abb’s Head, in Berwickshire, Scotland, has the biggest population of gannets on the planet, and that has been halved. The biggest population of gannets is at Bass Rock, off the coast of North Berwick, Scotland; that population has been badly impacted although specific figures have not been released. Also North Berwick is in East Lothian, not Berwickshire.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresExplore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionBirdsEuropeWildlifeNorthumberlandEnglandConservationfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(dcr)Deadly avian flu lands in Nova Scotia — Farm Focus Farm Focus subscribe headlines advertise contact Farm Focus subscribe/ headlines/ advertise/ contact/ Farm Focus Farm Focus March 2022 Farm Focus subscribe/ headlines/ advertise/ contact/ July 20, 2022 Deadly avian flu lands in Nova Scotia July 20, 2022/ RuralLife.ca by Emily LeesonAvian influenza has arrived in Nova Scotia. It was first confirmed in a Canada goose in the Grand Desert area of Halifax County. By Feb. 3, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed the presence of the virus in a commercial poultry barn in western Nova Scotia. Shortly thereafter, 12,000 turkeys were euthanized.“There are two additional locations, but they are not commercial farms,” said Lisa Bishop-Spencer, a spokeswoman with the Chicken Farmers of Canada, in mid-February.The virus can spread quickly from contact between wild birds and domesticated flocks.“It’s important to remember that the Atlantic region is under a known flyway for migratory birds, which is how the virus arrives in the region,” said Bishop-Spencer. “It is possible that more positive samples may be found as monitoring continues.”Avian influenza outbreaks pose a significant threat to the poultry industry. Signs of infection include a lack of energy, coordination, movement, and appetite, decreased egg production, coughing, gasping, sneezing, tremors, diarrhea, and sudden death. Generally classified into two main types (low pathogenic and highly pathogenic), different strains of the virus exist in different parts of the world. The strain confirmed in Nova Scotia this year, and earlier in Newfoundland when the virus was found at an exhibition farm on the Avalon Peninsula, is the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype. Highly pathogenic variations of the virus are extremely contagious and can cause as much as 100 percent of an infected flock to die.The virus has also been recently confirmed in Maine and New York. Avian influenza outbreaks occur most commonly in winter in the Northern Hemisphere, with peak activity occurring in February. HIGHLY INFECTIOUS“Avian influenza poses little risk to people, but the virus is highly infectious and potentially deadly in wild and domestic birds,” said Bob Petrie, a director with Nova Scotia’s natural resources department. “We urge the public to avoid feeding or handling wild birds like ducks, geese, pheasants, pigeons, and gulls to prevent disease spread.”Chickens, turkeys, quails, and guinea fowl are among the domesticated species at risk. The virus can move quickly through a flock. Feed and water access points can become contaminated as birds shed the virus through feces and respiratory secretions. With an ability to survive for long periods when temperatures are low, the virus can be spread further on farm equipment and from farm to farm. In Canada, the H5 and H7 subtypes of the avian influenza virus are federally reportable diseases – meaning that producers, veterinarians, and laboratories must notify the CFIA of all suspected or confirmed cases. The agency’s emergency response strategy currently includes the humane destruction of all infected and exposed animals, surveillance and tracing of potentially infected or exposed animals, strict quarantine, animal movement control, decontamination of infected premises, and zoning to define infected and disease-free areas. “Movement restrictions are placed on certain products leaving, going into, or moving within the control zone,” said Dr. Margaret McGeoghegan, a veterinarian with the CFIA’s Atlantic division based in Charlottetown.The control zone extends 10 kilometres out from any confirmed infection. “All trucks delivering items like feed and oil must be permitted to be in the area,” said Bishop-Spencer. “In addition, farmers in the zone have blocked access to their properties, and will heighten their biosecurity measures. For example, any truck requiring access to a farm property will have their tires and wheel wells washed and disinfected prior to getting onto the property and again upon leaving the property. Measures like this allow farmers to limit, as much as is possible, the spread of the virus.”Neighbouring farms with poultry also undergo ongoing testing for any spread. INDUSTRY IMPACTSWhile Health Canada confirms there’s no evidence to suggest that eating cooked poultry or eggs could transmit avian flu to humans and that all evidence to date indicates that thorough cooking will kill the virus, impacts on the industry are still evolving. After avian influenza was confirmed in Nova Scotia, a number of countries, including the U.S., placed varying restrictions on the importation of Canadian poultry products, especially from Nova Scotia. However, most Canadian poultry products are consumed domestically.“Because poultry and eggs are supply-managed commodities, the vast majority of the production is destined for the Canadian market, and what is exported tends to be the parts of the chicken, for example, that are consumed less in Canada, like dark meat,” said Bishop-Spencer.“In chicken, we export roughly eight percent of our total production,” she added. “Our primary destination for exports is the United States, which has limited the ban to the region affected, which is not a big contributor to exports overall. The impacts can indeed be significant to those who are involved in exports, but the domestic supply remains plentiful.”The CFIA currently suggests the following to protect backyard flocks: prevent contact with wild birds and other animals; keep premises clear of organic matter in which viruses, parasites, and bacteria could live; watch for signs of illness and report them early; limit exposure by visitors; and keep new birds separate from the established flock when first incorporating them.

Influenza has been overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains a major threat to global health. Improved vaccines that deploy innovative technologies will be welcome additions to our options for the control of influenza. In a novel application of targeted degradation published in Nature Biotechnology, Si et al1. describe the development of proteolysis-targeting chimeric (PROTAC) influenza vaccines. The PROTAC viruses target a selected viral protein to the ubiquitin–proteasome system, dramatically attenuating their replication while retaining their capacity to elicit robust and broad humoral, mucosal and cellular immunity. The authors demonstrate protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenge with influenza A virus in mice and ferrets. The concept of using PROTACs to attenuate live viruses for use as vaccines — not only against influenza but also against other viral diseases for which effective vaccines are lacking — is promising and warrants further investigation.Despite their clinical efficacy and widespread uptake, influenza vaccines have well-known limitations. Influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift — a gradual accumulation of point mutations due to error-prone replication; mutations in the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) can generate variants that evade immunity induced by prior infection or vaccination. Although influenza vaccines are re-formulated annually to account for antigenic drift, further antigenic drift during the 6- to 8-month period of vaccine manufacture can diminish their efficacy. Influenza viruses can also undergo antigenic shift — the introduction of a virus with a novel HA into the human population. Antigenic shift usually occurs through the exchange of gene segments between animal and/or human influenza viruses and can generate variants that cause pandemics.Current seasonal influenza vaccines induce strain-specific immunity and generally lack efficacy against variants that have undergone antigenic drift or shift. Improved vaccines that can elicit broader and more durable immunity are a public health priority, and many next-generation influenza vaccines are in development. These approaches use an array of innovative techniques to shorten production time, avoid deleterious mutations resulting from manufacture in hen’s eggs, or increase the breadth of protection.PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that induce the degradation of a protein of interest by targeting it to the ubiquitin–proteasome system2. They typically contain two covalently linked moieties, one specific to the protein of interest and the other to E3 ligase. Targeted protein degradation technology has been investigated primarily in the context of cancer3. It has also been applied as a promising antiviral approach against pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, to degrade viral or host-related proteins4,5,6,7. The targeting of a viral protein for degradation was first reported for the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X-protein, which is essential for HBV replication4. Later, development of a PROTAC targeting the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease5 was notable because this approach also overcame the problem of viral drug resistance that often emerges during conventional antiviral therapy targeting enzymatic activity. More recently, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2)-derived peptides were designed to promote proteasomal degradation of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting infection7.Si et al1. engineered a conditionally removable proteasome-targeting domain (PTD) onto the matrix gene segment of an influenza A virus (Fig. 1). The PTD contains the peptide ALAPYIP, recognized by the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), the substrate-recognition component of CRL2VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase. For vaccine manufacture, virus replication should not be attenuated. Therefore, the PTD includes a tobacco etch virus cleavage site linker, which is selectively cleaved by TEV protease, sparing the protein from degradation in cells that stably express TEV protease (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Overview of the PROTAC virus production system.PROTAC viruses are attenuated by proteasome-mediated targeted degradation of the ubiquitinated viral protein (M1–PTD) in conventional cells, resulting in deficient protein synthesis and attenuation of replication (left). The influenza nucleoprotein (NP), which is not fused to PTD, is not degraded. For vaccine manufacture, the PROTAC viruses replicate efficiently in cells engineered to express the TEV protease (TEVp), which cleaves the PTD (right). M1, matrix protein; Ub, ubiquitin; PTD, proteasome-targeting domain.Full size imageThe authors first show that the PTD directs the viral M1 protein to the host proteasome in conventional Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Fig. 1). They used a proteasome inhibitor and a VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitor to confirm that viral protein degradation and PROTAC virus attenuation were dependent on the proteasome and ubiquitin ligase. To quantify the attenuation, they measured the replication kinetics of the M1–PTD and wild-type viruses in conventional MDCK cells and in MDCK cells transduced to stably express TEV protease. As expected, the M1–PTD virus replicated efficiently only in cells expressing TEV protease (Fig. 1). In MDCK cells, replication competence decreased >20,000-fold relative to wild-type virus. Similarly impressive attenuation was observed in vivo in both BALB/c mice (10,000- to 50,000-fold versus wild-type) and ferrets (100- to 800-fold). Notably, M1-PTD was also genetically stable over more than 20 passages in the TEV-protease-expressing cells.The ubiquitous expression of VHL in most human tissues and cell types underpins the safety of potential PROTAC vaccines. Their ability to replicate stably and efficiently in MDCK cells, which are approved by the FDA for human vaccine production, is a bonus for this vaccine platform.PROTAC technology may offer unique advantages for the generation of broad and robust immune responses. Cellular immunity promotes viral clearance through cytotoxic T cell recognition of foreign peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on antigen-presenting cells. Viral epitopes presented on MHC class I are derived from proteasomal degradation of viral proteins. The level of ubiquitination of viral proteins correlates strongly with presentation of viral peptides on MHC8. Thus, the PROTAC approach may augment the presentation of viral epitopes on MHC and may promote enhanced T cell responses against the virus.Furthermore, similarly to the synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach based on codon-pair deoptimization9, PROTAC vaccines may induce superior protection against heterologous viruses because they incorporate a larger complement of gene segments from circulating wild-type viruses compared with the FluMist or M2-deleted single-replication influenza vaccine (M2SR)10, which incorporates several gene segments from a master donor strain.Further research is needed into any potential safety concerns of PROTAC vaccines. Mutations in human VHL result in several abnormalities, collectively called VHL disease11. The fact that VHL is a tumor-suppressor protein and that VHL loss is found in clear cell renal carcinomas12 has raised concerns about the use of VHL as a target for PROTACs. As the authors note, there may be individuals for whom the PROTAC approach or specific PROTAC viruses may not be suitable — for example, people receiving proteasome inhibitor therapy or those with defective expression of a specific E3 ligase. However, there are many different PTD–E3 ligase pairs and PTD–viral protein linkers that could be investigated: more than 600 E3 ligases have been identified in the human ubiquitin–proteasome system. Although personalized selection from a suite of E3 ligases would not be feasible for population-based vaccine production, there is scope to develop improved PROTAC vaccine candidates that are safe, efficacious and cost-effective.Implementation of a seasonal influenza vaccine strategy using PROTAC viruses would require the design and co-administration of four vaccines to protect against both circulating influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and B lineage viruses (Victoria and Yamagata). It may be prudent to target the same viral protein in the four viruses to reduce the risk that replicative competence would be restored through genetic complementation or reassortment. PROTAC vaccines would not face the problems of egg-adaptive mutations and introduction of glycosylation motifs that compromise the effectiveness of egg-based vaccines, and they could be manufactured more rapidly.Although Si et al. demonstrated their approach with influenza virus, it should be applicable to many other pathogens. A potential challenge for wider application relates to the structure of PTD–viral protein fusions. The authors evaluated PTDs linked to eight different influenza proteins (M1, PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M2, NEP and NS1) and found differences in the efficiency of cleavage that were related to protein structure. Although for all proteins the PTD allowed efficient proteolysis, the cleavage site linker was buried in seven out of the eight proteins, leading to low efficiency of cleavage required to prevent degradation during vaccine production. Choosing the best viral protein(s) to target and ensuring efficient cleavage are among the details to be investigated as the authors’ approach is extended to additional viral pathogens.

With the Spencer Fair running Sept. 2-5, many hoping to compete with their chickens would be sending in applications now, Helen Barnes from the Spencer Fair Association said."We made the decision because we have over 200 birds at the show," she said. "And people are getting ready now so we didn't want them sending in their applications and we'd have to return everything."Barnes said the state had initially put a stop to events where poultry from several locations were gathered up for shows. That order, which applied to "chickens, roosters, capons, hens, turkeys, pigeons, guinea fowl, and ducks and geese other than wild species,” expired July 1, but caution is being urged during fair season, thus the cancellation in Spencer.Fair officials are mulling how to use the large space occupied by the poultry show. An outdoor farmers market might be moved inside and there will still be some animals, like rabbits and pigeons, in that area.Shows canceled earlier over orderThe state's order forced the cancellation of shows earlier this year because the outbreak was believed to be quite serious."Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza is a highly contagious disease that affects both domestic and wild birds. This disease is deadly to many species of domestic birds and the spread of HPAI in domestic flocks may lead to interstate and international trade restrictions. Therefore, the prevention of the spread of the disease is of utmost importance to the residents and agricultural businesses located within the commonwealth," according to the order from the state Department of Agricultural Resources.While the matter sounds ominous, David Anderson, president of the New England Bantam Club, explained that most years, avian influenza is more like a common cold, more "lingering than devastating."But some years, it becomes highly pathogenic and is more serious.Still, he said, shows can go on safely.Some of the fairs he works with are changing to a display format so visitors can still see poultry but the birds will all be from a single farm. That decreases the chances of anything spreading between flocks, which Anderson believes is a low risk anyway.Risk to humans smallThe risk to humans is even smaller, he said.Avian influenza in humans is extremely rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With this year's outbreak, health officials have been vigilant about culling birds from flocks where the virus was found.That may have helped stop the spread, Anderson said, but oftentimes the science is needed to prove birds are infected. In some cases, flocks were depopulated because of sick birds that, it was later learned, did not have highly pathogenic avian influenza.Still, 4-H fairs and other agricultural fairs are also canceling poultry competitions altogether or changing their format this year, so it's best to check various fair websites to be sure poultry shows are on, if checking out chickens is high on a fairgoer's priority list.

IBV and AIV are a potential source of poultry mortality and economic losses. Furthermore, some pathogens have the ability to cause zoonotic diseases and impart human health problems. Antiviral treatments that are used often lead to virus resistance along with the problems of side effects, recurrence, and latency of viruses. Though target hosts are being vaccinated, the constant emergence and re-emergence of strains of these viruses cause disease outbreaks. The pharmaceutical industry is gradually focusing on plant extracts to develop novel herbal drugs to have proper antiviral capabilities. Natural therapeutic agents developed from herbs, essential oils (EO), and distillation processes deliver a rich source of amalgams to discover and produce new antiviral drugs. The mechanisms involved have elaborated how these natural therapeutics agents play a major role during virus entry and replication in the host and cause inhibition of viral pathogenesis. Nanotechnology is one of the advanced techniques that can be very useful in diagnosing and controlling infectious diseases in poultry. In general, this review covers the issue of the poultry industry situation, current infectious diseases, mainly IB and AI control measures and, in addition, the setup of novel therapeutics using plant extracts and the use of nanotechnology information that may help to control these diseases. Introduction Poultry production plays a vital role in food production and poverty alleviation in the absence of other nutrient-rich food items (1, 2). There are several important factors, such as poultry immunity, health, and production, which contest the future growth of the poultry industry (3). Globally, poultry diseases are continuously emerging to be the main subject in the poultry industry (4). Infectious bronchitis (IB), avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease, and Gumboro disease are considered the common poultry diseases globally (5, 6). Although abundant consideration has been paid to limiting infectious diseases to avoid losses, these diseases continue to emerge and re-emerge (7). Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), of the genus Gammacoronavirus, is one such kind of virus. In 1931, IBV was the first coronavirus identified in poultry and was considered a very vital pathogenic virus in livestock (8). At present, avian coronavirus IBV is a major economic pathogen of domestic poultry that causes mortality and significant losses in production regardless of vaccination (9). Many researchers have reported worldwide outbreaks caused by IBV in chickens and other birds that are characterized by high morbidity, mortality, and poor egg and meat production (10, 11). Currently, live attenuated vaccines are extensively used for the prevention and control of IB (12, 13). However, due to the higher diversity in viral genetic composition and the emergence of novel strains, the efficacy of vaccination is being greatly compromised (14). Avian influenza virus (AIV) is another very important virus that belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and causes huge losses to the global poultry industry (15, 16). This virus has an eight-segment negative, single-stranded RNA and encodes about 11 proteins (17). In addition, AIV is divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins that are present on the surface and are responsible for virus attachment and release, respectively (18, 19). The reassortment of HA and NA with different subtypes might consequence in disastrous pandemics as H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 in humans (20). Based on its pathogenicity, the virus is categorized into highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) (21, 22). The co-circulation of many subtypes of AIV, such as H5, H7, and H9, makes vaccination unsuccessful for production (23). Thus, it is very important to develop a vaccine that can be useful for multiple serotypes. Considering these factors, the risk of emergence of novel serotypes and infectious diseases into the human population and livestock increases (24). For instance, the occurrence of the highly pathogenic H7N9 AIV caused huge losses due to the intensification of the poultry production system. The increased density of poultry stocks and upsurges in populations lead to higher transmission between birds and humans (25). Additionally, the increased rate of evolution and pressure on the immune system limit the effect of vaccination (26). Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in feed has raised the issue of drug residues and ultimately pathogen resistance, so that the subtherapeutic use of antibiotics has been totally banned in European countries since January 2006 (27). Therefore, it is becoming very imperative to develop new strategies to control these types of diseases. For this purpose, consideration is being given to antiviral herbs that have no noticeable side effects on human and poultry health (28, 29). The influence of novel and alternative therapeutic agents on definite immune functions and a decrease in hazards might be very useful to counter viral infection (30). In the past, some derivatives and feed additives, i.e., plant extract, prebiotics, probiotics, enzymes, and yeast, have been reported to have immunomodulatory effects (31, 32). Their effects include improving metabolic status, decreasing physiological stress, inhibiting the expedition of cytokines by macrophages, and antimicrobial activity, thus enhancing immunity (33, 34). Antibodies (Abs) from mammals have been used for diagnostic and for therapeutic purposes against the invasion of pathogens (35), however, these Abs are obtained by invasive techniques. Thus, avian eggs have been considered for alternative production of Abs for therapeutic purposes against pathogen invasion (36, 37). Another important application, such as different nanomaterials that promote interactions between molecules and the virus, and enables researchers to construct a portable electroanalytical biosensing analyzer that effectively detects the virus (38, 39) along with the development of a nano-based viral vaccine. Generally, the development of first-generation vaccines has been produced by inactivation/killing or live attenuation of living organisms and second- and third-generation vaccines have been developed using RNA/DNA subunits (40, 41). Though subunit-based vaccines have many advantages, such as lower cost and the proficiency to produce an immune response against a specific pathogen as compared to conventionally developed vaccines (42), there are some disadvantages, such as poor immunogenicity, toxic effect, and are in vivo intrinsically instable along with multiple boosters. Hence, the development of a novel vaccine that can perform as an immunogen along with adjuvants to produce protection against the pathogen with enhanced immune response (43) and certainly nanotechnology is an advance technology that deals with the shortcomings of conventional vaccines. Genomic assortment and outbreaks of such infectious diseases can turn into an epidemic and cause a widespread adverse effect on the global trade of poultry products along with human health (20, 44). The development of novel antiviral treatment strategies to control IBV and AIV is urgently required as existing inimitable tasks concerning its control in commercial poultry farming. Therefore, in the present review, we discuss possible new strategies and plant derivatives along with the use of nanotechnology that might be helpful to better control IB and AI. Medicinal Plant Derivatives Against IBV Infection Research on plant-derived antiviral substances is inadequate in comparison with the search for antimicrobial properties. However, a number of investigations have publicized the positive role of plant extracts in relation to antiviral effect (Figure 1). Assessment of different plant extracts was conducted, and Thymus vulgaris, Mentha piperita, and Desmodium canadense showed an antiviral effect against IBV preinfection and postinfection (53). Hypericum perforatum L, which is also recognized as Saint John's Wort, has been well studied for its biochemical composition and pharmacological activities (54). The extracts of H. perforatum, such as hypericin (HY), quercetin, pseudohypericin, and quercitrin, were assessed as antiviral against IBV. It was proved that a reduction in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] via the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and upregulation of type I interferon via the MDA5 signaling pathway (55). Similarly, in another study, the natural compound of HY polycyclic quinone (56) has been proven to be antiviral against IBV infection in chicken embryonic kidney cells (CEK). IBV-infected CEK cells were treated with HY, and were found to upregulate anti-apoptosis genes such as Bcl-2 and to downregulate apoptosis-associated genes such as Caspase 3, Caspase 8, Bax and Fas, FasL, and JNK (57). The extract of Sambucus nigra was reported to have an inhibitory effect against IBV infection. When IB occurs at the early age of chicken,. nigra extract has shown inhibition of IBV infection in the early phase of disease infestation (58). Thus, it can be used for the inhibition of IBV and other CoVs. Garlic from the genus Allium of the family Amaryllidaceae was used as an antitherapeutic use in early times (59). The antiviral potential of garlic against IBV has been reported when exposed to various IBV strains and it showed an inhibitory effect (60). Allium (garlic) have been found to be a very effective therapeutic agent against corona viruses including COVID-19 as far as the immune system is concerned (61). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Plants in therapeutics to control infectious bronchitis (IB). (A) Thymus vulgaris (45). (B) Mentha piperita (46). (C) Desmodium canadense (47). (D) Hypericum perforatum (48). (E) Sambucus nigra (49). (F) Alium sativum (50). (G) Achyranthes aspera (51), and (H) Panicum antidotale (52). Similarly, the immune system of chicken against IBV has shown to be resistant during the supplementation of extract of sweet orange peel (62). Shahzad et al. (63) reported that various plants, such as Achyranthes aspera, Neuroda procumbens, Panicum antidotale, Ochthochloa compressa, and Suaeda fruticose, were very effective against all poultry viruses through their extracts, hence their use can be beneficial in future IBV infections. These plants extracts are useful in controlling the viral growth and have antiviral effect. The optimum antiviral activity and lowest viral growth were observed with the extracts of S. icolados and O. compressa, in terms of HA/HI as HA titer = 0 showed complete control over viral growth (64). The essential oils (EO) have been used for different viruses, such as dengue and herpesvirus, to assess virucidal activities (65, 66). Jackwood et al. (67) have carried out a research using two different hosts, i.e., Embryonated eggs (ECE) and Vero cells (E6). The EO designated as QR448a and botanical oleoresins in liquid emulsion was administered to the chicken infected with IBV. Following the aforementioned treatment, the clinical manifestation, pathological lesion, and RNA of IBV decreased, confirming the positive effect of EO and oleoresins. Use of Nanotechnology to Control IBV Nanotechnology is one of the inventive skills that have an inordinate possibility of uses along with a socio-economic prospective in the global poultry industry (68). The origin of nano is a word from the Latin “nanus” that mean a lesser, dwarf, or minute unit approximately 1 nm equals 10−9 m (69). Nanotechnology has developed the area of biomedical sciences, with a vast variety of NPs and capability in regard to diagnosis to therapeutics for viral infectious diseases (Figure 2) (70, 71). FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Different types of nanoparticles used in biomedicine for therapeutics of viral diseases. NP, Nanoparticles created with Biorender.com. The antiviral effects of G-Ag nanocomposites against IBV and Feline CoV (72) were investigated. Li et al. (73) have prepared a vaccine based on IBV-flagellin self-assembled protein nanoparticles (SAPNs) against IBV by incorporating spike protein as an adjuvant with the flagellin. IBV-challenged chicken with the aforementioned nano-vaccine showed a higher Ab response confirming its protective role. In another research, adjuvant-based nano-carriers of Quil-A and chitosan (QAC) having a size <100 nm were developed by Chandrasekar et al. (74). Furthermore, encapsulation with plasmid DNA (pQAC-N) vaccine and coding nucleocapsid (N) protein was done. When this vaccine was administered intranasally, improved immunogenicity and protection in terms of humoral and cellular immunity against IBV infection were observed. In addition, a decrease in viral load and reduced severity of clinical symptoms were observed. Polymeric carbonized nano-gels (CNGs) are also very effective in terms of IBV therapeutic agents as CNGs are very adsorbent on virus particles that may obstruct S1 and S2 glycoproteins to interact with host cells during infection. The development of CNGs is carried out at higher temperatures that possess a greater positive charge, which might cause the neutralization on the surface charge of IBV and weaken the pathogenicity of virus (75). Chou et al. (76) demonstrated the amalgamation of CNGs from lysine hydrochloride by a simple pyrolysis method, which resulted in the inhibition of virus against IBV. At a very lower concentration of 30 μg/ml, its efficiency was demonstrated by showing an inhibitory effect >98% in IBV-infected chicken embryos. Several uses of full NP based on magnetic and gold quantum dots (QDs) for virus detection and tracing have been described (77). Ahmed et al. (78) reported a novel method by linking anti-IBV Abs with QDs for the production of an immune-link of chiral-QDs as a chiro-immuno-sensor for IBV from blood samples of chicken. Furthermore, a self-assembled nanostructure was established for the limit need to be used for detection and 47.91 egg infection dose (EID)/50 ml, was quite efficient in examination of the target virus (79). Virus-like particles (VLPs) have been extensively studied and developed to transport a range of compounds, including medicines, peptides/proteins, RNA/DNA, Abs, and vaccines, for use as antigen nanocarriers and adjuvants to immune cells in an attempt to elicit a protective humoral immune response (80). Cell surface protein S that binds to the receptor can induce the body to produce an immune response (81). Chen et al. (82) have described a classic approach to the use of avian CoVs VLPs-based S protein using 100-nm gold np incubation with an optimized concentration of viral proteins (Figure 3). The aforementioned study resulted in the impulsive development of proteins with the induction of the assembly of virus-like nanostructures with viral antigens coating the fundamental particulate. Furthermore, it was concluded that the results of VLPs from the present study validate the successful preparation of synthetic VLPs (sVLPs) through NP, innate inclination to persuade protein coating (83, 84). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Schematic illustration of the preparation of synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) of avian corona virus. sVLPs were prepared from optimized mix enclosing spike (S) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and 100 nm gold nanoparticles through impulsive development of corona protein (72). Use of Virucidal Drugs Against IBV Infection Advanced studies in the molecular biology of viruses have highlighted many potential targets for antiviral drugs (85). The efficacy of virus activity limiting drugs, such as Argovit, Triviron, Ecocid, and lauric acid monoglycerides, has been tested in chickens by inoculation of the vaccine strain of IBV H120 against IB of chickens. These virucidal drugs were shown to possess potential virucidal activity in the small intestine against IBV (86). Traditional medicines, mainly from China, have been very effective against respiratory viruses (87). A combination effect of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), such as Shegandilong (SGDL) and doxycycline, was examined by Feng et al. (88) to prevent viral infection, and the outcomes indicated an increased level of tracheal immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, SGDL granule and doxycycline efficiently subdued the replication of IBV and inhibited the propagation of IBV tropism between the trachea and lung. Furthermore, they controlled the expression of mRNA of IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, and reduced histopathological lesions of respiratory organs such as trachea and lung. In other similar studies, based on the combination of glycyrrhizin diammonium (GD) and lithium chloride (LiCl) conducted by Li et al. (89), IBV was used to infect cells. The effect of the drugs to inhibit the virus was established by using CEK. Additionally, the apoptotic effect was positively associated with the cytopathic effect and might be repressed in effect of the drug treatment. The replication of IBV and the effect of LiCl were examined in two different cells types, i.e., Vero cells derived from African Green monkey kidney-epithelial cells and DF-1 cells derived from chicken embryo fibroblast cells. The concentration of viral RNA and proteins was reduced after the aforementioned cells lined were treated with LiCl (90). Amino acid derivatives are known for their antiviral ability against different poultry, animal, plant, and human viruses (91). The modification of amino acids with respect to antimicrobial peptides activities plays an important role in antiviral activities (92). The evaluation of antimicrobial peptides was carried out in terms of swine intestinal antimicrobial peptides (SIAMP) against IBV in chicken embryos. Pre-treatment of embryos with SIAMP and infected with IBV showed a remarkable reduction in mortality. Though the authors of this study did not present the characterization of the antiviral mechanism, they suggested that SIAMP might play a role during virus attachment to the cell surface, thus limiting IBV infection (93). Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is well known as an antiviral agent (94). In terms of IBV, recombinant chicken MBL showed antiviral activity during the direct interaction with virus particles that subsequently inhibited IBV infection (95). Thiazolidines are reported as antiviral inhibitors (96). The substitution of 2-aryl thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acids 1a-h was better antiviral than their N-acylated derivatives 2a and 3a, which would be promising antiviral agents against AIV H9N2 and IBV infections in the near future (97). Avian eggs can produce Abs that protect against pathogen entry by non-invasive techniques. Similarly, when Tsukamoto et al. (98) produced IgY (Ab) from ostrich eggs and used against IBV-infected chickens, infection was remarkably inhibited. Medicinal Plant Derivatives Against AIV Infection Novel anti-influenza therapeutic techniques are a prerequisite for its control in the present era, and these developments can be achieved through the search for new ways to modulate the viral mechanism and immune system (Figure 4) (105–107). Numerous herbal species with potential inhibitory effects on the replication of influenza viruses were frequently described using in vitro cell culture methods and embryonated eggs or in vivo mouse models (108, 109). Many phytochemicals of relatively low molecular weight, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenes, glucosides, and alkaloids extracted from different plants have been shown to be endowed with an antiviral activity against AIV (110, 111). In this regard, polyphenol-enriched extract of Rumex acetosa employs an inhibitory effect against AIV replication by weakening the attachment of viral particles to target cells (112). FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Plants in therapeutics to control avian infectious influenza. (A) Eugenia jambolana (99). (B) Ocimum sanctum (100). (C) Acacia Arabica (101). (D) Agrimonia pilosa (102). (E) cranberry (103), and (F) Ginseng (104). The antiviral effect of the water extract of Psoraleae semen (WPS) has an auspicious role of novel anti-influenza. Choi et al. (113) have conducted a comprehensive study using RAW 264.7 and MDCK cells to assess the inhibitory effect of virus using 100 μg/ml in WPS. It was proven that WPS served as an immunomodulator and inhibitor of influenza HA and NA. Furthermore, they suggested that WPS can be a substantial alternativee as an antiviral therapeutic agent due to the disruption of infection via type I IFN-mediated signaling pathway involving RAW 264.7 cells. Similar findings were reported in which the anti-influenza effects of WPS produce direct inhibition of HA and NA mediation. The predominant role of Psoralen and bakuchiol in influenza and herpes simplex viruses was reported in WPS antiviral activity against many (114, 115). Recently, bakuchiol was found to exert anti-influenza viral activity via the activation of erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (116). Oxidative stress tempted by infections of RNA virus may contribute to numerous features of viral disease pathogenicity including apoptosis, impairment of immune system, inflammation response, and body weight loss (117). One of these compounds, Yi-Zhi-Hao pellet (CYZH), is a known TCM that is used as an antiviral. Further, it induced the activation of Nrf2 and NF-κB, which subsequently upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Also, CYZH protected cells from oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen series. In conclusion, CYZH inhibits IAV replication in vitro, at least partly by activating the expression of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway (118). Considering multiple components in CYZH, the other relevant mechanisms of anti-IAV are still needed to be considered in future study. Activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway induces the expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative genes, such as HO-1, which is known to play a role in alleviating oxidative stress and tissue protection (119, 120). For example, previous studies have indicated that Nrf2 protect cells from the cytopathic effects of AIV, most likely by increasing the expression of antioxidant genes in human alveolar epithelial cells and modifies AIV entry and replication in nasal epithelial cells (121, 122). This mechanism further need to be studied in avian species in the future. Sood et al. (123) found that extracts of Eugenia jambolana had a 100% virucidal effect against HPAIV H5N1 in tissue culture and ECE in ovo inoculation. In another study (124), Ocimum sanctum and Acacia Arabica crude extract and terpenoid isolated from the leaves of O. sanctum and polyphenol from A. Arabica have shown promising antiviral properties against H9N2 virus, showing significant virucidal activity. Future investigations are necessary to formulate combinations of these compounds for a broader antiviral activity against H9N2 viruses and evaluate them in chickens. The extracts of these plants were used on tissues in ovo, however; further study is needed in avian species. The extract of Agrimonia pilosa also exhibited a virucidal effect at a concentration of 160–570 ng/ml against influenza A and B viruses when the viruses were treated with the extract prior to plaque assay (125). Luganini et al. (126) conducted research considering the direct action of cranberry extract against influenza virus and showed that the novel Oximacro of cranberry extract impedes two subtypes (A and B) of influenza viruses. During in vitro studies, they elaborated on the mechanism of Oximacro that prevented virus entry and attachment, leading to virucidal activities. In the past, the immune response, mainly humoral, in chickens during the inactivation of the vaccine for AIV has been induced by the addition of immunoadjuvants and extracts of plants in feed. Similarly, when the stems and leaves of Ginseng saponins were added to the drinking water, the humoral immune response increased to a significant level. In another such instance, serum Abs level enhancement was observed significantly when H. perforatum L. was administered orally and in the drinking water (127, 128). When the extract of ginseng after fermentation was administered to mice, the protection level against different subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9) of the influenza virus. Additionally, components of the adoptive immune system such as B cell, CD4, CD8, and major histocompatibility complex II were observed. However, detailed studies are needed in the future to explore the anti-influenza mechanism of ginseng in fermented form (129). The efficacy of Sargassum pallidum polysaccharides (SPP) as adjuvant in inactivated vaccines of NDV, AIV, and IBV in chickens was tested by Li et al. (130). In that study, the vaccines containing 10, 30, and 50 mg SPP/ml were compared with the traditional oil adjuvant vaccines. Serum Ab titers against the three viruses significantly increased at the dose 30 mg/ml. Moreover, the CD4 content and T lymphocyte multiplication were enhanced in all treated groups. Use of Nanotechnology to Control AIV The application of various nanomaterials endorses the interactions between the materials and the virus, enabling other researchers to build a biosensing analyzer that should work effectively based on the portable electroanalysis, and perform exact detection of influenza virus (131). The use of nano-based vaccines has many advantages that include higher storage time, and the encapsulation of vaccines in NP that are polymers in solid form might assist to stabilize at room temperature, consideration of an alternate route of administration, and enabling precise discharge. Nano-vaccines might release soluble antigens that induce both types of immunity, i.e., humoral and cellular (132). In a similar way, NPs based on a chitosan derivative are used to deliver an immune response when administered into mucosal sites of poultry (Figure 5). Furthermore, a decrease in morbidity, mortality, and viral load is observed in chickens infected with IBV and AIV (133). Magnetic beads are also considered as nano beads and are used to identify signals at amplifion along with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) apta sensors, the magnetic nano bead-amplified QCM immune-sensors have been used for the detection of the H5N1 protein (134). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) magnetic particles, and carbon-based materials are commonly used to analyze and identify the different subtypes of influenza viruses. The preparation of these particles is carried out based on the methodology already available in the literature (135, 136). Additionally, there are well-known techniques such as electrode-based well array, electrochemical quantitative systems, and on-chip nanomembrane tubular sensors of based on full integration (137, 138). Furthermore, mesoporous silica NPs performing functions with the amino group and naturally loaded with prodrugs of quercetin and shikimic acid discovered a novel antiviral nanoformulation that targets the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. They induced also strong immunomodulatory effects: they limited the production of cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO) by 50%. Furthermore, it played an extraordinary role in the critical carrageenan-induced rat model to induce the antiinflammatory influence carried in vivo (38, 139). Thus, nanotechnology through the use of a variety of NPs and in the form of nano-vaccines, nanobodies and nanomedicine, along with the use of adjuvants, has a remarkable future perspective in the field of biomedicine to control avian infectious diseases. FIGURE 5 Figure 5. Schematic illustration of the use of nanoparticles (chitosan) to deliver vaccine during IB and avian influenza to mucosal sites to induce immune response. The modified figure was redrawn with permission from Renu and Renukaradhya (133). Image created with Biorender.com. The control of IBV and AIV has faced many troubles due to several factors such as drug resistance, emergence of novel viral strains, and cross-species infections. Plant extracts can be a potential source to develop novel therapeutic medicine. The use of nanotechnology in terms of nano-vaccines, nanobodies, and nanomedicine might be very helpful to diagnose and control these poultry infectious diseases. In the future, the exact mechanism of action to counteract poultry infectious diseases caused by novel viral strains needs to be studied to develop control strategies.

(AP Photo: LM Otero, file)abc.net.auews/influenza-covid-risk-to-pregnant-women/101246872Link copiedShareShare articleWhen Alix fell ill with COVID, she cycled through the full gambit of symptoms: coughing throughout the night, soaring temperatures and unforgiving physical fatigue. But it was the thing she couldn't feel that really made her worry. Days into the infection and 34 weeks pregnant, she noticed her baby was uncharacteristically still. "I called the midwives and they said to come into the hospital and they did some fetal monitoring to make sure the baby is OK," she says. "It was in my mind that it's not just about me, it's about the baby."It was the second time in three weeks the Victorian mother had found herself at the hospital with a respiratory illness. The first was with a nasty bout of influenza which saw her hospitalised for four days with a "really high pulse rate". Women who test positive for COVID while pregnant have a higher risk of hospitalisation and ventilation than those who aren't pregnant and are also at greater risk of premature birth and stillbirth. It's a similar situation for the flu, which can be deadly for expectant mothers. And now, as COVID cases once again trend upwards with the arrival of new Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, and Australia braces for a bumper flu season, pregnant women have been left to decide whether to attempt to limit their contact with the outside world or risk contracting the virus.Alix was well aware of her increased vulnerability and had been trying to take precautions to limit her exposure to the disease. She has also received three COVID vaccine doses — she tested positive just before she became eligible for her fourth — which research shows significantly reduces the risk of severe disease and pregnancy complications."I managed to avoid COVID and the flu for the last few years, then, of course, at the very end of the pregnancy, I got it," she says. "Congestion and coughing all through the night, when I'm already uncomfortable, it's not fun."Alix's unborn baby thankfully appears to be healthy — but two weeks since testing positive for COVID, she still hasn't fully recovered.And with the birth approaching, she's desperately hoping her symptoms subside sooner rather than later.What we know about pregnancy and COVIDThe link between COVID, pregnancy and an increased risk of complications has been apparent since early in the pandemic. This includes higher rates of premature births and stillbirths in women who test positive while pregnant, as well as higher rates of hospitalisation and ventilation."All the sorts of bad things that you don't want to happen when you're pregnant can happen if you layer COVID on pregnancy in an unvaccinated population," says Professor Caroline Homer, a co-program director of maternal, child and adolescent health at the Burnet Institute.Professor Caroline Homer is urging pregnant women not to delay their COVID boosters. There are a number of reasons why this is the case. During pregnancy, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are already working overtime to provide for the fetus. Then, as the baby grows, the mother's lung capacity is further reduced as the fetus takes up more space in the body."You lose some of that lung expansion and you can't breathe in as much as you usually could," Professor Homer says. "So when you get COVID, and you get pneumonia or a lung infection, you're unable to clear it as easily when you're pregnant — particularly in that last third of pregnancy."When there's an inflammatory response in the body, say from COVID or other illnesses, the body can also respond by going into early labour. High temperatures in the mother, particularly in early pregnancy, have also been linked to abnormalities later on."If the mother's sick, the baby is sick as well, the baby's oxygen levels are completely dependent on that of the mothers," says Lisa Hui, an Associate Professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Melbourne."That's part of the reason why babies might need to be born prematurely; because they're being compromised due to maternal illness but also the mother might not be able to cope with her own illness and support the baby at the same time."Vaccination benefits the mother — and the unborn babyThe good news, according to Professor Homer, is vaccination goes a long way to reducing severe COVID symptoms in the mother — which then reduces the likelihood of harm to the unborn baby."Vaccination reduces all the risks hugely, it probably doesn't take everything away, but it makes an enormous difference," she says. "And it doesn't seem to have any adverse effects on the baby or the mother."A recent Victorian study, led by Associate Professor Hui, looked at data from 12 Melbourne maternity hospitals between July 2021 and March this year and found no increase in birth defects or fetal growth restrictions in vaccinated pregnant women.Doctors continue calls for pregnant women to get COVID vaccinePhoto shows A man and woman stand next to each other smiling, each are holding a newborn baby in their arms. New evidence indicates antibodies from COVID vaccines may be passed to children in utero.The study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, also found vaccinated women had significantly lower stillbirth and pre-term birth rates and a lower rate of catching COVID during pregnancy compared to their unvaccinated peers.Of women who caught COVID while pregnant, 2.3 per cent of vaccinated women had a preterm baby compared to 7 per cent of unvaccinated women, according to the report.Associate Professor Hui attributes some of the findings to the biological effects of the vaccine — that it reduces the risk of severe COVID disease which is associated with pre-term birth and stillbirth — but says "it's probably not the complete story"."We know that one of the biggest influences on whether a pregnant woman decides to have a vaccination during pregnancy or not is the quality of the relationship she has with her maternity care provider … so the women who didn't get vaccinated may actually be in a group that is less engaged with antenatal care or is maybe feeling marginalised," she says."The results of our study have two important messages: one is that it gives us, as health professionals in the community, confidence that vaccination during pregnancy is safe but it is also a message to the healthcare system that we need to try harder to look after women that haven't been vaccinated."A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week has also shown that the antibodies generated after vaccination during pregnancy can pass through the placenta to the baby, which results in a reduction of COVID hospitalisation in infants under six months old."That's a similar mechanism to what happens with influenza vaccination during pregnancy, it leads to a boost in the mother's own production of these antibodies, they cross the placenta, and the baby is born with protection," Associate Professor Hui says."We have the data now and it's all very reassuring; by getting vaccinated during pregnancy you protect the mother, you protect the unborn baby and you protect your newborn."The 'flurona' double threatAt the moment, Professor Homer says it's "pretty uncommon" for pregnant women to be hospitalised for COVID. But there's another viral disease going around that poses an equal danger — influenza. Alix was unlucky enough to catch both in short succession.Video convinces others to get vaccinatedPhoto shows A photo of a woman wearing a mask in a hospital bed. A mother of three who was 26 weeks pregnant feels grateful to be partly vaccinated when she contracted COVID-19 along with her husband and one of their children."It's been six weeks of being really unwell," she says. "I can't really do much at all, it's sort of ruining the last part of the pregnancy."The combination of the COVID pandemic and a bigger-than-usual flu season has experts worried about simultaneous infections of influenza and COVID — dubbed "flurona".A dose of this Frankenstein illness would be particularly dangerous for pregnant women, who are more at risk of death and severe illness from the flu.The annual influenza vaccine has been recommended for pregnant women for the last decade, and Professor Homer says it's particularly important this year as "we're seeing influenza in the community at very high levels".With people over 30 now able to access a fourth COVID vaccine dose, she also urges all pregnant people to take it up as soon as possible. "Pregnancy is not a reason to delay getting those booster doses," she says, "because we know that having boosters on board makes your symptoms a whole lot less".Vaccinated or not, pregnant women who catch COVID should seek advice from their midwife or doctor. In many hospitals, this will trigger a check-in system where the mother receives extra monitoring during their illness.Read more about COVID vaccines:There is talk about a fifth COVID vaccine, but how many should I already have and who is eligible?WA's uptake of latest COVID-19 booster lags as second-lowest in AustraliaRNA vaccines rose to prominence during COVID, but we've only scratched the surface of their potentialWith the increase in COVID and flu cases, Associate Professor Hui also recommends employing additional social distancing strategies and wearing a mask when this isn't possible.For Alix, the advice from her obstetrician has been to rest, drink lots of fluid, take Panadol for fevers and "just be patient". "My immune system is already suppressed being pregnant, then having flu and COVID on top of that, it's normal to be exhausted and for it to take time," she says.But, if at any point the baby stops moving, her heart rate goes up, or she starts to feel really unwell, it's back to the hospital."I feel like I've done what I can, there's not much more I can do other than rest," she says. "But preparing for the birth is a marathon in itself."Loading...Read our full coverage on COVID-19 hereLoading...Posted Wed 20 Jul 2022 at 7:00pmWednesday 20 Jul 2022 at 7:00pmWed 20 Jul 2022 at 7:00pm, updated Fri 17 May 2024 at 1:42amFriday 17 May 2024 at 1:42amFri 17 May 2024 at 1:42amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

Official advice allows the co-administering of COVID-19 and flu vaccines in Australia. There is slightly higher chance of an adverse response when COVID-19 booster vaccines are administered at the same time as influenza vaccination – but those reactions are mostly mild or moderate. That is the finding of a new peer-reviewed study published this month on the JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) Network. The study, supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was designed to assess the safety of administering COVID-19 booster shots and influenza vaccines at the same time. Authors say the safety profile of co-administering the vaccines separately ‘has not been well described’. The research was based on self-reported data from 981,099 people in the US aged 12 years and over, collected from 22 September 2021 until 1 May 2022. Participants submitted data voluntarily through v-safe app, a smartphone-based monitoring system that was set up by the CDC. The researchers found the simultaneous administration of an mRNA COVD-19 booster along with an influenza vaccine is associated with a ‘statistically significant’ increase in systemic reactions in the seven days following vaccination. When compared to the administration to a COVID-19 mRNA booster alone, the authors report an 8–11% greater chance of reactions. Both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were included in the study. The study found most reactions were reported as mild or moderate and were recorded most often on the day after vaccination. The most frequently cited reactions included fatigue, headache, and myalgia, with less than 1% of those who had co-administered vaccines reporting the need for medical care. Of the 22 respondents (0.02% of the total) recorded as receiving care at a hospital in the week following their vaccinations, 10 were ultimately reported as hospitalisations unrelated to vaccination or reported in error. As a proportion, more systemic reactions were reported following the co-administration of the Moderna booster. Of those who contributed data after a Pfizer booster and influenza vaccine, 36,144 (58.9%) reported a reaction. That figure stood at 68.6% for those who were co-administered the Moderna COVID-19 booster and an influenza vaccine. A similar trend was seen on the health impact category – described as people unable to perform normal daily activities, or who missed work or school, or received care from a medical professional – which was also tracked as part of the study. Such a response was reported among 11,658 respondents (19%) who received a Pfizer booster and influenza vaccine and 8210 respondents (27%) who simultaneously received a Moderna booster and an influenza vaccine. The researchers did not collect details on reactions after the flu vaccine alone but said ‘influenza vaccines in general are not particularly reactogenic’. They do note, however, that among adults aged 65 years or older, local reactions were more frequently reported following high-dose influenza vaccine than standard-dose vaccine. The authors say that due to the data being collected voluntarily, the results might not be applicable to the population in general. They also cite self-reporting as potentially open to misclassification, and note that the study did not include information on influenza vaccine type. The co-administration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines currently takes place in Australia, with the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) issuing advice in December last year on the matter. In a previous statement, ATAGI has acknowledged the limited existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of co-administering vaccines. ‘Providers need to balance the opportunistic need for co-administration with the benefits of giving the vaccines on separate visits,’ the advisory group states. ‘There is the potential for an increase in mild-to-moderate adverse events when more than one vaccine is given at the same time.’ Log in below to join the conversation.

Most of the seals were found dead.Also read: Dozens of dead seals found near Maine's coast, bird flu may be partially to blameNOAA gave the strandings, which have affected harbor and gray seals, the “unusual” designation on Friday. That authorizes a federal investigation to try to determine the cause and minimize deaths.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has already confirmed that samples from four stranded seals tested positive for avian flu, which has been found in more than 40 states since it was detected in winter 2021.The risk to the public from the occurrence of avian flu in seals is low, but beachgoers should take precautions anyway, NOAA representatives said.“We continue to ask the public not to touch ill, stranded or floating dead seals, to keep pets far away from seals, and to call their local stranding network organization to report live or dead stranded seals,” the agency said in a statement.Most strandings have happened in the southern and central coast of the state from Biddeford to Boothbay, NOAA said. Neither animal is listed under the Endangered Species Act, but both are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.Also read: High number of seal deaths linked to bird flu, feds sayThe avian flu outbreak has killed tens of million of chickens and turkeys on farms, and the virus is able to jump to mammals. It rarely affects humans.NOAA said it’s working with local, state, tribal, federal and international groups on its investigation. Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue agency, has reported responding to dozens of seal strandings since the beginning of June.Avian influenza has also been detected in dozens of species of wild birds as well as eight species of scavenging mammals, NOAA said. The virus is also affecting Canada, where it has been found in 11 provinces, the agency said.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...RACGP - Supply issues flagged as TGA provisionally approves Moderna for under-fives Home About Clinical Authors Most read this year GP Opinion Videos & Podcasts Professional Comments policy RACGP poll Menu Search for: Advertising newsGP > Clinical Matt Woodley 19 Jul 2022 News Supply issues flagged as TGA provisionally approves Moderna for under-fives Matt Woodley 19/07/2022 1:42:00 PM The Federal Health Minister has urged parents to delay booking COVID vaccine appointments for their very young children. The Moderna paediatric vaccine is in short supply globally. (Image: AAP) This article was updated at 4.40 pm on 19 July to include comments from the Federal Health Minister and infectious diseases paediatrician Professor Robert Booy. Federal Health Minister Mark Butler has warned the public that Moderna’s paediatric vaccine is in short supply globally, hours after it was provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in Australian children aged six months to five years. Despite receiving TGA approval, Minister Butler told reporters much still needs to be done before the vaccine becomes available for very young children, including an assessment by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). ‘I want to stress again that there is very limited supply of this Moderna product, which is a different product to [those] made available to other age cohorts,’ he said. ‘As you can imagine, there is fierce competition by countries in North America, Europe and other parts of the world to get their hands on this very limited supply. ‘My department is in active negotiations right now with Moderna for Australia to secure as many doses as we possibly can.’ TGA provisional approval is the ‘first step’ towards the use of a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia, and indicates that the regulator has judged that it meets high safety, quality and efficacy standards. The vaccine is the first to be approved for this age cohort in Australia, although it received a green light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month. In light of the global competition for supply, Minister Butler asked that parents delay booking in their very young children for a COVID vaccine until further notice. ‘There is no action yet that can be taken by parents … to make an appointment or otherwise,’ he said. ‘If I had a message to parents of children under the age of five today, it is to consider getting your child vaccinated for flu. ‘Our vaccination rates for influenza for under five-year-olds are lagging where they historically have been at this point in the flu season – lagging quite considerably.’ Minister Butler added that of the approximately 1300 Australians hospitalised due to influenza this flu season, more than 700 have been children under the age of 16. Professor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician who is also Head of the Clinical Research team at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, says the new vaccine is likely to be of most benefit for children who have multiple disabilities, chronic medical disorders, or immunodeficiency. ‘Having a new, safe product that can be given to children as young as six months is important,’ he said. ‘Very young children can also transmit infections they catch at daycare, to their vulnerable parents, to teachers, and to vulnerable grandparents. ‘Children who are otherwise well are unlikely to get severe COVID-19, but with vaccination, the risk goes down even more.’ Professor Booy also pointed out that safety reports from the US – where the new vaccine has already been used in hundreds of thousands of children – are ‘reassuring’. ‘The immune response from this vaccine in young kids is very similar to the immune response in older children, teenagers and young adults, even though the dose given is lower,’ he said. ‘The use of the Moderna vaccine for young children is likely to be both safe and effective, and implementation in Australia will contribute to better control of a disease that is proving elusive to manage.’ According to the TGA, Moderna’s paediatric vaccine is made in the same way as the vaccines for older people, but contains a lower concentration of the active ingredient: six months to less than five years – 25 mg in 0.25ml vial 6–11 years – 50 mg in 0.25ml vial 12 years and older – 100 mg in 0.5ml vial As with other age groups, the TGA indicated the vaccine will be administered as two doses at least 28 days apart. ‘As we have seen with children in older age groups, the TGA expects that vaccines for younger children will provide protection from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as hospitalisation and death,’ the release stated. ‘In making this regulatory decision, the TGA carefully considered data from the KidCOVE clinical trial, which was conducted at multiple sites throughout Canada and the United States and included over 6000 participants aged six months up to six years. ‘The study demonstrated that the immune response to the vaccine in children was similar to that seen in young adults [18–25 years] with a favourable safety profile.’ The TGA stated that most adverse events seen in clinical trials for this cohort were mild-to-moderate and generally reported after the second dose. Adverse events included irritability/crying, redness and/or swelling at injection site, fatigue, fever, muscle pain and axillary (groin) swelling or tenderness. Provisional approval of this vaccine in this age group is valid for two years and subject to certain strict conditions, such as the requirement for Moderna to continue providing information to the TGA on longer term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. ‘Australians can be confident that the TGA’s review process of this vaccine was rigorous and of the highest standard,’ the regulator stated. ‘The decision to provisionally approve the vaccine was also informed by expert advice from the Advisory Committee on Vaccines, an independent committee with expertise in scientific, medical and clinical fields including consumer representation. ‘The TGA will continue to actively monitor the safety of the vaccine in children and adults both in Australia and through collaboration with our overseas counterparts. If safety concerns are identified, we will take action and promptly provide information to the public.’ The TGA will publish the Australian Public Assessment Report relating to its provisional approval of the Moderna paediatric vaccine ‘in the coming days’. Pfizer also recently began the process of applying for approval to use its own COVID-19 vaccine among the youngest age cohort in Australia.

(ABC News)Data relating to hospitalisations for COVID-19, which is made available in the NSW Respiratory Surveillance Report, includes anyone admitted to hospital who has tested positive for the virus in the previous 14 days, regardless of why they were admitted.Flu hospitalisations, meanwhile, are defined in the report as "unplanned emergency department presentations for 'influenza-like illness' (ILI) requiring an admission". That means such patients have not necessarily been clinically diagnosed with the flu. (RMIT ABC Fact Check has previously explained that laboratory testing of suspected flu cases is reasonably uncommon.)Caveats aside, the hospitalisation figures for COVID-19 and the flu are vastly different.In the week to July 16, 806 people were admitted to NSW hospitals with COVID-19, including 77 admitted to ICUs. Those admissions brought the total number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 to 2,058.In comparison, 42 people were admitted for likely influenza. (No figure for flu cases in ICUs was available.)As for deaths, NSW recorded 142 COVID-19 fatalities in the week to July 16.State data on flu-related deaths was not available, though Australia-wide figures relating to the 2022 flu season showed that 113 deaths had been attributed to the flu as at July 3.The national report also notes a number of caveats with the data, and makes clear that "the number of influenza-associated deaths" recorded "does not represent the true mortality associated with" the disease.Of course, when it comes to COVID-19, it's worth remembering that there have been more than 8,000 deaths in Australia since January.A better measure of severity, however, is the case fatality rate of each disease, which is the percentage of cases resulting in death.According to Paul Glasziou, the director of the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare at Bond University, the case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the flu were "roughly comparable", though he noted such a comparison was problematic."The direct comparison is hard because of different detection rates of cases of each," he told CheckMate."We are probably detecting more of the COVID [from home RATs] than we are influenza, so that makes the influenza case fatality appear worse than it would be if most cases were detected."Professor Glasziou added that COVID-19 was a "much bigger issue because of the much higher infection rates"."The total of 113 influenza deaths this year is equal to about two days of current COVID deaths."Fact check: Flu vaccinePhoto shows person getting injection, claim is misleading red crossProfessor of Public Health at Bond University, Chris Del Mar, has called into question the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, saying that it only makes a tiny difference. RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.Professor David Henry, also of the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, added that some people had experienced second and third documented infections with COVID-19, which "crossed seasons in a way that flu generally doesn't".Additionally, Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute, told CheckMate it was important to take age into account when considering relative severity, with children more susceptible to severe flu symptoms and outcomes (including hospitalisation) when compared to COVID-19."As the ages increase, this is likely to be less so and, when the elderly are considered, then those over 70 appear to be faring much worse with COVID-19 compared to influenza."No, polar bear numbers haven't explodedShrinking sea ice remains a threat to the future of polar bears, experts agreed. (Supplied: Steven Amstrup, Polar Bears International)An internet meme produced by the conservative political group Turning Point USA has resurfaced on Australian social media, wrongly suggesting polar bears — long a symbol of the warming climate — have seen their numbers dramatically increase."When Al Gore was born there were 7,000 of us," reads the text, superimposed over a picture of a polar bear family. "Today only 30,000 remain."The meme sarcastically refers to former US vice-president Al Gore, whose 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth warned of melting polar ice caps due to climate change and the effect this was having on polar bears.It's not the first time the film has been derided, with Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart last year telling high-school students that its truthfulness was "short on delivery" because, for example, polar bear numbers "have increased".But as RMIT ABC Fact Check found, such claims don't check out.The problem is, the most robust counts of the species do not allow for historical comparisons of the total population.Instead, they provide estimates for 19 regional subpopulations — and for many of those, reliable figures for calculating trends are not available. In some cases, there are no estimates at all.Fact check: Polar bear numbersPhoto shows A screengrab of Gina Rinehart giving a speech with a small photo of her young self superimposed. Verdict: "doesn't check out"In a video made by Gina Rinehart to mark the 125th anniversary of her Perth alma mater, the mining magnate claimed polar bear numbers have increased. Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.So, what does the available data say?Over the long term, data from July 2021 showed two of the 19 subpopulations had "very likely" decreased while another had "likely" decreased. The other 16 did not have enough data to make a determination.Over the short term, four subpopulations were likely stable, two had likely increased and three had likely decreased, with the remaining 10 being data deficient.Experts told Fact Check that the data limitations made it difficult to say whether the total polar bear population had risen or fallen over time, but all agreed that shrinking sea ice was a threat to the species' future.Survey suggests short-term link between vaccines and periods, but no need for alarmResearchers noted that menstrual irregularities following vaccination were not unique to COVID-19 jabs. (ABC News: Margaret Burin)An analysis of a survey linking COVID-19 jabs with changes to menstrual cycles has been seized upon by anti-vaxxers and others opposed to vaccine mandates as vindication of their concerns."Reports of infertility, miscarriages and SIDS skyrocketing … and the MSM just quietly drops this," read one popular Telegram post, which linked to a news article about the survey."Another conspiracy-fact confirmed," far-right activist Avi Yemini tweeted.Earlier in the pandemic, CheckMate explained that there was insufficient data to draw a link between COVID-19 jabs and menstrual changes.So, what does the new evidence show?Conducted by academics at Washington University and the University of Illinois, the survey involved roughly 39,000 people who were double vaccinated.It found that 42 per cent of those with regular periods bled more heavily than usual after vaccination. Meanwhile, a number of others who did not typically menstruate reported breakthrough bleeding."​​Generally, changes to menstrual bleeding are not uncommon or dangerous, yet attention to these experiences is necessary to build trust in medicine," the researchers headed by Dr Kathryn Clancy wrote, adding that dismissal by medical experts had only fuelled community concerns and led some people to conflate "the possibility of short-term menstrual changes with long-term harms to fertility".However, they explained, the uterine reproductive system can cope with short-term stressors "in a way that leaves long-term fertility intact", with 40-plus years of research showing that while these "can and do influence periods", they "do not produce long-term effects".In addition, the researchers noted that menstrual irregularities following vaccination were not unique to COVID-19 jabs, and had also been associated with vaccination against typhoid, hepatitis B and HPV.Can the COVID jab affect menstruation?Photo shows Woman curled up with hands over abdomenSome women have reported short-term changes in their menstrual cycle following COVID vaccination, but drawing a connection between the two is far from straightforward.Peter Rogers, a professor of women's health research at the University of Melbourne, told CheckMate that, in his view, such changes were "not something [people] should worry about" since "relatively minor environmental impacts can and do alter the menstrual process".There were also several reasons why such changes were "unlikely" to indicate anything about fertility, he said, including that menstruation — which does not occur if an embryo successfully implants — was "not directly linked to fertility".Experts and health authorities continue to advise that the clinical evidence shows that vaccines do not affect fertility, as CheckMate explored last week.Anti-abortion fight resorts to twisting definitionsPro-life and pro-choice protesters outside the US Supreme Court in 2013. (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst)Debate in the US has continued to rage since the Supreme Court's ruling to rescind constitutional protections for women seeking an abortion, handing legal authority back to the states.Fact checkers are busy tackling claims on the topic, including one that a Texas state lawmaker had recently sought to allow the death penalty for women who underwent the procedure.That claim was deemed "mostly true" by PolitiFact, which found the substance — but not the timing — was correct: a Texas bill to punish abortion with the death penalty was proposed in 2021, prior to the Roe v Wade fallout, though it never made it out of the committee stage.More widespread have been claims that abortion is "never medically necessary".These have been debunked by multiple outlets, with AFP finding that such assertions hinge on a "distorted, inaccurate understanding of what abortion is".That, explains FactCheck.org, includes redefining abortion to include only those situations where the sole aim of the medical intervention is to "produce a dead baby" rather than to save the mother's life.Fact check: Queensland abortion lawsPhoto shows matt canavan's claim is baselessCoalition senator for Queensland Matt Canavan says that the State Government's proposed abortion laws would allow unrestricted access to abortion beyond 22 weeks. RMIT ABC Fact Check finds his claim to be baseless.Similarly, the head of a prominent US anti-abortion group recently sought to redefine the term by arguing that, in the case of a 10-year-old rape victim whose life could be at risk from carrying to term, it's "not an abortion".But that suggestion was flatly rejected by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which told PolitiFact that the definition of abortion was "not dependent on the reason for needing an abortion".Speaking to the various fact checkers, experts listed a host of circumstances under which terminating a pregnancy may be medically necessary, such as preeclampsia, ectopic pregnancy and cancer treatment, to name just a few.Edited by Ellen McCutchan and David CampbellGot a fact that needs checking?

Aikawa ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-7585-43481,2 Nature Reviews Rheumatology volume 18, pages 497–498 (2022)Cite this article 7092 Accesses 3 Citations 15 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Drug therapyImmunizationRheumatic diseases In patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease, methotrexate therapy has been associated with poor immune response to vaccines, including those intended to provide protection against COVID-19. Emerging evidence supports the practice of temporarily discontinuing this treatment in order to improve immunogenicity. Refers to Arumahandi de Silva, A. N. et al. Pausing methotrexate improves immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in elderly patients with rheumatic diseases. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 81, 881–888 (2022).Methotrexate is the anchor therapy for inflammatory joint symptoms in many diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is widely used both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, owing to its efficacy and adequate safety profile. However, methotrexate has been associated with poor humoral immune responses to many different vaccines, including those against SARS-CoV-2, in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases1,2. The short half-life of methotrexate and the rapid turnover of naive lymphocyte lineages provide a rationale for temporary discontinuation of this therapy near the time of vaccination as a strategy to enhance immunogenicity. In this context, Arumahandi de Silva et al.3 retrospectively evaluated the value of this approach for patients receiving mRNA and viral-vector vaccines, and corroborated findings previously reported for influenza vaccines4,5,6 and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccines7. In fact, robust antibody responses are generally induced in a short period (~14 days) after each vaccine dose3. The responses can be even faster and stronger with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection2. Credit: Alex Whitworth/Springer Nature LtdEvidence from a series of trials of influenza vaccination by Park et al.4,5 demonstrated that withdrawal of methotrexate for 2 weeks after a single dose of seasonal tetravalent vaccine was associated with enhanced humoral response in patients with RA, without worsening disease activity. However, the challenging scenario for COVID-19 vaccination includes the option of several different vaccines, most of which have a two-dose schedule, with an interval between doses that can vary from 2–4 weeks to 12 weeks. The first version of the ACR guidance for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases suggested a 1-week discontinuation of methotrexate after each dose of mRNA vaccine and a 2-week discontinuation period after the single‐dose viral-vector vaccine for those with well‐controlled disease8; by contrast, EULAR did not recommend any specific methotrexate-discontinuation strategy. In the German cohort studied by Arumahandi de Silva et al.3, methotrexate intake schedules around vaccinations were heterogeneous: 33 patients had maintained methotrexate therapy, and 31 had changed their intake in one of several different patterns, including withdrawal before and/or after vaccination.“methotrexate has been associated with poor humoral immune responses to many different vaccines”This retrospective analysis3 revealed that methotrexate withdrawal for at least 10 days after the first and/or second dose, but not before, improved the humoral response to vaccination, regardless of the type of vaccine used. This finding is similar to that reported by Park et al. for influenza vaccination4,5,6, which demonstrated that the timing of methotrexate interruption is crucial, with discontinuation of methotrexate before vaccination providing no improvement in immunogenicity, even with a pause of 4 weeks5; notably, the timing of the last dose of methotrexate before vaccination did not affect vaccine response6.Arumahandi de Silva et al.3 found that patients who discontinued methotrexate had higher titres of IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins, higher vaccine response rates as defined by positive levels of RBD IgG and of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies and higher virus-neutralizing capacity, in comparison with those who continued methotrexate therapy3. Both seropositivity for anti-RBD IgG and higher titres of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies have been associated with increased protection against COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases9. The ~33% increase in the frequency of vaccine response according to anti-RDB IgG positivity seen in the methotrexate discontinuation group was even greater than the reported 12–34% improvement in response to influenza vaccine4,5 and to the ~24% increase in IgG response to the inactivated anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine7. A ~21% higher response rate was also seen with methotrexate withdrawal when neutralization response was measured using a test that directly evaluates inhibition of RBD linkage. This finding contrasts with the modest and non-significant 13% improvement in response observed with the same strategy in patients receiving the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine7. The fact that mRNA vaccines were used in >85% of patients in the analysis by Arumahandi de Silva et al. probably accounts for this difference, since mRNA vaccines induce very specific anti-RDB antibodies at higher titres3.“methotrexate withdrawal for at least 10 days … improved the humoral response to vaccination”Age is well known to decrease vaccine immunogenicity, and this factor independently influenced vaccine response in all methotrexate-withdrawal trials, including the study by Arumahandi de Silva et al.3. Of note, in this study the benefit of pausing methotrexate was limited to elderly patients (≥60 years old); however, the patients aged younger than 60 years, who were underrepresented in the cohort, all responded very well to vaccination, precluding a definitive conclusion about the benefit of the methotrexate-holding strategy in the general adult population receiving COVID-19 vaccines. The results of the largest influenza vaccination study by Park et al., however, support the notion of an overall, age-nonspecific benefit of a methotrexate-holding strategy, as the mean age in the patient groups was approximately 53 years4.Although the use of DMARD combination therapy and glucocorticoids has also been associated with decreased response rates in larger COVID vaccine trials2, their use did not seem to hamper the beneficial effect of discontinuing methotrexate in the analysis by Arumahandi de Silva et al.3 and by Araujo et al.7. Regarding the use of glucocorticoids, methotrexate-holding studies3,4,5,7 have solely included patients receiving no or low doses of prednisolone, and in the cohort analysed by Arumahandi de Silva et al. ~80% of patients were not being treated with glucocorticoids3. The benefit of methotrexate withdrawal has also been observed regardless of methotrexate being used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. However, the biologic DMARDs that interfere profoundly with humoral vaccine response, rituximab and abatacept, were not represented in the study by Arumahandi de Silva et al.3 and were underrepresented in the other trials4,5,7.Regarding methotrexate dose, Park et al.4 suggested that methotrexate has a dose-dependent detrimental effect on the immune response to influenza vaccine, with the benefit of temporary interruption being apparent in patients receiving doses greater than 10 mg per week. The analysis by Arumahandi de Silva et al.3 included patients receiving methotrexate with mean doses similar to those in the trials by Park et al. (approximately 13 mg per week), whereas patients in the study of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine7 were receiving a slightly greater median dose (20 mg per week) and no patients received a dose lower than 10 mg per week. In both anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine papers3,7, methotrexate doses were comparable between the maintenance and withdrawal groups, and the dose did not impact the effect of methotrexate withdrawal.Although Arumahandi de Silva et al.3 did not study the safety of the methotrexate withdrawal strategy or its influence on disease activity, the results of influenza vaccination studies suggested that a 2-week withdrawal period does not affect control of RA disease activity4,5, whereas in the trial of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine the frequency of RA flares increased after the second period of methotrexate withdrawal7, probably owing to the short-term interval between the vaccine doses and therefore the withdrawal periods. This finding is consistent with data on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate in patients with RA, in whom a 3-week discontinuation of methotrexate would be required for concentrations of its metabolites in red blood cells to fall below the therapeutic threshold, and with the fact that RA disease flares frequently occur approximately 1 month after stopping methotrexate10.Overall, the results of the retrospective analysis by Arumahandi de Silva et al. are consistent with those from other trials and support the strategy of discontinuing methotrexate for 10–14 days after each dose of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with well-controlled and stable autoimmune rheumatic disease. This strategy, however, requires close surveillance of disease activity and shared decision-making. ReferencesHaberman, R. H. et al.

Dog owners are also being asked to be extra vigilant and keep their dogs away from them. Over recent weeks dozens of dead sea birds have been found along the Northumberland coastline – especially on beaches around Amble, Druridge, Newbiggin, Warkworth, Cresswell and Seaton Sluice. Testing carried out by DEFRA has confirmed that the cause of death is Avian influenza. This virus circulates naturally in wild birds and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe over the winter, they can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. The disease has also struck the sea bird colony on Coquet Island - home to four tern species, gulls and eider ducks - with devastating consequences. Elizabeth Morgan, Director of Public Health at Northumberland County Council said: “I want to reassure residents that the risk to public health from avian flu is very low. “The discovery of dead birds is always upsetting but it is really important that people do not pick up or touch any sick or dead birds to avoid spreading the virus, which can affect humans in rare cases. “As well as issuing an appeal for the public not to touch or move dead birds, I am also asking dog owners to keep their pets away from them.” While the risk to pet dogs from avian influenza is usually very low, dog walkers are also being asked to be extra cautious around wildfowl and are being advised to stick to footpaths and use leads where there are large numbers of birds in order to reduce their animal's exposure to creatures which could be infected. If a member of the public comes across a dead wild bird, they are asked to report it to DEFRA on 03459 335577 (select option 7). DEFRA will investigate and decide if they need to collect samples for recording, testing and analysis. Providing good location information for a dead or diseased bird is particularly important and location apps such as 'what3words' can be very helpful. If DEFRA indicate that they do not intend to collect any dead birds, contact the council’s customer services on 0345 600 6400. The council will arrange collection from public land or where appropriate, will inform the landowner to arrange removal of birds found on private land. Landowners should seek advice about their obligation to arrange compliant collection and disposal of dead birds affected by Avian Influenza as animal by product category 1 waste through a licenced livestock contractor.

From late 2019 into early 2020, up to 56 million cases of the flu were reported in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), with somewhere between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths. That's why the flu shot is recommended every year by doctors. Inoculation against influenza can prevent you from falling ill with the flu, reduce symptoms if you do catch it, and protect others through herd immunity, according to Bustle. But you might be wary of side effects of the shot, including the feeling of fatigue that some people report. According to experts, however, it's a normal reaction and, while bothersome, is nothing to fear. So please, don't let the possibility of feeling a little more tired than usual stop you from getting the flu shot when flu season rolls around. You'll probably only feel tired for a day or so PR Image Factory/Shutterstock Dr. Gustavo Ferrer of the Cleveland Clinic Florida Cough Center told Bustle that the tiredness some people feel is simply the body's defenses gearing up to protect you. "The symptoms are the result of the antibodies produced by our body in order to build up an immune response. In essence, a foreign substance (dead virus) ​entering our body that our defenses recognize and respond with fatigue, tiredness, low-grade fever, and lousiness," he said. Fatigue should pass within a day or so and should not be harmful. According to Dr. Ferrer, resting following the shot is key to fighting the feeling of tiredness. "This is the time to rest. Don't push through. You need time to restore your energy," he said. So, take a nap on the couch or curl up in bed and get some much sleep. You'll feel better soon enough. What else might you feel when you get the flu shot? Shutterstock Side effects from the flu shot can include things like soreness or redness at the site of injection, fever, headache, muscle aches, and nausea, according to the CDC. For most people, these pass within 24 to 48 hours and don't causes issues. Some people might feel dizzy or faint upon receiving the shot, which is usually a reaction to the injection itself. A few symptoms might be indicative of an allergic reaction, however, and should be taken seriously. These include problems breathing, wheezing or hoarseness, swelling near the eyes or lips, hives, weakness, paleness, dizziness, and a fast heart rate. If you notice any of these symptoms, call your doctor or, depending on the severity, 911. The flu shot is safe for pregnant women. People with a rare condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome are not advised to get the flu shot, along with anyone with a severe egg allergy. And if you're feeling ill or under the weather for any reason, postpone the shot until you feel better. Recommended
