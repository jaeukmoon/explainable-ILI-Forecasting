On March 29, 2023, the Ministry of Health in the South American nation of Chile reported that country’s first human case of infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. This was the second human case of H5N1 bird flu reported in South America. CDC Update The Ministry of Health in the South American nation of Chile has reported that country's first case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. This is the second human "H5N1 bird flu" virus infection reported in South America, the first was reported by Ecuador in December and was associated with exposure to backyard poultry. In February of this year, neighboring Peru reported H5N1 virus infections in sea lions and pelicans after die-offs in those animals. Globally, this is the 11th human case of H5N1 reported since January 2022. The prior 10 H5N1 cases all had exposure to poultry. The source of H5N1 virus infection for the patient in Chile is part of an ongoing investigation. A respiratory specimen from the Chile case-patient is being sent to CDC for confirmation and additional testing. In the U.S., one H5N1 case was reported in person who reported fatigue without any other symptoms after poultry culling activities. As of March 10, 2023, H5N1 viruses (clade 2.3.4.4b) have been detected in wild birds or poultry in 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the United States and Canada, and in most of the rest of the world. Detection of a human infection with H5N1 bird flu in another country in South America is not surprising. As noted in a recent CDC H5N1 technical report: "because of ...the wide global prevalence of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds and poultry outbreaks, continued sporadic human infections are anticipated." Further, the report notes that "To date, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses currently circulating in birds and poultry, with spillover to mammals, and those that have caused human infections do not have the ability to easily bind to receptors that predominate in the human upper respiratory tract. Therefore, the current risk to the public from HPAI A(H5N1) viruses remains low. However, continued comprehensive surveillance of these viruses in wild birds, poultry, mammals, and people worldwide, and frequent reassessments are critical to determine the public health risk, along with ongoing preparedness efforts." CDC is actively working on the H5 situation both internationally and domestically, including conducting surveillance in the U.S. among people with relevant exposures and preparing for the possibility that H5N1 viruses gain the ability to more easily spread to and between people.

That's the conclusion of Australian and Chinese scientists who analysed close to five decades of animal influenza records. Avian influenza H5N1 under an electron microscope [Credit: Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz] Their study, published in One Health, is the result of a partnership project between Fudan University and the University of Sydney, led by Chinese researchers and co-authored by Professor Michael Ward from the Sydney School of Veterinary Science. The team created a database of more than 70,000 records of animal influenza from 1970 to 2016, providing insights into the trends of these viruses over time and space. It gives public health authorities a framework to detect and track viral outbreaks in animals that threaten to emerge in human populations. “This generates a solid foundation for understanding how, when and where animal influenza viruses could evolve into pandemic agents,” Professor Ward said. “We are recovering from the coronavirus pandemic now, but a flu virus that flares up and takes hold in humans has the potential to dwarf the impact from COVID-19 given the high mortality rates caused by some animal viruses.” The researchers concluded that bird flu might be the source of a new pandemic strain. Birds are natural hosts of a huge range of avian influenza subtypes. This, say the authors, increases the likelihood that bird flu could become zoonotic, that is, transfer from animal to human. Professor Michael Ward “The issue is whether a mutation within a subtype is going to be the one that suddenly gives a certain influenza virus the power to transmit person to person,” Professor Ward said. “The first barrier is getting into mammals. It’s a big jump for a virus to go from birds into mammals, and then if it's transmitting quite well there's a greater chance it will jump into humans. “It's just a numbers game. Viruses jumping species is not a rare event, so it’s likely a virus will eventually make that final jump to humans.” Professor Ward said when two different influenza virus subtypes infect the same host cell, their genetic material can mix to create a new virus with the potential to trigger a pandemic. A bird virus that mutates in pigs before jumping to people, he continued, could create “a viral Armageddon and a confronting global health crisis”. An analysis of global events in the research found bird flu accounts for 79.6 percent of influenza in all animal hosts, followed by swine flu at 10.6 percent. “H5N1 (avian influenza) is the big one at the moment. It's been big for the last two decades, and it seems to have got its mojo and be powering along quite well,” Professor Ward said. H5N1 has infected almost 900 people since 2003 with a death rate just shy of 52.5 percent, according to the World Health Organization. Since January 2022 in the United States, outbreaks of a branch of H5N1 known as 2.3.4.4b have affected more than 58 million fowl, resulting in the deaths or culling of most. Testing poultry for avian influenza in Romania [Credit: Michael Ward] Professor Ward said Asia, North America and Europe have been the regions most likely to report new influenza subtypes. Sweden had the greatest diversity of subtypes, followed by the United States and China. The African continent, on the other hand, had no records in many countries, and data that exists showed a lower diversity of subtypes. Professor Ward said globally imperfect animal influenza surveillance and data sharing means health authorities are unprepared to detect new strains of influenza or the next viral pandemic. “One of the problems is implementing surveillance of animal viruses, it's always difficult to sample wild populations, particularly birds,” Professor Ward said. “The other side is domestic species, particularly poultry. If you report you've got viruses in your domestic poultry, there’s trade impacts, there's potential human health blowback, so countries are reluctant to put all that information out in the public domain. “There are big black holes in terms of influenza surveillance in places like South America and Africa. We just don't get many reports, so it's hard to know what's going on.” DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2023.100514 Declaration: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and a University of Sydney-Fudan University partnership award, and the National Key Research and Development Program of China.

Join us for this episode of Science on the Menu, in which our expert Francesca Baldinelli explains the state of play.Listen on:Spotify Apple Podcasts YouTube Music Transcript of the episode Intro (00:10):Science on the Menu, a podcast by the European Food Safety Authority.James (00:20):Hello, listeners, and thanks very much for joining us today on this latest episode of Science on the Menu EFSA's podcast. My name is James Ramsay, I'm the head of communications at EFSA, and today we're going to be talking about avian influenza. So avian influenza is a topic that's featured prominently in the media in recent days, and to talk us through what the virus is all about, and also the work that we are doing here at EFSA we are joined by one of our animal health experts, Francesca Baldinelli. Francesca, very warm welcome. Before we dive into things, maybe you could just tell us a bit about yourself.Francesca (00:57):Thank you very much for inviting me. I'm a vet, graduated in Italy. I'm Italian, and I'm an epidemiologist with a PhD in epidemiology and a postgraduate diploma in Animal Health. Before arriving to EFSA, I did several work in other institutes, and I will say that my main work was at the National Institute in Italy for public health, where I've been working for years on zoonotic diseases, so diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa. And then in the National Epidemiology Centre in Italy, still working again on zoonotic diseases. Then I arrived to EFSA and I thought I was working only on animal diseases, but of course, we are in a bigger framework, the one of One Health, so when we talk about human, about animal health issues, they can also develop as human health issues.James (01:57):Yeah. Okay. And maybe we come onto that in a bit. That's the concept of kind of One Health and, I presume, I mean, we are not working in isolation. We work with other EU agencies on these kinds of things.Francesca (02:09):Exactly.James (02:10):Yes. Okay. I presume you also have some experience working in the field as well.Francesca (02:14):Yes, I have it, not really as a normal vet, let's say, or what you can expect from a vet, because I've never been doing clinics or surgery, but I've been doing epidemiological work in the field working with, rodents, feral cats in islands isolated. But I should admit that, I mean, really ahead of thinking about the possibility of working i EFSA and with avian flu, I also had field experience with avian influenza.James (02:46):Okay. And in what sense?Francesca (02:48):Yeah. That’s because my husband is an ornithologist <laugh>. And I've been supporting him years ago, we are talking about 2007 and 2006, supporting him taking samples, swabs, ringing wild birds to be there later analyzed by the EURL for Avian flu.James (03:12):Let's talk a bit then about what avian influenza actually is. Can you just explain in kind of broad terms, you know, what the virus is about? Where it comes from, you know, how long we've been living with it, these kinds of things.Francesca (03:28):Yes. So first of all, avian influenza is a virus. I think we are all more familiar after the covid time with what a virus is. And the avian flu virus is really similar to the covid in the sense that it is a so-called RNA virus. So it's a virus that when multiplicated inside an host can mutate with a certain level of frequency, like the covid, when they are RNA, it is inside their behavior to mutate.James (03:58):So when we talk about avian flu, we are not necessarily talking about the same thing that we are seeing mentioned in the media today.Francesca (04:05):It's a huge universe. So we have one type of virus that can have different subtype according to the different protein, that can change. And then we have different strains. So it's really a very huge universe. And the virus evolves. And, we are seeing now viruses that emerged only two years ago or few years ago. And, of course what we see is always just a part of what is outside, because it's really depend on what we are monitoring and the type of surveillance we are doing to really monitor the evolution of the viruses.James (04:47):But I presume, hopefully, it goes without saying that, you know, the systems we have in place for monitoring and surveillance now are obviously much improved and continue to improve on a day-to-day basis almost, when it comes to the emergence of new viruses and these kinds of things. And EFSA has a role here as well.Francesca (05:06):Yes, yes. We have I will say a very good system to monitoring in the European Union the evolution of avian influenza viruses. It's a continuous collaboration among different institution in the Union. So EFSA, for the animal health side. Then we have the ECDC, from the human side.James (05:25):Yeah, this is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Francesca (05:28):Right, James. Yes. And then we also have the great collaboration from the Union Reference Laboratories for avian influenza located in Italy, which is analyzing the genetics of the viruses.James (05:41):So as I mentioned before, now that there's a lot of kind of public interest, media interest in this topic, and you could say, increased concern. But why do you think this has happened recently? What is it about avian influenza now, which makes us a bit more alert and, why are we talking about this now?Francesca (06:04):Since 2020, October 2020, we are observing and facing the biggest epidemic ever in Europe. So that's clear. That's indicated by the data we had in the last epidemiological here, more than 6,000 cases in birds, which is really very high number of detection of avian flu. We are talking about highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in birds. And this is raising concerns about the persistence of those viruses in Europe. So let me give you some background in relation to the expected expectation avian influenza, because it is considered a seasonal disease. So it appears in Europe in birds with the migratory birds coming from outside the union into the union to winter here. And they can bring the virus along their migration roads. Then during the winter, it is expected that the virus is transmitted between wild birds, but also from wild birds to the poultry. So the domestic birds we raise in the industry. And, when there is the migration back of those wild birds, mainly water birds from the union or from Europe toward outside in Asia for the breeding season, it usually disappears. It means that during the summer there are only few cases of avian flu detected and expected, or no cases at all, as it was in the past years. Whereas after October 2020, we have seen a continuous detection of cases also during the summer, something completely unexpected and new. And what is even newer is the fact that the virus was detected in wild bird species, which were never, very rarely, affected before.James (08:00):So these things combined, I guess starts to raise a little bit the attention of scientists, those working in public health, animal health, that something slightly different and unusual is going on here. So no longer can be considered seasonal in the same way that it was before. We see it present in new bird species. Okay.Francesca (08:23):Yes, and there are also other signs of unusual presence of the viruses because this very high environmental contamination led to the continuous detection of cases also into poultry, and also to the detection of the viruses is mammals.James (08:41):Okay.Francesca (08:42):Which are susceptible to highly pathogenic avian flu because this is, let's say a poultry or a birds disease, but it can be also transmitted to humans, and to mammals. And this is what we have been observing since November, let's say 2020. And the number of mammal cases, also, these species are a little bit increasing and also, let's say worrying a little bit because we cannot really predict what will happen in the future, but we know that these are very high environmental contamination concerns all of us.James (09:17):In fact, I read, I mean, it's been found in maybe in mammal species that you wouldn't expect at all. Like, I don't know, sea lions.Francesca (09:26):Yeah. So that's a very unusual situation that was found in Peru and Chile in the past weeks. And, I mean, when you find a mammal infected, it's because most probably it had eaten an infected bird. So, it is an isolate case, let's say, of a predator of a scavenging that has eaten a burst with the virus. But in this case, there were more than 600 sea lions dead. And, from the analysis, it is proven that it was the avian flu virus causing the death of those animals.James (10:06):So that would suggest that there's a kind of sea lion to sea lion transmission.Francesca (10:10):This is hypothesis, that cannot be proven, of course. But it is also very unusual to find in that case, 100 carcasses of sea lions floating altogether in one spot.James (10:27):Yeah.Francesca (10:27):It suggests between mammals transmission or acquisition of the virus from the environment.James (10:35):Okay, when the virus is present in bird populations, I mean, that's obviously a big issue. So what do we know about the risks to human health at the moment from this?Francesca (10:49):Yes. Of course, human to human transmission has not been observed up to now for this virus. And what I can say is that we work closely with ECDC and the EURL. And according to ECDC, the risk of transmission to humans, to the general population let's say, is still low, whereas the risk of transmission to occupational exposed people, so people working with birds in the farm, because of culling activities or other activities, is considered ranging from low to moderate. But there is really a high uncertainty related to the fact that the virus is continuously mutating.James (11:30):So important there to say, when we talk about human cases, we are talking there about humans who have got the virus directly from animals. We're not talking about humans passing the virus among themselves.Francesca (11:43):Exactly.James (11:43):There we say, still the risk, so animal to human transmission we say the risk is low for the general population, maybe increased a bit for people working who are exposed occupationally to working with birds. What are we doing either at EFSA or, among the scientists who are working on this at an EU level to prepare to get ready in case we arrive at this unfortunate situation where we have human to human transmission.Francesca (12:14):Yeah. That's a very interesting point. And this goes behind EFSA’s scope, but our ECDC colleagues are working on this, so they are preparing for this in the really unfortunate event of this will become true. But up to now, there have been no human to human transmission.James (12:35):So you mentioned that the risk of the general population is low. Iis there any risk to humans though exposure via food?Francesca (12:44):EFSA has estimated the risk of transmission by eating the poultry as negligible. So we should consider that poultry in Europe are under surveillance. They are tested in case of any signs. And, highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry is a very severe disease. So when it's there, most of the time you can see it, you detect it, and of course, those animals are not designated to the human consumption. We reinforce this message. So negligible risk of acquiring avian influenza virus by eating chicken, let's say.James (13:21):Okay. That's good to know. Just, just a bit more on what EFSA is doing. So, we have these quarterly reports that we produce on request of the European Commission, and that provides a kind of update on the status of the epidemiology, how the virus is developing, if you like, what we observe of the virus in the EU and, maybe outside as well. So, what did we find there?Francesca (13:48):Yeah, yeah. We have this mandate received from the Commission to give every three months an update of the situation. And this will serve the Commission, the Member States for taking any decision on how to face or control what is going on. And we received recently a request to give a more frequent update starting from now, and also to issue a new report not foreseen. So the main changes are that since December up to beginning of March, we are observing unexpected number of cases in one specific wild bird categories, in gulls.James (14:28):Okay.Francesca (14:28):So gulls were never, I mean, not never, but very rarely affected before December, and now most of the cases in the wild birds are concentrated in this bird category.James (14:41):Okay. Does that raise a specific concern or it's just an observation that we make, that avian influenza can be found in new bird species.Francesca (14:52):It's an observation. It happened in the past that new wild bird species were maintaining and spreading around the virus, now it's the turn of the gulls. And of course, then we need to consider the ecology of these species because they are, let's call them, urban species. They are frequently within the city in contact with us, so we will need to consider a different kind of exposure. And according to where they will migrate from now onward, they might bring with them the viruses.James (15:28):Okay. So we are working with the ECDC, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, on these regular reports. And this gives an overview of the situation, as you said, as far as avian influenza is concerned, do we produce recommendations as well?Francesca (15:44):Sure. We produce recommendation every three months, and from different perspectives. Let's say that the main, for example, in relation to the poultry are of course to increase the surveillance in poultry to early detect any cases, and to react immediately to stop the epidemic, to stop the spread. Then if I think about possible cases in wild birds for the general the population, the main recommendation is of course not to touch any dead or sick wild bird you could find. This has to be done if you are well protected with personal protective equipment.James (16:26):What about the situation with vaccinations? There was an announcement recently the European Commission announced the rules to harmonise the use of vaccines in the Member States. Are we involved at all in any work on vaccines?Francesca (16:44):Yes. We are involved in it and the Commission harmonised the rules across the Member States, according to the international rules for vaccinating against highly pathogenic avian influenza, so following the WOAH standard, which is the World Animal Health Organisation. At the same time, the Commission has also mandated EFSA to assess possible vaccination strategies in poultry and possible surveillance strategies in vaccinated poultry in the Union. And we are working on it.James (17:19):Okay. And when's that due?Francesca (17:22):After summer, the first part about vaccination strategies and available vaccines that could be used against avian flu and next year March, we will deliver a second part of this work, focusing mainly on surveillance.James (17:39):Good. Well, Francesca, thank you very much. I think you've given us really a very comprehensive view, but explain very clearly about the avian influenza, the work we're doing, what it means for Europe and, what we should be looking out for in the future as far as EFSA's work is concerned, and the work of our partner agencies in European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. And, maybe we can get you back on the podcast in the future at some point to update us again in case the situation changes.Francesca (18:14):Sure.

Naguib1 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 13, Article number: 4476 (2023) Cite this article 2370 Accesses 20 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Influenza virusPathogensVirology AbstractExchange of viral segments between one or more influenza virus subtypes can contribute to a shift in virulence and adaptation to new hosts. Among several influenza subtypes, H9N2 is widely circulating in poultry populations worldwide and has the ability to infect humans. Here, we studied the reassortant compatibility between chicken H9N2 with N1–N9 gene segments of wild bird origin, either with an intact or truncated stalk. Naturally occurring amino acid deletions in the NA stalk of the influenza virus can lead to increased virulence in both mallard ducks and chickens. Our findings show extended genetic compatibility between chicken H9Nx gene segments and the wild-bird NA with and without 20 amino acid stalk deletion. Replication kinetics in avian, mammalian and human cell lines revealed that parental chH9N2 and rH9N6 viruses with intact NA-stalk replicated significantly better in avian DF1 cells compared to human A549 cells. After introducing a stalk deletion, an enhanced preference for replication in mammalian and human cell lines could be observed for rH9N2Δ(H6), rH9N6Δ and rH9N9Δ compared to the parental chH9N2 virus. This highlights the potential emergence of novel viruses with variable phenotypic traits, warranting the continuous monitoring of H9N2 and co-circulating subtypes in avian hosts.

Poultry-adapted viruses can occasionally transmit to humans1,2,3. IAVs belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family with genetic material composed of segmented negative-sense RNA. The segmented genome allows for direct gene exchange between two or more IAVs co-infecting the same host cell, a mechanism termed reassortment, resulting in the emergence of novel subtypes4,5,6. The influenza virion contains eight gene segments that encode at least 10 proteins7 where the external domains of the two major surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are used for subtyping different IAVs. There are 18 HA and 11 NA types described to date, whereas 16 HA and 9 NA are found in the avian population4,8; thus, theoretically, there are 144 possible HA–NA combinations. Over 100 out of these combinations have been reported to date, indicating extensive reassortment among different HA and NA genes. However, some subtypes are rarely found in nature, suggesting that some factors restrain particular HA–NA combinations4,9. Due to this genetic flexibility, IAVs are highly adaptable, able to transmit among a variety of host species and evade host immune responses10,11. Consequently, during this past century, four new IAVs causing global pandemics have emerged through reassortment11,12.Since the late 1990s, low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) of the H9N2 subtype has become one of the most widely detected AIV subtypes in poultry, posing a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. In particular, this has affected countries in South East Asia and the Middle East13. Poultry-adapted H9N2 have been shown to preferentially bind human-like sialic acid receptors, while H9N2 viruses circulating in wild-bird species need prior adaptation in order to bind human sialic acid moieties efficiently14,15,16. However, recently H9N2 isolates derived from wild birds in China also displayed increased receptor affinity for human-like receptors17. Indeed, H9N2 has shown evidence of zoonotic transmission, predominantly causing mild upper respiratory tract infections in humans18. To date, reported human cases caused by the LPAIV H9N2 have been limited to the G1 and Y280 lineages, and no human-to-human transmission has been reported5,16,19. The H9N2 subtype tends to undergo extensive reassortment with co-circulating AIVs, including highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5Nx and H7Nx, as well as LPAIV H10N85. Donation of internal genes from H9N2 has been verified in H5N1 and H7N9 viruses involved in several human cases of severe respiratory tract infections, some of which had lethal outcomes20,21,22,23. Recently, a core gene pool of the H9N2 internal genes has been defined which is suggested to act as a template for reassortment, revealing a strong association between reassortment events, geographical area and specific mutations24. Since its emergence, HPAIV H5N1 has acquired a NA-stalk deletion associated with increased virulence in avian hosts, such as mallards and chickens25,26, as well as mice27,28. In the course of transmission of AIVs from wild bird host species to domestic poultry, NA-stalk deletions have been associated with the early stages of this host transition. As of now, a variety of NA-stalk deletions of various lengths have been found in all classical NA subtypes29,30.In this study, we used reverse genetics with the aim to assess the reassortment compatibility of the chicken-adapted H9N2 influenza virus A/Chicken/Egypt/S12568C/2016(H9N2) of the G1 lineage with NAs representing all 9 NA types (N1–N9) known to circulate in the wild bird population. In addition, we investigated whether a deletion of 20 amino acids (aa) in the NA stalk, commonly found in highly pathogenic influenza A/H5N1 viruses, affects this compatibility. Finally, we explored the replication kinetics of successfully rescued recombinant viruses on avian (DF-1), mammalian (MDCK-II), and human (A549) cell lines. ResultsH9N2 is strongly overrepresented compared to other H9Nx combinationsTo obtain a brief overview of the natural occurrence of various HA–NA combinations in IAVs from avian, mammalian and human hosts, all HA and NA sequences from these sources submitted to GISAID were collected and analyzed. The summarized sequence data in Table 1 demonstrate that combinations of HA and NA are not randomly distributed. Instead, certain HA/NA combinations were heavily overrepresented, whereas others were rare. The H9Nx combinations from all analyzed sequences revealed a significantly higher occurrence of N2 compared to other neuraminidases (97%, 14007/14255). Likewise, H9 isolated from domesticated birds were almost always found in combination with N2 (99%, 10789/10826). Focusing solely on the H9 isolates derived from humans, H9 was exclusively found in combination with N2 (100%, 86/86). In wild birds, H9 occurred in combination with several different NA, but the most common combination was H9N2 (92%; 1785/1936) in this group as well. There are likely many underlying factors behind the successful spread of H9N2 in poultry populations31. However, the fact that this was the most common combination also in wild birds prompted us to investigate whether genetic incompatibility between segments might be a cause of the overrepresentation of N2 in combination with H9.Table 1 GISAID submitted HA and NA sequences from avian, mammalian and human hosts. Sequence data were accessed in Nov 2022.Full size tableNA cluster exclusively based on their subtypeEarlier studies on the phylogenetic relationship between the NA types N1–N9 suggest that the NA genes form two distinct groups where group 1 contains N1, N4, N5 and N8, while group 2 contains N2, N3, N6, N7 and N932. To confirm that the phylogenetic relationship between the different NA genes used in this study (including the NA segments used in the rescued reassortants) follows the same pattern, an extended phylogenetic analysis based on NA sequences of AIV subtypes from wild birds and poultry was performed (Fig. 1). The analysis showed the same phylogenetic clustering into two groups with the same internal relation between the NA segments. The phylogeny solely followed the NA classification since all N1–N9 clustered together independent of host and origin of isolation.Figure 1 HYPERLINK "sps:id::fig1||locator::gr1||MediaObject::0" RAxML midpoint tree based on wild bird and poultry-adapted Neuraminidase sequences (N1–N9). The scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site, and branch labels show the bootstrap value in percentage. Virus isolates used in this study are highlighted in bold.Full size imageNeuraminidase types N1–N9 from AIV of wild-bird origin exhibit genetic compatibility with poultry-adapted virus backboneA possible explanation for the varying occurrence of the different HA/NA combinations shown in Table 1, particularly the extreme overrepresentation of H9N2 in poultry populations (99% of all combinations), could be that there is a genetic incompatibility between other NA segments and the H9 backbone virus, either in terms of physical incompatibility related to segment packaging during particle formation or functional incompatibility related to replication kinetics in the host cells. To study this in more detail, we generated recombinant viruses using the eight-plasmid reverse genetics system with the genetic backbone (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NS and M genes) from the poultry-adapted chH9N2 and NA gene segments from AIV of wild-bird origin representing all 9 NA types. All recombinant viruses rH9Nx (Table 2), including intact NA or short-stalk NA, were successfully rescued, indicating genetic compatibility between the poultry-adapted virus backbone and NA genes derived from wild-bird AIVs.Table 2 List of generated recombinant rH9Nx viruses with and without stalk deletion. Letters m = mallard and g = black-headed gull denotes the host origin. All recombinant viruses have a gene backbone derived from the chH9N2 (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NS and M) together with a wild bird derived NA-gene.Full size tableThe rH9N2(H6), rH9N4, rH9N5, rH9N7 and rH9N8 viruses replicate significantly better in human A549 cells compared to the parental chH9N2To study potential differences in replication kinetics after the introduction of NA segments from AIV of wild bird origin in the parental chH9N2 backbone, avian (DF-1), mammalian (MDCK-II) and human (A549) cell lines were infected with the chH9N2 and the generated recombinant viruses. Most of the viruses were able to establish infection in all three cell lines, with varying efficiencies (Fig. 2). The parental chH9N2 demonstrates significantly higher replication in DF-1 cells compared to A549, which is well in accordance with the fact that chH9N2 is poultry-adapted. Recombinant reassortants rH9N1, rH9N2(H9) and H9N9 did not efficiently replicate in DF-1 cells and replicated at a significantly lower rate compared to the parental chH9N2 (Table 3). In contrast, at early timepoints, rH9N4, rH9N6 and rH9N7 showed significantly higher replication in the avian DF-1 cells compared to chH9N2. Recombinant reassortants rH9N1, rH9N2(H9), rH9N3 did not efficiently replicate in A549 cells (Fig. 2). Additionally, rH9N6 replicated significantly less efficient in both A549 and MDCK-II (Fig. 2, Table 3, Suppl. Table 6). In the A549 cells, rH9N2(H6), rH9N4, rH9N5, rH9N7 and rH9N8 displayed significantly better replication efficiency compared to the parental chH9N2 (Fig. 2, Table 3). When comparing the replication efficiencies of the rH9Nx viruses in DF-1 and A549 cells, most of the viruses replicate significantly better in DF-1 cells (Suppl. Table 3). These results suggest that introducing the different NA (N1–N9) segments into the poultry-adapted H9N2 virus backbone significantly impacts replication kinetics of the recombinant viruses, resulting in either increased or reduced replication efficiency depending on NA segment and cell line. In some cases, the reassortant viruses displayed increased preference for replication in human cells.Figure 2Replication efficiency of the rH9Nx reassortants with intact neuraminidase stalks in DF-1 (orange) and A549 (blue).

The replication kinetics of the viruses with NA-stalk deletions were similar to that observed for the viruses with an intact NA-stalk, albeit with generally reduced replication in all cell lines (Fig. 3). However, rH9N5Δ, rH9N6Δ, rH9N8Δ and H9N9Δ displayed significantly better replication in A549 cells compared to chH9N2. The rH9N4Δ instead, displayed a significant replication increase in DF-1 cells at early timepoints (8 h and 24 h) compared to chH9N2 (Table 4). When comparing the replication of the rH9Nx with 20 aa stalk deletions in DF-1 and A549 cells, for the majority of viruses, a significantly better replication in DF-1 cells could be observed (Suppl. Table 4). In MDCK-11 cells, rH9N2Δ(H6) and rH9N6Δ and rH9N9Δ displayed increased replication compared to their homologous counterparts with intact NA stalks, although a significant difference was only observed for rH9N6Δ (Suppl. Table 7). Additionally, rH9N6Δ and rH9N9Δ displayed increased replication in A549 cells compared to their homologs with intact NA-genes (Suppl. Table 5). This was also the case for rH9N9Δ in DF-1 cells.Figure 3Replication efficiency of the rH9Nx reassortants with a 20 aa neuraminidase stalk deletion in DF-1 (orange) and A549 (blue).

Underlined p-values indicate significantly lower TCID50 at a given timepoint. Non-significant comparisons are denoted ‘ns’.Full size tableNA stalk deletion increases NA-activity in rH9N1Δ, rH9N3Δ and rH9N4Δ The functional balance between the HA and NA glycoproteins has repeatedly been reported to be crucial for viral entry and establishment of infection33. The NA cleavage activities were assessed for all recombinant reassortants to investigate how this factor relates to the observed replication kinetics of the viruses (Fig. 4). The NA-activities were significantly reduced in all the reassortants with intact NA compared to the parental chH9N2, except for rH9N4, which also had a decreased activity, although not significant (Suppl. Table 8). Similarly, the NA-activities of the stalk-deletion reassortants were generally reduced compared to the chH9N2, except for the rH9N1Δ, rH9N3Δ and rH9N4Δ where the activities instead increased. Comparing the NA activities between recombinant reassortants with intact NA stalks to their homologous counterparts with stalk-deletions revealed that the stalk deletion increased the NA activity significantly (at higher HAU) in rH9N1Δ, rH9N2(H6)Δ, rH9N3Δ, rH9N6Δ, and rH9N7Δ. In contrast, the stalk deletions reduces the NA activity of rH9N2(H9)Δ, rH9N5Δ, and rH9N8Δ (Suppl. Table 9). Although we observed differences in NA activities between the recombinant reassortants, there were no obvious correlation between NA-activity and replication kinetics in our experimental setting.Figure 4NA activity of the rH9Nx reassortants with and without a 20 aminoacid stalk deletion. Graph demonstrates the Relative Luminescence Unit at given HAU titers. Errorbars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM).Full size imageDiscussionReassortment events play an essential role in the diversity of AIVs through the genetic exchange between co-circulating viruses of different subtypes34. Since the 1990s, the LPAIV subtype H9N2 has spread throughout the world’s poultry populations and has been found in an increasing number of countries. Frequently recorded reassortment events between H9N2 and other co-circulating AIV subtypes necessitate further research on potential restrictions for reassortment of this AIV subtype. Four main factors contributing to genetic incompatibility between different viral subtypes have been suggested to restrict the genesis of reassortants: (1) incompatibility between packaging signals of gene segments from various IAV strains, (2) segment mismatch referring to incompatible protein–protein interactions, (3) transcriptioneplication incompatibility between the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and viral gene segments, or (4) inhibitory effects of one IAV subtype on another35,36. In addition to these mechanisms, virus-extrinsic spatiotemporal factors also play a role in restricting reassortment between co-infecting viruses37. Altogether, the factors dictating efficient reassortment are likely more complex and extend beyond the mentioned mechanisms; thus, conditions favoring efficient reassortment remain to be elucidated. Considering the wide spread of H9N2 in poultry species, we investigated the genetic compatibility between chicken H9N2 and wild bird-derived AIV neuraminidases (N1–N9) with and without a 20 aa deletion in the stalk region of the NAs.By using a reverse genetics system, rH9Nx reassortants with NA gene segments representing all neuraminidase types (N1–N9) found in the AIV gene pool could be successfully rescued. This is in agreement with the outcome of our in silico analysis (Table 1), which demonstrated previous records of naturally occurring combinations, including H9N1–H9N9 subtypes, although the occurrence of any other subtype than H9N2 was very low, especially in poultry species. Our findings indicate genetic compatibility between the parental chH9N2 and NAs from all other AIV subtypes of wild bird origin, implying that genetic or physical incompatibility with other NA segments in the influenza A virion is not the restricting factor resulting in the overrepresentation of H9N2 in poultry. Both HA and NA demonstrate hypervariability in their aa sequences and within a subtype, up to 20% aa sequence diversity has been observed7,38. Hence, the NA diversity needs to be taken into consideration. In this study, we used only one wild-bird-derived AIV NA segment as representative of each NA type in the reassortment experiments, except for N2 where two different segments were used. It is possible that not all NA segments of every NA type is compatible with the chH9N2 backbone and future studies with a wider diversity within each NA type might reveal such differences. On the other hand, the fact that all tested NA segments generated successfully resuscitated virus particles suggest a broad “tolerance” to genetically distant NA segments within this backbone. Adaptation to poultry species and other hosts can be another factor limiting the spread of the other H9Nx subtypes. Therefore, we have assessed the impact of NA exchange on the replication kinetics in different cell lines harboring different structures of sialic acid receptors, including a chicken cell line (DF-1) expressing the avian-like receptor (α2,3 SA)39,40, a human cell line (A549) and another mammalian cell line (MDCK-II) that both harbor human-like receptors (α2,6 SA) as well as the avian-like receptor41,42. The replication kinetics results of the intact NA-reassortants indicated replication capacity in all three cell lines, with a significantly higher replication in DF-1 cells compared to A549. Notably, rH9N1, rH9N2(H9), rH9N3, rH9N8 and rH9N9 demonstrated higher replication in MDCK-II cells at 72 h post-infection compared to DF-1 and A549.As demonstrated by several groups, the length of the NA-stalk affects the biological characteristics of influenza viruses; truncated NAs are widespread among AIVs and associated with increased virulence in chickens43,44,45. Thus, we assessed the genetic compatibility and virus replication kinetics of the N1–N9 reassortants after introducing a 20 aa deletion in the NA stalk region. Genetic compatibility was not impacted by the NA-stalk deletion considering reassortants with all NA subtypes (N1–N9) were successfully rescued. The majority of the reassortants with a stalk deletion displayed increased replication in both MDCK-II and A549 compared to DF-1, although with a lower replication rate compared to the intact NA-reassortants. Interestingly, rH9N2Δ(H6), rH9N6Δ and rH9N9Δ viruses showed an increased replication in MDCK-II and A549 compared to their homologous counterparts with an intact NA-gene. Collectively, our replication kinetics observations imply that changing NA has no significant impact on establishing infection in either DF-1, MDCK-II, or A549. However, a truncated NA-stalk appears beneficial in terms of replication kinetics in mammalian cells.The HA and NA have opposite functions and thus have to work cooperatively to facilitate movement on cell surfaces and ultimately efficient attachment and viral entry. A suboptimal NA activity in relation to the activity of HA, may obstruct or aggravate the ability of the virus to infect a cell33,46. In this study we assessed the NA-activity for rH9Nx reassortants with and without stalk deletion. Although significant differences were observed in NA activities between the recombinant reassortants, these differences did not show any consistent correlation to the replication kinetics of the viruses. We have not studied if and how the introduction of new NA segments into the chH9N2 backbone virus affect the relative abundance of HA and NA molecules in the virus envelope. Hence, the effect on replication kinetics after introduction of a NA segment with a different NA activity compared to the parental virus, might have been masked by an altered relative abundance of HA and NA in the reassortant virus.The NA-stalk region varies considerably between subtypes and NA-stalk deletions is commonly found in different avian influenza viruses29,30,47. Studies have shown that NA-stalk deletion can have varying effects on AIVs48,49,50,51, however, stalk deletions are commonly associated with adaptation to poultry species30,43,49. In our study, all recombinant viruses with NA stalk deletion were successfully rescued indicating that the 20 amino acid deletion is not detrimental to virus rescue and replication. All recombinants, with stalk deletion, generated in the study had significant lower or similar replication in DF1 cells at 48 h and 72 h post infection (Table 4). This correlates with what was previously published by Arai et al., where they showed that 21 amino acid stalk deletion is associated with increased growth in human cell line compared to a reduction in replication kinetics in chicken cell line46. Our and previous findings show that the effects of NA-stalk deletions in avian viruses are complex and depend on a variety of factors.In conclusion, remarkable genetic compatibility was found between the chicken H9N2 backbone and N1–N9 from AIV of wild bird origin where the NA stalk length did not have any impact. However, reassortant viruses with truncated NA-stalk revealed increased replication kinetics in mammalian cell lines. These findings provide insights into the potential emergence of H9Nx viruses in nature and how they behave in different cell hosts, which calls for continuous monitoring of reassortant events at the domestic-to-wild-bird interface. Further studies of infection efficiency and replication kinetics of these viruses in chickens are needed to better estimate the role of the different NA segments in vivo.Materials and methodsIn silico analysisTo investigate the natural occurrences of the HA and NA gene combinations in AIVs reported among avian species (16 HA and 9 NA) with an emphasis on H9, all available influenza sequences from fully sequenced HA and NA genes on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database were retrieved (accessed: 1st of November 2022) and summarized in Table 1. HA–NA combinations not found on GISAID were cross-checked on the Influenza Virus Database to ensure complete coverage of all available influenza sequences. Additionally, a phylogenetic analysis of N1–N9 sequences from wild birds and poultry hosts was performed. Briefly, NA sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database and aligned using MAFFT (MAFFT online service, https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). In Geneious Prime v.2022.1.1 phylogenetic tree was generated using the RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood v8.2.11) plug-in using nucleotide model GTR GAMMA. Finally, the phylogenetic tree was visualized using FigTree version 1.4.4 (http:/ree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).VirusesTen LPAIV viruses resembling all AIV NAs (N1–N9) circulating in wild birds, including two N2 genes from mallard H9N2 and H6N2 (Supplementary Table 1), were obtained from Jonas Waldenstöm (Linneaus University, Sweden) and used in this study. Viruses were initially isolated from wild birds at the Ottenby Bird Observatory (Öland, 56.19765; 16.39939, Sweden). In addition, the G1-like lineage chicken LPAIV H9N2 influenza virus A/Chicken/Egypt/S12568C/2016 (hereafter chH9N2) was rescued via the eight-plasmid reverse genetics system described previously52.Plasmid construction and cloningIn brief, viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp® viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following extraction, NA gene segments from viruses in Supplementary Table 1 were amplified using a high-fidelity Superscript IV One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) with specific forward and reverse primers, including segment-specific sequences and BsmBI or BsaI restriction sites at both 3′ and 5′ ends (Supplementary Table 2). Subsequently, pHW2000 expression plasmid and PCR products were digested using either BsmBI or BsaI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) restriction enzymes and then ligated together in a 3:1 insert/plasmid ratio using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). The ligated pHW2000-NA plasmids were transformed into competent DH5α E. coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) using the standard heat shock method. After the transformation step, selected clones were verified by purification of plasmid DNA using the Zyppy® plasmid miniprep kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) and subsequent sequencing at (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) to ensure correct gene orientation and sequence. Eleven expression plasmids containing the different NA-gene segments were constructed. Additionally, 11 pHW2000 plasmids containing a 20 aa deletion in the NA-gene were constructed using Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). Specific primers (Supplementary Table 2) for N1–N9 were designed to delete 20 aa at nucleotide positions 148–207.Cell cultureMadin–Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK-II), Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T), and Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) were cultured in flasks containing Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK) including 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK), and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic–Antimycotic (Anti-Anti, Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK). Additionally, Chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1) cells were cultured in flasks containing 50% Ham’s F12 nutrient mix (F12), 50% Iscove Modified Dulbecco Media including 5% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) Anti-Anti. Cells were kept at 37 ºC with an air circulation containing 5% CO2. Cells were provided by Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.Rescue protocol and generation of recombinant reassortant virusesA “7 + 1” reverse genetics approach was used previously described by Hoffman et al., including seven gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NS, and M) from the parental chH9N2 and one of the 22 generated NA gene segments (10 intact and 10 with a 20-aa deletion in the stalk region). As a positive control, parental chH9N2 was rescued using all eight plasmids of this virus. Virus rescue trials were performed in co-cultures of 293T and MDCK-II cells at a 1:3 ratio cultivated in 6-well plates. Prior to transfection, cells were serum-starved for 1 h at 37 °C in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK). In brief, cells were transfected with 500 ng of 7 + 1 plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 3000 transfection reagents (Invitrogen by ThermoFisher Scientific, CA, USA) according to standard procedure. At 24 h post-transfection, the media was changed to 3 ml of infection media per well containing Opti-MEM (Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 0,2% (v/v) Bovine Serum Albumin solution 35% (BSA, MpBio™, CA, USA), 0.5 µg/µl TPCK-treated Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), and 100 I.U./ml Penicillin and 100 μg/ml Streptomycin (Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK). Supernatants were collected at two time points, 48 h and 72 h, and subsequently inoculated in specific pathogen-free (SPF) 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The allantoic fluid was harvested 72 h post-inoculation and viral content was confirmed by qPCR using AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems™ by Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) using primers targeting N1–N9 developed by Hassan et al.53.In vitro replication kinetics The replication kinetics of the recombinant reassortant viruses were assessed in avian (DF-1), mammalian (MDCK-II) and human (A549) cells. Trials to obtain plaques and calculate the MOI were not successful for all generated recombinant viruses using different concentration of either microcrystalline cellulose Avicel or agarose as overlay for plaque formation. Therefore, all viruses were titrated in MDCK-II cells and normalized to TCID50 (3.16 × 102/ml). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and all infections were performed in triplicate wells. At 1 h post-infection, the media was changed to infection media containing DMEM (Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Bovine Serum Albumin solution 35% (BSA, MpBio™, CA, USA), 0.5 µg/µl TPCK-Trypsin with a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 100 I.U./ml Penicillin and 100 µl/ml Streptomycin (Gibco™, Life Technologies, UK) and the cells were further incubated for 72 h. At timepoints 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection, cells were checked for cytopathic effects and supernatants were collected. Ultimately, viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant, and the viral content was assessed by qPCR using AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems™ by Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA). Statistical analyses comparing the replication kinetics of the rescued viruses were performed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple pairwise comparison using Graphpad Prism (version 9.5.1).Neuraminidase activityThe neuraminidase enzymatic activity of the recombinant reassortants was assessed by cleavage of the soluble substrate NA-XTD using the NA-XTD™ Influenza Neuraminidase Assay kit (Applied Biosystems™ by Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) following the manufacturers protocol. All viruses were normalized to an equivalent hemagglutinin unit of 32 HAU. In brief, viruses were diluted in a twofold dilution series with the assay buffer followed by addition of substrate and a 30 min room temperature incubation. Thereafter, an assay accelerator was added and the chemiluminescence was measured using infinite® M200 plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). A two-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism was done to compare the NA-activity between the viruses.

Are you protected from the flu if you got the flu shot last year? How long is the shot effective? The short answer is six months, but the long answer is more complicated than this. Read on and find out what this means for when you should get your next flu shot. When To Get a Flu Shot This Year What Is the Flu? The flu, or influenza, is a contagious infection of your lungs, throat, and nose. It infects millions of people every year. More people get sick at certain times of the year, especially late fall through spring. Symptoms come on fast and can include: CoughRunny or stuffy noseFeeling tiredBody aches or headachesSore throatRunny nose or congestionVomiting and diarrhea (more common in children) People can spread it before they have symptoms and up to five or seven days after they get better (which can also take several days). You get it by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your nose or eye. People who are sick can also spread it when talking, coughing, or sneezing. Who Should Get a Flu Shot? Most national health organizations recommend that anyone six months or older get a flu shot yearly, except in rare cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) especially recommends that you get the flu shot if you are older than 65, pregnant, have had a stroke, or have a chronic condition including (but not limited to): AsthmaDiabetesChronic kidney diseaseHeart disease How Long Does the Flu Shot Last? In short: The flu shot can last as long as six months. The long answer is a little bit more complicated, partly because everybody is different. Knowing how long the flu shot lasts is essential in determining when to get your flu shot each year. Flu season generally lasts from October to May but peaks from December through February. The CDC recommends getting the flu shot by the end of October. Unfortunately, if you get your flu shot in October of the previous year, you're not covered for the current October (and yes, that can matter since the flu technically exists year-round and only peaks during the flu season). In addition, if you got your shot late in the flu season last year, you're not covered at the end of the calendar year of the current year, even if you're within the six-month range. The flu strains differ yearly and so do the vaccines. How Effective Are Flu Shots? Researchers "tweak" vaccines annually to account for changes in circulating strains. Even so, vaccine effectiveness can vary widely from year to year. For instance, the effectiveness of the vaccine was 56% during the 2009-2010 flu season, 60% during the 2010-2011 season, and 36% during the 2021-2022 season. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approves vaccines, doesn't expect or guarantee the vaccine will entirely prevent the flu. Several studies have also shown that vaccine effectiveness decreases each month after you get it. Still, the vaccine makes severe illness and hospitalization less likely, especially if you have a condition that makes you more vulnerable. It's best to get the flu shot yearly—unless you're severely allergic to the vaccine or are six months of age or younger. While the flu shot isn't 100% effective, it can prevent the flu from becoming fatal. A Quick Review The flu makes millions of people sick each year and is pretty contagious, so health organizations recommend that nearly everyone older than six months get a flu vaccine annually, preferably around the start of flu season. While the shot won't fully protect you, it reduces your odds of getting it or getting very sick, especially if you are in a high-risk group. If you have any questions or concerns about getting a flu shot, reach out to your healthcare provider. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

It i one of the most frequently-occurring causes of the common flu. It is very easily transmitted between people through droplets left in the air from sneezing or coughing. t. The H3N2 virus, just like the H1N1 sub-type of influenza, triggers flu symptoms like headache, fever and nasal congestion. It is very important to maintain adequate hydration to help flush out the virus from the body. It is also advised to use medication that will help to manage symptoms, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Although H2N3 is a sub-type of the Influenza A virus, it does not cause flu symptoms in people, as this virus is only found in animals. Therefore, it is most likely that your symptoms are related to the H3N2 or H1N1 viruses. Main symptoms Symptoms of an H3N2 infection are the same as an H1N1 infection. These symptoms include: High fever, over 38ºC (or 100.4ºF) Body aches Sore throat Headaches Sneezing Coughing Runny nose Chills Excessive fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea, which will more frequently occur in children Muscle weakness The H3N2 virus is more frequently identified in children and older adults, although it can also infect pregnant women and recently post-partum women fore frequently. It can also easily infect people with compromised immune systems or chronic diseases. How transmission occurs Transmission of the H3N2 virus happens very easily through droplets that remain suspended in the air when an infected person coughs, speaks or sneezes. It can also occur through direct contact with infected people or with indirect contact of infected objects. Are H2N3 and H3N2 the same? Although these are both sub-types of the Influenza A virus, H2N3 and H3N2 are not the same because they target different populations. H3N2 is found solely in people, while H2N3 is found solely in animals, and is not associated with infections in people. What is the difference between H3N2 and COVID-19? Although they are both acute respiratory diseases caused by a virus, the H3N2 flu and COVID-19 are two very distinct conditions. In addition to being caused by different viruses, the H3N2 virus that causes the flu, the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, their respective starts and intensity are also different: H3N2 COVID-19 Symptoms are most intense in the first 48 hours Symptoms are most intense in the 5th and 6th day of infection Intense fever and body aches in the first days of infection Low fever in the first days of infection which can gradually increase over time Improves by the end of 7 days Symptoms evolve over time, and can result in serious symptoms, like respiratory changes or clots Although symptoms are similar, you should still consult a doctor for assessment of your symptoms and to evaluate whether you should complete a COVID-19 or flu swab. Treatment options Treatment for the flu caused by H3N2 aims to relieve associated symptoms, and therefore the following can be recommended: Rest Adequate hydration throughout the day Light meals that are easy to digest Use of medication like analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen) and anti-inflammatories (e.g. ibuprofen) Use of anti-viral medication, in some cases, to decrease the development and growth of viral cells, like Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) or Relenza (Zanamivir). These should be taken as prescribed by your doctor. In addition, it is important that while you are infected by H3N2, you should remain in isolation for 7 to 10 days to avoid transmission to other people. How to prevent To prevent H3N2 infection, you should avoid contact with anyone with flu-like symptoms. Infected people should remain in isolation for 7 to 10 days, so that they can avoid transmission of the virus to others. In addition, you should use a face mark and ensure adequate hand hygiene. It is important to avoid staying inside closed environments with too many people. It is also a good idea to avoid bringing your hands to your eyes or mouth, and avoid staying too close to a person who is infected. It is also possible to prevent transmission of this virus by getting the flu vaccine, which is made available every year. The flu vaccine protects against the H1N1, H3N2 and Influenza B viruses. People of all ages should receive the vaccine, but it should be particularly taken by children and older adults, as the virus is more common in these groups. The flu vaccine should be taken every year, as the virus mutates over time and can become resistant to previous vaccines.

That implies drastic and rapid changes in Earth’s electromagnetic field can cause illness.” The post’s caption also states “the flu is not contagious. No flu has ever been contagious.” The post garnered more than 70 likes in two weeks.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksOur rating: False Infectious disease experts say influenza, also known as "the flu," is a contagious viral respiratory infection of the nose, throat and lungs. A geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey said the technologies mentioned in the post were developed over decades, not years, and do not correlate with influenza outbreaks. The flu is a contagious infection caused by a virus, say health experts There is no truth to the post's claims, according to Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.“Influenza is caused by a virus,” Swartzberg said. “We’ve known this now for a little less than a century. And we know that viruses cannot survive without getting into a human being and replicating in their cells.” Most people catch the flu by breathing in airborne droplets from the coughs and sneezes of someone infected with the virus, according to Penn Medicine. Individuals can also be infected by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching their eyes, mouth or nose.The post attempts to link several historical influenza pandemics to various electrical and communications technologies. However, scientists have been able to use specific antibodies produced by the immune system in response to an infection to identify the specific strains of influenza behind the pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968. The virus responsible for the 1889 influenza pandemic, what the post calls the “Russian flu,” is still debated in the scientific community. But it is generally accepted the virus behind the 1889 pandemic was an influenza virus, according to an article in the journal La Presse Médicale.Fact check: Influenza virus is still active, hasn't 'disappeared'Post wrong about technologies and Earth’s magnetic fieldThe post includes images of electric power lines, radio, radar and satellite technologies, as well as the dates of their purported introduction to mainstream society. But the proposed correlation between those technologies and notable epidemics of the past is “highly inaccurate,” said Anna Kelbert, a research geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey.The technologies mentioned in the post were “continuously developed throughout the last couple of centuries, as humans were able to better harness electromagnetic waves for societal needs,” Kelbert wrote in an email. The timeline of the technologies' development shows "no correlation with human disease outbursts,” she said. The caption of the post also claims that seasonal variations in solar radiation are connected to the flu.Seasonal variations in the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface can affect human health “through exposing our skin to higher amounts of electromagnetic radiation in the summer,” Kelbert said. But Kelbert said those health risks are “unrelated to flu epidemics,” which tend to occur during colder months.Fact check: No, a massive solar storm is not approaching Earth any time soon The post is also wrong about electromagnetic fields playing a role. Substantial changes in Earth’s electromagnetic field happen over thousands of years, according to Kelbert. The variations that scientists can observe are “not drastic or rapid, in fact, they are very gradual and barely noticeable on the human time scale,” Kelbert said.

See the survey × 16 March 2023 Author(s): Sara Sawyer Emma Worden-Sapper Sharon Wu As bird flu continues to spread in the US and worldwide, what’s the risk that it could start a human pandemic? 4 questions answered Source(s): Conversation Media Group, the Upload your content Pordee_Aomboon/Shutterstock An outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza that started in 2021 has become the largest bird flu outbreak in history, both in the U.S. and worldwide. In the U.S. the virus has led to the destruction of millions of commercially raised chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, and has killed thousands of wild birds. Many virologists are concerned that this virus could spill over to humans and cause a new human pandemic. University of Colorado Boulder virologists Sara Sawyer, Emma Worden-Sapper and Sharon Wu summarize the compelling story of H5N1 and why scientists are closely watching the outbreak. 1. Is this virus a serious threat to humans? H5N1 is a specific type of influenza virus, predominantly harbored by birds, that was first detected on a goose farm in China in 1996. Recently it has begun infecting an exploding diversity of bird and mammalian species around the globe. The virus is highly pathogenic to birds, meaning that infections often cause extreme symptoms, including death. But its impact on humans is complicated. There have been relatively few human infections detected – fewer than 900 documented globally over several decades – but about half of those infected individuals have died. The good news about H5N1 for humans is that it currently doesn’t spread well between people. Most people who have contracted H5N1 have gotten it directly from interacting with infected poultry – specifically chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, which often are raised in close quarters on large commercial farms. There are only a small handful of examples of human-to-human spread. Because H5N1 doesn’t spread well between people, and because direct infection of humans by infected birds is still relatively rare, H5N1 has not yet erupted into a human epidemic or pandemic. 2. Why is this outbreak suddenly getting so much attention? The first reason that so much attention is being paid to bird flu right now is that currently H5N1 is causing the largest “bird pandemic” ever recorded. A certain viral variant that arose in 2020, called H5N1 2.3.4.4b, is driving this outbreak. In agricultural poultry flocks, if a few birds test positive for H5N1, the whole flock is killed regardless of symptoms or infection status. Higher prices for eggs and poultry meat in the U.S. are one result. The Biden administration is considering vaccinating farmed poultry flocks, but the logistics could be quite complicated. The second reason for increased attention is that H5N1 is now infecting more bird and mammalian species than ever before. The virus has been detected in a broad array of wild birds and in diverse mammals, including badgers, black bears, bobcats, coyotes, ferrets, fisher cats, foxes, leopards, opossums, pigs, skunks and sea lions. As H5N1 infects more species, it also increases its geographical range and produces more viral variants that could have new biological properties. The third and most worrisome reason that this virus is getting so much press is that H5N1 now seems to be transmitting well between individuals of at least one mammalian species. In late 2022, mammal-to-mammal spread occurred in Spain in farmed minks. H5N1 spread very efficiently between the minks and caused clinical signs of illness and death in the mink populations where it was detected. Sea lions in Peru are also succumbing to H5N1 virus in massive numbers. It hasn’t been confirmed definitively whether the sea lions are spreading the virus to each other or are contracting it from birds or H5N1-infected water. Here’s the key question: If H5N1 can achieve spread in minks and possibly sea lions, why not humans? We are also mammals. It is true that the farmed minks were confined in close quarters, like chickens on a poultry farm, so that may have contributed. But humans also live in high densities in many cities around the world, providing the virus similar tinder should a human-compatible variant arise. 3. What features could help H5N1 spread well in humans? Birds experience influenza as a gastrointestinal infection and spread flu predominantly through defecating in water. By contrast, humans experience influenza as a respiratory infection and spread it by breathing and coughing. Over the centuries, some of these avian influenza viruses have been passed from birds to humans and other mammalian species, although this is a relatively rare event. This is because bird influenza viruses must mutate in several ways to infect mammals efficiently. The most important mutational changes affect the tissue tropism of the virus – its ability to infect a specific part of the body. Avian flu viruses have evolved to infect cells of the intestine, while human flu viruses have evolved to infect cells of the respiratory tract. However, sometimes a flu virus can acquire mutations that allow it to infect cells in a different part of the body. Which cells influenza infects is partially dictated by the specific receptor that it binds. Receptors are the molecules on the surface of host cells that a virus exploits to enter those cells. Once viruses are in cells, they may be able to produce copies of themselves, at which point an infection has been achieved. Both human and bird influenza viruses use receptors called sialic acids that are common on the surfaces of cells. Bird influenza viruses, such as H5N1, use a version called α2,3-linked sialic acid, while human flu viruses use α2,6-linked sialic acid – the predominant variant in the human upper respiratory tract. Thus, to become efficient at infecting humans, H5N1 would likely need to mutate to use α2,6-linked sialic acid as its receptor. This is a concern because studies have shown that only one or two mutations in the viral genome are enough to switch receptor binding from α2,3-linked sialic acid to the human α2,6-linked sialic acid. That doesn’t seem like much of a genetic obstacle. 4. Why don’t we make a vaccine just in case? With avian influenza viruses, it is not possible to make effective human vaccines in advance, because we don’t know exactly what the genetics of the virus will be if it starts to spread well in humans. Remember that the seasonal flu vaccine must be remade every year, even though the general types of flu viruses that it protects against are the same, because the specific genetic variants that affect humans change from year to year. Right now, the best way people can protect themselves from H5N1 is to avoid contact with infected birds. For more information about prevention, especially for people who keep domesticated birds or are bird-watching hobbyists, the Centers for Disease Control has a list of guidelines for avoiding H5N1 and other bird flu viruses.

The genesis of Centivax dates back to around 2012, when Jacob Glanville was building a previous company called Distributed Bio, which was using computational immunology to identify new therapeutic antibodies to target specific protein sites. However, the tools the company was developing also provided better insights into immune systems – such as the induction of autoimmunity and the failure of vaccines for quickly mutating viruses. “At that point, I realized that I had invented a vaccine technology and I worked to develop it further,” says Glanville. “It was the beginning of a golden age of biotechnology. We had access to high-throughput genomic sequencers that we could point at the immune system to look at tens of millions of antibodies and T cell receptors. High-throughput synthesis technologies also allowed us to use DNA synthesis to build antibody libraries of thousands of human immune systems, which could be interrogated in vitro. This work gave rise to some new ideas around the conserved sites that exist in otherwise mutating viruses, and why our immune systems so often miss these sites. If we can get the immune system to focus exactly on these conserved sites, we can create universal vaccines.” Glanville spent years developing the technology in Guatemala – where he grew up and where he is also an affiliate professor at the University of San Carlos. Distributed Bio was performing well as a business and profits allowed the technology to develop, until it was eventually noticed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “We were selected for a Millennium Grand Challenge: End the Pandemic Threat award,” says Glanville. “A lot of science that gets funded is iterative rather than disruptive, and there will always be reviewers who don’t agree with a new idea. The funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was a huge breakthrough and allowed us to conduct studies in the US with key collaborators. But let’s not fool ourselves – this is only the beginning and we have a lot of work to do!”On December 31, 2020, the Distributed Bio services business was sold to Charles River laboratories – on the condition that Glanville could spin out the universal vaccine technology. “Many of the Centivax co-founders have known each other since 2008, so we’ve pulled a dream team together to execute this,” says Glanville.The company’s portfolio includes “universal” vaccines and antibodies against rapidly mutating viruses – as well as bacteria. However, Glanville explains that “universal” is not quite the correct term. “The term ‘universal’ when applied to vaccines is a buzzword; a more accurate description is ‘broad-spectrum.’ Unlike current flu vaccines and current COVID-19 vaccines, our vaccine should produce antibody responses against non-mutating sites and therefore will have a broad spectrum effect against the majority of viruses that could occur in the future. But biology is complex and eventually it will defeat you. Universal implies that the vaccine won’t ever require modification, but I don’t have the data right now to say if that will be the case or not. It may be that the vaccines still need modifying, but it should be far less frequent than current approaches – vaccines updated perhaps a few times per century, instead of the current practice of updating the vaccines every single year.” Hitting the right target The idea of a universal – or broad-spectrum – flu vaccine has been discussed amongst researchers for years. Despite numerous early-stage projects, there has been no true breakthrough. According to Nick Bayless, Chief Technology Officer of Centivax, influenza belongs to a club of viruses that have the same challenging hallmark: rapid mutation. “This isn’t true of all viruses, but HIV, influenza, and the coronavirus mutate very rapidly as a survival strategy to avoid the immune response,” says Bayless. “There are many different mechanisms involved in how each virus does this, but essentially they change the parts on the virus that are recognized by antibodies, which means that the immune system is unable to prevent the next infection after the virus has mutated.”But even viruses that mutate rapidly are bound by certain goal-based constraints; for example, the influenza virus has to enter human lung cells and the HIV virus must enter human T cells at a certain efficiency. The viruses attack their target cell by precisely docking onto a receptor on that cell, much like a rocket must precisely dock with the airlock on the ISS to deliver astronauts. Ultimately, this creates bottlenecks in viral evolution; the virus cannot mutate the “airlock” or it is unable to dock and is therefore no longer infectious. This conserved docking site creates a conserved and vulnerable patch that antibodies can attack and prevent all viruses from docking.“However, these rare, conserved epitopes are outnumbered by all the epitopes on the rest of the viral surface that can mutate – and a typical antibody response will go after the parts of the virus that is changing year to year,” says Bayless. “Our technology targets these areas because we know these viruses cannot infect cells without them.”Glanville adds, “The first time that someone described a broadly neutralizing antibody hitting a conserved site on flu was back in 1993. More papers were published in the 2000s and this started a race for a ‘universal’ vaccine, but everyone was flying blind because the tools for interrogating the immune system weren’t good enough; it’s only in the past ten years or so that we’ve really seen a revolution in high-throughput sequencing and DNA synthesis technologies.” In other words, scientists were trying to fix an engine when they couldn’t lift the hood. Glanville also points out that there has been a lot of attention directed at why our immune system don’t target the conserved sites of viruses over the last decade. “Computational biology allowed me to understand more about what is going wrong – and how we can fix it.” Diluting for strength Centivax’s technology is state of the art, but Glanville has a simple way to describe it. The company takes 10 representative versions of influenza vaccine, dating all the way back to 1918. “These strains are all very different to one another, but there are some conserved sites – as Nick explained – that have not changed. We take these strains, mix them together, and dilute the mixture. There is not enough of any of the ten individual strains to produce an immune response – but there is a large enough dose of the shared site, because all ten components share that exact site.”So far, Centivax has tested its approach in animals – and they, as well as laboratories at the University of Georgia and Auburn University, have observed it providing protection for up to twelve years of future evolution of the viruses. And critically, the approach was able to neutralize future variants of the virus that didn’t exist when the study began. “Now, we’re preparing to run in vivo studies for validation of our delivery of our vaccine using LNP mRNAs, and then we can enter manufacturing,” says Davis Tsao, Chief Operating Officer and co-founder. “Initially, we were planning to commence manufacturing earlier this year, but we’ve decided to hold our fire because there is the possibility that our approach will be compatible with the mRNA lipid nanoparticle systems that have been used in COVID-19 vaccines.”“The advantage for us is that those systems are much faster to manufacture, are less expensive, and have a built-in ability to stimulate the immune system,” explains Glanville. “And they have been de-risked significantly over the last two years. There are advantages and disadvantages to every delivery platform, but we’re excited by the mRNA studies we have ongoing. If we go the mRNA route, it could speed things up getting our vaccine into clinical studies.”Centivax’s most advanced program is its flu vaccine, but the company is also working on a broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccine and is starting to apply its technology to HIV (both vaccines are currently in animal testing). Another area the company is interested in is a side effect of some mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: myocarditis – and whether it is possible to engineer delivery systems to avoid the side effect. “We should always make the delivered medicine as safe as possible,” says Glanville. Movie Stars and Spreading Positive Vaccine Messaging In January 2020, Netflix aired the documentary series Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak. The series focused on a number of different public health topics, including influenza, Ebola, and vaccine research. And the timing was eerie – just as COVID-19 was just beginning to ramp up in certain parts of the world. “We allowed the film crew to follow us around in 2019,” says Glanville. “But I didn't know where it was going to end up to and I didn’t know whether we would get the Gates funding at the time.”One of the reasons that Glanville agreed to the filming was because of the misinformation and unnecessary scepticism that exists around vaccines globally. “I felt that if people watched us working our asses off to make better vaccines, they might recognize that people are investing their lives into this – all for the purpose of making lives better for others. And this realization might make people feel more comfortable about vaccines. It’s a small world. And it’s a very populated one. We are going to see more pandemics and outbreaks. Vaccine technologies are necessary more than ever. People need to see how hard we are working on this. We won’t reach everybody, but I think we can change some hearts and minds if we are more transparent in biotechnology and learn to communicate more effectively with the public.”Here’s what other experts at Centivax have to say on the topic of vaccines and the public:Stephanie Wisner, Chief Business Officer: “Jake was a thought leader on vaccines during the pandemic and appeared on multiple news channels. It is so important to communicate science in a way that is accessible to people and to give them the facts that they can engage with. I think scientists sometimes find it very difficult to communicate in language that makes sense to a layman who is not familiar with the terminology. Our industry as a whole needs to get better at this.”David Tsao, Chief Operating Officer: “In pandemic situations, epidemiologists often try to oversimplify – sometimes because they just want people to do something, like take a vaccine shot, but this ultimately leads to distrust. There will always be people out there saying crazy things and we can’t win them all, but if we stick to the facts and make information as accessible as possible – jargon-free, and so on – then people can make informed decisions. We also can’t pretend that everything is completely safe. There are side effects, but they are rare – and we shouldn’t hide that.”Nick Bayless, Chief Technology officer: “The current flu shot is only around 30-60 percent effective. It’s better than nothing, but you can see how this can lead people to be sceptical about the efficacy of vaccines. I think one of the best things that immunologists can do is to produce better vaccines that are more effective at preventing disease. But there are a lot of people out there who don’t think the current flu shot is worth it.”Sawsan Youssef, Chief Science Officer: “During the pandemic, everyone was very exposed to social media and there were a lot of anti-vax messages. A lot of friends and family were asking us many questions – and we were then able to spread positive information. Before the pandemic, these people would never normally ask questions like this! I think the general public is now far more aware of vaccines and viruses – and it has helped information be transmitted in a far more positive way.” Receive content, products, events as well as relevant industry updates from The Medicine Maker and its sponsors.

In April 2022, researchers found 660 cases of the H5N1 virus that causes avian influenza in wild birds. At this time, three bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in Georgia died from the virus. Researchers wondered how influenza virus was affecting bald eagle nest success. They found that in coastal Georgia, less than half of the nests fledged one eaglet that year. In a Florida county, nesting success rates were also halved. The researchers said that living in coastal areas puts the eagles at greater risk of catching the virus since it can persist in the water for more than a year. Eagles then catch the virus when consuming infected birds. Read the study in Scientific Reports. PAID AD Header Image: Avian influenza has affected the nest success of bald eagles in coastal areas.

That indicates efforts to promote heathy sleep duration ahead of an immunization could be an easy way to improve vaccine effectiveness. The study was published March 13 in Current Biology. The latest work builds off a 2002 study by members of the team showing that restricting sleep in participants diminished their antibody response to influenza vaccination, leading to about half of the antibody levels seen in controls at 10 days after an inoculation. Their interest in the work was revived during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in 2020, when they began to connect with others who had studied this question and started to pull together the meta-analysis. Across seven studies, which examined the impact of sleep duration on vaccination against viral illnesses such as influenza and hepatitis, the researchers found that insufficient sleep (defined as under six hours of sleep per night) in the days surrounding vaccination resulted in a decreased antibody response. “Insufficient sleep is a behavioral factor that can be corrected before vaccination and may not only strengthen, but also extend, the vaccine response,” said Eve Van Cauter, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine at UChicago and senior author on the meta-analysis. “We know that people respond differently to vaccination according to their age, sex, existing medical conditions and other factors that cannot be readily changed. Having an easily modifiable behavior that you can adjust around the time of your appointment gives you something you can control that is likely to improve your body’s response.” Insufficient sleep is a behavioral factor that can be corrected before vaccination and may not only strengthen, but also extend, the vaccine response. Importantly, the association was seen only in studies that objectively assessed sleep duration using wearable activity trackers or sleep studies in the laboratory. Self-reported sleep duration was not a predictor of vaccine response. The researchers noted that while the association was strong for men, it was weaker and not statistically significant for women. They argue this was likely due to the fact that none of the studies in women accounted for variations in sex hormone levels by menstrual cycle, use of contraceptives and menopausal status. “The link between sleep and vaccine effectiveness could be a major concern for people with irregular work schedules, especially for shift workers who typically have reduced sleep duration,” said Van Cauter. “This is something people should consider planning around, to ensure that they are getting enough sleep in the week before and after their vaccines.” Using the results of the meta-analysis and comparing to known data on the antibody response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the researchers estimated that the effects of insufficient sleep on the vaccine response would be equivalent to two months of waning antibodies after vaccination. “Interestingly, we saw the same outcomes in both influenza, which is a respiratory virus, and hepatitis, which affects the liver, suggesting that this effect could extend to all kinds of viruses, including coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2,” said Karine Spiegel, PhD, first author on the study and a research scientist at Inserm. “Overall, we see these results as a call to action.” The researchers hope that the study will inspire more research into the phenomenon to clarify the effects on men and women, as well as to better understand how different vaccines may be impacted by sleep duration and how sleep might be optimized to promote a better vaccine response. “We need much larger studies that control for the sex hormone environment in women in particular,” said Spiegel. “We also need a better definition of how many days of short sleep duration affect the antibody response, and whether it is just before the vaccine, or also during and after. Large scale studies that consider behavioral, demographic and hormonal characteristics should provide new insights that will translate to measurable impacts on vaccine efficacy.” “The immune system is not the only one modulated by sleep,” said Van Cauter. “Insufficient sleep is linked to other health issues such as an increased risk of developing obesity, diabetes or hypertension. Vaccines are an important tool for preventing and reducing the impacts of infectious diseases, and we think that you may be able to implement a simple behavioral change — getting enough sleep — to derive an immediate benefit. It’s cheap, and there is no adverse effect.” The study, “A meta-analysis of the associations between insufficient sleep duration and antibody response to vaccination,” included the additional authors Amandine E. Rey and Anne Cheylus of Inserm; Kieran Ayling of the University of Nottingham; Christian Benedict of Uppsala University; Tanja Lange of University of Lübeck; Aric A.

Here are warning signs and symptoms that you have a severe disease and need to be hospitalised. H3N2 Influenza, a subtype of Influenza A virus has been spreading fast in India with around 90 cases so far and 2 deaths. The illness is said to cause fever that lasts for 3-5 days and a prolonged cough and cold for up to three weeks. H3N2 Influenza subtype causes more hospitalisations compared to other strains and the symptoms include persistent cough, headache, fever and sinus-related symptoms among others. While the disease is usually mild in vulnerable groups it can turn severe and puts one at risk of complications and even death. If one is finding it difficult to breath, have low blood pressure, high rate of breathing, bluish lips, seizures, confusion, one must be taken to hospital immediately. (Also read: H3N2 influenza vs Covid-19: Symptoms, incubation period, severity and more) Influenza H3N2 is a subtype of the influenza A virus that can cause respiratory illness in humans. (REPRESENTATIVE PHOTO) "Influenza H3N2 is a subtype of the influenza A virus that can cause respiratory illness in humans. The signs and symptoms of severe disease caused by H3N2 influenza can vary from person to person, but generally, the following symptoms may indicate a more severe illness," says Dr Jayalakshmi TK, Consultant, Pulmonology, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai. SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF H3N2 INFLUENZADr Jayalakshmi lists the following signs of severe illness in H3N2 Influenza patients: 1. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath can indicate the onset of pneumonia or other respiratory complications. 2. Severe or persistent vomiting: Severe or persistent vomiting can be a symptom of severe H3N2 influenza. This can lead to dehydration. 3. Dehydration: Dehydration can occur if a person with H3N2 influenza is not drinking enough fluids or is experiencing severe vomiting or diarrhea. 4. Low blood pressure: Low blood pressure can occur if a person with severe H3N2 influenza is experiencing dehydration or sepsis. 5. High rate of breathing: A high rate of breathing can occur if a person with severe H3N2 influenza is experiencing difficulty breathing or low oxygen saturation. 6. Worsening of existing chronic medical conditions: H3N2 influenza can worsen existing chronic medical conditions like asthma or diabetes. 7. Bluish lips or face can be a sign of low oxygen levels in the blood, which can occur with severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia, which can be a complication of influenza. 8. Seizures or convulsions can occur as a result of fever or inflammation in the brain, which can occur with severe cases of influenza or other viral infections. 9. Confusion or disorientation can occur as a result of fever or inflammation in the brain, which can occur with severe cases of influenza or other viral infections. 10. High fever that persists for more than three days is a common symptom of H3N2 influenza, as well as other types of influenza, and can be a sign of a more severe case of the illness. 11. Extreme fatigue or weakness is another common symptom of H3N2 influenza, as the body is using a lot of energy to fight off the virus. 12. Chest pain or pressure is a viral respiratory illness that primarily affects the upper respiratory system. 13. Low oxygen saturation (hypoxemia) can occur in individuals infected with the H3N2 influenza virus, especially in severe cases of the illness. The H3N2 influenza virus can cause respiratory symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, which can lead to a decrease in oxygen saturation levels. COMMON SIGNS OF H3N2 INFLUENZADr. Shalmali Inamdar, Consultant, Physician and Adult Infectious Diseases, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital Mumbai talks about the common signs of H3N2 influeza • High fever: A sudden onset of high fever is one of the most common symptoms of H3N2 infection. The fever may range from 100 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and may last for 3 to 4 days. • Cough: A dry, persistent cough is another common symptom of H3N2 infection. The cough may be severe and last for several weeks. • Sore throat: A sore throat is also a common symptom of H3N2 infection. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever and cough. • Headache: Headaches are common in people with H3N2 influenza. They may be severe and persistent. • Fatigue: Fatigue and weakness are common symptoms of H3N2 infection. They may last for several weeks even after the other symptoms have gone. • Body aches: Body aches, especially in the back, arms, and legs, are common in people with H3N2 influenza. They may be severe and persistent. • Chills: Chills are a common symptom of H3N2 infection. They may be accompanied by fever and body aches. "If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications to help relieve the symptoms and prevent complications. Healthy lifestyle choices can lower the risk of H3N2 influenza and a strong primary care system with access to a full-time model for doctors can overcome barriers to treatment," says Dr Inamdar.

By MAAYAN JAFFE-HOFFMAN MARCH 13, 2023 11:31 Updated: MARCH 13, 2023 20:22 THE MRNA TECHNIQUE may mean that future pandemics can be dealt with far more quickly. (photo credit: ATHIT PERAWONGMETHA / REUTERS) According to Pfizer, mRNA technology could enable scientists to develop and manufacture the flu vaccine faster, potentially saving lives.The World Health Organization reported that as many as five million people suffer from severe cases of influenza each year, and an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die due to respiratory diseases alone. In Israel, more than 5,800 people were hospitalized this flu season (since October, 2022) with laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza, according to the Israel Center for Disease Control.Flu vaccines have been approved in the United States since 1945, but vaccine uptake tends to be lower, partly because people don’t believe the shots work. In Israel, for example, fewer than 20% of eligible individuals were vaccinated against the flu this year. According to a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu vaccine effectiveness can vary between as little as 10% up to 60%.“So many people don’t take these vaccines because they’re like, ‘well, why should I take the vaccine? It does not work,’” said Annaliesa Anderson, senior vice president and chief scientific officer for vaccine research and development at Pfizer. “They do work – but there are some quirks.” People pose with syringe with needle in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken. (credit: REUTERS)What’s going on?Each year, 144 influenza centers worldwide monitor the flu viruses circulating before flu season begins. Then, in February, the WHO recommends the flu vaccine composition for the upcoming fall/winter flu season in the Northern Hemisphere.It takes around six months to develop and manufacture the updated vaccines. There are three kinds of flu vaccines. The most common is cell-based; the candidate vaccine virus is injected into eggs, where it replicates. There are also cell-based vaccines that use cultured mammalian cells instead of eggs. Finally, another kind uses synthetic versions of the virus and is produced in insect cells.Aside from the long time it takes to make these vaccines, the egg can also introduce changes to the virus, resulting in less effective antibodies in humans, Anderson explained.Pfizer is now in the midst of a Phase 3 trial for a new mRNA influenza vaccine, with 36,200 participants over 18 enrolled at 269 trial sites. Anderson said the study has focused on the Northern Hemisphere but will soon expand to the Southern Hemisphere. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Pfizer and BioNTech developed the world’s first approved mRNA vaccine to combat COVID-19 in 2020, followed closely by Moderna. mRNA vaccines use the genetic code of a virus instead of the virus itself. Once the mRNA is in the cell, ribosomes read the code and build proteins called antibodies, which are then expressed in the body.Anderson said that now that Pfizer has succeeded with the mRNA technology, “we can start to plug and play” with new antigens. “Particularly for viruses like flu where we have to change strains yearly, this could be a very efficient platform.”She said it would take only about 100 days to make an mRNA flu vaccine, generate supplies and receive regulatory approval yearly. But, again, that is compared to the six months plus days it currently takes to make a flu vaccine. The shorter timeline should allow vaccines to be made closer to flu season and help avoid vaccine mismatch.Pfizer is not the only company developing mRNA vaccines for influenza. Last month, Moderna announced the interim Phase 3 safety and immunogenicity results for its mRNA-1010 seasonal influenza vaccine candidate. The company said the vaccine generated a robust immune response against A flu strains. However, it was not more effective against B strains (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata-lineage) than already approved vaccines.More than 6,000 people took part in the multinational trial. Some 70% of people who received the shot complained of mild adverse effects, such as pain and swelling at the injection site, compared to 48% for the conventional flu vaccine.Full study results could be ready within only a few weeks.In addition to these vaccines, several universal flu vaccines are in various development and testing stages.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags health flu disease vaccine CDC Moderna Pfizer mRNA Pfizer vaccine efficacy Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

(Representative Image)India is witnessing a surge in H3N2 influenza virus cases, a respiratory tract infection caused by four distinct types of viruses (A, B, C, and D) belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Several states including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Odisha, and Haryana are reporting viral infection cases. The state governments have also started taking precautionary measures to prevent the possible outbreak of viral infections. H3N2 has been the dominant subtype followed by H1N1. From January 2 to March 5, 451 cases of H3N2 have been reported in the country, according to data shared by the ministry.In this year, till February 28, 955 H1N1 cases have been reported. Majority of the H1N1 cases were reported from Tamil Nadu (545) while Maharashtra reported 170 cases, Gujarat 74, Kerala 42 and Punjab 28.However, the Union Ministry of Health on Friday said that the cases arising from seasonal influenza including H3N2 are expected to decline from March end.State-wise data on H3N2 virus1) Maharashtra: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Wednesday said 32 patients were admitted in Mumbai of whom 4 have been diagnosed with H3N2 and the remaining 28 with H1N1. Till March 13, 2023, the total number of patients tested for influenza in Maharashtra was 2,56,424, while the suspected patients are 1,406. Maharashtra health minister Tanaji Sawant noted that 352 patients of the H3N2 virus have been reported so far in the state and further asserted that there is no need to panic.2) Delhi: The city hospitals are witnessing a spike in cases of H3N2 virus that triggers symptoms like fever, cold and body aches, but in certain cases, leaves behind persistent cough making patients extremely weak, doctors said.There has been a nearly 150 per cent rise in patients coming to OPDs with such complaints, they said.3) Gujarat: Till March 10 this year, a total of 80 cases of season flu were reported in Gujarat, out of which 77 are influenza of H1N1 and three of H3N2 subtypes. Not a single death has occurred here due to H3N2, according to Gujarat Health Minister Rushikesh Patel.4) Odisha: A total 59 H3N2 Influenza cases has been confirmed out of 225 samples collected in the month of January and February this year in the State. Confirming this Director Dr Sanghamitra Pati, Regional Medical Research Center (RMRC) Bhubaneswar, said that "Symptoms are similar to the seasonal flu viruses including fever and cough etc."5) Karnataka: From January to March, 20 cases of H1N1 were identified along with 26 cases of H3N2, 10 cases of Influenza B, and 69 cases of Adeno, according to an official statement.6) Puducherry: As of 11 March, Puducherry reported 79 cases of influenza, belonging to the viral H3N2 subtype so far. But no death related to H3N2 has been reported in the union territory till now.7) Tamil Nadu: Tamil Nadu health minister Ma Subramanian said here were only 2 cases last month but now it's 20 to 25 cases in the state.8) Assam: The first case of H3N2 influenza was detected in Assam, and the Health Department was keeping a close watch on the situation, an official bulletin said.Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

After Covid-19, H3N2 Influenza cases are on rise across the country and the virus has already killed two people in India. While it is usually known to cause mild disease, vulnerable groups are at risk of severe illness. Considering H3N2 causes more hospitalisations than other influenza subtypes, one must be cautious and take Covid-like measures like wearing masks, washing hands frequently and follow social distancing to curb its spread. The virus is also causing rise in ICU cases in infants and children below 5 years with many of them reporting breathlessness, cough, fever and pneumonia-like symptoms.

"Influenza, also known as the flu virus can have a variety of potentially severe effects on kidneys. Patients who are critically ill due to influenza can develop Acute kidney failure in up to thirty percent of cases. Old age patients and patients who already suffer from any chronic illness such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease or chronic kidney disease constitute the highest risk group. Dialysis and post kidney transplant patients are even more prone to further kidney damage induced by influenza infections, which can lead to secondary bacterial pneumonias, and multi-organ complications, including heart failure. These patients are immunologically vulnerable and at higher risk of mortality as compared to general population," says Dr Saurabh Joshi, Senior Consultant and Head, Urology, Uro-oncology and Kidney Transplant, Accord Hospital, Faridabad, Delhi NCR. Symptoms of H392 influenzaSudden onset of high fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, body ache, chills are all common symptoms of H3N2 influenza, while shortness of breath, severe vomiting, dehydration, low blood pressure, bluish lips, seizures or convulsions, confusion, chest pain and low oxygen saturation are among signs of severe illness as per experts. Can influenza vaccination help?"The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that individuals with CKD or on dialysis and post kidney transplant patients should receive annual influenza vaccination and regular kidney specialist doctor visits to avoid serious complications. The authorities are urged to extend the influenza vaccination program to individuals with pre-existing renal conditions to safeguard the health of the vulnerable population," says Dr Joshi.

CassellShare on PinterestRoos Koole/Getty ImagesAn outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) infections has led to two deaths in India.H3N2 is known to cause more severe illness in young children and older adults. H3N2, which has been the dominant strain circulating in the United States this year, has been associated with more severe flu seasons.India is monitoring an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) infections that has led to two deaths, according to the country’s Union Health Ministry.The deaths were reported in Karnataka and Haryana.H3N2 is known to cause more severe illness in young children and older adults. In India, low vaccination rates combined with heavy air pollution worsen the effects of the flu. India typically experiences two peaks of seasonal influenza: one between November and February and another during monsoon season that runs from June through September.Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security and an infectious disease expert, says we see H3N2 circulate every flu season. And after two historically quiet flu seasons, the flu appears to have returned to its pre-pandemic activity.“This is a little bit late in the season, but it is still the season and India is in the northern hemisphere. Flu seasons are not all synchronous,” says Adalja.What to know about H3N2There are two flu viruses — Influenza A and B — that cause seasonal outbreaks in people.Currently circulating are the influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and influenza B Yamagata and Victoria lineages. H3N2, which has been the dominant strain circulating in the United States this year, has been associated with more severe flu seasons.“So far during the 2022-23 flu season in the U.S., about 99% of those hospitalized due to influenza had H3N2 subtype,” says Jennifer Horney, PhD, an epidemiologist and founding director of the University of Delaware’s epidemiology program.Research shows that H3N2 often causes more severe illness in adults ages 65 and older.The most common symptoms of influenza A cases include cough, congestion, sore throat, fever, headache, chills, body ache, and fatigue.Influenza A can be treated with supportive care in addition to antivirals like oseltamivir, baloxavir, peramivir, and zanamivir, says Adalja.What makes certain flu seasons more severe?According to Horney, flu seasons driven by H3N2 can include more cases of severe diseases, hospitalization, and death.This is especially true when vaccine coverage is low or the vaccine is not a good match to the circulating strains, she added.“A lot of what determines the severity of the flu season has to do with the match of the vaccine to the circulating strain and the percentage of people who are vaccinated each year overall,” says Horney.Influenza viruses are constantly evolving, and the flu vaccine must be updated annually to remain effective.Occasionally, the flu virus mutates in a way that reduces the effectiveness of the shot. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu shot is a good match this year — but coverage in the U.S. is lower than usual. A study conducted in the 2017-2018 flu season found that only 1.5 percent of 65,000 Indian adults ages 45 and older had ever received a flu shot, indicating that vaccine coverage in India is likely very low, says Horney.In addition, air pollution — which is high in India — can worsen flu symptoms. “Respiratory function is worse in a high pollution context,” says Adalja. “Any respiratory virus would be worse in those types of situations.” As a result, the flu’s mortality rate is higher in India — particularly among older adults and young children.It’s “more than twice the rate per 100,000 people than in the U.S., where we expect between 30,000 and 70,000 deaths from influenza each year,” Horney said.The bottom lineIndia is monitoring an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) that has led to two deaths. Though the uptick in cases is occurring somewhat later in India’s typical flu season, H3N2 circulates every year. This year’s shot is a good match against the circulating strains, and there are effective antivirals that can treat infections caused by H3N2.

Bush stood at a lectern in Bethesda, Maryland, to make an important announcement. He was joined by five members of his cabinet, two senators, three congressmen, and multiple international guests. It was an unusual show of force for a press conference, and with two unpopular wars underway and the response to Hurricane Katrina still floundering, there was plenty else to attend to. “Leaders at every level of government have a responsibility to confront dangers before they appear and engage the American people on the best course of action,” he declared. A failure to do so, he said, could cost millions of lives and trillions of dollars. Bush then announced a sweeping new program meant to tackle those dangers head-on. But it wasn’t a military conflict that commanded presidential attention. It wasn’t another hurricane or a terrorist attack. It was influenza. “Pandemic flu,” Bush explained, “occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily from person to person—and for which there is little or no natural immunity.” No such strain existed then, but Bush was worried that one soon might. To that end, he was announcing the creation of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, a comprehensive government plan for handling pandemic flu outbreaks. “By preparing now, we can give our citizens some peace of mind,” he said.His warning proved prescient. Four years later, in 2009, two children in southern California with no connection to each other developed fevers and coughs. Laboratory tests soon revealed that they were both infected with a new subtype of influenza. Within two weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention activated its Emergency Operations Center and began work to develop a vaccine. The Strategic National Stockpile sent antivirals and personal protective equipment to states. The World Health Organization declared a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and raised the influenza pandemic alert to the highest level. The H1N1 pandemic had begun.Now, 14 years after H1N1, and with COVID-19 still roiling the world, the United States is again facing the prospect of an influenza pandemic. Avian influenza, or H5N1, has been tearing through animals for over a year, spreading more widely than it ever has before. In the United States, H5N1 has been detected in more than 6,300 wild birds and in every state. Outbreaks in commercial flocks have been registered in 47 states, leading farmers to cull over 58 million birds. It has been found in American mammals, such as raccoons and harbor seals. And the number of affected birds and mammal species continues to grow. Yet this time, there is little evidence of the tenacity that propelled action in 2005 and 2009. Instead, the world has largely chosen to wait and see what happens next. It is a dangerous proposition. Thus far, although H5N1 has rarely infected humans, among the cases that have been diagnosed, the fatality rate has been roughly 50 percent. A bird flu that spreads efficiently among people would result in a new pandemic and exact extraordinary costs to human life, society, and the global economy.The United States needs to make sure it is ready for such a pandemic—just in case it happens. It can start by updating evaluations of how likely H5N1 is to start spreading between humans and what effect such spread would have. It should identify and prepare emergency steps to control the virus, should it mutate. The country also needs to look at the existing vaccines it has for the avian flu to see if they are effective, and it must review its distribution plans. It has to restock whatever health supplies it burned through while fighting COVID-19. And it must communicate all these steps to the U.S. population. Otherwise, the United States risks finding itself mired in another catastrophic pandemic.NO CHICKEN LITTLEAlthough it has attracted relatively little public attention, the scope of the avian flu outbreak is far beyond anything the world has seen before. The World Organization for Animal Health has recorded hundreds of H5N1 outbreaks in dozens of countries. In January 2023 alone, the organization recorded 70 outbreaks across three continents, resulting in the culling of three million birds in a three-week reporting period. Infections have also been reported in a variety of mammals, including skunks, foxes, bobcats, bears, mountain lions, and a tiger. For scientists, these cases are particularly alarming. The influenza virus is notorious for its propensity to adapt, mutate, and combine with other influenza viruses to form new subtypes. Its versatility and long track record of driving pandemics are the principal reasons why influenza has long been ranked as the top infectious disease risk. The fact that the virus is already infecting various mammals raises the possibility that H5N1 could gain the ability to spread between humans.A recent study out of Spain snapped the plausibility of this scenario into focus. Most mammal infections with the virus are one-offs, acquired when an animal has direct contact with a bird. (A fox, for example, could pick it up by scavenging a carcass.) But in Spain, investigators observed a more concerning pattern. Mink in a commercial farming facility became ill with H5N1 even though no poultry outbreaks had been reported in the region. A subsequent investigation led epidemiologists to conclude that the virus was likely spreading among the animals. Mink can become infected with both avian and human influenza viruses, which suggests they could serve as vessels for the virus to learn how to spread between people.Mink are not the only mammals that may have experienced internal H5N1 transmission. Peruvian health officials reported in March that tens of thousands of wild birds and nearly 3,500 sea lions were found dead off the country’s coast, all infected with the avian flu. The sea lions may all have had direct contact with infected birds and encountered the virus that way. But given the size of the die-off, it is possible that the virus was spreading among the mammals themselves. A rapid investigation by veterinary health officials was unable to rule out that possibility. To be clear, the mink and possible sea lion outbreaks are not themselves catalytic events that would make H5N1 a human threat. Both ended without infecting people, and the mink bout was thoroughly controlled by Spanish health authorities. But they are teachable moments, shots over the bow that show how the virus might find a path to spread in humans.READY TO ROLLThere are multiple ways that the avian flu could evolve. The virus could remain primarily a threat to animal health until it recedes, as it has in the past. It could also stay limited to animals without routinely infecting humans, becoming a persistent ecological and economic threat, including by driving up egg and poultry prices and threatening endangered species. But the third scenario, and the one of greatest concern, is that H5N1 could evolve to spread efficiently between people. It is impossible to say which of these scenarios will come to pass, and overreacting risks wasting public attention and resources. In the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks, for example, concerns about future acts of bioterrorism motivated the United States to offer smallpox vaccines to health-care workers and emergency responders. But the vaccine in use at the time was fairly risky, and smallpox attacks were a theoretical concern, so the program was stymied by low participation. Ultimately, the federal government spent important political capital on something unpopular. But an even worse failing would be to underreact to the next emerging threat, especially given the stakes. Policymakers therefore must take steps to prepare for a human H5N1 pandemic. That way, if one does emerge, the country can respond swiftly and aggressively. The most important immediate action that governments can take is to better gauge exactly how likely it is that bird flu will efficiently spread between humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a standardized Influenza Risk Assessment Tool that is meant to do just that. But the agency has not updated it for H5N1 since March 2022—before the recent explosion of cases, and before scientists gained a greater understanding of the virus. The tool should be updated now and more frequently going forward, at least until this animal epidemic ends. H5N1 could gain the ability to spread between humans.The federal government should also establish metrics and triggers for when to escalate its public health response to H5N1. During previous public health crises, officials lost time negotiating over when such a response is justified. During the 2014 to 2016 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, the international public health community infamously took months to rally because it falsely assumed the outbreak would easily come under control. The result was an outbreak that spread across the region and took 11,325 lives. To avoid repeating that error with H5N1, officials should hold discussions now with the goal of identifying clear and agreed-upon indicators for when to initiate certain emergency actions—for example, if multiple human cases are diagnosed within a short period. Relatedly, government departments and agencies with pandemic management responsibilities should explain clearly and in great detail what those emergency actions will be. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for example, might revisit its Pandemic Influenza Plan to incorporate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. (The plan was last updated in 2017.)Officials should also begin preparing public health actions—especially for how they will produce and distribute vaccines. Here, unlike with COVID-19, the United States will not have to start from scratch: the Pandemic Influenza Stockpile contains a vaccine designed to protect against H5N1. But the government must make sure this vaccine has been tested against the currently circulating strain. It must also determine whether it needs new investments to scale up vaccine production, and it should check plans to distribute doses. Right now, the vaccine is likely stored in bulk form to extend its shelf life. To be usable, the doses would instead need to be “filled and finished”—in other words, put into vials—a possibly time-consuming process that the government should map out. Finally, the United States must examine its Strategic National Stockpile. It usually holds materials necessary for successful mass vaccination campaigns, such as syringes, but its stores may have been drawn down by the government’s responses to COVID-19 and mpox (formerly known as monkeypox). If the government does not have enough of these materials, it needs to rapidly replenish them now. Finally, the federal government should increase its communications regarding the H5N1 situation and the measures it is taking to prepare. Right now, there is very little information available in the public domain, a misstep that echoes the early days of the COVID-19 and mpox epidemics. As both outbreaks have shown, information voids are inevitably filled with misinformation, whether maliciously spread or not. The United States should not let that happen again.None of this will be easy. Washington may face even greater competing crises today than in 2005, when Bush launched the country’s influenza strategy. But it also has the institutional and public memory of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can work to its advantage. And critically, it still has time. If Washington uses this opportunity right, the United States can be well prepared for a scenario where H5N1 becomes a human virus.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.You are reading a free article.Subscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.

However, a recent study led by the University of Georgia (UGA) has found that a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza – known as H1N1 – is currently killing an unprecedented number of bald eagles, thus endangering once more this species.According to the researchers, in 2022, under half of bald eagle nests along coastal Georgia successfully fledged at least one eagle, which is 30 percent below average for this region, while in a county in Florida, the success rate of nests was halved, decreasing from 86.5 percent to 41 percent.“We had reports from people who faithfully monitor eagle nests year after year with these heartbreaking stories of an adult eagle found dead below their nest. Within a few days, often its mate and the chicks were also found dead below the nest. It is clear the virus is causing nest failures,” said study lead author Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor of Veterinary Medicine at UGA.The first cases of avian influenza in bald eagles were confirmed in April 2022. Since then, the number of cases has skyrocketed, with infections reported not only in bald eagles, but also in a variety of other birds, including vultures and other raptors, waterfowl such as ducks and geese, aquatic birds like pelicans and herons, commercially farmed poultry, and even some songbirds. While 6,200 cases have been officially reported across the U.S., this number is most likely an undercount.“I think the number of wild bird cases is drastically underreported. People will submit one snow goose, for example, and it will test positive for the virus. And then they’ll tell you, ‘Well, there are thousands of geese dying at the same site.’ But it only goes down as one infected bird,” Nemeth explained.Since the virus can persist in water for over a year, the birds most at risk of infection are those living in coastal or other aquatic areas, or those that prey on birds living in such environments. Birds can catch the virus from spending time in the water and carry it to new locations during their migration, while raptors such as eagles or vultures can pick it up when they consume infected birds. Moreover, the virus has also spread to wild mammals, such as red foxes, coyotes, racoons, opossums, seals, and even some bears. While the risk posed to humans remains low, many of these species could experience significant declines.“A virus that can spread and be maintained as this virus can, it’s everywhere now. We can’t contain the virus, and we can’t vaccinate wild birds. But we can document the losses and try to help conserve affected species and populations the best we can,” Nemeth concluded.The study is published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.—By Andrei Ionescu, Earth.com Staff WriterCheck us out on EarthSnap, a free app brought to you by Eric Ralls and Earth.com.RELATED NEWS11-11-2024Deer mice shed light on adaptive evolution11-11-2024DNA evidence reveals new clues about Pompeii's eruption victims11-11-2024How did the COVID pandemic influence the seasonal flu?11-11-2024Elephant seal colony lost 95% of its pups to bird flu11-11-2024Frogs exposed to radiation show no signs of accelerated aging11-11-2024Proba-3: A mission to see the Sun like we've never seen it before11-11-2024Plants have sophisticated strategies to balance defense and growth11-11-2024Coaches who show compassion help athletes perform better11-11-2024Oil profits could save the planet if governments tax them now11-11-2024Social media is helping save wild animals like caracals11-11-2024Why do Australian finches have bright red and yellow bills?11-10-2024Memory is stored in cells throughout the body, not just the brainhomenewsnews-category/animalsNews coming your wayThe biggest news about our planet delivered to you each daySUBSCRIBEAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceSite MapStaffEARTH.COMNewsVideosImagesEarthpediaTake actionEARTHPEDIAArticlesAnimals EncyclopediaEndangered AnimalsPlants EncyclopediaEndangered PlantsEARTH NEWSBreaking NewsEnvironmentLifesyleVoicesAnimalsPlantsEarthsnapGet the appPrivacy PolicyTerms of serviceGET IN TOUCHContact Us© 2024 Earth.comAll rights reservedBird Flu Is Making Headlines but Doesn’t Threaten a Pandemic…Yet | BU Today | Boston University */ Skip to Main Content Boston University Bostonia BU Today The Brink More Publications University Publications Bostonia BU Today The Brink School & College Publications The Record Other Publications BU Today Sections Search News, Opinion, Community Bird Flu Is Making Headlines but Doesn’t Threaten a Pandemic…YetBU infectious diseases expert says scientists are watching closely A veterinarian carries out PCR tests on chickens in a farm in southwest France to check if they are contaminated with the avian flu virus in 2021.

Culling of commercial flocks to prevent further spread. Sharp increases in egg prices. At the moment, these are the main effects of a major global outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza—bird flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the public is low. But governments and scientists around the world are watching closely for any changes that could portend a new pandemic. So far there has been little to no human-to-human transmission of bird flu, says David Hamer, a Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine professor of medicine and a School of Public Health professor of public health. David Hamer. Photo by Cydney Scott The virus would have to mutate to spread widely among people, says Hamer, who is also interim director of BU’s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy & Research (CEID). There have been a small number of human cases in the last year, primarily in Asia and apparently caused by close contact with poultry. But the virus has already jumped to other mammals, including mink and foxes. And if human-to-human transmission does become a reality, the mortality rate could be high, says Hamer. Previous pandemics, such as the 1918 flu pandemic that killed about 40 million people, originated in birds. However, humans have gotten better at facing down pandemics in recent years, from field surveillance identifying outbreaks to the creation of vaccines, says Hamer. In part that’s a side effect of the coronavirus pandemic. Hamer serves as interim director of CEID until April 1, when director Nahid Bhadelia returns from a sabbatical serving as senior policy advisor for the White House COVID-19 Response Team. We talked to Hamer about the threat from H5N1, how the disease is different from other strains of flu, and why a human H5N1 pandemic is something we very much want to avoid. Q&Awith David Hamer BU Today: Let me start with a personal question. My wife volunteers at a local historic farm. One of her duties is tending to the chickens in the coop, and she brings home eggs. How concerned should we be? What precautions should we take? Hamer: Avian influenza has reached some domestic poultry populations, but it’s much more commonly being found in wild bird populations. So I think the risk is still relatively low. I think if there were an outbreak, they would be able to recognize it, because they’d have sick chickens. But good hand hygiene is important. And then, if she wanted to be really cautious, wearing a mask while she’s handling the chickens would be a reasonable thing to do. BU Today: We can’t get it from eating eggs? Hamer: It’s spread by droplets, respiratory aerosols, but also apparently through close contact with infected birds. And so if you get it on your hands and rub your nose, eyes or mouth, you could become infected. BU Today: The poultry industry is culling millions of sick birds worldwide, but the disease has also hit wild bird populations very hard? Hamer: Wild outbreaks were confirmed in 47 US states, according to a Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) alert, so it is very widespread. We find it in ducks, gulls, pelicans, swans, vultures. It’s been found in just about all sorts of different species of wild birds. BU Today: This is not a new disease? Hamer: It’s been around for a couple decades; we’ve been watching sporadic cases. Most of the human cases have been in Southeast Asia, and with a couple of exceptions almost all of those are single episodes, or maybe a family at most, that often had home poultry operations, a lot of close contact with sick chickens, and then became infected. But the notable thing is that it hasn’t generated additional personal-to-person spread. BU Today: It’s said there have been at least 14 human cases reported in recent months, 11 of them fatal. That’s bad, right? Hamer: Our worry is that if it mutates, and becomes more able to spread person-to-person, we’re in trouble, because if you look at the sort of average fatality rate of avian influenza, it’s pretty high. One study suggests that it is 14 to 33 percent for H5N1 but they note the World Health Organization estimates up to 60 percent. This compares to 0.1 percent or less for the strains of influenza that cause annual seasonal outbreaks in humans. BU Today: Could this just fade away? I think it’s here to stay because of its widespread presence in wild bird and wild mammal populations. BU Today: How is H5N1 different from other strains of bird flu? The H and N stand for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, two proteins that are involved in attachment of the influenza virus to human respiratory mucosa and its release into the respiratory tract. There are important differences between strains. H5N1 can attack the lower respiratory tract, which leads to a severe, life-threatening form of pneumonia, but it’s somewhat less able to bind in the upper respiratory tract and lead to lots of secretions that lead to transmission. BU Today: How does the 2009 H1N1 pandemic compare to this new threat? Influenza viruses can basically recombine between pigs, birds, and humans. The 2009 flu was a sort of recombination between pig and human elements, and it was so different that our immune systems didn’t recognize it. And that led to pretty much a global pandemic. That was interesting because a lot of the cases occurred in the spring and summer, which is not the typical time of year for influenza. BU Today: But it needs to mutate before we really have to worry? What I’m worried about is this: If there’s an interaction between pigs and domestic poultry, and there’s some sort of recombination between a swine influenza and an avian influenza that has the right characteristics to infect humans and be transmitted person-to-person, then we could have a pandemic. BU Today: Given what happened with COVID-19, how prepared are we? There is some vaccine development. We have treatments. We have antiviral drugs for influenza A and B, the main types of the virus that cause human infections. The neuraminidase inhibitors, the main category of drugs we use, should work against avian influenza, but we may need to be ready with additional new treatments that work if there’s an outbreak, as well as vaccines.I also think we have better surveillance systems in place than we did 20 years ago, or even a decade ago. There’s a lot more attention being paid to identifying novel viruses, and I think COVID has helped accelerate that process. But we definitely need to be on our guard. Of new diseases, most are zoonotic—they’re coming from animals. And so we really need to be monitoring animal populations anywhere there’s a greater interface between humans and animals. That’s backyard poultry operations and people in the rainforest where they’re cutting down the forest and having close contact with wild animals, both examples of settings where animal-to-human spillover events may occur.

Bird Flu Is Making Headlines but Doesn’t Threaten a Pandemic…Yet 0 share thisBird flu killed hundreds of seals in New England last year - Earth.comSubscribenewsvideosimagesearthpediatake actionearthsnapshopSubscribe03-15-2023Bird flu killed hundreds of seals in New England last yearByChrissy SextonEarth.com staff writerA new study from the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine has revealed that the deaths of hundreds of seals in New England were caused by bird flu. The research is the first to link a large scale mortality event in wild mammals to avian influenza. In the summer of 2022, more than 330 New England harbor and gray seals died along the North Atlantic coast. The researchers have connected this shocking event to an outbreak of avian influenza (HPAI) in the region.The Tufts Wildlife Clinic has been conducting avian influenza surveillance since January 2022, which is shortly after the H5N1 strain arrived from Europe. The testing has revealed that at least three strains of avian influenza have crossed the Atlantic, and there have been consistent waves of bird infections.In collaboration with NOAA’s Greater Atlantic Region Marine Mammal Stranding Network, the team also tested seals for bird flu. “We have a better resolution and greater depth of detail on this virus than before because we were able to sequence it and detect changes almost in real time,” said study co-first author Wendy Puryear. “And we have pairings of samples, sometimes literally from a bird and a seal on the same beach.”“Because of the genetic data that we gathered, we were the first to see a strain of the virus that’s unique to New England. The data set will allow us to more meaningfully address questions of which animals are passing the virus to which animals and how the virus is changing,” said co-first author Kaitlin Sawatzki.Domestic poultry and seabirds are highly susceptible to the H5N1 strain of bird flu. This particular strain is responsible for about 60 million poultry deaths in the U.S. since October 2020. The experts determined that at the time of the seal mortality event in New England, seagulls were getting hit hard by the H5N1 virus. There are lots of ways gulls and other birds may transmit the virus to seals, and not just through direct contact, noted the researchers.The highly pathogenic H5N1 is associated with a death rate of nearly 100 percent among domestic and wild birds, and the Tufts research indicates that there is a similar fatality rate for wild mammals. According to the study authors, none of the stranded seals that tested positive for bird flu recovered.“It’s not surprising that you might have transmission between the seals, because it has happened with low pathogenic avian influenza,” said Puryear. “However, we can’t say definitively whether or not there has been mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAI.”“To get strong evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission, you need two things: lots of infected animals and time,” explained Sawatzki. “Time for the virus to mutate, and time for the mutated virus to be transmitted to another seal.”“As the virus acquires mutations, we can see shared mutations in the sequences that are specific only to mammals and that haven’t been seen in a bird before. We had the numbers, but this outbreak didn’t last long enough to provide evidence for seal-to-seal transmission.”The team found evidence that the virus had mutated during the mortality event, but there has not been a case of bird flu in seals along the Atlantic coast since the end of summer 2022.The CDC reports that the risk to the public remains low, with less than 10 human cases of H5N1. In these cases, the individuals had direct contact with infected poultry.The ultimate public health threat associated with bird flu, however, is not yet known. According to the World Health Organization, 868 cases of human infection with H5N1 have been reported worldwide since 2003, and the fatality rate was over 50 percent.The study is published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.–—By Chrissy Sexton, Earth.com EditorCheck us out on EarthSnap, a free app brought to you by Eric Ralls and Earth.com.RELATED NEWS11-11-2024Deer mice shed light on adaptive evolution11-11-2024DNA evidence reveals new clues about Pompeii's eruption victims11-11-2024How did the COVID pandemic influence the seasonal flu?11-11-2024Elephant seal colony lost 95% of its pups to bird flu11-11-2024Frogs exposed to radiation show no signs of accelerated aging11-11-2024Proba-3: A mission to see the Sun like we've never seen it before11-11-2024Plants have sophisticated strategies to balance defense and growth11-11-2024Coaches who show compassion help athletes perform better11-11-2024Oil profits could save the planet if governments tax them now11-11-2024Social media is helping save wild animals like caracals11-11-2024Why do Australian finches have bright red and yellow bills?11-10-2024Memory is stored in cells throughout the body, not just the brainhomenewsnews-category/animalsNews coming your wayThe biggest news about our planet delivered to you each daySUBSCRIBEAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceSite MapStaffEARTH.COMNewsVideosImagesEarthpediaTake actionEARTHPEDIAArticlesAnimals EncyclopediaEndangered AnimalsPlants EncyclopediaEndangered PlantsEARTH NEWSBreaking NewsEnvironmentLifesyleVoicesAnimalsPlantsEarthsnapGet the appPrivacy PolicyTerms of serviceGET IN TOUCHContact Us© 2024 Earth.comAll rights reservedH3N2 Virus Spread In India: Here's How It Can Be PreventedNDTVWorldProfitहिंदीSportsMOVIESFOODLIFESTYLEHEALTHSWASTHTECHInfluencersGamesBig BonusSHOPPINGAPPSLive TV Latest Elections India World Cities Education Opinion Videos Auto India@AI OffbeatWeb StoriesScienceTrendsPhotosFeaturePeopleTV ScheduleH3N2 Virus Spread In India: Here's How It Can Be PreventedSearchNewsHealthH3N2 Virus Spread In India: Here's How It Can Be PreventedRead inOther Languages हिंदी में पढ़ें This Article is From Mar 14, 2023 H3N2 Virus Spread In India: Here's How It Can Be Prevented The H3N2 is a subtype of Influenza A virus. It was first identified in pigs in the US in 2010. Later in 2012, 12 infections were detected in humans followed by several H3N2 outbreaks in the same year. HealthPosted by Varsha VatsUpdated: March 14, 2023 1:34 pm ISTH3N2 influenza is a highly contagious virusThe H3N2 influenza is spreading rapidly in different parts of the country. The patients report flu-like symptoms which last for approximately 5 to 7 days. The sudden change in weather from extremely cold to hot has been identified as the main reason behind the rapid spread. Cough, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, diarrhea, runny nose and continuous sneezing are common symptoms of H3N2 influenza. In severe cases, the patient may experience discomfort in chest, difficulty in swallowing and continuous fever. The Ministry of Health has shared several guidelines that can help prevent you from catching the virus. Let's take a look at these prevention steps.H3N2 Influenza: Prevention steps you must follow1. Maintain hand hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water frequently or using hand sanitizer2. Avoid touching your face and nose3. Wear a mask and avoid crowded places4. Cover your mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing5. Avoid close contact like shaking hands6. Do not spit in public7. Drink plenty of waterThe Health Ministry and other health officials have also warned against the use of antibiotics to treat this infection.Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Grover, Head of Critical Care & Pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital said, "Firstly it is important to maintain all kinds of hygiene especially the respiratory hygiene. It is critical to adopt appropriate self-respiratory hygiene techniques to avoid the catching of infection. Avoid going in congested locations and always wear a mask when out in public. Before eating and after utilising public transit, wash your hands with soap and water. When you can't clean your hands, apply hand sanitizer. It is also advised for people to stay away from individuals who are sick."H3N2 influenza can spread easily from an infected person. Transfer of infected droplets via air, direct contact or surfaces can transfer it from one person to another.Who is at a higher risk?Children, senior citizens, pregnant women and people with pre-existing health conditions are at a higher risk of catching the virus.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Grover, Head of critical care & Pulmonology - CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram)Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

These include decreased administration of vaccines, leading to greater risk of vaccine-preventable diseases in children. The CDC recommends health care providers work with families to update children’s vaccines.Children who have missed vaccines should be contacted to schedule in-person appointments, and these children could be identified using state-based immunization information systems and electronic health records. Sick child visits should also be separated from well child visits.Methods of separating sick child visits from well child visits include scheduling them at different times of the day, reducing crowding in waiting rooms, and determining different locations for sick children and well children to visit through collaboration with health care providers.A CDC program known as Routine Immunization Schedule for Everyone (RISE) provides strategies to ensuring vaccination. Recommendations from RISE include catching everyone up on immunizations, determining who is behind on their vaccinations, making strong vaccine recommendations, and assuring vaccines are easy to find and afford.There were 7 vaccines added to the immunizations schedule. New COVID-19 vaccines, new abbreviations for COVID-19 vaccine products, and revised text for vaccine injury compensation were included in the updates. The pneumococcal vaccine has also been added to the catch-up schedule, with 8 weeks marking the final dose. Only children aged 12 to 59 months require a dose, regardless of risk.Injury claims for the COVID-19 vaccines are administered through the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP). This is because they were developed in response to a public health emergency. The national Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) resolves vaccine injury claims for most other vaccines in children and adolescents.Another recent change was made to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, with bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines recommended by the FDA in children aged 6 months to 4 years. This includes a single booster dose in these children at least 2 months after completing primary vaccination. Age-appropriate vaccine products should be administered for each dose.A revision was made to the dengue vaccine note, clarifying the vaccine is only recommended in children afflicted with dengue previously. Children traveling to dengue-prevalent areas should not be vaccinated.Clarification was also made for hepatitis B vaccines in children. In addition to the birth dose, infants of hepatitis B positive mothers require 3 additional vaccine doses. Certain hepatitis B vaccines were also included in the catch-up vaccination section for individuals aged 18 years. These vaccines are the Heplisav-B (DYNAVAX) and PreHevbrio(VBI Vaccines) vaccines.The live attenuated influenza vaccine also received an update, with indications it should not be given to individuals in close contact to immunocompromised people needing a protective environment and individuals with egg allergies. Trivalent vaccines are recommended for use in the 2023 to 2024 influenza season by the World Health Organization.In the case of a measles outbreak, information on outbreaks should be checked on the CDC’S measles outbreak website to determine what actions should be taken in individuals vaccinated against measles.Meningitis vaccines also received an update. In children aged under 10 years needing a meningitis vaccine for travel, Menveo liquid (Groups A, C, Y, and W-135) Oligosaccharide Diptheria CRM197 Conjugate Vaccine; GSK) is not appropriate for use, according to the CDC. Brands also cannot be interchanged with meningitis B vaccines.A special situations section was also included for the polio vaccine, detailing recommendations for adolescents aged 18 years at increased risk of polio viruses. Adolescents are at increased risk if there is no evidence of a complete vaccination series and should receive the remaining doses.ReferenceKoslap-Petraco M.2023 CDC immunization update-schedule changes national association of pediatric nurse practitioners annual conference Orlando, FL March 16, 2023.

Philip Gruber Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Avian influenza is being confirmed on Pennsylvania farms at the fastest pace of the year-old outbreak.USDA has announced 10 outbreaks this week alone and 20 in March, which is only halfway over. About 115,000 birds have been lost, mostly in Lancaster County.Three farms — a Chester County turkey operation and two small Lancaster County flocks — were added to the list Friday.Last April remains the costliest month of the outbreak in number of birds killed. Some 3.8 million birds were lost as three large egg farms were infected. A number of the recently infected farms have just a few thousand birds and supply the live bird market system, which provides specialty fowl for a variety of cultural traditions.The state on March 15 announced a quarantine for 207 live market supplier farms in Lancaster and Chester counties. Pennsylvania had been trying to address outbreaks with training and outreach, but State Veterinarian Kevin Brightbill said officials needed to clamp down after some farms chose not to report sick birds.For a one-page summary of ways to protect birds, symptoms of avian influenza, and numbers to call, go here.

Experts Explain Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment OptionsWhat Is H3N2? Experts Explain Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment OptionsIndia’s current outbreak is sounding the alarm—but no need to panic, yet.By Korin MillerPublished: Mar 14, 2023Save ArticleJump to:What is H3N2?Should you be worried about H3N2?H3N2 symptomsHow is H3N2 treated? An outbreak of H3N2 flu in India has left at least two people dead, according to health officials in the country. The virus is known for causing severe illness in young children and older adults. So it’s only normal to wonder what exactly H3N2 is, and what you can do to protect yourself from the swine flu variation. Health experts in India are calling for people to wear masks, practice careful hand hygiene, and get a flu shot if they haven’t already. While the current outbreak is happening across the globe, it’s captured the attention of people outside of the country given how easily infectious diseases can spread. The H3N2 strain “tends to be particularly hard on vulnerable populations,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.That said, flu season in the U.S. is currently wrapping up—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that seasonal flu activity is low across the country, although the most frequently reported flu cases were H3N2. According to CDC estimates, there have been at least 26 million flu illnesses, 290, hospitalizations, and 18,000 deaths from flu this season so far.Sure, with everything we’ve been through over the past three years, it’s understandable to feel a little nervous when you hear about an outbreak. So, do you need to worry about H3N2 in the U.S.? Here’s the deal.What is H3N2?In general, H3N2 is a strain of the flu that you want to avoid, if possible. But experts point out that the U.S. just faced a flu season with H3N2. H3N2 flu viruses began circulating in people in 1968, according to Penn Medicine, and have evolved in the decades since. While H3N2 viruses tend to hit vulnerable populations hard, anyone can get it.“When you have seasons that are dominated by H3N2, you tend to see more flu-related deaths,” Dr. Adalja says.“H3N2 is a strain of seasonal flu—it has been the dominant strain in this year’s influenza season, including in the U.S.,” Dr. Adalja says. “India just appears to be having a later peak than in the U.S.—H3N2 already came and went in the U.S. flu season.”Should you be worried about H3N2?Dr. Adalja says it’s unlikely we’ll see H3N2 again this season, despite how rapidly it’s spreading in India. “People have immunity because of exposure” from this season, Dr. Adalja points out. With flu season coming to an end in the U.S., it’s also unlikely that H3N2 would double back, he says.Consider this, too, per Dr. Adalja: H3N2 was one of the strains included in the flu shot. So, if you got your flu vaccine, you should be covered.Given that H3N2—which is a form of influenza A—was the dominant strain of the flu in the U.S. this season, there is a chance that we could see a “little bump” in flu cases caused by influenza B before flu season wraps up, says Thomas Russo, M.D., a professor and the chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo in New York. “There’s a tendency to have B rear its ugly head later in the season,” he explains.H3N2 symptomsSymptoms of H3N2 tend to be the same as other forms of the flu. According to the CDC, those can include:fever or feeling feverishcoughsore throatrunny or stuffy nosemuscle or body achesheadachesfatigueVomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)How is H3N2 treated?H3N2 is treated the same way as other strains of the flu, Dr. Adalja says. That means it may be treated by one of four anti-viral medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for flu:oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu)zanamivir (Relenza)peramivir (Rapivab)baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)How to protect yourself against the H3N2 fluIt’s best to get your flu shot in the fall or even early winter, Dr. Adalja says (at this point, it’s likely you’ve been exposed to the flu—and, again, the threat has mostly passed).It’s also a good idea to keep following common sense flu prevention guidelines, like practicing good hand hygiene (knowing how to wash your hands) and doing your best to stay away from people who are coughing and sneezing, says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. If you do happen to come down with the flu, call your doctor. “You can still get treated with an antiviral medication,” he says.Dr. Russo emphasizes the importance of good hand hygiene, regardless of the season. “It’s a good thing to do year-round to minimize the risk you’ll get infected with myriad infectious agents we have,” he says. “When winter is gone, we have all our summer viruses. Hand hygiene is always a good strategy.”Related StoriesWhat’s In the Flu Vaccine?Flu Vaccines May Not Protect Against Main StrainIs the Nasal Flu Vaccine the Best Choice for You?..Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowCold & Flu SeasonCan Mucinex Help You Get Pregnant?FDA Approves New Home Flu VaccineCDC Warns About Flu Deaths in KidsSo, When Is the Best Time for a Flu Shot?Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowNatural Ways to Ease NauseaHow to Get Rid of a Lingering CoughGenius Home Remedies to Soothe a Sore Throat ASAPHow to Break a Fever ASAPHow to Stop a Cold Before It Even Starts16 Best Foods to Eat When You Feel SickThis Is How Long the Flu Is ContagiousThe Best Humidifiers to Ease Cold SymptomsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Prevention.comNewsletterPress RoomGive A GiftCommunity GuidelinesSubscribeMedia KitAdvertise OnlineOther Hearst SubscriptionsCustomer ServiceA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

It has resulted in the loss of millions of birds and income for people who rely on the poultry industry. Nigeria is currently grappling with another outbreak which started in 2021.The Conversation Africa asked Clement Meseko, a virologist and expert on animal influenza, to explain the disease’s re-occurrences WHO concerned about bird flu cases in humans after girl’s death in CambodiaWhat is bird flu? How does it spread? Is it dangerous to humans? Bird flu is scientifically known as avian influenza and the pathogenic form as highly pathogenic avian influenza. It is a disease in birds (specifically poultry) caused by an influenza virus. It is highly pathogenic, meaning it causes tissue and organ damage in the host, and can kill more than 75% of the infected flock. Waterfowls like ducks are natural reservoirs of the disease. They can harbour avian flu without showing any symptoms. Many waterfowls and other wild birds are migratory, moving across and between continents – this brings them into contact with resident birds and domestic poultry. Their body secretions and excretions may contain virus that can then infect other birds and poultry. The symptoms in infected poultry include sudden death, respiratory distress, cough and haemorrhages in tissue and organs. Other animals, including pigs, horses and dogs can also be infected – and so can humans. In fact, it is zoonotic and therefore can be fatal for humans too. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infections have infected more than 880 people with about 50% case fatality globally. The virus also has the capacity to cause a pandemic: an influenza virus of avian origin, but not the currently circulating strain, caused the 1918 pandemic that ultimately killed about 50 million people – worse than the current COVID-19 pandemic. How many outbreaks have there been in Nigeria since 2006? Nigeria’s first outbreak of bird flu was confirmed in January 2006, the first epidemic in poultry in Africa. It killed millions of birds and millions more were culled to contain its spread. The economic and livelihood loss was huge as the disease spread all over the country with 100% mortality in many cases. The estimate of the economic cost of bird flu outbreak in Nigeria was over nine billion Nigerian naira (about US$32 million) – with people losing investment, livelihood and jobs. The disease was brought under control by 2008 thanks to stringent biosecurity measures like depopulation (culling), decontamination and control of poultry movement. In 2015 another strain emerged in Nigeria. Since then, new strains keep appearing. Live bird markets, common across Nigeria, are the main points of spread of bird flu while wetlands are the points of initial transmissions. Local waterfowls and other birds that may harbour avian flu come into contact with other bird species and with people. In 2006, 312 cases and in 2015, 256 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were recorded. What should Nigeria be doing differently? The disease may become endemic in Nigeria if circulation continuous and detection of the same strain is established. If a disease is constantly circulating in reservoir hosts it will lead to spill over to poultry and humans. If that’s the case, biosecurity measures must be stepped up. For instance, the government may consider other measures in addition to biosecurity. This may include controlled and regulated vaccination. There are vaccines. They have been used in Egypt, China, Indonesia with a mixture of failure and success. Vaccines only reduce the impact of the disease but do not prevent infection or re-infection. Those in the agricultural sector also need to introduce effective control measures at live bird markets and in the way poultry is traded more broadly. Measures would include restructuring the live bird markets, discouraging the mixing of species, the introduction of plastic cages and crates that can be easily cleaned and disinfected. Frequent cleaning, disinfection and decontamination of live bird market environments is very important for disease containment. You’ve described as Nigeria was an “ecological sink” for such viruses. Please explain In the research that examined the outbreak of the 2015-2016 bird flu, we found that west Africa was the epicentre of the virus that was later found in other sub-Saharan African regions – the central, eastern and southern African countries. In particular, within west Africa, Nigeria was the most important point of virus introduction and a central hub in the virus spread. Bird flu is mostly introduced into Nigeria through the presence and activities of wild birds. For instance, in the 2015-2016 outbreak we identified four virus introductions into Nigeria likely from east Europe. These birds travel across continents and countries through multiple international migratory routes, in much the same way that airlines move across the world on designated routes. Three major wild bird migratory routes from Asia and Europe transverse Nigeria. That’s good news for biodiversity but bad news for disease control. Bird watchers and ornithologists have found that migratory birds from Europe move into Nigeria every year during the cold harmattan season (November - February). This is the peak time for avian flu outbreaks. Nigeria is the most affected African country in terms of the frequency and burden of avian flu. This makes it the destination “sink” of the strains that may be circulating in Europe at any given time. Because we can’t change birds’ routes or habits, it would be up to Nigerian authorities to make sure it keeps its local birds and people as safe as possible. This would include surveillance of wild birds at wetlands and the monitoring of viral infections. Early detection is vital for early warning, risk analysis and control of infection.

Last December, the average price for a dozen large eggs was about $2.60 more than the same time the year prior, as SELF previously reported. This was partially the result of avian flu (along with other issues like inflation, corporate greed, and risky factory farming practices). Since the winter of 2021–2022, bird flu has killed nearly 60 million birds in 49 states in the US, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Now, the virus is raising alarms beyond egg prices and the enormous loss of wild and domesticated birds. Following reports of the virus’s spread to other animals, experts are exploring whether bird flu could meaningfully jump to human beings from mammals, then spread from person to person. People can get the virus from birds, but, currently, there’s no evidence they can spread it to other humans.The concern that this may change is based on rising interspecies transmissions: Since 2020, bird flu has been found in a slew of animals, including minks (which are vulnerable to both human and avian flu viruses, and so are considered “mixing vessels” for a range of infectious diseases), wild foxes, sea lions, skunks, and bears, per the CDC. Thomas Russo, MD, an infectious disease expert at the University of Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in New York, tells SELF that, since the H5N1 virus has efficiently infected such a range of animals, it could theoretically evolve to become good at spreading among humans. In the worst-case scenario, this would lead to a situation similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, with large swaths of the population infected with a virus that scientists would need to scramble to treat.Let’s be really clear, though: Right now, there’s no need to panic. Currently, there’s zero evidence that humans can spread the virus to other humans. If researchers did find that the virus could spread easily among humans—for instance, if people who hadn’t been in direct contact with poultry suddenly became ill with the virus—then it would be time to worry, Dr. Russo says. “That’s the Oh, crap moment [for viruses] and, presently, that is not the case with H5N1,” he explains. But we’re not there yet, and we might not ever be.Still, there are plenty of open questions about bird flu. Below, experts break down when the current outbreak started, what’s being done to stop it, and what might come next.How did the bird flu outbreak start?Among birds, H5N1 is spread through nasal secretions, saliva, and poop, per the CDC. Birds can become sick through contact with other infected birds or virus-contaminated surfaces.The last notable bird flu outbreak occurred during the winter of 2014. Multiple strains—including H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8—circulated in the US during this time, according to the CDC. Per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died from the virus and prevention efforts from December 2014 to June 2015, when it effectively petered out. And the current outbreak has been building for years now. H5N1 was first observed in the Netherlands in 2020, Dr. Russo says. It spread in Europe, Asia, and Africa before it was eventually detected in the US in early 2022, per the CDC.What’s different about the current outbreak, according to Thainá Landim de Barros, PhD, a poultry health extension specialist at Ohio State University’s College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences, is that warmer months haven’t slowed the spread, like they did in the summer of 2015. Unfortunately, she tells SELF, the current outbreak hasn’t followed the trajectory of the 2014–2015 outbreak—rather than getting back to normal, cases continued to spread over the summer last year.Should we be worried about bird flu eventually spreading to humans?In rare cases, people in contact with avian flu–infected birds do get the virus. A few months after the H5N1 virus was identified in the US last April, a person with “direct exposure to poultry” who was exposed to infected birds tested positive for the virus, per the CDC. But since December 2021, fewer than 10 people globally have contracted the virus, the agency says. Historically, people with the virus have experienced a range of reactions: Some have had no symptoms, and others had mild illnesses (such as an eye infection or upper respiratory symptoms). In a few cases, the virus has caused severe disease, like pneumonia, and even death. We don’t fully know the circumstances surrounding the people who have died during the current outbreak (and whether they had any underlying health conditions that could have made them more vulnerable).People who work with poultry can contract the virus through prolonged contact with an infected bird; if they inhale a bird’s mucus, saliva, or poop; or if any of those things get into their eyes, nose, or mouth. Thankfully, bird flu isn’t transmitted through cooked food, so you don’t need to worry about contracting the illness through groceries you pick up at the store. “The food safety risk doesn’t exist,” Dr. Landim de Barros says.While bird-to-human cases are rare, researchers are closely monitoring the outbreak’s potential threat to humans based on transmission from mammals. If researchers were to find proof of animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission, the response could look similar to that which occurred when COVID-19 started spreading, Dr. Russo says. This may include policies that slow the spread of illness and a wide-scale vaccination campaign.What’s being done to stop the spread—and do we know when the outbreak will end?The White House recently announced it’s considering plans to vaccinate millions of chickens against bird flu. Per The New York Times, agricultural officials have started testing vaccines and discussing potential immunization plans with poultry industry leaders.In the meantime, global health authorities are working together to keep a close eye on the virus. “There are a lot of international organizations that keep assessing the risk for public health, and right now the risk is still considered low,” Dr. Landim de Barros explains. “All countries can keep their surveillance programs [up-to-date]” and promptly notify other countries when an outbreak occurs, she says. In the US, the USDA monitors bird flu by testing samples from wild bird populations. Commercial farmers also have to keep a close eye on their flocks and report cases of avian flu to a local veterinarian’s office or agricultural agent, or the USDA itself. (Farmers and other people who work with wildlife can tell if a bird is sick by swabbing the animal’s throat or sending a fecal sample for analysis.)The CDC recommends that people who work with poultry wear protective equipment, like masks, gloves, and safety goggles.Unfortunately, there’s simply no way to tell when the current outbreak among poultry will end. But it’s essential, Dr. Landim de Barros says, to keep the news of the current outbreak in perspective. Given what we’ve all been through throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be easy to spiral when you see scary headlines—but there’s truly no need to at the moment. “It’s important to tell people not to panic,” she explains. “We have so many news [stories] every day, but it’s important [to know] our parties are doing everything they can to pay attention to what is happening.”Related:A Drug-Resistant Stomach Bug Is Becoming More Prevalent—Should I Be Worried?When Will We Get an RSV Vaccine?Paxlovid Is Super Promising.

Ad ChoicesNew Home Test Can Tell If You Have the Flu or COVID | Scientific American Skip to main contentScientific AmericanMarch 15, 20234 min readNew Home Test Can Tell If You Have the Flu or COVIDFlu and COVID symptoms are easily confused. A new home test—the first for flu—tells them apart in minutesBy Allison Parshall Johnce/Getty ImagesFor three pandemic years, people with runny noses and fevers have sweated out a tough question: “Is this COVID, which has killed more than a million Americans, or is it a more familiar flu?” Many of the symptoms overlap. But now the first home test that distinguishes between COVID and the flu has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. With just one swab, the test can differentiate between three respiratory viruses—the COVID-causing pathogen SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and B—with high accuracy in 30 minutes.Unfortunately, the future of the product remains uncertain. The FDA’s emergency use authorization for the test was issued in late February, just two days after the test’s manufacturer, Lucira Health, announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.The flu-and-COVID test had already been authorized for home use in Canada and Europe, as well as for U.S. health care settings such as hospitals and doctor’s offices, prior to the FDA’s emergency use authorization. Now it has been authorized to be sold directly to consumers without a prescription in the U.S. Its technology is closer to elaborate lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests than to the frequently used home antigen tests. Like PCR, Lucira’s product uses enzymes to replicate viruses’ genetic material and amplify it to a level at which it can be easily recognized. It is more sensitive than antigen testing.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

(The test did even better at detecting samples that were negative for these viruses: it had at or close to 100 percent accuracy. This is important because false negatives give people false reassurance.)The test also identified 99.9 percent of samples that were negative for influenza B, but these data are incomplete because that strain of the virus is not circulating in high enough quantities for researchers to conduct a clinical study. Lucira is required by the FDA to continue collecting data on influenza B.Lucira’s test uses a technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which is a little different from PCR. It is “kind of like [PCR’s] cousin,” Butler-Wu says. PCR cycles a sample through several different temperatures in order to amplify genetic material. LAMP, by contrast, can take place at just one temperature, making the processing equipment simple enough to be used at home. Lucira’s test does need power, and the single-use plastic apparatus comes with two AA batteries.The FDA’s emergency authorizations have allowed COVID vaccines, drugs and tests to enter the market since 2020. These authorizations are separate from the public health emergency that the Biden administration plans to end in May, so Lucira’s test won’t be deauthorized at that time.It is still unclear how Lucira’s bankruptcy will affect the availability of its product. The company, anticipating authorization, had manufactured sometest kits that it will now be able to sell, a spokesperson told Scientific American. Lucira is seeking to sell its business under Chapter 11 in order to resume manufacturing its products, which also include COVID-only, LAMP-based home tests. The company is not yet disclosing when the new combination test will be launched or where it will be sold, though its at-home COVID-only tests are available on Amazon and through its website.Lucira has also not yet announced the price of the at-home product, though health care providers can purchase it for $99. Canadian consumers have been able to buy it for 98 Canadian dollars, or about $72, according to Lucira’s online store. In contrast, BinaxNOW, Abbott Laboratories’ popular COVID antigen test, costs about $12 per test. For antigen tests, however, the FDA recommends using multiple assessments at two-day intervals, depending on a person’s symptoms and exposure to the virus, which drives up the total cost.One advantage of a test that tells COVID and the flu apart is that it will make it easier for doctors to figure out proper treatment quickly. “For flu, I might get Tamiflu, and then for [COVID], I might get Paxlovid,” Butler-Wu says. “So that’s where having that information can be really helpful.”Getting that news at home from a test can speed up a normally slow diagnostic and treatment time line, says David Peaper, a medical microbiologist at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of these medications are very time-sensitive, so that they need to be started within a certain number of days of the onset of illness,” he says. But outside of flu season, the combination test may be less valuable. It may be better to not test for flu at all when the virus isn’t circulating, Peaper warns, because taking unnecessary tests risks false-positive results that can mislead doctors and patients about care.The explosion of home testing during the pandemic has changed how both patients and doctors approach diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease, Peaper says. Prior to the spread of COVID, the only comparable FDA-approved home tests were for HIV. Now tests are in development for strep throat and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). “I think it’s really created a change in expectations,” Peaper says. “It’s a clear demonstration that patients can do these things at home.”Rights & PermissionsAllison Parshall is an associate news editor at Scientific American who often covers biology, health, technology and physics.

Now, H3N2, which has been causing a wave of infections in parts of India, is a subtype of the seasonal Influenza virus. So how dangerous is it and should we be worried about it? Find out here.By Akriti Anand March 14, 2023, 4:05:55 PM IST (Updated)7 Min ReadThe H3N2 influenza virus, which has claimed two lives in India this year, has put citizens and the government on guard again with the horrors of the COVID pandemic still fresh in minds of the people. The fact that H3N2 causes the flu and is capable of triggering an epidemic has alerted health officials in the country. But how dangerous is it and should we be worried about it? Find out here. 1. The challenge of getting the right diagnosis The wave of infection caused by the H3N2 influenza virus in various parts of India is being reported at a time when the coronavirus variant (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 infection has still not completely gone. While citizens have now learnt to live with the COVID-19 virus, an outbreak of another viral infection might pose a challenge to the right diagnosis of the illness. Is it the common cold, flu or COVID-19? That's the question one might ask when dealing with symptoms that are common to all three. Difference between common cold, flu and Covid-19 | A symptom check Influenza can cause severe illness or death, especially in people at high risk. Here's how it is different from COVID-19 and the common cold: SymptomCommon ColdFluCOVID-19Caused by many virus, but mostly it is rhinovirusCaused by Influenza virusCaused by SARS-CoV-2Symptom onsetGradualAbruptHeadacheRareUsuallyUsuallyCoughUsuallyUsually (can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks)Usually (dry)Muscle achesSometimesUsuallyTirednessSometimesUsuallyUsuallySneezingUsuallyUsuallyRarelySore throatCommon/UsuallySometimes/UsuallyUsuallyRunny or stuffy noseCommonUsuallyUsuallyFeverRare to sometimesUsuallyUsuallyDiarrheaNeverSometimes (more common in children)SometimesNausea or vomitingNeverSometimes (more common in children)SometimesNew loss of taste or smellSometimes (especially with a stuffy nose)RarelyUsually (early — often without a runny or stuffy nose)Shortness of breath or difficulty breathingMay have difficulty breathing due to Stuffy noseUsuallyUsually (Info credits: CDC and Mayo Clinic) Besides this, the other way to determine the nature of the pathogen is a laboratory diagnostic test. The H3N2 influenza virus sample can be collected from nasal, throat, tracheal aspirate and "nasopharyngeal secretions" or washings and then be sent to the lab for confirmation. "...a rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) method is used (to detect the nature of the virus)," PharmEasy explained. RT-PCR methods can also be used for the same.\ ALSO READ | Rise in flu, adenovirus cases in India — but how do you tell them apart 2. Not the first time India witnessing such a flu outbreak India witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza every year - one from January to March and the other in post-monsoon season, said the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in a press release. The government has, however, estimated that the cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end. H3N2 is a subtype of the seasonal Influenza virus. 3. Death and severe disease due to influenza According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) report in 2017, annual epidemics are estimated to cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths. Meanwhile, a report in Our World in Data says, "The risk of death from influenza has declined over time, but globally, hundreds of thousands of people still die from the disease each year." The CDC said that the severity of human illness associated with H3N2v resembles that of seasonal flu. While there are groups that are more at risk of severe disease and hospitalisation than others, the CDC says that infections with influenza viruses (including variant viruses like H3N2v) can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. The WHO says hospitalisation and death occur mainly among high-risk groups. However, a health ministry report in 2017 said that in India, "available information suggests that in the post-pandemic period (2012-2015) Seasonal Influenza has affected persons mainly in all age groups". Meanwhile, the CDC said that the severity of human illness associated with H3N2v resembles that of seasonal flu. 4. H3N2 influenza caused epidemics in the past Th H3N2 virus "seems to spread more easily to humans from pigs than other swine influenza viruses", the CDC said. It added that "influenza viruses are always changing. It’s possible the H3N2v virus could change and begin spreading easily from person to person". H3N2 influenza, also known as "Hong Kong flu," is a subtype of the influenza A virus that causes respiratory illness in humans. This subtype has caused several influenza epidemics in the past and only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics, the WHO said. The 1968 pandemic was caused by an influenza A (H3N2) virus, the CDC said. Meanwhile, Randeep Guleria, the former head of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), was quoted by ANI as saying that: "We had a pandemic many years ago because of H1N1. The circulating strain of that virus is now H3N2 and, therefore, it is a normal influenza strain." In June 2009, the WHO declared the H1N1 pandemic. This is also popularly referred to as the swine flu pandemic 5. 'Cocktail of viruses' in the air — is it a threat? No The "cocktail of viruses" in the air, which has increased infection from H3N2, Type B influenza, adenovirus and COVID-19, is not alarming but a usual trend, the chief of ICMR-run National Influenza Centre (NIC) was quoted by News18.com as saying. NIC head Varsha Potdar said, "These are seasonal influenza viruses. One or two viruses co-circulate with one virus predominant in the season." "From August to October, H1N1 was predominant, whereas, from November, H3N2 starts dominating. Now, type B virus is also in circulation along with H3N2," she added. The health ministry had last week raised an alarm over a spike in COVID-19 positivity rate in some states and called for strict vigilance. On Sunday, India recorded over 500 Covid-19 cases after more than 100 days. This has prompted health experts to urge citizens to mask up and follow COVID-appropriate norms. Randeep Guleria said there is a need for people to use face masks and follow hand hygiene. According to a Times of India report, he even urged vulnerable groups to take vaccines, saying that COVID-apt behaviour further delays immunity to other viruses. "The jabs comes as a new vaccine every year and quadrivalent vaccine covers both influenza A and B and their subtypes," Guleria was quoted as saying. Is there any vaccine for influenza? The WHO recommended annual vaccination to protect against influenza. "Among healthy adults, influenza vaccine provides protection, even when circulating viruses do not exactly match the vaccine viruses," it said, adding that, influenza vaccination may be less effective among the elderly in preventing illness, but reduces the severity of disease and incidence of complications and deaths. Who can get flu vaccine in India? The Advisory Committee on Vaccines and Immunization Practices has said that influenza vaccine in India has not been recommended for Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) yet. This is because "data on morbidity and mortality of influenza in India is very limited and current status does not justify the prioritisation of strategies for influenza prevention and control". In the 2017 report, the government of India recommended the vaccination of high-risk groups with the seasonal influenza vaccine. The vaccine is said to be "desirable for elderly individuals (≥ 65 years of age) and children between 6 months to 8 years of age. There are other prioritized groups which one can check out here. Meanwhile, the Serum Institute of India said the vaccine is known to be safe in children from 2 to 17 years of age and is not licensed for use in children younger than 2. "LAIV has been approved for use in healthy adults and the elderly also (without a history of egg allergies or asthma)," it added. WHO recommends annual vaccination for: > Pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy > Children aged between 6 months to 5 years > Elderly individuals (aged more than 65 years) > Individuals with chronic medical conditions > Health-care workers The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommended the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine earlier.Continue ReadingFirst Published: Mar 13, 2023 6:38 PM ISTCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Representational image. Photo: Celso Pupo/Shuttersto Topic | Kerala Thiruvananthapuram: Seasonal infections are on the rise as the summer advances. Flu caused by both H3N2 and H1N1 viruses has been now reported from across Kerala. The total number of H3N2 flu cases reported in Kerala has touched 13. The latest three cases were confirmed from Ernakulam district, while the remaining 10 patients who were earlier diagnosed with the viral disease belong to Palakkad and Alappuzha. Health authorities said that the condition of none of the patients was critical. RELATED ARTICLES Malappuram Nipah surveillance: Kerala health workers survey 27,908 houses to identify fever cases Malappuram Weekend trip proved fatal for Kerala boy, Nipah infection source wild hog plum? In Kerala, facilities to conduct the tests to confirm the disease are currently available only at the unit of the National Institute of Virology in Alappuzha. However, as the Institute is overburdened with samples, the results for H3N2 tests are being delayed. In view of the situation, the authorities have initiated procedures to conduct tests for H3N2 at the Public Health Laboratory in Thiruvananthapuram also. Meanwhile, the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) advised elderly people, young children, expectant women and people suffering from serious ailments to exercise caution regarding H3N2. They should seek treatment as soon as symptoms of the disease, which is a variety of influenza (flu), are observed, said DHS authorities. Persistent cough, sometimes accompanied by fever, being reported across the country for the past two to three months is due to Influenza A subtype H3N2, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) experts said recently. The H3N2, which has been in wide circulation for the past few months, causes more hospitalisations than other subtypes, said ICMR scientists who keep a close watch on ailments caused by respiratory viruses through the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories network. Two people died of H3N2 influenza virus in the country on Friday. The first death was reported in Karnataka and the second in Haryana, the Union Health Ministry sources said. An increase in the number of H1N1 cases also was noticed in Kerala. While the virus has been detected in 19 persons so far in March, one person succumbed to the disease, the authorities added. Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. The 4 types of seasonal influenza viruses are types A, B, C and D. The general symptoms are a sudden onset of fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and a runny nose, says a WHO advisory.

According to the experts, these proteins could be used to better defend against the flu. “The main antigenic targets of influenza virus are two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Whereas the structural and dynamical properties of both glycoproteins have been studied previously, the understanding of their plasticity in the whole-virion context is fragmented,” wrote the researchers. To investigate, the team conducted detailed simulations of the influenza A H1N1 virion, or the swine flu. The experts concluded that the visualizations show many new vulnerable states of flu viruses, which could improve future vaccines and antiviral drugs.

Whatâs next? Read on âEgg prices have soared since early 2022, reaching about $4.25 a dozen. An avian flu outbreak and increasing fuel, feed and packaging costs have contributed to egg supply shortages and the high prices.

For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 9 & 10 are also shown. Please refer Seasonal Influenza for Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) - ILI Surveillance Actual increase in the number of ILI cases has been seen in FSM, Fiji, CNMI, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga, RMI Samoa and Palau. The increased ILI cases seen in Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Samoa may be due to the increased number of sites reporting for the week. The reduction in the number of ILI cases has been seen in New Caledonia may be due to the decreased number of sites reporting for the week. No ILI cases were reported from Cook Islands, Pitcairn Islands and Niue for the week. No reports were available from Guam, Tokelau, and Tuvalu for the week. American Samoa and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease. Influenza Fiji WK10, ongoing seasonal influenza surveillance has detected that 28% of NPS samples were positive for Influenza virus. Out of this, 4% of influenza A/H1pdm and 96% Influenza B/Victoria lineage detected; The proportion of positivity has increased by 47% compared with that of the past week (19%).

The researchers found that black swans lack some of the immune-related genes that are needed to fight off bird flu and other viral illnesses. “The Australian black swan (Cygnus atratus) is an iconic species with contrasting plumage to that of the closely related northern hemisphere white swans,” wrote the study authors.“The relative geographic isolation of the black swan may have resulted in a limited immune repertoire and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, notably infectious diseases from which Australia has been largely shielded.”“Unlike mallard ducks and the mute swan (Cygnus olor), the black swan is extremely sensitive to highly pathogenic avian influenza.”Study co-author Dr. Kirsty Short noted that black swans can die from the avian flu HPAI within three days.“Our data suggests that the immune system of the black swan is such that, should any avian viral infection become established in its native habitat, their survival would be in peril,” explained Dr. Short.“We currently don’t have HPAI in Australia, but it has spread from Asia to North America, Europe, North Africa and South America.”When the bird flu was introduced to new locations, such as Chile and Peru, it killed thousands of wild seabirds, noted Dr. Short. “The risk to one of Australia’s most unique and beautiful birds is very real, and we need to be prepared if we hope to protect it.”The researchers hope their findings will be able to better protect not only the black swan, but also other susceptible species across the globe.“We want to increase awareness about how vulnerable Australia’s bird species are to avian influenza and the highly precarious situation they are in,” said Dr. Short.The research was funded by the Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award.The study is published in the journal Genome Biology.–—By Chrissy Sexton, Earth.com EditorCheck us out on EarthSnap, a free

Often described as the ‘problem child of seasonal flu’, every time it strikes, both hospitalisations and deaths skyrocket. The H3N2 outbreak is characterised by a more severe illness lasting longer and is almost always responsible for one of the worst flu seasons. Of the last five quite severe influenza seasons, three were caused by H3N2, research has shown. In 2018, it wreaked havoc in the United States. This year, it is India’s turn.

Details of the death recorded in Gujarat on March 14, 2023 of a 52-year-old woman are not yet available. Of the hospitalised patients, 6 per cent had clinical signs of pneumonia and 6 per cent had seizures, 7 per cent went on to develop severe disease requiring attention by Intensive Care Units while 10 per cent needed supplemental oxygen, according to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data. On March 10, the Union health ministry held a meeting to review the situation. “Every year, India witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: One from January to March and another in the post-monsoon season. The cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end,” the ministry noted. Since then, several state governments have begun initiating mitigation measures; the Goa government announced a high-level meeting to discuss monitoring of H3N2, the Karnataka government has reinstated the mask mandate, while Delhi, Noida and Gurugram are on high alert.However, H3N2 isn’t exactly a novel virus. India, and several other countries, have reported its outbreak several times in the preceding years. Read more: The number of new flu viruses is increasing, and could lead to a pandemicThe annual seasonal flu is usually caused by co-circulating two influenza A strains representing the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes and two influenza B strains representing the Victoria and Yamagata lineages. The first detection of H3N2 dates back to 1968 from Hong Kong, when the virus jumped into humans, resulting in more than a million deaths worldwide. “Prior to this outbreak, there was no documentation of H3N2 viruses circulating in humans. Most likely, circulating human H2N2 viruses re-assorted with avian H3N2 influenza viruses that resulted in a novel H3N2 viral strain that possessed the ability to infect and transmit between humans,” said a 2018 paper published in the journal Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics. Since this viral subtype first infected humans, it has evolved rapidly to escape host immunity and improve its survival chances. “The adaptations acquired by modern H3N2 Influenza A viruses (IAVs) create difficulties in recognising and predicting current and future epidemiological threats,” the 2018 paper noted.However, adopting changes to the standard methods used to analyse H3N2 viruses would allow researchers to continue to study and better understand this ever-changing subtype of influenza viruses, it added.We are yet to fully understand why an H3N2 infection is so debilitating. Read more: Between 1918-19 Spanish flu and COVID-19, not much has changed“H3 viruses dwarf the contribution of H1 to overall epidemic burden [of influenza] in terms of hospitalisations, care facility outbreaks, deaths,” flu expert Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist with the British Columbia Center for Disease Control, was quoted as saying by news website STAT. I think uniformly, in public health, we dread H3N2 epidemics over and above those due to H1N1, Skowronski further said. This coupled with its fast-mutating characteristic makes developing vaccines not just essential but also tricky. While a flu vaccine is available and is updated every year depending on what strain is dominant in circulation, it isn’t as effective against the H3N3 strain. The flu vaccine is typically protective against H3N2 roughly 33 per cent of the time. In comparison, its efficacy is nearly double of H1N1.Read more: WHO influenced H1N1 vaccine purchase?

According to public data by the Health Department, since January, H3N2 cases accounted for 79 cases, out of which, 109 cases were tested for influenza type. During the January-March period, there were only 19 confirmed cases of Influenza B while the H1N1 sub type (three cases) appeared to be receding.Puducherry has not reported any deaths from H3N2. At present, only two H3N2 cases are registered. The H3N2 strain has affected mostly 16-49 age group , with the data showing that the demographic segment accounted for 50% of all patients. “The virus spread could already be on a downward curve”, said G. Sriramulu, Health Director. “In fact, the Indian Council for Medical Research had estimated that the virus surge was expected to start subsiding by the end of March,” he pointed out.“The mandate to the medical fraternity is to test for the influenza type among patients reporting with fever in combination with other associated symptoms such as throat pain and cough”, Dr. Sriramulu said. In addition to steps to detect the virus infection at an early stage, the Health Department has made available treatment facilities in all hospitals and Primary Health Centres across Puducherry.The department said all hospitals are running dedicated outpatient units for assessing fever. Anyone who comes to the hospital with symptoms like fever, cold, cough, sneezing, etc. is also being tested for the H3N2 virus. Preventive measures The department has appealed to the public to follow precautionary measures which include washing hands with soap, wearing face shields for those with symptoms of infection, avoiding going to crowded places, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing.

meteorologists.If you’re worried you might have the flu, one distinguishing feature of the dreaded respiratory virus is that its symptoms can come on quickly and all together.“The hallmark of influenza tends to be fever with a cough or a sore throat,” says flu expert Dr. Jonathan Temte, a professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.“For younger children, a fever with respiratory symptoms, cough, sore throat, runny nose and congestion all are suggestive of influenza.”“The other hallmark of influenza is that people tend to go from feeling well to feeling ill rapidly over the course of a few hours versus the course of over two to three days,” he adds. Along with fever, cough and sore throat, there are other symptoms as well.“Usually when people have a typical presentation of the flu, they usually develop all of their problems over the course of a few hours,” says Dr. Richard Martinello, an infectious disease specialist at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. “Usually it starts off they just don’t feel right and they know they’re not well, but then they develop a headache, muscle aches, sore throat, a dry cough and then fever.”“Typically it gets worse over the next day or two, and it can get very severe,” he adds. “One thing that makes flu a little bit different than other infections is that it comes on pretty quickly.”“With the flu, your whole body aches, you have a headache and you have a fever,” he says. “You feel miserable.”Here’s a look at common flu symptoms and expert advice on when to contact a health care provider.Fever and chills(Thinkstock)Fevers that develop with a flu infection are often higher than 101.5 and can reach 104 or 105, says Martinello. People often feel very cold, like they can’t warm up.“Sometimes you’re also having shakes and chills, where you body is shivering,” adds Martinello. “Your body is trying to warm itself up.”AdvertisementA fever with the flu often lasts up to four days, about the typical duration of illness caused by flu, says Temte.“In general, people are feeling quite ill, are not wanting to go to work or school or participate socially for typically three to four days,” he says.However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that not everybody with influenza will develop a fever.Cough and sore throat(Thinkstock) With the flu, the cough tends to be dry, and you can have a dry, scratchy and painful sore throat as well, says Temte.Body achesThe flu can also leave you feeling achy all over with muscle and body aches. “They oftentimes are so severe that any part of your body hurts if you move it,” says Martinello. “Just moving your arms and legs causes discomfort.”The likelihood of muscle aches can depend on the strains of flu virus that are circulating each year, notes Temte. “With some strains there could be more muscle aches, with some we see less,” he says.Fatigue(Thinkstock)Fatigue is a common flu symptom, and it can leave you not wanting to do much of anything. “You have no interest in doing things, very little energy to get up and participate in life in general,” says Temte.Headache(Thinkstock)The CDC calls a headache a common flu symptom. It can stretch across your whole head and sometimes be throbbing, says Martinello.Runny nose(Thinkstock) A runny nose can accompany the flu, and it’s like the one that has you reaching for the tissue box when you have a cold, says Temte.When to see a health care provider?The CDC says that most people who get the flu have a mild illness that does not require medical care or treatment with antiviral drugs. In those cases, the federal agency recommends people stay home and avoid contact with others.The CDC recommends that people who have flu symptoms should contact a provider if they are in a high-risk group for complications, are very sick or are worried about their illness.Know your flu risk.

THESE severe signs and symptoms could be a warningTIMESOFINDIA.COM / Mar 15, 2023, 18:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us 1/6​Don't delay treatment​While flu or influenza is not rare, it can still lead to severe illness or death, especially in people at high risk such as those with pre-existing comorbidity, elderly and children.Recently, India has witnessed a spike in H3N2 virus cases and hospitalization that triggers symptoms like fever, cold, cough and body aches. There has been a nearly 150 per cent rise in patients coming to OPDs with such complaints, doctors said for Delhi hospitals, according to PTI. It is important to seek medical assistance instead of self-treatment, which may worsen your symptoms if proper treatment is not taken in time. 2/6​Why children are getting hospitalized​"The reason behind the hospitalization of children is that they keep playing even when they are unwell. Hence, at times, parents also neglect the gravity and visit doctors only when infection becomes high. Hence they have to be taken to ICU or else admitted to hospital," IANS quoted Sudhir Bhandari, former Principal of SMS Medical College, Jaipur.Here are some signs which should not be ignored.3/6​High fever​Doctors share that while earlier, fever usually lasted for 3-4 days, but in these cases, the fever is not getting cured even in 6-7 days, according to IANS. Along with high fever, patients may also experience chills.Read more: Are KFT and LFT blood tests enough to assess your liver and kidney health?4/6​Persistent cough​In case of flu, a dry cough usually starts after a fever and can last for a long time. The cough is very strong and it is taking 10 to 12 days to get cured, according to experts. Along with coughing, you may also experience a sore throat.Read more: Why should pigeons worry you? Health hazards associated with pigeon droppings5/6​Pneumonia​In some patients getting infected with H3N2 virus, more infection is spreading in their lungs. This can lead to pneumonia. For the unversed, pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, leading to cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.If the condition worsens, hospitalization becomes necessary, often in elderly or young children.6/6​Weakness​Fatigue, lethargy and extreme weakness are frequent H3N2 symptoms. These may persist for several weeks even after the other symptoms have subsided. You may also experience severe and long-lasting body pain, particularly in the back, arms, and legs.While some of the above mentioned symptoms may seem to common, they should not be taken lightly as your condition can worsen, which may lead to complications like shortness of breath, persistent vomiting, low blood pressure, convulsions and disorientation.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous8 golden rules of a happy marriageindia​10 unique things only Penguins can doindia8 signs your children are driving you into social isolationindiaMalavika Mohanan captures hearts with her breathtaking photos​indiaAnanya Panday's stylish striped saree look is a perfect addition to your ethnic wardrobeindiaKeerthy Suresh shines with her radiant and irresistible charmindiaShruti Haasan channels vintage elegance in a classic satin black sareeindiaKarisma Kapoor's black net saree with cape is a masterclass in fashion eleganceindia10 unique varieties of Gulab Jamun that are must-tryFood Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Alice accuses Vivian for suggesting to use 'Women’s Card'BB18: Chum asks Karan about his struggles in the gameExcl- Nyrraa on BB18: Why Eisha, Alice weren't confronted?BB18: Vivian and Kashish clash over coffeeBB18: Rajat's controversial fights in the showBB18: Nouran slams trolls over rumours of Vivian consuming 'gutka'BB18's Hema had to sell her earrings to cover expensesBB18: Vivian orders Rajat to keep an eye on housematesArfeen refuses to shake hands with Avinash as he leaves BB18123 Photostories 5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf water5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom Shoaib Ibrahim calling Bigg Boss no more a personality show to Divyanka Tripathi admitting it is not her cup of tea: Celebs who have refused to do the show​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from school8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​'Bigg Boss18': From his intense brawl with Avinash Mishra to arguments with Vivian Dsena; Rajat Dalal's controversial fights in the show7 warm drinks to try first thing in winter morningsPeople of these 5 zodiac signs are known for their big-heart and generosity123lifestyle videos03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

According to the latest data available on IDSP-IHIP (Integrated Health Information Platform) till March 9, in 2023, India has seen a total of 3,038 lab-confirmed cases of various subtypes of influenza including H3N2. From January 2 to March 5, 451 cases of H3N2 have been reported in the country, according to data shared by the health ministry. India has also recorded its first two deaths due to seasonal influenza subtype H3N2, one each from Karnataka and Haryana. A respiratory illness, the virus spreads through infected droplets. In an advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) last week, it urged people to wash hands with soap and water if symptomatic, wear masks and avoid crowded places, and cover their mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing. Fighting H3N2 Flu: Nutrition Is Key Prachi Jain, HOD, Nutrition & Dietetics, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, shares, the three important Ms when coming to tackling a flu - Masks, medicines, and meals "To fight against any infection and flu, our immunity and immune system plays a crucial role to fight against the foreign body or infections. To strengthen our immune system, good and adequate nutrition is the key." While attaining strong immunity is a lifelong process dictated by a good lifestyle, it is important to pay attention to one's diet when one has the flu.

Know Its Symptoms, Prevention And Treatment Explained: What Is Influenza A Virus Subtype H3N2? Know Its Symptoms, Prevention And Treatment H3N2 appears to cause more hospitalisations than other influenza subtypes, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The common symptoms caused by H3N2 are fever, cough, and breathlessness. By : Radifah Kabir | Updated at : 12 Mar 2023 07:44 PM (IST) H3N2 is spread through droplets which contain the virus. If a person comes in close contact with someone who has been infected by H3N2, and inhales the aerosols exhaled by the infected person, the healthy person can also become infected.Source : Getty India reported its first two deaths from Influenza Virus A subtype H3N2 this week, in Karnataka and Haryana. The Union Ministry of Health released a statement on March 10, which said that the ministry is keeping a close watch on the morbidity and mortality of H3N2. The ministry also advised children, young adults and the elderly, especially those with comorbidities, to be careful and maintain precautions because they are the most vulnerable to seasonal influenza. H3N2, a human seasonal influenza virus Influenza viruses are of four types: A, B, C and D. Seasonal epidemics of disease in people, also known as flu season, are caused by Influenza A and B viruses. Seasonal influenza refers to the acute respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses. The only influenza viruses known to cause flu pandemics, or global epidemics of flu disease are Influenza A viruses. When a new and different influenza A virus emerges that infects people, has the ability to spread efficiently among people, and against which people have little or no immunity, a pandemic can occur, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). On the basis of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), Influenza A viruses are divided into different subtypes. So far, 18 hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 neuraminidase subtypes have been identified. There are more than 130 Influenza A subtype combinations in nature. Since there is a tendency for "reassortment", or the process of swapping gene segments, in Influenza viruses, there is a possibility that several other combinations exist, but have not been identified. When two influenza viruses infect a host at the same time and swap genetic information, reassortment can occur. Influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 are the two Influenza A strains that routinely circulate in people. In India, the cases of seasonal influenza increase from January to March, and in the post-monsoon season. According to India's health ministry, cases of seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end. In India, a structured surveillance network of 28 sites, which includes 27 Department of Health Research (DHR)-Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)'s Virus Research & Diagnostic Laboratories, and India's National Influenza Centre (WHO-NIC) at ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, is conducting an integrated surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) for the detection of human influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. The surveillance network monitored the viruses Influenza A H1N1pdm09, Influenza A H3N2, and Influenza B Victoria, for a period of nine weeks, from January 2 to March 5, 2023. Since the beginning of 2023, Influenza H3N2 has been the predominant subtype among the samples testing positive for influenza. In weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, the number of cases of influenza caused by H3N2 were 46, 57, 44, 42, 47, 61, 46, 52, and 56, respectively. Number of cases caused by different Influenza virus subtypes from January 2 to March 5, 2023 (Source: Ministry of Health) Symptoms of Influenza A H3N2 H3N2 appears to cause more hospitalisations than other influenza subtypes, according to ICMR. Of the patients hospitalised due to severe acute respiratory illness caused by H3N2, about 92 per cent had fever, 86 per cent had cough, 27 per cent experienced breathlessness, 16 per cent had wheezing, 16 per cent showed clinical signs of pneumonia, and six per cent experienced seizures. This means that the common symptoms of H3N2 infection are fever, cough, breathlessness, and wheezing, while pneumonia and seizures are rare symptoms. According to ICMR, 10 per cent of the patients with severe acute respiratory infections affected by H3N2 required oxygen, and seven percent needed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support. According to Dr. Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director - Max Healthcare & Senior Director - Institute of Internal Medicine, H3N2 is causing symptoms which are slightly different and more severe than what was seen in previous years. “Lots of patients are complaining of persistent coughs or bouts of cough which keep going on for many days, sometimes even for weeks after the flu settles. Even in the post-viral phase, lots of people have prolonged fatigue, weakness, tiredness, mental fogging, and inability to work and concentrate,” Dr Budhiraja said. According to Dr Budhiraja, the feature of H3N2 is that it triggers a certain type of reaction or inflammation in the upper airways or sometimes even in the lungs, partly because it may be allergic or inflammatory in nature. “Normally, fever, cough, and cold, body aches settle down in 3-5 days. In the present scenario, other symptoms are settling down but the dry hacking bounds of the cough continue,” Dr Budhiraja said. How is H3N2 spread? H3N2 is spread through droplets which contain the virus. If a person comes in close contact with someone who has been infected by H3N2, and inhales the aerosols exhaled by the infected person, the healthy person can also become infected. Sneezing and coughing can release droplets consisting of the virus. Also, if a person touches a surface on which the virus is present, and then directly touches their nose or mouth, they could be infected with H3N2. According to Dr. Raj Kumar, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, changes in temperature and humidity, pollution and weather changes can increase one’s susceptibility to H3N2 infection. “Changes in temperature and humidity can also affect the survival and transmission of viruses, making them more aggressive. Persistent coughing can be triggered by pollution, with particulate matter, irritating gases, and mixed pollutants having been linked to an increase in coughing and wheezing. In addition, changes in the weather can often lead to the production of mucus,” Dr Kumar said. Who is at risk for H3N2 infection? According to Dr Kumar, people with multiple underlying health-related conditions or weakened immune systems are more susceptible to developing severe symptoms due to seasonal influenza infection, and may take longer to recover from the illness. He also said that people who have been infected by Covid-19 variants have a compromised immune system. “H3N2 may be more severe because of the fact that in the last three years, people were using masks extensively and this virus subtype could not enter the body. Hence, there was a lack of adequate antibodies to fight against this. With reduced or no masks now, the virus is entering people’s bodies. Due to compromised immunity against it, people are facing the long-lasting effects of the virus. This compromised immune system probably is making people more vulnerable towards viral infection. This is especially witnessed during the changing season, which can further affect the immune system, thus resulting in infections being more aggressive and long-lasting,” Dr Kumar said. How to prevent H3N2 H3N2 infection can be prevented by wearing masks, avoiding crowded places, covering mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, avoiding touching eyes and nose, especially after touching an external surface, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking paracetamol for fever and body ache. Also, people must avoid shaking hands, must not spit in public, should not eat together sitting close to others, and must not take antibiotics or other medicines without consulting a healthcare professional. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent seasonal influenza infection. When the circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines, an influenza vaccine is the most effective. A trivalent influenza vaccine includes two subtypes of Influenza A virus, and one Influenza B virus subtype. Quadrivalent vaccines include all these viruses, along with another Influenza B virus subtype. According to Dr Kumar, lifestyle changes, rest and hydration are important to prevent H3N2 infection. “If one’s cough is caused by a viral infection, rest and hydration can provide relief. However, if the cough persists for over a week or is accompanied by other symptoms such as chest pain or difficulty breathing, it is crucial to seek medical attention. Pollution can exacerbate asthma, and the use of high-quality inhalers can aid in managing it. Lifestyle changes such as avoiding acidic or spicy foods and taking antacid medication if required can also assist in addressing acid reflux-related coughs.” Dr Kumar said. How can H3N2 be treated? The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the drug oseltamivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza. Oseltamivir is made available through the public health system free of cost. People who do not belong to the high risk group are administered symptomatic treatment However, if people have severe or progressive clinical illness due to seasonal influenza infection, they are prescribed oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, ideally within 48 hours following symptom onset. The WHO recommends treatment for a minimum of five days. If a person has asthma, he or she can be given corticosteroids. “In asthmatic people, airways become hyper-responsive to the viruses that trigger asthma-like situations. This gives them bouts of cough. These patients have to be treated with a combination of anti-allergic and asthma-like medications which basically help relax the airways and are sometimes given steroids which are more potent anti-inflammatories to reduce the swelling in the airways. Since they do respond to these medications, we can say that this is the virus that is triggering these effects in the upper airways,” Dr Budhiraja said.

(Pexels: Cottonbro)abc.net.auews/what-we-know-about-the-2023-flu-season/102113242Link copiedShareShare articleAlarming headlines and media coverage have said we've had 100 times as many influenza cases in the first two months of 2023 compared with the same time the previous year.The coverage suggested we're in for a bumper flu season, starting early, and your best protection was to get a flu vaccine when available.But that scary sounding 100 figure is misleading. Here's what's behind the figures and what we can really expect from the 2023 flu season.Comparing apples with orangesIn the first two months of 2023, there were 8,474 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. In 2022, over the same period, there were 79 cases.So it might seem this year's figures are indeed more than 100 times higher than last year's. But we shouldn't be alarmed. That's because in early 2022, influenza cases were artificially low.Behind the world's strange flu season Photo shows A woman sitting on a couch, wrapped in a cosy white blanket, sneezes into a tissue.A range of specialists are saying the COVID-19 pandemic has set off a chain of consequences that interrupted the spread of influenza, possibly throwing out seasonal trends for years to come.Strict COVID measures almost eliminated influenza outbreaks in 2020 and 2021. Shutting international borders, quarantining, social distancing and mask-wearing stopped influenza from coming into the country and spreading.Many COVID restrictions weren't relaxed until late February/March 2022. So, in January and February of that year, there were fewer opportunities for us to mingle and spread the influenza virus. It's hardly surprising there were few cases then.In fact, the rate of flu in 2023 is actually very similar to pre-COVID years (that is before 2020).As always, the reported cases represent just a fraction of the actual influenza cases. That's because many people do not seek medical care when infected with influenza or their GP doesn't always test them for it.How about an earlier flu season?Every year, it seems, influenza throws a new curve ball making predictions tricky.Flu rates in the northern hemisphere largely peaked in December 2022, two months earlier than usual.But there has been some late-season influenza B activity in the northern hemisphere this year. This is one type of influenza that causes seasonal flu. So travellers arriving and returning from the northern hemisphere have been bringing influenza to Australia for several months.Travellers from the northern hemisphere may have been bringing the influenza virus with them. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)So we expect more cases of influenza. Australia may even have an autumn surge. This occurred last year, when influenza cases rose sharply in May and peaked by June. That's two months earlier than the five-year average pre-COVID.Before COVID, influenza cases usually began to rise in April/May. This progressed to a full epidemic from June to August, often extending into September, before waning in October.So what can we expect in 2023?The start, length and severity of influenza seasons vary and are often unpredictable.Community immunity will be less than in pre-COVID times. That's because of fewer influenza infections during COVID restrictions plus lower influenza vaccine uptake in recent years.Loading...So the 2023 flu season may be at least moderately severe. This remains speculation. Flu routinely surprises us.The severity of the coming Australian influenza season will be influenced by the types of influenza that circulate, when the surge starts and when the season peaks. The effectiveness, uptake and timing of vaccinations and the degree of remaining herd immunity will all be important.Plan to get vaccinatedOnly about 40 per cent of those eligible were vaccinated against influenza in 2022, according to the Australian Immunisation Register database. Rates were highest in people aged 65 or older.However, as we saw an early influenza season in 2022 (peaking in May/June) many Australians were not vaccinated during the early stages of the epidemic.Why has my cold dragged on so long?Photo shows a woman lying on her side curled up in bed during the day, blowing her noseOccasionally a cold might turn into something more serious, requiring assessment and specific treatment, and a GP visit could be warranted. But don't rush to see your doctor.With this knowledge, it's important to be vaccinated in April/May before influenza becomes common.Now is a good time to start preparing to get your flu vaccine. Ask your GP or pharmacist when you can book yourself in.Vaccination is our best defence against influenza and is recommended from the age of six months. Younger infants receive protection if their mum was vaccinated during pregnancy.The 2023 vaccine has been updated to protect against more recently circulating strains. There are also different types of influenza vaccine, some more effective in elderly people, some free under the National Immunisation Program, some not. Other vaccines are available for people with egg allergies and for small children. It's best to discuss the vaccine options with your GP or pharmacist.Robert Booy is an Honorary Professor in the Department of Child and Adolescent Health at the University of Sydney.

(Heiko Kiera/Shutterstock)Social SharingEight skunks found dead last month in Vancouver and nearby Richmond, B.C., have tested positive for avian flu.The B.C. government says it is the same strain of avian influenza associated with the outbreak that began in April 2022.The skunks were found in residential areas in both cities and were taken to B.C.'s Animal Health Centre over concerns they may have been deliberately poisoned.British Columbia's Ministry of Agriculture says the skunks were infected with the same H5N1 strain that has caused the deaths of millions of domestic poultry since the outbreak began in April last year. The ministry says in a statement the skunks may have contracted H5N1 by scavenging on infected wild birds. The statement says while avian flu in skunks is considered to be a low risk to human health, there are always risks when people or pets come into contact with sick or dead wild animals. Since last April, the ministry says wildlife infected by the flu included more than 20 species of wild birds, two skunks and a fox found in rural areas of the province.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia Biden administration approves Willow oil drilling project in Alaska despite protest Biden administration approves Willow oil drilling project in Alaska despite protestFirst Person Cycling to work is my form of self-care — something I lost while working from homeFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Edited By: India TV Health Desk New Delhi Updated on: March 16, 2023 12:26 IST URL copied Follow us on Image Source : INSTAGRAM/SHAIK_YOUNUS_REPORTER Can antibiotics help in H3N2 cases? Here is what experts say H3N2 Virus Influenza cases rise: The recent outbreak of the H3N2 virus has caused concern among citizens who are unsure if antibiotics can effectively treat the disease. However, it is important to note that antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral ones like H3N2. Doctors explain that H3N2 is a type of influenza virus that cannot be treated with antibiotics. Doctors l also emphasize that antibiotics should not be used for treating H3N2 infections. Reports have shown that, throughout the country, seven people have died due to the H3N2 virus, with a surge in cases seen in Delhi. Dr G C Khilnani, Chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, said that the majority of ICU admissions for H3N2 viral pneumonia have been for patients over 75 years old with severe comorbidities. Can antibiotics help in H3N2 virus cases? Self-medicating with antibiotics can cause harm to the body, and health experts discourage this practice. Prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, making primary diseases difficult to treat and potentially fatal. Common side effects of taking antibiotics without consulting a doctor include underdosing, antibiotic resistance, and the spread of infection. It's important to note that not all infections require antibiotics, and they should only be used when absolutely necessary. Dengue, for example, is a viral infection that does not require antibiotics. Instead, symptomatic treatments such as fever control and hydration are recommended. Experts recommend early consultation with a specialist and the early initiation of antivirals such as Oseltamivir, along with strict bed rest, for H3N2 infections. Avoiding mass gatherings, wearing masks, and maintaining proper hygiene can also help prevent the spread of the virus. Essentially, antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like H3N2, and self-medicating with them can cause harm. It's important to consult a doctor for proper treatment and follow guidelines for preventing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks and maintaining hygiene.

In a situation report published this week, the agency said that although the threat in Europe remains low for the general public, and low to moderate for those in frequent contact with birds, the risk assessments contain “high uncertainty”.That’s because the increasing transmission of H5N1, including its introduction to the Americas and the spread in animals, has offered unprecedented opportunities for the virus to shift and reassort – a process where different strains of the same pathogen combine into something new. “The expansion of mammal species identified infected with A(H5N1) viruses, as well as the detection of viruses carrying markers for mammalian adaptation in other genes such as the PB2 that correlated with increased replication and virulence in mammals, is of concern,” the ECDC said this week. “Although the virus retained a preferential binding for avian-like receptors, several mutations associated to increased zoonotic potential were detected.”The PB2 gene was recently identified in mink in Spain. H5N1 jumped from wild birds to thousands of farmed animals – within weeks, more than four per cent had died from haemorrhagic pneumonia. In total, 50,000 mink were culled.“In most of the mammalian cases where the virus has been sequenced, we have seen a specific mutation in the PB2 gene, which allows the virus to replicate at a different body condition,” Dr Michelle Wille, an expert in avian viruses at the University of Sydney, previously told the Telegraph. “The mutation is cropping up more because there are more mammalian cases, which is likely [because of] the staggering number of avian cases.” A official checks an otter that died, amidst rising cases of bird flu infections in Peru Credit: REUTERS/Sebastian Castaneda She added that in experiments in ferrets from a decade ago, scientists identified a handful of mutations that would be needed to allow for efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission.Unlike PB2, these have not yet been spotted in nature – but the more transmission that occurs, the greater the risk that this could occur. Last month a woman in China was hospitalised with H5N1, while a young girl died earlier this month and her father was quarantined in Cambodia after contracting the virus. Sequencing of the Cambodia cases found that the virus did have the mutations expected to allow it to infect humans, but that there were no signs that the pathogen has changed to better spread between people.“The small adaptations we observe have been detected in spillover events into humans in the past, and have not resulted in sustained human-to-human transmission,” said Dr Erik Karlsson, director of the National Influenza Center of Cambodia and acting head of virology at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, which sequenced the virus. In the latest ECDC assessment, the agency said any reports of transmission events to and potentially between animals should be closely followed – especially in pigs, which are known to harbour both animal and human diseases. Just yesterday, Canada announced that eight skunks found dead in late February in Richmond and Vancouver were infected with avian influenza. They likely contracted the diseases after scavenging infected wild birds, according to officials. The ECDC also warned that there are no signs of the outbreak dwindling, and that the circulation of H5N1 may instead increase in the coming months, as “breeding bird colonies move inland with possible overlap with poultry production areas”.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Poppy Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024What is Hong Kong flu?

All you need to know as Bihar sounds alert over H3N2 caseUnion Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had written to the states and union territories, voicing concern about the surge in influenza-like illnesses and other severe respiratory ailments.Edited By Anwesha MitraPublished13 Mar 2023, 09:31 PM ISTH3N2 is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans, known as swine flu viruses. (Representative Image)(HT_PRINT)The Bihar government has sounded an alert following the detection of an H3N2 influenza virus case over the weekend. The development came even as the virus sub-varient caused two deaths in the country last week. Meanwhile, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had written to the states and union territories, voicing concern about the surge in influenza-like illnesses and other severe respiratory ailments. What is Hong Kong Flu?H3N2 Influenza is a subtype of the Influenza A virus first detected in people in July 2011. The virus had first been identified a year earlier in pigs in the US. In recent days it has been spreading rapidly through India and has caused nearly 500 cases. According to the Union Health Ministry Karnataka and Haryana have confirmed one death each from H3N2 influenza so far. H3N2 has been the dominant subtype followed by H1N1. Both these subtypes belong to Influenza 'A' type.The reference to Hong Kong - while not part of official nomenclature - comes from the 1968 flu pandemic that first broke out in the area. The Hong Kong influenza pandemic lasted till around 1970 and caused between one and four million deaths. It is believed to have been caused by the an H3N2 strain of the influenza A virus.What are the symptoms of H3N2?The symptoms can be similar to other cold and flu infections and the list includes persistent cough, headache, fever and sinus-related issues. While officials have repeatedly noted that the disease is usually mild for most patients, one should visit the hospital if they are facing difficulty breathing, have low blood pressure, high rate of breathing, bluish lips, seizures or confusion.What precautions can be taken?The Indian Council of Medical Research has urged people to wash hands with soap and water if symptomatic, wear masks and avoid crowded places, and cover mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing. The apex health research body also advised people to take plenty of liquids, avoid touching eyes and nose, and take paracetamol for fever and bodyache.It also urged people to not shake hands or use other contact greetings, spit in public, take antibiotics or other medicines without consulting doctor or eat together while sitting close to others.

Edited By Alka JainPublished15 Mar 2023, 07:49 AM ISTH3N2 is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans, known as swine flu viruses. A 58-year-old Gujarat woman died due to flu-like symptoms at a state-run hospital in Vadodara city, said an official on Tuesday, adding that the sample has been sent for H3N2 testing and the review committee will determine the exact cause of the death. DK Helaya, Resident Medical Officer (RMO), SSG Hospital said that the patient was shifted to Sir Sayajirao General (SSG) Hospital on March 11 from a private facility and she died on March 13, according to news agency PTI.“We have taken all the samples and sent them for testing. The review committee will determine the cause of the woman's death," the RMO told media persons. Gujarat has reported three cases of seasonal influenza subtype H3N2 so far this year, Health Minister Rushikesh Patel had said last week. "Till March 10 this year, a total of 80 cases of season flu were reported in Gujarat, out of which 77 are influenza of H1N1 and three of H3N2 subtypes. Not a single death has occurred here due to H3N2," Patel had said.Spike in H3N2 cases: Gujarat prepares for emergencyGujarat Health Minister Rushikesh Patel earlier requested people to remain vigilant and not panic. The minister said the H1N1 subtype dominates in the flu cases reported in the state so far, and the mortality rate was very low in both kinds of infections."As a precautionary measure, the government has implemented the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) to quickly identify an outbreak. All seasonal flu cases are being monitored on a detailed daily basis," Patel said."Necessary medicines, PPE kits and N-95 masks, etc, have been issued to health centers and hospitals. In addition, healthcare workers have been asked to carry out surveys and provide necessary treatment as per the guidelines," he added. Free testing is available at 13 government and 60 private laboratories for patients with symptoms of seasonal flu, the minister said.

This strain of flu is being considered highly infectious and has been causing long term sickness in people. The long existing cough and fever has left people with questions of safety.2/6​​Symptoms of H3N2 flu: ​The signs and symptoms of severe disease caused by H3N2 influenza can vary from person to person. The symptoms include high fever, severe headache, body pain, sore throat, severe and persistent cough , cold and congestion in the lungs. Other symptoms include body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dr. Vinay Bhatia, Head -Molecular Biology, National Reference Lab, Oncquest Laboratories Limited, Gurugram, says, “The illness is said to cause fever that lasts for 3-5 days and a prolonged cough and cold for up to three weeks. If one is finding it difficult to breathe, have low blood pressure, high rate of breathing, bluish lips, seizures, confusion, one must be taken to hospital immediately. An uptick in ICU admissions was seen mostly in those who have comorbidities and those older than 65 years of age.”3/6​People at a higher risk: Children below five years of age, people who are 65 years and older, pregnant people, and people with certain long-term health conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions are at a higher risk of developing complications due to the virus, as per CDC.Also Read: H3N2 virus influenza: When does the flu get serious? THESE severe signs and symptoms could be a warning​4/6​​H3N2 is more severe than H1N1: ​According to Dr. Bhatia, “Influenza A H3N2 infection is more severe than A H1N1 or B in terms of fever, leukopenia, and C-reactive protein. Myalgia and other symptoms such as fever, headache, general malaise and sore throat were equally frequent in influenza A H3N2, A H1N1, and B infections.”5/6​​Diagnosis of these virus infections: ​H3N2 and H1N1 viruses can be diagnosed through laboratory testing. "The sample for laboratory testing of H3N2 and H1N1 viruses is similar to the sample collected for COVID-19 testing that is the nasal swab and pharyngeal swab. The method of testing for H3N2 and H1N1 viruses is also similar to COVID-19 testing, that is RT PCR test.6/6​​Guidelines to follow: ​Health experts in India are calling for people to wear masks, practice careful hand hygiene, and get a flu shot if they haven’t already. The H3N2 strain “tends to be particularly hard on vulnerable populations.“There is no need to panic and it’s also a good idea to keep following common sense flu prevention guidelines, like practicing good hand hygiene (knowing how to wash your hands) and doing your best to stay away from people who are coughing and sneezing,” advises Dr. Bhatia.

(File Photo | AP)Ashish SrivastavaUpdated on: 13 Mar 2023, 6:07 pm2 min readCopiedNEW DELHI: A surge in the H3N2, the dominant strain of Influenza A, cases in the city has led to an increase in people turning up for flu vaccines.Hospitals and health centres told The New Indian Express that queries for the flu shot and inoculation have risen during the last 8-10 days.Dr SPB Boytra, Chairperson, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said that about 50 percent more people have taken the annual flu vaccine in recent days compared to the last year.Dr Surajit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo also said that a trend of increased vaccine (flu) uptake is driven by multiple reasons.“People are panicking and while many are aware also,” Chatterjee said.“They (people) are panicking since this particular strain—H3N2—exhibits aggrieved symptoms and affected patients take a little longer to fully recover,” he added.Dr Boytra said that increased awareness about vaccination after Covid-19 has also a role to play behind the uptick in inoculation. “People are becoming more and more aware and maybe that’s why they are willing to take the vaccine,” he added.However, doctors said the vaccine will not give immunity to people against the virus immediately after inoculation. “We are not advising against it (vaccine) but it should be kept in mind that the vaccine will not give immunity right away. It will take at least two-three weeks to develop the antibodies,” Chatterjee said.However, they also said that vaccination should be mandatory for vulnerable groups and those living with life-threatening diseases. They also added that safe public practices like use of masks and hygiene should be followed to prevent infection.“People who are involved in public dealing including healthcare workers; patients of cancer, transplant, CKD, elderly and other vulnerable groups should go for inoculation,” Dr Boytra said.The subtype of Influenza A virus has been spreading fast in the country and has claimed two lives so far, raising alarm for the central government.The illness is said to cause fever that lasts for 3-5 days and a prolonged cough and cold for up to three weeks. The H3N2 Influenza subtype causes more hospitalisations compared to other strains and the symptoms include persistent cough, headache, fever and sinus-related symptoms among others. The ICMR recently issued an advisory asking people to avoid self-medication and the use of antibiotics in this influenza outbreak.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestDelhiFlu vaccineInfluenza AH3N2Show CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

According to the health ministry data from January 2 to March 5, in all 451 cases of H3N2 virus have been reported. The ministry is keeping a close watch on the situation and cases are expected to decline from the month end, the ministry said last week.Health experts say taking a flu vaccine once a year is an important strategy."Everybody must take it. This animal flu shot is directed against four strains of influenza virus. Although none of these vaccines is 100% protective, it still gives a significant protection and especially against the strain we are talking about now. So, if you have not taken your flu shot, please go ahead, and take it otherwise make it a routine," said Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, and senior director at its Institute of Internal Medicine.Budhiraja said people should take the flu shot in September-October. "Every year's flu vaccine has slightly different composition depending on which virus strains are more prevalent. And this will reduce the impact, either will prevent you from getting infection, and if you get flu infection it generally will be a minor disease," he said.Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Data ScienceSQL Server Bootcamp 2024: Transform from Beginner to ProBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityAdvanced Excel Course - Financial Calculations & Excel Made EasyBy - Anirudh Saraf, Founder- Saraf A & Associates, Chartered AccountantView Program MarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program AstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy for Non-Finance ExecutivesBy - CA Raja, Chartered Accountant | Financial Management Educator | Former AVP - Credit, SBIView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate Java Mastery: Method, Collections, and BeyondBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI for Everyone: Understanding and Applying the Basics on Artificial IntelligenceBy - Ritesh Vajariya, Generative AI ExpertView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File StreamBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth GodinBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling AuthorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Tabnine AI Masterclass: Optimize Your Coding EfficiencyBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced C++ Mastery: OOPs and Template TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program FinanceAI and Generative AI for FinanceBy - Hariom Tatsat, Vice President- Quantitative Analytics at BarclaysView Program Web DevelopmentJava 21 Essentials for Beginners: Build Strong Programming FoundationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of Finance: Finance Beginner CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program While flu shot is not compulsory in India, experts say it should be recommended to vulnerable populations."It (flu vaccine) is important. However, making it compulsory is not required. For example, young healthy people are at low risk for severe disease," said Anurag Agrawal, former head of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), the laboratory consortium, and chair of the World Health Organisation's Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution. Hospital executives say that queries for the flu shot and inoculation have risen during the last few days."A campaign among the elderly and otherwise vulnerable would make sense," said Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at the Ashoka University.Given the rise in the number of cases, the health ministry has asked the states to closely monitor the proportion of Influenza Like Illnesses and Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses (ILIs/SARIs) in view of the rising number of influenza cases in the country.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onflu shotsinstitute of internal medicinehealth ministryashoka universitysandeep budhirajamax healthcaregautam menonanurag agrawalwhoinfluenza(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The RT-qPCR kit can detect the presence or absence of three pathogens - Influenza (H1N1, H3N2,Yamagata and Victoria sublineages), SARS CoV2, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The three pathogens have similar initial symptoms but differ in how the illness progresses, how easily they spread, and how they are treated. The kit helps identify which pathogen is causing the respiratory illness, aiding clinicians and patients to opt for the right course of treatment. The kit can help healthcare providers stay informed about the current burden of respiratory infections and be prepared for any new ones that may emerge. The kit has the shortest cycle time of 27 minutes. The time taken for result to be read can vary between 50-60 minute. It’s an open kit that can be used in all the available RT PCR equipment. The kit is evaluated by ICMR at National Institute of Virology, Pune, using 225 known positive samples and 85 negative samples. The overall sensitivity of KRIVIDA TRIVUS is 99.11% and specificity is 100%. The kit will be produced at KRIYA’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Oragadam in Chennai. The test is priced competitively, and it will soon be commercially available across the country. Comments × Thank You Your comment has been submitted for approval.

Image courtesy: ShutterstockDr Bajaj points out, “The subtype of influenza A virus is of particular concern for pregnant women. Expecting mothers are at an increased risk of severe illness and complications from the flu because their immune system is suppressed during pregnancy. While this suppression is necessary to prevent the mother’s immune system from attacking the fetus, it also leaves pregnant women more vulnerable to infections like the flu.”Complications of the H3N2 virus on pregnant womenSince pregnant women are at a higher risk of getting infected by the H3N2 virus, there are certain complications that they might face, including: Preterm labour and delivery Low birth weight Fetal distress Maternal mortality in severe cases.Flu vaccine is your best defence against H3N2 virusJust like any other virus, getting a vaccine available to fight the virus is your best defence. It’s no different in the case of the H3N2 virus! Dr Bajaj encourages pregnant women to get the flu vaccine to protect themselves and their unborn babies. “The flu vaccine is safe and effective during pregnancy and can help reduce the risk of complications from the flu. Pregnant women who receive the shot also pass on the protective antibodies to their babies thereby protecting them from the viral infection” advises the expert.Get the flu vaccine to protect yourself against H3N2 virus. Image courtesy: ShutterstockPregnant women who develop flu-like symptoms should be treated with antiviral medications as soon as possible. These medications can help reduce the severity of the illness and prevent complications. Pregnant women who are at high risk of complications from the flu, such as those with underlying medical conditions like asthma or diabetes, should be treated with antiviral medications even in the absence of noticeable symptoms, she adds.Other precautionary steps pregnant women should takeWhile getting the flu vaccine is necessary, pregnant women also need to take other steps to protect themselves from the flu. Here are some steps you should take: Practice good hygiene Wash your hands frequently Avoid close contact with people who are sick Refrain from touching their face Seek prompt medical care if you develop flu-like symptoms.A word from the expert!In conclusion, the H3N2 influenza virus can have serious implications for pregnant women and their unborn babies.

The decision has been taken by the government after 79 H3N2 influenza cases were reported in the union territory in the last four days. Such cases are also increasing in Tamil Nadu and other neighboring states.2/6​Do not confuse H3N2 with COVID​H3N2 influenza and COVID are not similar infections though the nature of the symptoms seen in both the cases are quite identical.H3N2 influenza is caused by H3N2 influenza virus, while COVID is caused by the coronavirus.H3N2 has existed before and is a subtype of the influenza A virus. The coronavirus causing COVID was a novel virus which led to worldwide pandemic in 2020.3/6​H3N2 poses a greater risk in children​H3N2 virus affects kids and adults alike, doctors have said.Health experts have said that for kids H3N2 can be serious and it is very important to keep them safe from catching the viral infection. Several experts have said that non-exposure of kids to influenza viruses in the last 2 years has increased their susceptibility towards the infection recently. To contain the spread of COVID, schools and other educational institutes in the country were closed for almost 2 years. Doctors have warned parents to take note of the symptoms and get medical help urgently without delay. They have also urged parents to not administer antibiotics upon seeing the symptoms.4/6​What are the H3N2 symptoms seen in kids?​The common symptoms of H3N2 influenza seen in kids are fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weakness and lethargy.Though the symptoms might appear mild, it can pose a severe threat to those who already have respiratory diseases like pneumonia and asthma. Experts say the recovery period in case of H3N2 influenza is a little longer hence kids may also be at higher risk of developing pneumonia or other respiratory infections, which can lead to hospitalization and even mortality in severe cases.5/6​No, antibiotics do not help against H3N2 influenza virus​Doctors have warned parents to not self-prescribe their kids with antibiotics. Antibiotic tablets are consumed mindlessly and this has increased after COVID pandemic. Recurrent fever, which people usually do not check if it has been caused by viral infection or bacterial infection, is suppressed with doses of antibiotics.Random usage of antibiotics can make the body resistant to the drug and it may be a problem when the body is actually under a bacterial attack and needs the right drug to counter the attack.6/6​Precautionary measures against H3N2 influenza virus​In order to avoid catching the massively circulating H3N2 virus, parents should follow anti-influenza measures and also encourage the kids to follow it.Avoid touching nose, eyes and mouth without cleaning your handsClean hands often with soap and sanitise itCarry tissue papers or wet wipes to keep hands cleanAvoid touching exposed and unclean surfacesWash your hand before eatingUse tissue papers to keep the hand dry and cleanWear mask whenever in crowded places​COVID XBB 1.16 variant: Tracker finds high cases in India, know the symptoms​FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous8 golden rules of a happy marriageindia​10 unique things only Penguins can doindia8 signs your children are driving you into social isolationindiaMalavika Mohanan captures hearts with her breathtaking photos​indiaAnanya Panday's stylish striped saree look is a perfect addition to your ethnic wardrobeindiaKeerthy Suresh shines with her radiant and irresistible charmindiaShruti Haasan channels vintage elegance in a classic satin black sareeindiaKarisma Kapoor's black net saree with cape is a masterclass in fashion eleganceindia10 unique varieties of Gulab Jamun that are must-tryFood Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Alice accuses Vivian for suggesting to use 'Women’s Card'BB18: Chum asks Karan about his struggles in the gameExcl- Nyrraa on BB18: Why Eisha, Alice weren't confronted?BB18: Vivian and Kashish clash over coffeeBB18: Rajat's controversial fights in the showBB18: Nouran slams trolls over rumours of Vivian consuming 'gutka'BB18's Hema had to sell her earrings to cover expensesBB18: Vivian orders Rajat to keep an eye on housematesArfeen refuses to shake hands with Avinash as he leaves BB18123 Photostories 5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf water5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom Shoaib Ibrahim calling Bigg Boss no more a personality show to Divyanka Tripathi admitting it is not her cup of tea: Celebs who have refused to do the show​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from school8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​'Bigg Boss18': From his intense brawl with Avinash Mishra to arguments with Vivian Dsena; Rajat Dalal's controversial fights in the show7 warm drinks to try first thing in winter morningsPeople of these 5 zodiac signs are known for their big-heart and generosity123lifestyle videos03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

GC Biopharma said on Monday that GCFlu Quadrivalent obtained approval from Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. (Credit: GC Biopharma) GC Biopharma said it was the largest seasonal flu vaccine supplier to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and UNICEF (UNICEF) under the WHO program and has supplied flu vaccines to 63 countries around the world. In addition to the 23 countries where the vaccine is already licensed, GC Biopharma has now added Taiwan to the list. Cumulatively, GC Biopharma’s flu vaccine production exceeds 300 million doses, solidifying its position as an expert in the bioindustry. In 2018, GC Biopharma transferred the vaccine technology to Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp. (MVC), a Taiwanese biopharmaceutical specializing in the mass production of vaccines and biologics. Accordingly, through local clinical trials, MVC confirmed the vaccine’s immunogenicity, safety, and equivalence to that of global manufacturers. With the latest vaccine approval, GC Biopharma will now supply the undiluted flu vaccine solution to MVC, and the latter will manufacture the finished vaccine to establish a local production system. The flu vaccine market in Taiwan is estimated at approximately $50 million. As part of GC Biopharma’s strategy to expand its market share in the global flu vaccine market, it plans to accelerate the localization of vaccine production starting with its entry into the Taiwanese market, said a company official. "The goal is to build a global vaccine infrastructure based on the strong vaccine technology that has been accumulated for half a century," GC Biopharma CEO Huh Eun-chul said. tweet Related articles GC Biopharma stepping into mRNA-based flu vaccine biz GC Biopharma scores third WHO PQ for chickenpox vaccine GC's flu vaccine patch shows positive results in phase 1 study GC keeps largest flu market share in Latin America with extra order Marianne Chang mchang@docdocdoc.co.kr See Other Articles Copyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited News That You Haven't Seen Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Falls and trips, primary reasons for older adults’ injuries, while youngsters must be careful about electric scooters [Interview] ‘Pediatric care will revive, so don't give up and stay with us’ Potential new cure found for treating glioblastoma resistant to immunotherapy Macular degeneration cases mark a 2.5-fold increase in 5 years Huons to acquire PanGen Biotech to boost biopharma R&D, CDMO biz Philips Korea to launch digital pathology reference site at Seoul Clinical Laboratories Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Comments Log In 작성자 비밀번호 댓글 내용입력 0 / 400 Submit 댓글 정렬 Newest Recommended Top Comments BEST Comments BEST Comments It is automatically exposed by adding up the number of replies and recommendations. 닫기 More Delete comments Deleted comments cannot be recovered.

H3N2 is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans, known as swine flu viruses. (Representative Image) Amid rising H3N2 influenza cases, Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena will chair a meeting with Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) today i.e. on 18 March. In the meeting, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, Chief Secretary, Health Secretary and Other Senior officials of the Health Department will also be present. Yesterday, Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had issued an advisory advising children and the elderly to take special precautions. Although not many cases of this virus have been reported in the government hospitals of Delhi, strict instructions have been given to the District Surveillance Units, health facilities and government hospitals to monitor and prevent the spread of this seasonal influenza. While addressing a press conference, Bharadwaj said, "This is the season of influenza. This type of seasonal influenza runs all over the world. At present, not many cases of influenza have been reported in the government hospitals of Delhi, so we do not need to panic and worry." "We just have to be careful and responsible. Patients with flu-like symptoms and patients with severe respiratory complaints will be monitored in the OPD and IPD of hospitals in all districts of Delhi to ensure early screening. If early rising trends are seen anywhere, they will be detected well in time," he added. Also Read: Suffering from fever and cough? How do you know its H3N2 or new COVID variant XBB 1.16 Bharadwaj said that currently H1N1 influenza and H3N2 influenza are spreading widely in the country. Generally, its first peak time comes from January to March and the second peak comes at the end of the monsoon. This peak decreases till the end of March. Earlier, the Union Ministry of Health had said that the cases arising from seasonal influenza including H3N2 are expected to decline from March end. "This time, many patients with influenza are coming, whose medical history has diseases related to the lungs, serious conditions due to corona, and asthma, which is affecting them more. People are seeing symptoms like fever, cough for a long time, increased mucus production, watery nose, headache, body ache, etc. Elderly people above 65 years of age and children below 5 years of age need to be more careful with influenza. At the same time, people complaining of lung disease also need to be cautious," Delhi Health Minister said. The doctors too said that the city hospitals are witnessing a spike in cases of H3N2 virus that triggers symptoms like fever, cold and body aches, but in certain cases, leaves behind persistent cough making patients extremely weak. There has been a nearly 150 per cent rise in patients coming to OPDs with such complaints, they said. Bharadwaj also added that the central government has issued a Covid advisory in six States - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Maharashtra and Gujarat. However, Delhi is not included in these states. He added that the Delhi government has got the genome sequencing done of the samples of the current coronavirus. "This variant is non-hazardous. But still advisory is being issued by the Delhi Government for the safety of the people. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of corona infection and the prevention of corona and influenza are the same, he said. In such a situation, people should avoid going to crowded places. If you have a cough and cold, do not touch public things in public places. Keep washing your hands from time to time. Do not put your hands on your nose, eyes, mouth, etc," he added. Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by 4 distinct types -- Influenza A, B, C and D belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Among these types, Influenza A is the most common pathogen for humans. Globally, influenza cases are typically seen to increase during certain months of the year. India usually witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: one from January to March and another one in the post-monsoon season. According to the Union Health Ministry, the cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end. In most cases, the disease is self-limiting with symptoms of cough and cold, body ache and fever etc and usually resolves within a week or so. However, potentially high-risk groups such as infants, young children, pregnant women, elderly above the age of 65 years and people with comorbidities might experience more symptomatic illnesses requiring hospitalization also. Disease transmission is mostly airborne from person to person, through large droplets generated by the act of coughing and sneezing. Other modes of transmission, include indirect contact by touching a contaminated object or surface (fomite transmission), and close contact including handshaking.

Doctors said the crisis in Oseltamivir supply has left parents of children suffering from flu in dire distress KOLKATA: Even as children in the city battle the influenza threat, parents are worried sick over the disappearance of an antiviral syrup from shelves at medicine shops across the city. Doctors said the crisis in Oseltamivir supply has left parents of children suffering from flu in dire distress. The government, however, maintains it has enough stock of the medicine at its paediatric facilities.Used in treatment for Influenza A and its sub-types, doctors prescribe Oseltamivir syrup for young kids.One of the influenza A subtype that is being detected in the city in significant number at present is H3N2.âOseltamivir is the only anti-flu medication and the syrup form of the medication is the choice for younger children who cannot swallow the capsule. But this medicine is running out of shelf and we are getting lots of distress feedback from parents of children suffering from influenza,â said paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor at Institute of Child Health.Even about five years ago, there was restriction on sale and stock of Oseltamivir to only a handful of chemists and hospitals as it required special licence. While the restriction was aimed at preventing the misuse and overuse of the drug, now all medical stores can stock the medicine.Bengal Chemist & Druggists Association president Shanka Roy Chowdhury said the supply crisis of the syrup for the past couple of months but the capsule form is still available.âThere has been high demand of the medicine because of the ongoing influenza cases. As a result there is crisis of the dug at the moment. We are reaching out to other head office and also manufacturers to sort out the problem,â said Roy Chowdhury.Sources said that not all medical stores keep Oseltamivir as the ones who keep it also does it in limited quantity as the medicine does not have much demand in other months.âThe irregular supply amidst the high demand is one of the reasons for the crisis. Also since this the financial year-end, many wholesalers also tend not to pick up stock around this time adding to the woe,â said Rajendra Khandelwal, MD.

IANS | New Delhi | March 14, 2023 7:12 am Representational image (File photo) Even as India is seeing a spurt in Influenza cases, caused by H3N2 virus, health experts on Monday have suggested people to take precautionary measures such as use of masks, better hand hygiene, as well as an annual flu shot. A total of 3,038 lab-confirmed cases of various subtypes of influenza including H3N2 have been reported till March 9 by the states, as per the latest data available on IDSP-IHIP (Integrated Health Information Platform). This includes 1,245 cases in January, 1,307 in February, and 486 cases till March 9. Advertisement “In my opinion, for the time being the government can again make masks mandatory at least in highly vulnerable zones like public transports, hospitals, airports, railway stations and other public conveyances. People should avoid visiting crowded places, or wear a mask whenever in public,” Dr. Sunil Sekri, Associate Consultant – Internal Medicine, Max hospital, Gurugram, told IANS. The respiratory virus “spreads through droplets, so which means that the secretions can spread from person to person, and most people touch their nose and mouth at some point, or that secretions can remain on the fingers and when they shake hands with other people”, it can likely spread, said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, co-chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s National Covid-19 Task Force, making a case for the need of masks particularly in crowded indoor gatherings. According to data from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), there has been a combination of respiratory viruses ranging from Covid-19 virus, swine flu (H1N1), H3N2, and the seasonal Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B viruses in circulation. H3N2 and H3N1 are both types of influenza A viruses, commonly known as the flu. Some of the most common symptoms include prolonged fever, cough, running nose, & body pain. But in severe cases people may also experience breathlessness and/or wheezing. Meanwhile, the Covid infection has also reported a spike after four months as 524 daily Covid cases were reported on Sunday. “For the last three years we have learned how respiratory infections can be prevented. Because the infections go out and come in from the nose and mouth, you need to cover this area and that is masking. Proper masks are needed, particularly when you are in crowded places,” said Dr. Iswar Gilada, an infectious disease expert. “Masking is important particularly for those who are both with comorbidities and the family members of those who are having such kind of people at their home,” he said. The experts also suggested people to wash their hands before eating or utilising any public transit with soap or sanitiser to minimise the risk of infection. Another thing is flu shots, that need to be taken annually to help boost immunity. It is because, “a vaccine that you took last year might not necessarily cover the influenza virus that’s going to come next year or the year after. It will give you some baseline protection but it may not give you the best protection”, Dr. Jayadevan told IANS. Meanwhile the experts also stated that antibiotics should be avoided in treating the flu as it works only against bacteria and not viruses. “Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like influenza or Covid-19. Antibiotics are designed to target and kill bacteria, not viruses. In some cases, antibiotics may be prescribed if a bacterial infection is suspected or if there is a secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, that develops as a result of a viral illness,” Dr Laxman Jessani, Consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai, told IANS. “However, it is important to use antibiotics judiciously and only when they are truly necessary to help prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” Jessani added.

Updated: March 13, 2023 10:44 PM IST By Victor Dasgupta | Edited by Victor Dasgupta Follow Us Image for representational purposes Lucknow: The rising cases of the H3N2 subtype of the influenza A virus have alarmed the authorities. Different states have already sounded alert directing concerned authorities to take all the necessary precautions. On Monday, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj Dr Anshu Pandey also issued instructions to hospitals, the community and primary health centres of the district to effectively deal with the situation. “The guidelines issued by the union health ministry would be followed in this matter. The instructions have been sent to hospitals, CHCs and PHCs for strict compliance. If any directives for specific tests are issued, they too would be implemented on priority,” a Hindustan Times report said quoting CMO Dr Anshu Pandey. SRN Hospital of MLN Medical College, which the biggest government medical hospital in the region, presently has 120 beds in its medicine ward and all these beds have oxygen support. “We held a review meeting on Monday and finalised a plan of action which would be revised from time to time.

Health Ministry Sets Up Network to Monitor H3N2 Virus in Real Time The Union Health Ministry has said it is monitoring the H3N2 influenza outbreak through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network on a real-time basis. It is also tracking and keeping a close watch on morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable groups like children, the elderly and people with co-morbidities. “India every year witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: one from January to March and the other in the post-monsoon season. The cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end,” the Union Health Ministry said in a press release. The ministry has provided guidelines on the categorization of patients, treatment protocol, and guidelines on Ventilatory management to the states and UTs which are also available on the website of the Ministry (www.mohfw.nic.in) and NCDC (ncdc.gov.in).

H5N1 is a specific type of influenza virus, predominantly harboured by birds, that was first detected on a goose farm in China in 1996. Is bird flu virus a serious threat to humans? The virus is highly pathogenic to birds, meaning that infections often cause extreme symptoms, including death. There have been relatively few human infections detected globally over several decades but about half of those infected individuals have died. The good news about H5N1 for humans is that it currently doesn’t spread well between people. The first reason that so much attention is being paid to bird flu right now is that currently H5N1 is causing the largest “bird pandemic” ever recorded. Why is this outbreak suddenly getting so much attention? A certain viral variant that arose in 2020, called H5N1 2.3.4.4b, is driving this outbreak. In agricultural poultry flocks, if a few birds test positive for H5N1, the whole flock is killed regardless of symptoms. The second reason for increased attention is that H5N1 is now infecting more bird and mammalian species than ever before. The virus has also been detected in a broad array of wild birds and in diverse mammals. As H5N1 infects more species, it also increases its geographical range and produces more viral variants that could have new biological properties. Birds experience influenza as a gastrointestinal infection and spread flu predominantly through defecating in water. What features could help H5N1 spread well in humans? By contrast, humans experience influenza as a respiratory infection and spread it by breathing and coughing. Over the centuries, some of these avian influenza viruses have been passed from birds to humans and other mammalian species. Avian flu viruses have evolved to infect cells of the intestine, while human flu viruses have evolved to infect cells of the respiratory tract. Both human and bird influenza viruses use receptors called sialic acids that are common on the surfaces of cells. Birds experience influenza as a gastrointestinal infection and spread flu predominantly through defecating in water. What features could help H5N1 spread well in humans? This is because we don’t know exactly what the genetics of the virus will be if it starts to spread well in humans. Right now, the best way people can protect themselves from H5N1 is to avoid contact with infected birds.

Written by Satata Karmakar |Published : March 13, 2023 10:15 AM IST The H3N2 influenza virus is spreading rapidly in India. In the last few days, the country has witnessed a massive surge in cases of the infection, which is almost a look-alike of COVID infection, however, they both are extremely different in nature. According to the latest data from the Union health ministry, the states reported a total of 3038 laboratory-confirmed cases of various influenza subtypes, including H3N2, up until March 9th, 2023. The country has also logged two deaths, each from Karnataka and Haryana due to the H3N2 virus infection. Experts have warned that H3N2 influenza cases are on the rise in India with an alarming increase in ICU admissions. Why India is witnessing a sudden surge in the number of H3N2 flu cases? Is it unusual? We will answer all your queries in this article. H3N2 Virus In India: What We Know So FarAs cases are on the rise in India, it is important that we understand the virus and the way it spread from one individual to another.

Influenza viruses that have the ability to cause infectious diseases are called flu. There are four different types of these viruses - A, B, C and D. H3N2 virus is a mutation that occurred in the Influenza A virus. In a statement, United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said that the H3N2 virus had caused the 1968 flu pandemic. The outbreak led to the death of around 1 million people globally and about 100,000 in the US. Who Is At Higher Risk?It was a few months back when India was in the grip of the COVID-19 virus. The outbreak led to the deaths of millions of people in the world, and India was among the worst affected nations. People couldn't even forget the terrifying pictures of the back-to-back waves of the virus and the emotional damage that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused and now, seems like the country is standing at the threshold of yet another season of dreadful virus infection. You may like to read H3N2 is the topic most concerning virus at the moment, which has similar symptoms to COVID. But, the virus comes with different features. To understand who is at a higher risk of catching the virus, we quoted what some experts have said. Immunity is one of the major factors in play when asked, who is more at risk. H3N2 is highly contagious in nature, and here is a list of people who are at higher risk: Elderly peoplePeople suffering from PneumoniaPeople with respiratory illnessesPregnant ladiesChildren below 5People with underlying co-morbiditiesHow Long Does The Infection Last?As per the experts, there is no set timeline for the duration of the infection caused by the H3N2 virus. In most of the cases, reported so far in the country, experts have noticed that the infection lasts between 5 to 15 days, with symptoms that look like flu. The duration and the effect of the virus completely depend on the immunity of the patient. In most cases, the infection starts with a high fever, which fades away at the end of the three days. However, persistent cough can persist for 4-5 days extra. H3N2 SymptomsAre you infected? How to know if you have caught the H3N2 virus? A statement from the ICMR said, "A persistent cough, sometimes accompanied by fever, running through India for the past two-three months is due to Influenza A subtype H3N2."

Representational Image GUWAHATI: The first case of H3N2 influenza virus from Assam has been confirmed by the health department on Wednesday.Assam National Health Mission (NHM) in a statement said the state health department is keeping a close watch on the evolving seasonal influenza situation in Assam through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network on a real-time basis. âDistrict surveillance officers under IDSP Network are fully geared up to meet this public health challenge in every district of Assam in line with the guidelines formulated by Govt. of India and ICMR,â read the Assam NHM statement.Health officials said though the sample of the H3N2 infected patient was tested positive in Gauhati Medical College Hospital in February 16 itself, it was not brought to light of the public. GMCH medical superintendent Abhijit Sarma said the sample of the patient came from a private hospital in the city. âThe H3N2 infected patient has now been discharged from the hospital,â said Sarma.He added that since last year, 266 samples of suspected viral infection cases were tested and various types of viruses were detected.While influenza cases go up during certain months of the year globally, in India, it usually witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza â one from January to March and other one in the post-monsoon season. âThe cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end,â Assam NHM noted.âIn most cases, the disease is self-limiting with symptoms of cough and cold, body ache and fever and usually resolves within a week or so. However, potential high-risk groups e.g. infants, children, pregnant women, elderly above the age of 65 years and people with comorbidities might experience more symptomatic illness requiring hospitalization also,â it cautioned.About the AuthorKangkan KalitaKangkan Kalita is a reporter with The Times of India and covers issues on health, education, stories of human interest while keeping a close watch on political developments and student movements.

Photo / NZMENew Zealand should be prepared for a flu season as bad as last year’s heavy onslaught, virologists say. Photo / NZMENew Zealand should be prepared for a flu season potentially as bad as last year’s, virologists say, on the back of returning strains and more overseas plane passengers.But there’s cautious optimism that Covid-19 at least won’t fuel the same “twindemic” of 2022, with expectations that coming waves will be smaller than the first Omicron surges.After a two-year absence, the flu returned in force last year, swamping hospitals with the highest numbers seen in a decade.Flu began widely spreading in May, before pushing case numbers over June in some places to more than four times what doctors saw across recent years.Ahead of this season, virologists told the Herald that a similar-sized surge was possible, for two key reasons.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.One was that the bulk of last year’s flu cases had been the familiar influenza A (H3N2 and H3N3), which typically caused more illness in elderly populations.Yet, there’d been comparatively little influenza B strains, which have been circulating in the northern hemisphere and often affect younger and school-aged children.H1N1, or “swine flu”, has also been on the rise overseas.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Because we didn’t see these two viruses much last year, the population will be susceptible to them,” ESR virologist Dr Sue Huang said.“There’s potential for these viruses to trigger substantial illness.”ESR virologist Dr Sue Huang. Photo / NZMEOtago University virologist Dr Jemma Geoghegan agreed those returning strains could help make for another big season, which might again peak earlier than usual.“I would say that we could likely see a similar picture to 2022, where we see an earlier peak and an increase in the number of cases too.”She pointed to the other big factor: A higher number of international arrivals compared with last year.“It’s important to look at what is happening globally, as we know from Covid-19, how connected New Zealand is,” Geoghegan said.“Assuming international travel has returned to close to pre pandemic levels now, this would fuel imports of respiratory infections.”In a normal year, the flu infects around one in four Kiwis and kills perhaps 500 – making it hitherto our single deadliest infectious disease before Covid-19.Huang said that because most of the population had now been exposed to Omicron, it was possible Covid-19 wouldn’t cause quite as much havoc as it did last year, when successive BA.2 and BA.5 waves put overloaded hospitals under extreme pressure.But that could change if another high-spreading variant took off.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Covid-19 modeller Professor Michael Plank noted that the recombinant Omicron type XBB 1.5 – which has been driving nearly all new Covid-19 infections in the United States – was beginning to trend up quickly here.“It’s really put its foot down in the last couple of weeks and looks like it could become dominant and contribute to a bit of a rise in cases.”But he doubted that bump would prove as large as that of last winter’s BA.5 wave, which topped out at more than 10,000 daily reported cases in July.Plank said it remained to be seen just how this flu season shaped up, but he hoped it wouldn’t be on the scale of 2022.“Nevertheless, I think we do need to be prepared for another winter of high levels of respiratory illness, compared with pre-pandemic times.”Right now, surveillance showed levels of influenza-like illnesses were low across New Zealand, with Covid-19 hospitalisations and death rates also hovering around their lowest since Omicron first arrived.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.In a normal year, the flu infects around one in four Kiwis and kills perhaps 500 – making it hitherto our single deadliest infectious disease before Covid-19. Photo / NZMEA Te Whatu Ora-Health New Zealand spokesperson said a range of measures were being implemented to prepare for winter, such as a new programme to spread resources more widely across the health system.“We will be consulting with primary care and local pharmacies over the use of telehealth and local care to support rural, Māori and Pacific communities by extending the Summer National Telehealth Service, including nurse triage and GP overflow services and providing support to rural communities.“We are also working hard to ensure patients are transferred to home after being in hospital, so people can recover better in their own environment, while making sure they have the right care at home to prevent re-admission by expanding community rapid response.”University of Auckland vaccinologist Associate Professor Helen Petousis-Harris recommended that Kiwis get their flu shot when it becomes available next month – and also the new bivalent Covid-19 booster if they’re eligible.Recent research had suggested bivalent vaccines – soon to be available to Kiwis aged over 30 – could slash hospitalisation rates among over-65s by 73 to 84 per cent, compared with no booster.The updated vaccine – targeted against Omicron type BA.5 - was also expected to be effective against the recent strains of XBB.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.While each new boost tended to bring “diminishing returns” in neutralising antibodies, those who’d already been vaccinated, infected or both would still have some protection against severe disease – namely in the form of longer-lasting B and T cell responses.“[Covid-19] is something that you get again, but normally, it will be milder if you’ve got good hybrid immunity onboard,” Petousis-Harris said.“So, if it’s been quite some time since your last boost or infection, getting a top-up may be a good idea as we’re heading toward winter.”SaveShareShare this articleCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitter/XLinkedInRedditLatest from New ZealandNew ZealandUpdated'I still can’t believe this is actually real': North Shore family celebrating $30.2m Lotto win12 Nov 01:46 AMNew ZealandUpdated'Significant congestion': Auckland Harbour Bridge lanes to close during rush hour hīkoi protest12 Nov 01:26 AMNew ZealandUpdatedTurtle troubles in Napier: 'It is totally irresponsible to release them to the wild'12 Nov 12:54 AMSponsored: Make sure your valuables are coveredsponsoredAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New Zealand'I still can’t believe this is actually real': North Shore family celebrating $30.2m Lotto win12 Nov 01:43 AMThe family bought the winning ticket at Albany Central Superette four weeks ago.'Significant congestion': Auckland Harbour Bridge lanes to close during rush hour hīkoi protest12 Nov 01:26 AMTurtle troubles in Napier: 'It is totally irresponsible to release them to the wild'12 Nov 12:54 AMThe Country: Damien O'Connor on his European trade trip12 Nov 12:53 AMsponsoredOtago pinot leads NZ wine resurgenceNZ HeraldAbout NZ HeraldMeet the journalistsNewslettersClassifiedsHelp & supportContact usHouse rulesPrivacy PolicyTerms of useCompetition terms & conditionsOur use of AISubscriber ServicesNZ Herald e-editionsDaily puzzles & quizzesManage your digital subscriptionManage your print subscriptionSubscribe to the NZ Herald newspaperSubscribe to Herald PremiumGift a subscriptionSubscriber FAQsSubscription terms & conditionsPromotions and subscriber benefitsNZME NetworkThe New Zealand HeraldThe Northland AgeThe Northern AdvocateWaikato HeraldBay of Plenty TimesRotorua Daily PostHawke's Bay TodayWhanganui ChronicleVivaNZ ListenerWhat the ActualNewstalk ZBBusinessDeskOneRoofDriven CarGuideiHeart RadioRestaurant HubNZMEAbout NZMENZME careersAdvertise with NZMEDigital self-service advertisingBook your classified adPhoto salesNZME Events© Copyright 2024 NZME Publishing LimitedTOPICMR Approves Innovative Test Kit for Simultaneous Detection of Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV - Punekar News Skip to content Punekar News Pune News, Pimpri-Chinchwad News Primary Menu Punekar News Pune Aundh Camp Deccan Khadki Kondhwa Swargate PCMC Health Defence Nation Jobs Travel Events Cinema Chatori Galli Sports Automobile Business Market Edge Real Estate Dreams Per Square Feet Search for: HomeNationICMR Approves Innovative Test Kit for Simultaneous Detection of Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV Health Nation ICMR Approves Innovative Test Kit for Simultaneous Detection of Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV Share this News:Pune, 16th March 2023: KRIYA Medical Technologies, based in Chennai, has developed a new RT-qPCR test kit called KRIVIDA Trivus, which has received approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for detecting influenza, Covid-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This approval comes as several parts of the country are experiencing a significant rise in these viruses. The KRIVIDA Trivus test kit can differentiate between these three pathogens quickly, with a cycle time of just 27 minutes, and it can be used with all available RT-PCR equipment. The kit’s efficacy was evaluated by the ICMR at the National Institute of Virology, Pune, using 225 known positive samples and 85 negative samples. The KRIVIDA Trivus kit demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.11% and specificity of 100%. This kit can provide an immediate line of treatment as it enables quick detection of the viruses. The CEO and Founder of KRIYA Medical Technologies, Anu Moturi, said that the KRIVIDA Trivus test kit can differentiate between infections caused by influenza, Covid-19, and RSV, which have similar initial symptoms but differ in how the illness progresses, how easily they spread, and how they are treated. Dr. Shanmuga Priya, the Head of Research and Development at KRIYA, added that the test kit could help detect coinfections and enable doctors to create the right treatment plan. KRIYA will produce the test kit at its manufacturing facility in Oragadam in Chennai, and it will soon be commercially available across the country at a competitive price, the company said.

(Image Credit: ANI.)Your browser does not support the audio element.A 58-YEAR-OLD Woman died in Gujarat’s Vadodara after getting infected with the H3N2 influenza Virus outbreak. The woman was undergoing treatment at Sir Sayajirao General Hospital (SSG) hospital and was diagnosed with hypertension. She was admitted to the hospital two days ago after having difficulty in breathing. This is Gujarat's first death due to the H3N2 influenza virus while it is the third casualty due to the virus in the country. The first death by this H3N2 virus was reported in Karnataka where an 82-year-old man died in the Hassan district last week. Another incident of death due to the H3N2 influenza virus was reported from Haryana. What Is Influenza H3N2 Virus? The H3N2 virus is a subtype of the influenza A virus. This virus can affect animals and birds and can cause respiratory problems in human beings as well. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists recently said that a subtype of this virus causes more hospitalisations than any other strain. The symptoms of this influenza virus are somewhat similar to a cold and cough and include high fever, body pain, nausea, dehydration, difficulty in breathing, low blood pressure and diarrhoea. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that H3N2 is a non-human influenza virus that typically circulates in pigs but can also infect humans. Doctors have advised the infected patients not to use antibiotics without taking proper instructions from their concerned doctors. Dr Sandeep Nayar who is a senior director at New Delhi's BLK Max Super Speciality Hospital has prescribed the post-recovery diet for the infected patients to boost their energy. "Vitamins are important but they are best taken from natural sources. I think what people do today is going out without breakfast and relying on pills for nutrients which is harming their immunity and overall wellbeing. Eating a balanced regular diet, drinking adequate fluid and getting regular exercise is crucial for immunity,” Dr Nayar was quoted as saying by India Today. How To Prevent H3N2 Influenza Virus? To stop the rapid spread of the influenza virus, doctors have advised the use of face masks in public places and to use of proper hygiene. People are also advised not to visit crowded places without using proper face masks. Doctors have advised that infected patients should isolate themselves to further stop the spread of the highly contagious virus. Former AIIMS-Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that this virus spreads through the droplets and mutates every year. He further cautioned senior citizens and patients with long-term respiratory problems to take proper treatment. "So, currently we are seeing an increase in the number of cases of influenza, which is basically presenting fever, sore throat cough, body aches and runny nose history and is a type of influenza virus, which we see every year during this time of the year. But it is a virus with changes over time, it mutates over time and what we call an antigenic drift," Dr Guleria was quoted as saying by ANI.More In NewsHyderabad: Public Gatherings, Protests Banned Within 500m Of State Secretariat Following Security ConcernsTelanganaKarnataka Minister Zameer Ahmed Khan Sparks Row With Racist Slur Against Union Minister KumaraswamyIndiaForeign Secretary Vikram Misri Gets Two-Year Tenure Extension, To Serve Till 2026IndiaMumbai Sees Rise In Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease Cases Among Children; Check Symptoms And PreventionMaharashtraAndhra Pradesh Rain: Visakhapatnam, Nellore And Ten Other Districts On Heavy Rain Alert Till Nov 14 | DetailsIndiaNext ArticleJagran HindiPunjabi JagranGujarati JagranNai DuniaInextliveJagran Josh Only My HealthHer ZindagiVishvas NewsJagran TVJagran English brings you all the latest and breaking news from India and around the world.

Lately, the active Covid cases have crossed the 500 mark in the state.Dr MK Sudarshan, Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) chairman, said the a high number of H3N2 cases have been observed in the past few weeks. He added that the number of H1N1 cases have also seen a rise. According to data collected by the Union Health Ministry, the neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala are also seeing a high prevalence of the virus. Sudharshan said that with a simultaneous rise in Covid cases, the number of ICU admissions is a matter of concern.As of March 15, with 119 new Covid cases reported, the total active cases in the state are 560. The weekly test positivity rate (TPR) stood at 2.76%, with one death reported on Tuesday. The deceased is a 71-year-old man from Bengaluru, with symptoms like fever, cough, and breathlessness. He also had other comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.Health officials added that most patients being admitted in the ICU have other comorbidities. The department is, however, being watchful and has assured that the rising cases are not a reason of worry.Since symptoms for Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Covid cases are almost similar, the state Health and Family Welfare Department has directed hospitals to investigate all patients showing symptoms for either viruses and study the existence of co-infections.According to data released by the Union Health Ministry on March 13, Karnataka has seen 4,700 H1N1 cases from 2018 till March 2023, and 201 have been declared dead till now. Doctors said a change in the weather has been the primary cause for the rise in ILI/SARI cases.

Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate in all parts of the world, says WHO. These are classified into various subtypes. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) influenza viruses. Buy Prime Test Series for all Banking, SSC, Insurance & other exams The H3N2 Influenza: Signs and symptoms: A flu-like situation has gripped most parts of the country. Almost everyone knows someone who is suffering from fever, cough, runny nose and body ache. While flu is not uncommon at this time of the year when the weather changes from extremely cold to warm, this is not the seasonal flu warn experts. Common symptoms of H3N2 influenza: The flu symptoms caused by H3N2 are similar to symptoms caused by other seasonal influenza viruses. Symptoms typically appear suddenly and can include: cough runny or congested nose sore throat headache body aches and pains fever chills fatigue diarrhea vomiting How does H3N2 Influenza spread: According to the WHO, seasonal influenza spreads easily. Crowds accentuate the possibility of the spread. The spread also occurs when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Droplets coming out of the nose or mouth containing viruses are dispersed into the air and may affect people as far as a meter away and those in close proximity alike. Diagnosis of H3N2: The flu has some symptoms in common with other respiratory illnesses, such as the cold. This is one reason why it’s impossible to know whether a person has the flu just by observing their physical symptoms. A healthcare professional can perform a lab test to confirm whether you have the flu or some other illness. However, if you experience flu-like symptoms during the traditional flu season (October to May), they may diagnose you with the flu even without the help of a lab test. Vaccine for H3N2: Each year, the annual flu vaccine protects against either three or four strains of flu. These are known as trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, respectively. An H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B strain are included in the trivalent vaccine, while an extra influenza B strain is included in the quadrivalent vaccine.

Scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have linked these cases of fever and a prolonged cough to influenza A subtype H3N2. Types of Influenza Seasonal influenza can often be divided into kinds A, B, C, and D. According to the World Health Organization, seasonal epidemics of sickness are brought on by the spread of influenza A and B viruses (WHO). Difference between H3N2 influenza and COVID-19 Symptoms The viruses that cause COVID-19 and H3N2 influenza are both highly contagious. They have the capacity to significantly modify as well as disseminate via droplets. Although each of these respiratory infections are very contagious, they are caused by different virus families. H3N2 is a subtype of the influenza A virus that is currently circulating in humans, whereas COVID-19 is brought on by the SARs-CoV-2 virus. According to reports, compared to other strains, the latter can result in more hospitalisations. Major Symptoms of Influenza Up until now, upper respiratory tract symptoms have been reported in the majority of flu cases. This covers symptoms including a dry cough, headache, fever, sore throat, and runny nose, among others. A persistent cough that just won't go away has been noticed, though. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) estimates that a seasonal fever will last five to seven days, but that the cough may linger for as long as three weeks in certain people. How to know if it is COVID or Influenza? The only guaranteed method to determine if you have the flu or COVID is to get tested for it. You can choose between an RT PCR test, which is more accurate but takes longer to produce results, and a rapid antigen test, which delivers data more quickly. A respiratory sample, such as a nasal swab, is required for flu and COVID tests in order to detect the flu virus.
