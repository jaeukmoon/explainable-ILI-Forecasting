Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) National Influenza Vaccination Week Kickoff EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages Friday, December 4, 2020 — December 6-12 marks National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW), an annual observance to remind everyone that there’s still time to get your flu vaccine if you haven’t already. Flu activity is still low, but it may increase as we head into the winter. There are many reasons to get a flu vaccine if you haven’t yet. Flu vaccination can prevent flu illness, reduce the severity of flu illness and protect people at high risk from flu complications. 2020 NIVW Digital Media ToolkitFlu vaccination is especially important this season, as vaccination may help preserve medical resources and reduce the overall burden of respiratory illnesses on our health care system. Getting vaccinated also protects the people who are more vulnerable to serious flu complications, like pregnant women, children and people with underlying conditions like asthma, diabetes and heart disease. It takes about two weeks after flu vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against flu, so get vaccinated now to be protected this flu season. There are more doses of flu vaccine available this season than ever before. For the 2020-2021 season, manufacturers have as already distributed 197.4 million doses of flu vaccine. Because of the record number of doses produced and distributed, administration is occurring over a longer period. As the final doses of flu vaccine come into market, it’s important that those doses are administered so that we are protecting as many people as possible against flu this season. Encourage your loved ones and community to get a flu vaccine by sharing your own SleeveUp flu vaccination photo with a message on why you chose to get vaccinated this year. The more people vaccinated; the more people protected. There’s still time to get your flu vaccine. More ways to participate in National Influenza Vaccination Week: Coordinated Social Share: Tweetstorm: On Wednesday, December 9 at 12PM EST, join in on our coordinated tweetstorm by posting our suggested content (or your own) to collectively raise our message about the importance of flu vaccination.

A health care provider places a bandage on the injection site of a patient who just received an influenza vaccineCDC High-dose influenza (commonly known as flu) vaccines are no better than regular-dose influenza vaccines in reducing deaths and hospitalizations among patients with underlying heart disease, according to a large study publishing in JAMA. The results do not change well-established findings about the value of an annual influenza vaccine for persons with heart disease and other chronic illnesses, and do not change the recommendation for an annual influenza vaccine for most people. The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and appears online on December 4. “Getting a vaccine is even more critical than usual this year, as people with COVID-19 who get the flu are at higher risk for more serious complications,” said Lawton S. Cooper, M.D., M.P.H., one of the study’s co-authors and a researcher with the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, NHLBI. “People should follow the guidance of their healthcare provider as to which flu vaccine, high or low dose, is better for them, but getting the flu shot is more important than which dose.” Researchers have known for some time that people with cardiovascular disease are at higher risk for developing serious complications from influenza, including heart attacks, hospitalizations for heart failure, and death. As a result, experts have strongly recommended that this group get an influenza vaccine, and at least one study has suggested that a high-dose version might help reduce these complications more than the regular-dose vaccine. To determine if there is benefit in the higher dose, the NHLBI funded the Influenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) trial, a randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 157 medical centers in the United States and Canada over three influenza seasons. The trial, which was launched in September 2016, included a total of 5,260 patients who had been recently hospitalized for a cardiovascular event, including heart attack within the previous year or heart failure within the previous two years. Each participant also had one or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease—for example, they were age 65 or older, smoked, or had type 2 diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, or a history of stroke. At the end of the study, the composite total of hospitalizations and deaths was roughly equal for both flu vaccine groups. The researchers observed 883 hospitalizations due to cardiovascular or pulmonary causes and 92 deaths from any cause in the high-dose vaccine group, while they saw 846 hospitalizations for these events and 78 deaths from any cause in the regular-dose vaccine group. The difference was not statistically significant. Orly Vardeny, Pharm.D., M.S., lead researcher of the study and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota’s Medical School and College of Pharmacy, Minneapolis, said there are a couple of possible explanations for the findings. “First, we enrolled people at high risk for heart and lung-related hospitalizations,” she said, “so it’s possible that the incremental benefit of one vaccine over the other would not have overcome the high underlying risk in this population.” Although there were many hospitalizations during the trial, only a small number were identified as caused by influenza, thus another possibility is that since all participants received the influenza vaccine, both the high- and low-dose formulas similarly reduced their risk for heart and lung hospitalizations, Vardeny explained. Although there were few vaccine-related side effects in either group, patients who received high-dose vaccines tended to have more typical injection-related side effects, such as pain, swelling, and muscle aches. “It’s important to remember that all participants in INVESTED received a vaccination, and that both vaccine formulations were generally well tolerated with very few patients experiencing severe adverse reactions, with no difference between groups,” said Scott Solomon, M.D., study co-leader and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Unfortunately, many high-risk cardiovascular patients don’t get vaccinated at all. For reducing hospitalizations due to heart and lung complications, just getting vaccinated with any influenza vaccine may substantially lower risk in our high-risk patients.” The researchers noted caveats in the study, including its focus on patients with a high risk for cardiovascular disease, use of vaccine formulations available during the 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 influenza seasons, and use of vaccines that were prepared in chicken eggs. The researchers said future studies should examine whether other types of flu vaccine may be more protective for patients with high-risk conditions or whether a high-dose vaccine benefits low-risk cardiac patients more. This study is supported by grants from the NHLBI (U01HL130163 and U01HL130204).

Why do muscles, joints ache during the flu? By Janelle Ringer - December 3, 2020 Joint Pain In the 2019-2020 flu season, nearly 56 million cases of influenza were reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In many of those cases, the virus was accompanied by muscle and joint aches. “Muscle pain is never enjoyable, and can cause alarm in patients,” says Thomas Donaldson, MD, chair of orthopaedics at Loma Linda University Health. “They can be especially frustrating for people who already experience issues with joint or bone health,” he says. When a body is infected with a virus, the immune system works to fight the infection. Donaldson says this fight could lead you to feel muscle inflammation and weakness — called myositis — or joint and muscle pain — called myalgia. Pain manifested in the joints is called arthralgia is also a commonly associated with a fever. What’s causing the pain? When infected by a virus, the body mounts an immune response, sending antibodies to seek out attack the virus, blocking it from spreading further. “The pain you feel in your joints when you have the flu is due to the body’s immune response, not the actual flu,” Donaldson says. Once the antibodies have bonded with influenza, the body produces a type of protein to kill the virus. This protein is what causes the symptoms, Donaldson says. Additionally, white blood cells produce cytokines — which are small proteins used for cell signaling — which causes inflammation in muscles and joints. “Inflammation can cause pain that feels similar to mild arthritis,” Donaldson says. When should you seek help? Fortunately, the aches and pains are temporary. Once the body fights the infection, the pain should subside. If symptoms are ongoing or severely worsening, there may be a more significant underlying issue, Donaldson says. "Influenza cannot be treated with antibiotics, but prolonged viral symptoms can turn into a bacterial bronchitis and or pneumonia," he says. "A cough producing mucas that is not clear or white may require more aggressive treatment involving antibiotics." While it’s common for joints to feel stiff or sore, Donaldson says you should be able to move them fully. “Even if it’s uncomfortable, you should still have full mobility of your joints,” he says. “If you lose movement or your joints are red or swollen, consider seeking medical attention.” To learn more about what you can do to protect yourself and your family during the flu season, visit our flu page at lluh.org/flu.

By Emily ShifferPublished: Dec 03, 2020 8:30 AM ESTSave ArticleLaylaBird//Getty ImagesThe flu virus is no joke. The 2019-2020 flu season left 38 million people sick with the influenza virus, which resulted in 18 million visits to a health care provider, 400,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 flu deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And this year's flu season is fully underway, so you may have questions about the main types that you hear about each season: influenza A and B.The flu can be kind of confusing because there are actually four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D. But for humans, it's influenza A and B that cause seasonal epidemics every winter and spring that are what you know as "flu season." Typically, influenza A is more common. But in early 2020, influenza B cases were highly prevalent, according to the CDC. "The majority of influenza during the flu season is influenza A, but influenza B has been increasing in the last year, and some studies show more severe influenza B illness in children," says Kavita Shanker-Patel, MD, a family medicine physician at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.So what are the differences between influenza A and B, and what do flu B symptoms look like? Here's what you need to know.What is influenza B—and how is it different than influenza A? Both influenza A and B are very contagious and have comparable rates of infection and death. But influenza A and B have some key differences that determine how prevalent they tend to be.Influenza A: "Influenza A is a more common and faster-changing strain of influenza virus," says Dr. Shanker-Patel, which is part of the reason it spreads so easily and tends to be the dominating strain during flu season, responsible for the majority of infections. Influenza A has subtypes, which are classified based on the combo of these two proteins found on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H1-H18) and neuraminidase (N1-N11). The two main circulating A subtypes in humans, says Dr. Shanker-Patel, are A(H1N1) and A(H3N2).Influenza B: Influenza B is normally less common and a more slowly changing strain of influenza. It gets classified under two lineages: B(Victoria) and B(Yamagata), says Dr. Shanker-Patel. With influenza B, people can be contagious days before the onset of symptoms, she notes. (In general with the flu, people are contagious about a day before symptoms pop up and while they are showing symptoms, per the CDC.)Another difference between the two: B is found only in humans, while A can be found in other species like birds and pigs, according to Dr. Shanker-Patel. Oh, and flu season usually involves strains of both flu types (and the flu vaccine is designed to protect against specific strains of both, depending on which A and B strains vaccine developers predict circulating that season). For example, "The 2019-2020 influenza season in the northern hemisphere was predominately influenza B/Victoria and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09," says Dr. Shanker-Patel.What are the symptoms of influenza B? The symptoms on influenza B are pretty similar to influenza A, with a few distinctions: FeverChillsCoughSore throatRunny/stuffy noseBody aches (these are thought to be more predominate with influenza B)HeadachesFatigueGI symptoms, like vomiting and/or diarrhea (this tends to be the case more often in children with influenza B)What does treatment for influenza B typically involve? The treatments for influenza B and A are also pretty similar. You can use prescription meds to help shorten the duration of your illness, as well as other medication and lifestyle changes to lessen the intensity of your symptoms.Antiviral medication: "These help to lower the duration of symptoms, and can help prevent serious complications," says Dr. Shanker-Patel. There are currently 4 FDA-approved flu antivirals.Over-the-counter fever reducers: "These are for fever control, and other symptoms," says Dr. Shanker-Patel, and include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol).Lots of rest and hydrationStaying homeDo I need to be worried about preventing influenza B specifically?While the flu is serious, you don't need to focus on preventing a specific strain of it. You just want to make sure you are using good hygiene and preventive practices (psst, mask wearing and social distancing are great for avoiding a flu too!) overall to avoid contracting any and all infectious diseases circulating right now. "Although influenza A is more rapidly changing and more prevalent, influenza B can cause just as severe, or more severe illness," says Dr. Shanker-Patel. "So it’s important to practice these measures to reduce risk of contracting both types of influenza virus."Related StoryWhen Is Flu Season Exactly—And When Does It End?Safety measures are especially important during this 2020-2021 flu season, which overlaps with the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the CDC, some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, making it hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. But diagnostic testing can determine if you are sick with a flu or COVID-19. How do you stay safe from the flu again in general? First, get your flu shot. "The flu shot is the most important step in preventing influenza," says Dr. Shanker-Patel. While getting it doesn't guarantee you won't get the flu, it reduces your chances, protects groups who cannot get a flu shot and are at risk of developing serious complications or dying from the flu, and reduces your chance of requiring hospitalization for the flu. Beside that, you should also:Avoid close contact with sick peopleCover your coughs and sneezes (and following CDC recommendations regarding mask wearing!)Wash your hands with soap and water often throughout the dayTry not to touch your faceStay on top of the cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, especially in frequently touched areasThe bottom line: Influenza A and B are both highly contagious in humans and have similar symptoms. Getting your flu vaccine and taking other preventive measures help protect you against both.Emily ShifferFreelance WriterEmily Shiffer has worked as a writer for over 10 years, covering everything from health and wellness to entertainment and celebrities.

Library of Congress In 1872, the U.S. economy was growing as the young nation industrialized and expanded westward. Then in the autumn, a sudden shock paralyzed social and economic life. It was an energy crisis of sorts, but not a shortage of fossil fuels. Rather, the cause was a virus that spread among horses and mules from Canada to Central America. For centuries, horses had provided essential energy to build and operate cities. Now the equine flu made clear just how important that partnership was. When infected horses stopped working, nothing worked without them. The pandemic triggered a social and economic paralysis comparable to what would happen today if gas pumps ran dry or the electric grid went down. In an era when many looked forward to replacing the horse with the promising new technologies of steam and electricity, the horse flu reminded Americans of their debt to these animals. As I show in my new book, A Traitor to His Species: Henry Bergh and the Birth of the Animal Rights Movement, this reckoning fueled a nascent but fragile reform movement: the crusade to end animal cruelty. The equine influenza first appeared in late September in horses pastured outside of Toronto. Within days most animals in the city’s crowded stables caught the virus. The U.S. government tried to ban Canadian horses, but acted too late. Within a month border towns were infected, and the “Canadian horse disease” became a North American epidemic. By December the virus reached the U.S. Gulf Coast, and in early 1873 outbreaks occurred in West Coast cities. The flu’s symptoms were unmistakable. Horses developed a rasping cough and fever; ears drooping, they staggered and sometimes dropped from exhaustion. By one estimate, it killed two percent of an estimated 8 million horses in North America. Many more animals suffered symptoms that took weeks to clear. At this time the germ theory of disease was still controversial, and scientists were 20 years away from identifying viruses. Horse owners had few good options for staving off infection. They disinfected their stables, improved the animals’ feed and covered them in new blankets. One wag wrote in the Chicago Tribune that the nation’s many abused and overworked horses were bound to die of shock from this sudden outpouring of kindness. At a time when veterinary care was still primitive, others promoted more dubious remedies: gin and ginger, tinctures of arsenic and even a bit of faith healing. Conductors and passengers pulling a streetcar during the equine influenza outbreak. bauhaus1000 via Getty Images Throughout the 19th century, America’s crowded cities suffered frequent epidemics of deadly diseases such as cholera, dysentery and yellow fever. Many people feared that the horse flu would jump to humans. While that never happened, removing millions of horses from the economy posed a different threat: It cut off cities from crucial supplies of food and fuel just as winter was approaching. Horses were too sick to bring coal out of mines, drag crops to market or carry raw materials to industrial centers. Fears of a “coal famine” sent fuel prices skyrocketing. Produce rotted at the docks. Trains refused to stop at some cities where depots overflowed with undelivered goods. The economy plunged into a steep recession. Every aspect of life was disrupted. Saloons ran dry without beer deliveries, and postmen relied on “wheelbarrow express” to carry the mail. Forced to travel on foot, fewer people attended weddings and funerals. Desperate companies hired human crews to pull their wagons to market. Worst of all, firemen could no longer rely on horses to pull their heavy pump wagons. On November 9, 1872, a catastrophic blaze gutted much of downtown Boston when firefighters were slow to reach the scene on foot. As one editor put it, the virus revealed to all that horses were not just private property, but “wheels in our great social machine, the stoppage of which means widespread injury to all classes and conditions of persons.” Ruins in downtown Boston after the November 9, 1872, fire. NYPL Of course, the flu injured horses most of all—especially when desperate or callous owners forced them to work through their illness, which quite often killed the animals. As coughing, feverish horses staggered through the streets, it was evident that these tireless servants lived short, brutal lives. E.L. Godkin, the editor of The Nation, called their treatment “a disgrace to civilization … worthy of the dark ages.” Henry Bergh had been making this argument since 1866, when he founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals—the nation’s first organization devoted to this cause. Bergh had spent most of his adult life pursuing a failed career as a playwright, supported by a large inheritance. He found his true calling at age 53. Motivated less by the love of animals than by a hatred of human cruelty, he used his wealth, connections and literary talents to lobby New York’s legislature to pass the nation’s first modern anti-cruelty statute. Granted police powers by this law, Bergh and his fellow badge-wearing agents roamed the streets of New York City to defend animals from avoidable suffering. Trading card depicting Henry Bergh, c. 1870-1900. Cassius Marcellus Coolidge / Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons As the equine flu raged, Bergh planted himself at major intersections in New York City, stopping wagons and horse-drawn trolleys to inspect the animals pulling them for signs of the disease. Tall and aristocratic, Bergh dressed impeccably, often sporting a top hat and silver cane, his long face framed by a drooping mustache. Asserting that working sick horses was dangerous and cruel, he ordered many teams back to their stables and sometimes sent their drivers to court. Traffic piled up as grumbling passengers were forced to walk. Transit companies threatened to sue Bergh. Critics ridiculed him as a misguided animal lover who cared more about horses than humans, but many more people applauded his work. Amid the ravages of the horse flu, Bergh’s cause matched the moment. Henry Bergh’s mausoleum in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York. Rhododendrites via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 4.0 At its darkest hour the epidemic left many Americans wondering whether the world they knew would ever recover, or if the ancient bond between horses and humans might be forever sundered by a mysterious illness. But as the disease ran its course, cities silenced by the epidemic gradually recovered. Markets reopened, freight depots whittled away delivery backlogs and horses returned to work. Still, the impact of this shocking episode lingered, forcing many Americans to consider radical new arguments about the problem of animal cruelty. Ultimately the invention of electric trolleys and the internal combustion engine resolved the moral challenges of horse-powered cities. Meanwhile, Bergh’s movement reminded Americans that horses were not unfeeling machines but partners in building and running the modern city—vulnerable creatures capable of suffering and deserving of the law’s protection.

However, mutations were acquired after long-term circulation of H9N2 virus in poultry, particularly in the hemagglutinin (HA) proteolytic cleavage site (CS), a main virulence determinant of AIV. Compared to chickens, little is known about the genetic determinants for adaptation of H9N2 AIV to turkeys. Here, we describe 36 different CS motifs in Eurasian H9N2 viruses identified from 1966 to 2019. The European H9N2 viruses specify unique HACS with particular polymorphism by insertion of non-basic amino acids at position 319. Recombinant viruses carrying single HACS mutations resembling field viruses were constructed (designated G319, A319, N319, S319, D319 and K319). Several viruses replicated to significantly higher titers in turkey cells than in chicken cells. Serine proteases were more efficient than trypsin to support multicycle replication in mammalian cells. Mutations affected cell-to-cell spread and pH-dependent HA fusion activity. In contrast to chickens, mutations in the HACS modulated clinical signs in inoculated and co-housed turkeys. G319 exhibited the lowest virulence, however, it replicated to significantly higher titers in contact-turkeys and in vitro. Interestingly, H9N2 viruses, particularly G319, replicated in brain cells of turkeys and to a lesser extent in mammalian brain cells independent of trypsin. Therefore, the silent circulation of potentially zoonotic H9N2 viruses in poultry should be monitored carefully. These results are important for understanding the adaptation of H9N2 in poultry and replication in mammalian cells.

AIV are enveloped viruses with a segmented single-strand RNA genome of negative polarity. The genome is composed of eight gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) which encode more than 11 viral proteins1. According to the different antigenic properties of the two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), AIV are classified into 16 HA (H1—H16) and 9 NA (N1 – N9) subtypes. Each virus contains one HA and one NA subtype with possible 144 HxNy combinations2. Wild birds are the natural reservoir for all AIV subtypes and domestic birds acquire AIV infection after direct or indirect contact with wild birds. In poultry, H1-H16 subtypes are low pathogenic (LP), while H5 and H7 subtypes can become highly pathogenic (HP) to cause up to 100% mortality. Therefore, preventive culling of H5 and H7 infected poultry is recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)3. The HA plays an important role in virus virulence and interspecies transmission4,5,6. Activation of HA by proteolytic cleavage into HA1 and HA2 subunits is important for exposing the HA2-fusion peptide, which mediates pH-dependent merge of viral and host cell membranes and subsequently the release of viral RNA into the host cell7,8. The HA cleavage site motifs (CS) of HPAIV specify a stretch of basic amino acids (aa) which comply with the minimum polybasic motif required for the cleavage by ubiquitous furin-like enzymes (R-X-K/R-R)9. LPAIV possess monobasic HACS, which is activated by trypsin-like enzymes (e.g. trypsin, airway-trypsin like enzymes, transmembrane serine proteases “TMPRSS”) which are restricted to the respiratory and digestive tracts10,11. Therefore, replication of LPAIV is usually limited, and morbidity and mortality are reduced compared to the HPAIV which cause systemic infections resulting in multiple organ failure and up to 100% mortality3.H9N2 viruses are the most widespread AIV in poultry worldwide. They infect a wide range of birds and mammals including humans12,13. In birds, the virus is endemic in many countries and a number of genetic lineages are established (e.g. G1, Y280, Korean lineages)14. H9N2 are classified as LPAIV and some H9N2 viruses are poorly adapted to poultry, however, they may cause severe morbidity and considerable mortality in chickens even without concomitant bacterial or viral co-infections15,16,17. Although chickens and turkeys belong to Galliformes, turkeys are generally more vulnerable to AIV-induced morbidity and mortality than chickens3. Compared to mammals18,19, genetic determinants for adaptation of H9N2 in both species are not well understood. In chickens, mutations in the HA head domain of Asian-H9N2 contributed to efficient virus transmission20 and insertion of basic aa in the HACS increased pathogenicity of some strains21,22. In turkeys, molecular markers for the adaptation of H9N2 are not known.In Europe, H9N2 outbreaks, particularly in turkeys, have been reported from Poland, UK and the Netherlands23,24,25. In Germany, recurrent outbreaks caused by Korean-like H9N2 lineage have been increasingly observed since 2012 mainly in turkeys, and autogenous vaccines have been used in some regions26,27. In this study, polymorphism in the HACS was determined after analysis of the HA sequences of European and non-European H9N2 viruses. Recombinant viruses were constructed and the impact of these mutations on virus fitness in vivo and in vitro in turkeys and chickens was studied.Materials and methodsSequence analysisAll HA protein sequences of European and non-European H9N2 viruses were retrieved from GenBank and GISAID until 21–01-2020. Sequences of laboratory adapted viruses and those with ambiguous amino acid sequences were deleted. The remaining sequences were aligned using Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT)28 and further analyzed using Geneious Prime. The polymorphism in position 4 (P4) to position 1 (P1) in the cleavage site (positions 317 – 320 H9 HA numbering after removal of the signal peptide sequence) was determined.Cells, viruses and plasmidsHuman-embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK-293 T), Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), MDCK type II (MDCKII) cells, bat brain cells (FLG-R, CVCL_0I97) cat brain cells (CEB1-R), warthog brain cells (PHA-B-1-R) and mouse brain cells (MDIG-1-R) were obtained from the cell-culture collection at the Veterinary Medicine of Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), Germany. MDCK-HAT and MDCK-TMPRSS2 cells have been previously described29. Primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells were prepared from 18–19 day-old chicken embryos and primary turkey embryo kidney (TEK) cells from 23 day-old turkey embryos30. Turkey embryo brain (TEB) cells were prepared from 23 day-old turkey embryos according to the standard protocols30. Aurkey/Germany/AR1685/2016 (H9N2) (GISAID ID: 486,439) (designated hereafter as K319) was obtained from the repository of FLI kindly provided by Timm C. Harder. All plasmids of K319 were cloned in a previous project (Mostafa et al. submitted) as previously published31. pCAGGS-expression plasmid was kindly provided by Stefan Finke. Cloning of the HA gene into pCAGGS was done after amplification of the HA genes from pHW-HA plasmids using specific primers containing XhoI and ClaI restriction sites (available upon request). Green fluorescence protein (GFP) pcDNA-expression plasmid was kindly provided by Barbara Klupp.Generation of recombinant virusesThe HA of K319 virus was modified using QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA). Primers used for mutagenesis are available upon request. Mutagenesis reactions were treated with 10 U/µl DpnI for one hour at 37 °C. Transformation of XL Gold ultracompetent cells was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies, USA) and 400 µl were plated on Luria–Bertani (LB)-agar (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with ampicillin (Roth, Germany) overnight at 37 °C. Colonies were inoculated in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin and incubated overnight in a shaker at 37 °C/300 rpm. Plasmids were extracted by QIAprep Plasmid Kits (Qiagen, Germany) and the concentration was adjusted to 1 µg/µl. Viruses were rescued in HEK293T and MDCKII co-culture using Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM (Gibco, USA) as previously described32. Supernatants of transfected cells were inoculated into 9–11 day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Germany). Eggs were examined daily for embryo activity for 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) and chilled at 4—8 °C for 1—2 days. Then, the allantoic fluid was collected under sterile conditions from each inoculated egg and the hemagglutination titer was determined using hemagglutination (HA) test according to the standard protocol33. Sterile allantoic fluids (after plating on sheep blood agar) with HA titer > 16 were pooled together and aliquots were stored at—70 °C until use. Virus titration of working stocks was determined by plaque test as described below. Furthermore, unwanted mutations were excluded by sequencing of plasmids and virus stocks. Sequences of all viruses in this study were generated after amplification of all gene segments using One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) and universal primers31 or internal primers (available upon request). Amplicons were extracted in 1% (w/v) agarose (Biozym Scientific GmbH, Germany) gels using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Purified gene products were subjected for Sanger sequencing by an ABI BigDye Terminator v.1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Germany). Nucleotide and deduced aa sequences were analyzed using Geneious Prime.Replication kinetics in different cell linesThe replication of recombinant viruses in primary CEK and TEK cells as well as indicated cell lines was compared using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Viruses were incubated with the indicated cells in 12-well plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h (h). The virus inoculum was removed and cells were treated with citrate buffered (pH 3.0) saline (CBS) for 2 min (min) to inactivate extracellular virions. Afterwards, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Finally, cells (except MDCK-HAT and MDCK-TMPRSS2) were covered with minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 2.8% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (MP Biomedicals, USA) and with or without 2 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MDCK-HAT and MDCK-TMPRSS2 were covered with MEM containing BSA and 0.2 µg/ml Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as described29. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and stored at − 70 °C until use. The replication kinetics were conducted in duplicates and repeated two times for each type of cells. Virus progeny was titrated by plaque test as described below. The results are expressed as mean and standard deviation of all replicates as log10 plaque forming unit per ml (Log10 pfu/ml).Plaque testVirus titration was done in MDCKII cells in 12-well plates using standard plaque assay. Briefly, viruses were ten-fold serial diluted in MEM. Confluent cells were infected for 1 h with virus dilutions at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The extracellular viruses were adsorbed and cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were covered by semi-solid agar (Bacto Agar; BD, France) containing MEM, 2 µg/ml TPCK-trypsin and 4% BSA (MP Biomedicals, USA). Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 days, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde containing 0.1% crystal violet and were incubated at room temperature (rt) for at least 24 h. Virus titration was performed in duplicates. Virus titers were calculated after counting the number of plaques multiplied by the reciprocal of virus dilution. The final titers were calculated and expressed as Log10 pfu/ml. Cell-to-cell spread was determined by measuring the diameter of 100 plaques of each virus using Nikon NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany). Plaque diameter is shown as mean and standard deviation.Western BlotThe impact of trypsin, HAT or TMPRSS2 on HA cleavability was investigated using standard Western Blot procedures. CEK cells were transfected with 5 µg of the different HA-pCAGGS plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM for 24 h. Moreover, CEK cells were cotransfected with 2 µg pCAGGS-HA-plasmid and 500 ng TMPRSS2 plasmid, incubated for 24 h and harvested as described below. Furthermore, MDCK-HAT cells were infected with the six different viruses using a MOI of 0.1 for 24 h at 37 °C. At 24 h post transfection or post-infection, cells and supernatant were harvested and subjected for two cycles of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and washing of the pellets with 1 × PBS. Finally, pellets were solved in PBS and Laemmli buffer (Serva, Germany). The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C, then stored at -20 °C or directly used for detection of viral proteins in 12% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Briefly, 20 µl of each sample was transferred to a polyacrylamide gel to separate proteins with a molecular mass between 10 and 100 kDa. An electrophoresis chamber (BioRad, Germany) was filled with 1 × SDS-PAGE-buffer (10xPAGE Buffer: 0.25 M Tris, 2 M Glycin, 1% SDS), protein solutions containing SDS-sample buffer were loaded onto the gel and separated at 200 V for 45—60 min. Size of the indicated proteins was assessed against PageRuler protein ladder (Thermo Fisher, USA). Binding of viral proteins to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVDF) (GE Healthcare Life science, Germany) was done after electrotransfer at 20 V for 90 min per blot. After blocking the membrane with 5% skim milk in 1 × Tris-buffer-saline 2.5% containing 0.25% Tween20 (TBS-T) (Applichem GmbH, Germany) for 1 h at rt on a rocking platform. Serum of an infected turkey (1:100) in the current study was incubated with each membrane overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed by 1 × TBS-T and incubated with TBS-T containing peroxidase-labelled secondary anti-turkey antibodies (1:20,000) for 60 min at rt. Visualization of viral proteins was done by chemiluminescence using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad, Germany) Kit. Images were captured by Bio-Rad Versadoc 4000 Molecular Imager (BioRad, Germany) and Quantity One software (BioRad, Germany).Syncytium formation assayMonolayers of CEK cells in a 24-well-plate were transiently transfected with 100 ng of GFP-pcDNA plasmid and 600 ng of the different pCAGGS-HA-plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM as previously done34. After 210 min of incubation at 37 °C, OptiMEM was exchanged to 1 ml MEM with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biowest, Germany). The transfected cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin for 10 min at rt and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 ml MEM containing Earle’s balanced salts and 10% FCS. To induce membrane fusion, cells were incubated with 1 ml of PBS which was adjusted to pH 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.8 or 6.0 with HCl, for 4 min at rt. Cells were washed twice with 1xPBS and were then incubated with MEM containing 10% FCS for 4 h and finally fixed with 4% PFA. The number and the area of green-fluorescing syncytia with three or more nuclei within 10 fields of view (5.5 mm2 each) using an Eclipse Ti-S Fluorescence microscope and the NIS-Elements software (Nikon) as described34. The area of syncytia was divided by the number of syncytia to determine the average syncytia area. The larger the average area of syncytia, the higher the fusion activity.Animal experimentEthical statementThe animal experiments were carried out in the experimental animal facilities of the FLI, Germany following the German Regulations for Animal Welfare. All experiments were approved by the authorized ethics committee of the State Office of Agriculture, Food Safety, and Fishery in Mecklenburg – Western Pomerania (LALLF M-V; permission number 7221.3–1.1–051-12) and the commissioner for animal welfare at the FLI representing the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUCs).Experimental designSPF ECE were incubated in the hatchery facilities at the FLI for 21 days and one-day old turkeys were purchased from commercial source. The turkey poults were tested to exclude bacterial (i.e. Salmonella, E.coli, ORT), viral (i.e. AIV, NDV, TRT) and protozoal (i.e. Coccidia) infections. All birds received water and feed ad-libitum. Six week-old chickens or turkeys were allocated to different groups of 15 birds each in separate animal rooms. Ten birds were inoculated with each recombinant virus oculonasally (ON) with 105.7pfu/bird. At 1 day post inoculation (dpi), 5 sentinel chickens or turkeys were added to assess chicken-to-chicken or turkey-to-turkey transmission. Furthermore, 10 chickens were intravenously (IV) inoculated with selected viruses to determine the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI). A negative control group was left un-inoculated. All birds were observed daily for 10 days. Oropharyngeal (OR) and cloacal (CL) swabs were collected at 4 dpi using serum-free MEM containing antibiotics (in 1 L: 5.6 ml BSA, 1% enrofloxacin (Bayer, Germany), 0.5% lincomycin (WDT, Germany), 0.1% gentamycin (aniMedica GmbH, Germany). Swabs were frozen at − 70 °C until use. At 4 dpi, 3 birds per group were slaughtered and organ samples from nare, trachea, lung, airsac, pancreas, duodenum, kidney, thymus, bursa and brain were used for virus titration and/or histopathological examination. At the end of the experiment, all birds were humanely killed under deep anesthesia using Isoflurane (CP-Pharma, Germany).Detection of viral RNARNA was extracted from swabs and organ samples using NucleoMagVet 8/96 PCR Clean-up Core Kit (Macherey & Nagel GmbH, Germany) in KingFisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The amount of viral RNA was determined in different samples using SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Germany). A generic quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting partial AIV-M gene sequence35 was performed in AriaMx Real-time PCR System (Agilent, Germany). Standard curves were run in each RT-qPCR plate using ten-fold serial dilutions of K319 virus (101 to 105 pfu/ml). The relative amount of viral RNA was quantified by plotting the Ct-values in the standard curves and results are expressed as mean and standard deviation (equivalent Log10 pfu/ml). Moreover, selected samples were inoculated in SPF ECE for virus isolation as recommended36. Furthermore, virus excreted in oropharyngeal (OR) and cloacal (CL) swabs from inoculated and contact birds was subjected for Sanger sequencing.SeroconversionBlood samples were collected at the end of the animal experiment from all chickens and turkeys, and serum was separated after 24 h incubation in the fridge. Sera were tested for anti-AIV nucleoprotein (NP) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by ID screen Influenza A Antibody Competition Multispecies kit (IDvet, France) and plates were read using Tecan ELISA reader. According to the manufacture guideline samples below 45% were considered negative.Histopathology and immunohistochemistryHistopathological lesions and distribution of AIV matrixprotein (MP) antigen in different organs were studied by histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. Samples were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned at 2 – 4 µm. For histopathological examination, slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the severity of lesions was determined using an ordinal scale: 0 = no; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe necrosis and/or necrotizing inflammation. Furthermore, for immunohistochemical examination slides were stained using the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method (Vectastain PK 6100, Vector Laboratories Burlingame, USA) with citric buffer pretreatment, a primary monoclonal mouse anti-MP antibody (M1Hb-64, 1:100), and a secondary biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (BA 9200, Vector Laboratories Burlingame, USA) antibody (1:200) in IHC as described37. The distribution of parenchymal and endothelial MP antigen in different organs was semi-quantitatively scored, each on an ordinal scale: 0 = negative; 1 = focal or oligofocal, 2 = multifocal, and 3 = coalescing to diffuse antigen.StatisticsData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.1.0 and differences were considered significant at a p value of p < 0.05. Plaque diameter was analyzed with Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test. Replication kinetics in different cell lines were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests and Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test. Viral shedding in oral swabs at 4 dpi were compared using Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon test. Results were considered significant when p value in both tests were < 0.05.ResultsEuropean H9N2 viruses specify unique HACS motifs, mostly due to substitutions of non-basic amino acidsPolymorphism in the cleavage sites (Fig. 1A,B) from position P4 to position P1 (residue 317 to 320 in H9 numbering) in European (n = 82) and non-European (n = 2926) H9N2 viruses from 1966 to 2019 were analyzed (Fig. 1C,D; Table 1, Supplementary Table S1). Sequences of the European viruses represent 21 turkey, 15 chicken and 46 wild bird isolates. In total, 36 different HACS motifs were identified (P4-P1 only). The European viruses had 12 different motifs and the non-European viruses exhibited 32 different HACS motifs (Table 1). Four HACS motifs were observed only in the European and 24 only in the non-European viruses (Table 1). While the majority of non-European H9N2 possessed RSSR/G (81.5%), KSSR/G (5.9%) or KSKR/G (3.3%) in the HACS, the European viruses specified different motifs due to accumulation of non-basic aa including ASDR/G (47.6%), ASNR/G (13.4%), ASAR/G (7.3%) or RSSR/G (11.0%). Only 4 out of 36 HACS motifs (motifs #6, 7, 27 and 35) contain dibasic or multibasic HACS. Motif #6 (ASKR/G) was seen in 4 European H9N2 sequences and motif #7 (RSKR/G) in 1 and 6 European and non-European H9N2 sequences, respectively. Moreover, the non-European viruses have variations in all four positions. Conversely, serine (S) in P3 and arginine (R) in P1 in the European viruses were highly conserved (100%), while P4 and P2 specified 5 (A, I, R, T, V) and 6 (G, A, N, S, D, K) different aa, respectively (Fig. 1B). At P2, the European viruses had G (6.1%), A (7.3%), N (15.9%), S (11.0%), D (50.0%) or K (9.8%), while the prevalence rate of these aa in non-European viruses was 1.4, 0.0, 1.7, 89.7, 3.1 and 3.5%, respectively. These results indicate that the HACS sequences of European H9N2 viruses differ from the non-European viruses. While serine at P2 dominated the non-European H9N2, the European H9N2 viruses had relatively comparable prevalence of G, A, N, S and K (6.1 to 15.9%), while D had a prevalence of 50.0%. G is the smallest and K is the largest aa (Fig. 1E). Since mutation (i.e. to tyrosine (Y)) at P2 affected cleavability of non-European H9N2 viruses in cell culture38 and replication of WSN/H1N1 in the brain of mice39, we decided to study the impact of non-basic aa in P2 (hereafter referred to 319) in the European H9N2 viruses in vitro and in vivo.Figure 1Polymorphism in the hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) of European and non-European H9N2 sequences. The 3D structure of H9N2-K319 HA trimer showing P2 (residue 319) in blue, arginine in P1 (red) and glycine in P1´(green) was generated by SWISS-Model and further edited by Geneious (A). Alignment of the cleavage site of representative European viruses showing polymorphism (K, G, A, N, S, D) in position P2 (B). Prevalence of polymorphism in the HACS of European H9N2 (n = 82) (C) and Non-European H9N2 (n = 2926) (D) in H9N2-HA sequences retrieved from GISAID and GenBank on 20–01-2020. All sequences specifying S contains R in position P4. Positions P1 and P3 are highly conserved, while position P2 was more variable than P4, particularly in the European-H9N2 sequences (C-D). Structure and size of amino acids in position P2 are shown (E).Full size imageTable 1 Cleavage site motifs of European and Non-European H9N2 viruses from 1966 to 2019.Full size tableGeneration of six recombinant viruses with variable HACS motifsTo get an insight into the impact of non-basic aa variation at P2, six recombinant viruses were generated. In addition to the wild type K319 virus, five mutants carrying G, A, N, S or D at position 319 (designated G319, A319, N319, S319 and D319, respectively), resembling the field viruses (Fig. 1C), were rescued. Viruses were propagated in SPF ECE and the virus titers ranged from 105.7 (G319) to 106.2 (S319) pfu/ml (data not shown).Variable replication of recombinant viruses in primary turkey and chicken cells in the presence or absence of trypsinReplication of the recombinant viruses was studied in TEK and CEK in the presence and absence of trypsin for 1, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hpi, and virus titers were determined by plaque test in MDCKII cells (Fig. 2A–D). In TEK cells, in the presence of trypsin, the peak of virus replication was reached 24 hpi, except for K319 at 48 hpi. G319 replicated at significantly lower levels than S319 at 8 hpi (p < 0.002), while G319 and S319 replicated at higher levels than K319 at 24 hpi (p < 0.04). At 48 hpi, G319 replicated at higher levels than N319 (p < 0.04) and all viruses replicated at similar levels at 72 hpi (Fig. 2A). Without trypsin, all viruses replicated at comparable levels at 8 and 48 hpi and reached the peak of replication at 48 hpi. G319 replicated at significantly higher levels than A319 at 24 hpi and higher than K319 and S319 at 72 hpi (p < 0.006) (Fig. 2B). Although trypsin increased virus titers in TEK cells compared to cells without trypsin, only significant differences were obtained for S319 at 8 and 24 hpi (p < 0.04). In CEK cells, in the presence of trypsin, peak of virus replication was reached 24 hpi. G319 replicated at significantly higher titers than K319 at 24 and 48 hpi (p < 0.03) (Fig. 2C). D319 replicated at significantly higher titers than N319 at 8 hpi and higher than K319 at 24 hpi (p < 0.02) (Fig. 2C). Without trypsin, virus titers were comparably lower than in the presence of trypsin, although it was not statistically significant (p > 0.052) and peak of virus replication was delayed to 72 hpi (Fig. 2D). Comparing TEK and CEK, in the presence of trypsin, N319 replicates significantly higher in TEK than in CEK cells at 8 hpi (p < 0.003) (Fig. 2A,C). Without trypsin, only K319, A319 and S319 replicated at 72 hpi to significantly higher levels in TEK cells than in CEK cells (Fig. 2B,D). Taken together, all recombinant viruses replicated to higher levels and reach their maximum titer in primary turkey and chicken cells faster in the presence of trypsin. Non-basic amino acids, particularly G319, supported rapid and higher replication of H9N2 in turkey cells. Regardless of their different physiochemical properties, mutations in the HACS enhanced virus replication in TEK than in CEK. These results indicate that mutations in P2 affect virus replication in avian cells.Figure 2Virus replication in cell culture in the presence or absence of trypsin. Shown are the replication kinetics of the recombinant viruses 1, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h post inoculation (hpi) at an MOI of 0.001 in turkey embryo kidney (TEK) cells (A,B) and chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells (C,D) with (+ T) and without trypsin (-T). Titers are expressed as PFU/ml and are shown as the mean and the standard deviation. The kinetics were done twice in duplicates for each cell types and data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests and Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test. The results were considered significant when p value in both tests were < 0.05 as indicated by asterisk and explained in the main text.Full size imageTMPRSS2 and to a lesser extent HAT can support multiple-cycle replication of viruses with non-basic amino acids in the HACSUsing Western blot, the HA of all viruses was shown to be cleaved by trypsin, TMPRSS2 and HAT whereas no cleavability was observed in the absence of these proteases (Fig. 3A–C). The proteolytic activation of HAT and TMPRSS2 to support multiple-cycle replication was studied in different MDCK cells for 24 hpi. In MDCK cells which do not produce endogenous HAT or TMPRSS2, virus titers were generally lower than in MDCK-TMPRSS2 and MDCK-HAT cells (Fig. 3D). Without trypsin, G319 and S319 replicated to higher levels than K319, A319 and N319. S319 replicated at significantly higher titers than D319 (p < 0.02) (Fig. 3D). In the presence of trypsin, the titer of G319 was higher than A319 and K319. In MDCK-TMPRSS2 cells, all viruses replicated at comparable levels (p > 0.2), except G319 which replicated at significantly higher titer than other viruses (p < 0.015) (Fig. 3D). In MDCK-HAT cells, all viruses replicated at comparable levels (p > 0.1) (Fig. 3D). Viruses replicated at higher titers in MDCK-TMPRSS2 than in MDCK-HAT cells, but it was not statistically significant (p > 0.9). All viruses except S319 replicated at significantly higher titers in MDCK-TMPRSS2 than in MDCK cells (p < 0.001), while only K319 and D319 replicated at significantly higher titers in MDCK-HAT than in MDCK cells (p < 0.05). Together, although mutations in P2 did not affect HA-cleavability by trypsin, HAT and TMPRSS2, they modulated H9N2 virus replication in a protease-dependent manner with a remarkable impact of TMPRSS2 and to a lesser extent HAT on virus replication.Figure 3HA proteolytic activation and replication of recombinant viruses in different MDCK cell lines.

Western Blot figures were acquired by Quantity One Software Version 4.4 (Biorad, Germany) (https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4000126-14A.pdf). Multiple cycle replication after infection of MDCK with or without trypsin, MDCK-TMPRSS2 or MDCK-HAT with different recombinant viruses at MOI of 1 for 24 h. Titers were determined by plaque assay in MDCKII cells in the presence of trypsin. Titers are expressed as PFU/ml and are shown as the mean and the standard deviation. The kinetics were done twice in duplicates for each cell types (D). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests and Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test. Asterisk indicates significant differences compared to K319 (p < 0.05).Full size imageNon-basic amino acids in the HACS increased cell-to-cell spread and influenced the optimal pH-range for HA fusion activityCell-to-cell spread of the different virus variants was investigated by plaque assays on MDCKII cells. While K319 produced significantly smaller plaques compared to other viruses (p < 0.0001), largest plaque diameter was observed for G319 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). Binding of protons in the low pH environment of the endosome serves as fusion trigger for HA. The pH-dependence and optimal pH of fusion of the different HA variants was investigated in a transient-transfection based cell–cell fusion assay. For this, CEK cells were transfected with the different pCAGGS-HA plasmids and GFP-pcDNA which was used as a marker and fusion was triggered with PBS buffer at pH 4.0 to 6.0 in 0.2 intervals. 4 h after the pH shift, syncytia were measured to determine the pH for membrane fusion. All HA variants produced syncytia at pH 4.0 to 5.2. Exposure to pH 5.4 could trigger all HA variants except D319. Only S319-HA and G319-HA produced syncytia at pH 5.6. No syncytia formation was observed by any HA at pH ≥ 5.8. The highest fusion activity was observed after exposure to pH 4.2 for K319-HA, pH 5.0 for D319-HA, pH 5.2 for G319-HA and S319-HA and pH 5.4 for A319-HA and N319-HA (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that mutations in P2 have an impact on cell-to-cell spread and pH fusion activation of H9N2.Figure 4Cell-to-cell spread and pH fusion activity of recombinant viruses. Cell-to-cell spread was assessed in MDCKII cells in the presence of trypsin. Asterisk indicates that K319 induced the lowest plaque diameter compared to all other viruses (p < 0.05). Plaque diameter was measured by Nikon NIS Software (Nikon, Germany) (https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/de_EU/products/softwareis-elements) and analyzed with Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test (A). pH activation of membrane fusion was determined by treating HA-transfected chicken embryo kidney cells with pH 4.0 to 6.0 at 0.2 pH-intervals. The mean size of measured syncytia (> 50) was calculated. Shown is the range of pH values at which HA fusion activity was detectable. White arrows indicate the pH at which fusion activity was highest for each HA variant (B).Full size imageMutations in the HACS did not increase H9N2 virulence or transmission in chickensAll ON or IV challenged chickens remained healthy and PI values for all viruses were 0.0, however, all birds seroconverted (Supplementary Table S2). Viral RNA of all viruses was only detected in OR swabs of inoculated chickens 4 dpi and at low titers (Fig. 5A), where RNA of K319, G319, A319, N319, S319 and D319 was detected in 8/10, 7/10, 8/10, 5/10, 9/10 and 4/10 OR swabs, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). G319 and S319 had significantly lower titers than K319 and A319 (p < 0.04) (Fig. 5A). Viral RNA was reported in the nare of inoculated chickens with N319 and to a lesser extent in A319- or K319-inoculated chickens (Fig. 5B). No infectious virus was obtained after direct titration of any sample in plaque test. All contact chickens remained healthy and neither antibodies nor viral RNA were detectable (Supplementary Table S2). Collectively, H9N2 used in this study is poorly transmissible in chickens and mutations in P2 have no impact on virus transmission in chickens.Figure 5Virus detection in oropharyngeal swabs and organ samples in chickens and turkeys. Detection of viral RNA in inoculated chickens in oropharyngeal swabs (A) or organs (nasal cavity) (B) at 4 dpi was determined by RT-qPCR targeting the M gene and are expressed as equivalent Log10 PFU/ml. Virus excretion in oropharyngeal swabs (C,D) as well as in brain (E) and nasal cavity (F) at 4 dpi was determined by RT-qPCR targeting the M gene and are expressed as equivalent Log10 PFU/ml. Asterisk indicates significant difference compared to K319.Full size imageIn turkeys, H9N2 exhibited higher adaptation than in chickens and some non-basic amino acids in the HACS affected virulence, replication and transmissionDirect inoculated and co-housed turkeys exhibited clinical signs including swelling of infraorbital sinus, facial edema, ruffled feather, rales and/or diarrhea. These clinical signs were observed in inoculated turkeys with N319 (10/10; PI = 0.6), K319 and D319 (9/10; PI = 0.4), S319 (3/10; PI = 0.1), A319 (2/10; PI = 0.1) and G319 (1/10; PI = 0.1) (Table 2) and in 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1/5, 1/5 and 1/5 co-housed turkeys, respectively (Table 2). At 4 dpi, caseous material was observed in the swollen sinuses during autopsy. Viral RNA was detected in almost all OR swabs obtained 4 dpi in inoculated turkeys and no significant differences were observed between the groups (p > 0.1) (Fig. 5C). In contact turkeys, G319 was shed in significantly higher amounts compared to K319, A319 and D319 (p < 0.03) (Fig. 5D). Cloacal shedding was only detected in two K319- and one A319-inoculated turkeys, although at very low titers (data not shown). In all inoculated groups, viral RNA was detectable only in the nare obtained 4 dpi and to a lesser extent in the brain (except for A319) (Fig. 5E,F). Direct titration of samples was not successful. Sequence of the HA in swab samples revealed no changes in the HACS and no additional mutations in the HA except G319 which an additional G61D mutation (H9 numbering) in inoculated turkeys. All ON-inoculated and contact turkeys seroconverted, except for one contact turkey inoculated with S319 (Table 2). Using IHC, MP antigen was detected in the nare of all inoculated turkeys, mainly in the epithelial cells of nasal chambers, infraorbital sinus and nasal glands. K319 and N319 were detected at slightly higher levels than others. MP antigen was neither detected in other examined organs nor in the endothelial cells. Histopathological changes in the nare were mostly multifocal, acute to sub-acute, lymphocytic and purulent, partially necrotizing sinusitis, rhinitis and inflammation of the nasal glands with associated edema of surrounding tissue. The inflammation caused by K319 and N319 was slightly more severe than other viruses. In the brain, mild multifocal lymphocytic perivascular infiltration was observed in turkeys inoculated with D319, A319 and S319. In the kidneys, focal interstitial lymphocytic infiltration was observed in one turkey inoculated with A319. Together, turkeys succumbed to H9N2 infection more severely than chickens. Mutations in P2 in the HACS affected virulence in turkeys.Table 2 Clinical examination of turkeys after oculonasal inoculation.Full size tableHACS mutations have an effect on virus replication in different brain cells in the presence or absence of trypsinBecause low amounts of H9N2 RNA and mild lesions were observed in the brain of turkeys, multiple-cycle replication efficiency in brain cells obtained from different species was studied. All recombinant viruses replicated in TEB, PHA-B-1-R and CEB1-R cells independent of trypsin at an MOI of 0.001 for 24 h (Fig. 6A–C). In TEB, the addition of trypsin significantly increased virus replication and G319 revealed the highest titers (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). In PHA-B-1-R and CEB1-R cells, viruses replicated at significantly lower titers than in TEB without significant impact of trypsin in virus replication (Fig. 6B,C). Moreover, G319 was able to replicate in bat and mouse brain cells independent of trypsin, although at lower titers when compared to PHA-B-1-R and CEB1-R cells (data not shown). These data indicated that the H9N2 virus used in this study can infect brain cells of turkeys and mammals independent of trypsin, and mutations in the HACS can affect multiple-cycle replication of the virus in turkey brain cells.Figure 6Replication of recombinant viruses in brain cells of turkeys, pigs and cats. Replication of indicated viruses was tested in primary turkey embryo brain (TEB) cells (A), Warthog brain PHA-B-1-R cell line (B) and Cat brain CEB1-R cell line (C) after infection with recombinant viruses at an MOI of 0.001 for 24 h in the presence ( +) or absence (-) of trypsin. Virus titers are expressed as log10 PFU/ml and are shown as the mean and standard deviation of three independent rounds. Asterisk indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) compared to wt-H9N2 K319.Full size imageDiscussionThe wide distribution of H9N2 affects the poultry industry worldwide. The virus is endemic in chickens and turkeys in several African and Asian countries, and recurrent outbreaks have been reported in Europe. European H9N2 viruses analyzed in this study had HACS motifs, which are different from the non-European H9N2 viruses. Compared to the Asian H9N2 G1-like lineage, little is known about the virulence of European H9N2 in chickens and turkeys40,41. Several studies have shown that non-European H9N2 viruses can increase in virulence after the insertion of basic aa in the HACS with or without reassortment with HPAIV H5N121,22. Our analysis showed that the European H9N2 virus acquired several non-basic amino acids particularly in position P2 (residue 319 H9 numbering). Some of these alterations have been previously reported in Polish H9N2 viruses42. While amino acids at P3 and P1 are highly conserved, the variation in position 2 is remarkable. Six different amino acids were observed in European H9N2 viruses (G, A, N, S, D, K) while three were seen in the non-European viruses (Y, T, I). These results indicate a preferential selection for accumulation of non-basic amino acids in non-European viruses at this position. The inserted non-basic amino acids at P2 have different physiochemical properties, including size and polarity. These different characteristics may have an impact on the HACS conformation which could result in increased accessibility for certain proteases and thus enhanced HA cleavability, and/or the degree of exposure of the fusion peptide, resulting in the observed enhanced cell-to-cell spread (Fig. 4A) and altered optimal pH-range to trigger HA fusion (Fig. B).Viruses used in this study replicated in different cultured cells without trypsin, although cells were infected with low multiplicity and extracellular virions were removed by treatment of cells with citrate buffered saline and washing with PBS. The efficient replication of some H9N2 viruses in primary chicken cells without exogenous trypsin has been previously reported43. Our results showed that TMPRSS2 and to a lesser extent HAT can support multiple-cycle replication of different viruses, particularly G319, better than trypsin. Several studies have also shown that S, R or K in P2 can affect cleavage activation of the R-S-X-R motifs in non-European H9N2 viruses by different proteases (i.e. matriptase, HAT, TMPRSS2 and furin)11,44. Similarly, a tyrosine at P2 affected cleavability of non-European H9N2 viruses in cell culture38.Cleavage of the fusion-inactive HA0 by host proteases into HA1/HA2 subunits results in irreversible conformational changes, enabling HA2 to mediate low-pH dependent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes in the endosomal compartment and subsequently release of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm6. The pH value in the early endosome is about 6 to 6.3, 5 to 6 in the late endosome, and 4 to 545 in the lysosome46. Thus, rapid fusion may enhance early virus replication before triggering the host-immune response or lysis of the virus particles. Nevertheless, pH stability is also important for persistence of AIV in the environment or in the acidic milieu of the upper airways. Therefore, AIV optimal ranges for pH-fusion-activation vary from 4.4 to 6.446,47. Mutations in P2 affected pH-fusion activation in the range of pH 4.0 to 5.6. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, it is possible that the insertion of non-basic amino acids enhanced cleavability of the HA in the extracellular environment by HAT or intracellularly by TMPRSS2. It has been also reported that mutations in the head domain of the HA1 apart from the fusion peptide can trigger HA2 fusion activity of H9N2 at different pH values48,49.Although chickens and turkeys are both galliform birds, they vary in their susceptibility to AIV. Generally, turkeys are more vulnerable to AIV-induced morbidity and mortality than chickens3. The virus used here is a turkey-origin virus similar to the vast majority of European viruses analyzed in this study, thus it is conceivable that adaptation to turkey-cells or turkeys was superior to chickens. Similarly, Turkey/Wisconsin/66(H9N2) caused no clinical signs in chickens, although all chickens seroconverted, while inoculated-turkeys exhibited mild depression, sinusitis and respiratory signs and almost all turkeys seroconverted50. Likewise, all chickens inoculated with a recent polish H9N2 virus of turkey origin from the 2013/2014 outbreak and 1 of 2 contact-chickens seroconverted42. Poor replication of two Dutch wild-bird-origin H9N2 viruses in chickens as indicated by lack of clinical signs, low virus titers in swabs and respiratory organs and low seroconversion has been reported41. Conversely, efficient replication and transmission of a chicken-adapted virus Ck/Hebei/LC/2008 H9N2 in chickens and turkeys have been reported, although cloacal excretion was not seen in turkeys51.There is a gap in understanding the genetic determinants responsible for adaptation in chickens vs. turkeys. Interestingly, N337K (corresponding to N319K in our study) in the HACS was detected in the 6th passage of a turkey-origin H9N2 isolated in Poland in 2013/2014 outbreak in chickens as low frequency variant and became predominant in the 7th passage indicating a role of this particular amino acid for virus adaptation in chickens52. However, in our study, neither N319 nor K319 exhibited any increased virulence or transmissibility in chickens or turkeys, and both viruses replicated in a trypsin-dependent manner at significantly higher levels in turkey cells than in chicken cells. It seems that variation in P2 alone is not sufficient for adaptation in chickens and additional mutations e.g. in HA, PA, NP and PB152 or in the NA53 are probably required. Furthermore, sequence of swab samples from inoculated and contact turkeys at 4 dpi indicated that mutations in the HACS were stable except for G319 which acquired one additional mutation in the HA. Whether this mutation resulted in increased virus titers in the nasal cavity in sentinel turkeys remained to be investigated. Studies showed that H9N2 HACS was stable after passaging in cell culture or in embryonated eggs54,55. Conversely, passaging of H9N2 in tracheal organ cultures or different birds (i.e. turkeys, quails and ducks) resulted in accumulation of mutations in the HACS, among other segments40,56. These different results may be explained by using different H9N2 viruses or variable host-specific selection pressure. Moreover, we detected RNA but not infectious virus in brain samples. Evidence for the extra-pulmonary spread of H9N2 in different organs in poultry has been described48,57,58.Human infections caused by H9N2 have been reported59. Importantly, several AIV with high fatality rate in humans acquired non-HA/NA gene segments from H9N2 (e.g. H5N1, H7N9, H10N8). In addition to human hosts, H9N2 AIV has also infected mammals including pigs, dogs, cats, horses and bats13. Without prior adaptation, AIV H9N2 in this study succeeded in multiple-cycle replication in brain cells of pigs, cats and mice independent of trypsin, albeit to low levels. Mutation to tyrosine at P2 increased replication of WSN/H1N1 in the brain of mice39. Virulence of these viruses remains to be studied in mammalian models, but zoonotic risk of H9N2 AIV (e.g. G319) should be monitored carefully. G319-like H9N2 viruses may infect and replicate at higher levels in the upper respiratory tract of turkeys without causing severe disease. The threat of H9N2 AIV as a zoonotic agent is neglected60 and there is an urgent need to reassess containment of the H9N2 AIV in poultry61.In conclusion, our analysis indicated preferential substitutions of non-basic amino acids in the HACS of European-H9N2 viruses, which were different from non-European viruses. These mutations increased virus replication in vitro and in vivo and contributed to virus fitness in turkeys, but not in chickens. H9N2 viruses in this study, particularly G319 replicated in mammalian cells without trypsin. The findings of this study are important to better understand adaptation of H9N2 in turkeys and mammalian cells. ReferencesBouvier, N. M. & Palese, P. The biology of influenza viruses.

Study authors identified and evaluated a statistical signal for an increased risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome in days 1-42 after 2018-2019 high-dose influenza vaccine administration. The benefits of influenza vaccines outweigh the insignificant risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) following influenza vaccinations, according to a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. During the 2018 to 2019 influenza season, the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a collaborative project between the CDC and 8 integrated health organizations, identified a statistical signal for an increased risk of GBS on days 1 to 42 post-vaccination with the 2018-2019 high-dose influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD). Study authors conducted claims-based self-controlled risk interval analyses among Medicare patients 65 years of age and older to assess this signal. In total, 7,453,690 patients who received a IIV3-HD vaccination in the early-season and 14,437,945 patients who received a IIV3-HD vaccination at the end-of-season were included and analyzed. Post-vaccination days 8 through 21 and days 1 through 42 were used as risk windows, and post-vaccination days 43 through 84 were used as a control window. Additionally, the VSD performed chart-confirmed analyses on 646,996 IIV3-HD vaccinations. Results suggested that there are no statistically significant increases in GBS risk following IIV3-HD administration in the 2018-2019 influenza season. In the early-season analyses, there was no statistically significant increase in GBS risk observed in either 8 to 21 days post-vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 1.85; 95% CI, 0.99-3.44) or 1 to 42 days post-vaccination (OR, 1.31; 95% CI 0.78-2.18) risk windows. In the end-of-season analyses, there was no statistically significant increase in GBS risk observed in either 8 to 21 days post-vaccination (OR 1.64; 95% CI 0.92-2.91) or 1 to 42 days post-vaccination (OR, 1.12; 95% CI 0.70-1.79) risk windows. A final chart review by the VSD identified 1 case of GBS in both the risk (onset, day 1) and control windows, a relative risk of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.06-15.99), and determined it to be statistically insignificant. While the study does “not exclude an association between 2018-2019 IIV3-HD and GBS,” study authors “determined that, if such risk existed, it was low.” A chart-confirmed VSD result also did not confirm an increased risk of GBS.

Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery duration.MethodsBy retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1–4).ResultsWe reviewed the patients’ data of 94 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe-COVID-19, 19 Severe-COVID-19 and 37 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.81 × 109/L vs 1.74 × 109/L, P = 0.001; 0.87 × 109/L vs 1.74 × 109/L, P < 0.0001, respectively) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) of severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1–4).ConclusionsOur study suggests the plausible role of lymphocyte subsets in disease progression, which in turn affects prognosis and recovery duration in patients with severe COVID-19 and influenza A. Peer Review reports BackgroundSince the time the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic, has seriously threatened to global public health and is still expanding. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can be mild or severe, which the incidence of mortality is higher among the elderly and among those with pre-existing comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes, similar to influenza [1]. In addition, their modes of transmission are by contact, droplets, or fomites [2, 3]. While relatively little is known about the immunopathological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there exists vast literature on the possible underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis of Influenza A virus.As previous studies demonstrated that infection of humans with influenza A virus leads to an induction of apoptosis of a portion of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes, thus resulting in a severe transient leukopenia, and that lymphocyte apoptosis, which represents a part of an overall beneficial immune response could be a possible mechanism of disease pathogenesis [4, 5].Although the precise immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is unknown, genome studies and standard blood investigations suggest involvement of the immune system. Previous studies have shown that severe leukopenia and lymphopenia occur during early stages of infection and subsequently become less prominent as the disease progresses in patients with severe COVID-19 [6, 7]. Furthermore, as lymphopenia developed in severe COVID-19 cases, it was shown to be a predictor of prognosis and a reliable indicator of disease severity and hospitalization in COVID-19 patients [8]. However, data on kinetic alterations in lymphocytes after COVID-19 infection are sparse. To the best of our knowledge, there are no comparative studies focusing on the dynamic variations in lymphocyte subsets of patients with influenza A and SARS-Cov-2 infections. Whether changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis and recovery in COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, in view of the above, in this retrospective study, we analyzed the role of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 and severe influenza A, to provide us with valuable insights for better understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms following SARS-Cov-2 and severe influenza A infections.MethodsStudy design and participantsWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of all patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 and were admitted to the Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 20, 2020 to March 17, 2020. In addition, all patients with severe influenza A who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020 were recruited for this study. A group of healthy blood donors who were previously recruited in 2018 were used to provide data for the healthy controls in this study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Ditan Hospital (No. 202000601). The need for individual consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.The patients with COVID-19 were divided into non-severe and severe pneumonia groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocols for Patients with COVID-19 (Trial Version 7, Revised) [9]. The diagnostic criteria for patients with non-severe COVID-19 included: (1) Epidemiological history, (2) Fever or other respiratory symptoms, (3) Typical computed tomography (CT) image abnormities of viral pneumonia, and (4) Positive result of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 Ribonucleic acid (RNA), while those with severe COVID-19 additionally met at least one of the following conditions: (1) Shortness of breath or dyspnea, with a respiratory rate of 30 times/min, (2) Oxygen saturation (resting state) 93%, or (3) PaO2 / FiO2 300 mmHg.Samples of patients with COVID-19 that were SARS-CoV-2 positive based on nucleic acid detection and showed the presence of lymphocyte subset population for approximately 4 weeks after onset, where lymphocyte subset analyses were performed at least twice within the 4 weeks duration, were included in this study. However, those samples that were SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive and either lacked or showed the presence of only one lymphocyte subset population for approximately 4 weeks after onset were not considered for this study.Patients with severe influenza were diagnosed based on Influenza: Diagnosis and Treatment (2019) [10]. The diagnostic criteria were as follows: sustained high fever> 3 days accompanied by severe cough, coughing up sputum or bloody sputum, or chest pain; rapid breathing rate, respiratory distress, and cyanosis of lips; change in consciousness such as unresponsiveness, drowsiness, restlessness, or convulsions; Severe vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration; presence of symptoms associated with pneumonia; exacerbation of pre-existing conditions and/or diseases; other clinical conditions requiring hospitalization. Patients with severe influenza A admitted to our hospital who met the above criteria were included in this study. Patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis, such as the presence of influenza B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella was determined.Healthy controls who tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis viral infections, systemic infections, connective tissue diseases, cancer, or any other abnormal tumor markers were considered.Patients in four groups (non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, severe influenza A, and healthy controls) excluded minors younger than 18 years old and pregnant women.Data collectionThe information related to age, gender, onset of symptoms, medical history of pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and/or autoimmune disease), severity assessment on admission, laboratory findings, and treatment regimen for each patient was extracted from electronic medical records.Laboratory confirmationLaboratory confirmation tests for COVID-19 were performed by Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Beijing Ditan Hospital. Throat swab and/or sputum specimens were collected from all patients at admission and were tested the same day. Patients were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, according to the WHO interim guidance for COVID-19 [11].The diagnosis of severe influenza virus infection was confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs [10].Flow cytometric analysesTo explore the cellular immune response of patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A, peripheral blood samples (2 mL each) were collected from healthy controls and all patients at week 1 (0–7 days), week 2 (8–14 days), week 3 (15–21 days), and week 4 (22–28 days) from the initial onset of symptoms, for analyses of complete blood cell counts and cell counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, and natural killer (NK) cell counts [cells/μL] and CD4+ T/CD8+ T ratio). Lymphocyte subsets were detected and counted by BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and the subsets were characterized according to phenotypes of the corresponding CD antigens.For T cell subset identification and counting, a Four ColorHuman CD3/CD8/CD45/CD4 Flow Kit was employed, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 μL of the isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was incubated directly with the Four Color reagent consisting of a combination of RPE-Cy5.5 conjugated CD3 (Mouse IgG1), APC conjugated CD8 (Mouse IgG1), RPE conjugated CD45 (Mouse IgG2a), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD4 (mouse IgG1) monoclonal antibodies for 15 min at 4 °C in absolute counting tubes. Subsequently, 450 μL of red blood cell lysing solution (1xBD lysing solution) was added to the tubes before performing the flow cytometric analysis. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 5 min prior to detection by BD FACS Calibur flow cytometer. Data were obtained and analyzed automatically by the MultiSET software.Statistical analysesAll analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 26.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical data are expressed in frequency or percentage, and statistical significance was determined by χ2 or Fisher’s exact test. Nonparametric variables are expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR). For continuous data, Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal Wallis test was performed to compare variables between different groups and determine the statistical significance. In all analyses, P < 0.05 was statistically significant. The dynamic changes of different subsets of lymphocytes at different time periods are represented by boxplots.ResultsDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and severe influenza AIn our study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 94 healthy blood donors (healthy controls), 99 patients with COVID-19 and 37 patients with severe influenza A. The group with healthy controls (HC) comprised of 44 males (47.0%) and 50 females (53.0%).Among the 99 patients with COVID-19, 56 were men (56.6%) and 43 were women (43.4%).All the COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups, according to the abovementioned diagnostic criteria, and there were 80 non-severe cases (80.8%) and 19 severe cases (19.2%; Table 1). The median age of patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19 was 37 (30–49) years and 67 (53–74) years, respectively. The severe patient group had a higher age than the non-severe COVID-19 group. The median durations of hospitalization of patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19 were 4 (2, 7) and 5 (4.5, 10) days, respectively. Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of different study groupsFull size tableAll the patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 19, 100%) presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. On the contrary, only a few patients with non-severe COVID-19 had fever (n = 58, 73%) and cough (n = 38, 48%). Notably, none of them had dyspnea.A total of 31 (31.3%) patients in both the COVID-19 groups had pre-existing chronic medical conditions, including diabetes (8 [11%]), hypertension (24 [32.9%]), COPD (2 [2.8%]), cardiovascular disease (2 [2.8%]), renal disease (1 [1.4%]), and autoimmune disorders (5 [6.9%]). Specifically, 19 patients (24%) with non-severe COVID-19 and 12 patients (63%) with severe COVID-19 presented with one or more of the pre-existing chronic medical conditions (Table 1). One patient in the severe COVID-19 group died on day 28 after the onset of the disease.Similar to the group with severe COVID-19, the median age of patients with severe influenza A infection was higher (67 years) than that of those of healthy controls (47 years). Notably, the difference in age was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) between the groups. All patients with severe influenza A infection (n = 37, 100%) presented with fever and cough. However, only 28 patients (76.0%) had dyspnea. Out of 37 patients with severe influenza A, 4 (11.0%) died and 33(89.0%) survived (Table 1).Variations in leukocytes and lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 and severe influenza A in the first week of illnessDue to the age difference in the cohort of patients with non-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and severe influenza, the healthy controls were divided into 2 groups (group one and group two). The median age of the healthy controls in group one was 37 (31,41), which age-matched with the non-severe COVID-19 patients (P = 0.546). The median age of the healthy controls in group two was 68 (55,77) and age-matched with severe COVID-19 and severe influenza patients (P = 0.546 and P = 0.159, respectively).The absolute counts of total white blood cells (WBCs) (5.29 × 109/L) and lymphocytes (1.51 × 109/L) of non-severe COVID-19 patients in the first week of illness were significantly lower than those of the healthy donors in group one (6.01 × 109/L, P = 0.007 and 1.85 × 109/L, P = 0.001, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in total T cells (P = 0.105), CD4+ T cells (P = 0.203), CD8+ T cells (P = 0.068) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio (P = 0.193) between non-severe COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in group one (Table 2). Table 2 Comparison of cell counts of total WBCs, total lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets in patients with non-severe COVID-19 with the first week of illness and Healthy Donors in Group oneFull size tableThe absolute counts of total WBCs of patients with severe COVID-19 (4.55 × 109/L, P = 0.275) and severe influenza A (5.99 × 109/L, P = 0.989) showed no significant differences with the WBCs’ counts of the healthy control in group two. The absolute counts of lymphocytes in healthy donors in group two (1.74 × 109/L) were significantly higher than those of patients with severe COVID-19 (0.81 × 109/L, P = 0.001), severe influenza A (0.87 × 109/L, P < 0.0001). Patients with severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A had a significantly lower number of total T cells (P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively), CD4+ T cells (P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively), and CD8+ T cells (P = 0.002 and P < 0.0001, respectively) than healthy controls in group two. CD4+/CD8+ ratio in severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A demonstrated no significant differences compared with those in healthy controls in group two (P = 0.334 and P = 0.564, respectively). Further, there were no significant differences in peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphocytes and total T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio in patients with severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A in the first week after illness onset (Table 3). Table 3 Summary of comparison of cell counts of total WBCs, total lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets in severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A cases in the first week of illness with healthy donors group twoFull size tableDynamic changes in leukocyte and lymphocyte subset counts with disease progressionTo further determine dynamic changes in the immune cell subsets of patients with non-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and severe influenza A, with disease evolution, we compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, total lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of each cohort at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.The leukocyte counts of patients with non-severe COVID-19 were significantly higher in week 3 than those of week 1 and week 2 (W1-W3: P = 0.005, W2-W3: P = 0.044). A similar tendency was seen with lymphocyte count, which showed a sharp significant increase at week 3 compared with that seen at week 1 (W1-W3: P = 0.004). Interestingly, a significant change in total T cell count was observed at week 3, suggesting a marked increase in total T cell population when compared with that observed at week 2 (W2-W3: P = 0.045) (Fig. 1a-c). The total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and T cell counts demonstrated no significant difference at week 3 in patients with non-severe COVID-19 compared with healthy donors in group one. No significant changes were seen CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratios of patients with non-severe COVID-19 during the 4 weeks following the infection (Fig. 1d-f). Fig. 1Dynamic variations in cell counts of total WBCs, total lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets in patients with non-severe COVID-19 at weeks (W) 1, 2, 3, and 4 during the course of illnessFull size imageIn patients with severe COVID-19, White blood cells gradually recovered and the variations in leukocyte counts were found to be statistically significant (W1-W2: P = 0.013, W1-W3: P = 0.003, W1-W4: P = 0.001). A similar trend was observed with total lymphocyte count, which sharply increased at week 3, showing a significant difference compared to those at weeks 1 and 2(W1-W3: P = 0.013, W1-W4: P = 0.002, W2-W3: P = 0.001) (Fig. 2a, b). In addition, a significant and a drastic increase was noted in the cell counts of total T cell and CD4+ T cell subset at week 4 when compared with those of weeks 1 and 2. (W1-W4: P = 0.034, W2-W4: P = 0.003; W1-W4: P = 0.020, W2-W4: P = 0.001). Although CD8+ T cells gradually increased from week 1 to week 4, their counts were still significantly lower than healthy controls in group two at week 4(Fig. 2c-e).

Our analyses revealed significant dynamic variations in total lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets, which get activated in the early stages of COVID-19 and severe influenza A infections, and further demonstrated that severe immune injury tended to be more prominent in patients with severe form of the disease. The recovery rate of patients with severe COVID-19 was comparatively longer than those who received immediate antiviral treatment for severe influenza A and those with non-severe COVID-19.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 99 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19, 37 patients with severe influenza A and 94 healthy blood donors who were previously recruited in 2018. All the patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups, according to the abovementioned diagnostic criteria, including 80 non-severe cases (80.8%) and 19 severe cases (19.2%). Several reports and studies have clearly indicated that older or elderly people are more prone to COVID-19 as their immune systems are likely to get overwhelmed by infections due to their advanced age. Similarly, the elderly who are 65 years or older are particularly at risk for influenza infection, hospitalization, and death due to influenza-related complications, such as pneumonia [12]. In our study, the median age of patients with non-severe COVID-19 was 37 years, while that of those with severe COVID-19 was 67 years. Consistent with the previous studies, our data indicate that the ages of the severe patient group are higher than those of the non-severe COVID-19 group. Further, our study showed that the median age of patients with severe influenza A infection was higher (67 years) than that of those with non-severe COVID-19 (37 years) and healthy controls (47 years). Notably, this difference in age was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) among the groups, which suggests that the elderly people represent a large at-risk population.The WHO-China joint report on COVID-19 provided a comprehensive symptomatology of COVID-19 (n = 55,924) [13]. A previous study showed that patients with COVID-19 present with pyrexia in 85% of cases during their illness course, but only 45% are febrile on early presentation. In addition to cough (67.7%) and sputum (33.4%), respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea, sore throat, and nasal congestion were reported to be present in 18.6, 13.9, and 4.8% of cases, respectively. Both COVID-19 and influenza present with common clinical manifestations including fever, cough, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, dyspnea, and myalgia [7, 14, 15]. In our study, all the patients with severe COVID-19 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, whereas only 73 and 48% of patients with non-severe COVID-19 had fever and cough, respectively. Similar to the severe COVID-19 group, all patients with severe influenza A infection presented with fever and cough. However, only 76.0% of the patients had dyspnea. These clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and influenza infections were consistent with other studies. As previously reported the mortality rate also increases in patients with additional comorbidities [3]. Specifically, 63 and 89% patients with severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A, respectively, presented with one or more pre-existing chronic medical conditions. While the mortality rate was 5% due to severe COVID-19, it was even higher (11%) for severe influenza A.Lymphocytes and their subsets play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and inflammatory response in the host. As in case of immune disorders and other infections, a viral infection impairs the host’s immune defenses and results in decreased levels of lymphocytes and their subsets [16, 17]. Lymphocyte subsets, namely CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells are primarily involved in the humoral and cytotoxic immunity against viral infection. Therefore, this necessitates the need to understand the mechanism of reduced blood lymphocyte levels and characterize the dynamic alterations of lymphocyte subsets to provide novel insights for an effective treatment and prognosis of COVID-19.As lymphopenia is frequently observed during the initial stages of respiratory viral infection [3, 18]. We identified and analyzed different variations in leukocytes, lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte subsets in patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A.. The counts of WBCs and lymphocytes, but not the counts of T cells, nor CD4+ or CD8+ T cells of non-severe COVID-19 patients decreased significantly compared with healthy controls in group one during the first week of illness. No significant changes were seen CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratios of patients with non-severe COVID-19 during the 4 weeks following the infection. On the contrary, the counts of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with severe COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of healthy controls in group two from week1 to week3 after illness onset. Further, CD8+ T cells did not improve significantly at week4 of illness compared with healthy controls. Although the counts of WBCs, lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subpopulations were not compared between non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients due to the age mismatch, this results still suggested that T lymphocytes and their subsets were damaged more drastically in severe COVID-19 patients. These findings are corroborated by a previous study which hypothesized that the virus might directly infect lymphocytes resulting in their apoptosis, thus leading to causing a sharp decline in total lymphocyte population and subsequent lymphopenia. Moreover, lymphocytes express the coronavirus receptor angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2(ACE-2), and therefore are a direct target for the virus [19]. Another retrospective study suggested that lymphopenia might be one of the predictive factors for progression to respiratory failure during early stages following Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) infection [20]. Giving further strength to our study, a study by Geng et al. demonstrated the decline in the populations of T lymphocytes and their subsets, after influenza A virus infection, to be positively correlated with prognosis [21]. Meantime, our results reiterate the fact that CD8+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [22]. Taken together, lymphopenia was common in the patients with COVID-19, indicating a significant impairment in the host’s immune system following SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A infections. Our findings are in line with other studies which also detected these alterations in patients with pneumonia caused by MERS-CoV and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [20, 23]. In addition, a significant reduction in both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were specifically observed in patients with severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A. Therefore, this indicates a more severe immune insult in patients with the severe form of the disease. Consequently, the alteration would be more profound, and leads to adverse clinical outcome in these patients. Thus, lymphocytes and their subsets, especially CD8+ T cells, might be a potential predictor for disease severity and clinical efficacy in COVID-19.Next, we focused on the dynamics of T lymphocytes and their subsets, which played a vital role in cellular immune responses. We compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, total lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the non-severe and severe COVID-19 patient groups at weeks 2, 3, and 4 with that of those observed during the initial stages of infection. The total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and T cell counts significantly improved at week 3 in patients with non-severe COVID-19. Lymphocyte also recovered markedly at week 3 in severe COVID-19 patients. However, T cell and CD4+ T cell subset population significantly increased at week 4 in patients with severe COVID-19. Our results are consistent with a previous study by He et al. that showed a sharp decline (below normal) in the cell counts of CD45+, CD3+ T cell subsets, CD4+ T cell subsets, and CD8+ T cell subsets during the first week of SARS-Cov infection; their values further declined during the second week before increasing during the third week and returning to normal by the fifth week. Moreover, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts were found to be extremely low in critically ill and deceased patients [23]. Taken together, the alterations in lymphocytes and their subsets gradually improved at later time points in patients with COVID-19. Collectively, our results indicate that the recovery duration of patients with severe COVID-19 is longer than those with the mild form of the disease.Our study results further revealed a noticeable difference in the time taken for the cell counts to improve among the severe and non-severe COVID-19 and the severe influenza groups. The cell counts of total lymphocytes and their subsets recovered only around week 4 in severe COVID-19; the recovery time was almost delayed by a week compared with those having non-severe COVID-19. On the contrary, the cell counts of total lymphocytes and their subsets in patients with severe influenza A increased and improved drastically at week2; this rapid recovery rate could be attributed to the early initiation of treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, or peramivir, which interfere with virus release from host cells by blocking the viral nucleic acid function, thus preventing infection of new host cells [24].The relative role(s) played by the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 versus direct viral effects in the respiratory system and other organ systems has been questioned, with the possibility of immunopathogenesis being a major causal component of severe COVID-19 [25, 26]. Limited by research conditions, our study only demonstrated that severe COVID-19 cases had significant lymphopenia, especially the helper (CD3+CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), in the early stage of illness onset, consistent with previous research results, and lymphocytes and their subgroups in severe COVID-19 patients require a longer recovery period, compared with severe influenza patients. These results can give more points to other studies about T lymphocyte dynamic. The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases may be an important phenomenon in lymphopenia of severe COVID-19 patients [27]. Moreover, the function of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells was within normal range which indicated by PMA/Ionomycin stimulated IFN-γ positive cells in these three subsets, and there was no significant difference between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. At the same time, T cell counts recovered was related to the concentration of cytokines in plasma likes IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α, which was decreased in the disease resolution stage of COVID-19 patients [28]. They also observed that increasing exhausted marker PD-1 expression on T cells was tested as COVID-19 patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, which demonstrated that the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted, not just a decrease in T cell counts. In summary, we would continue further studies on the function of T cell subsets across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease severity to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 potential immunopathogenesis.Our study has several limitations. Firstly, this study was retrospective, small single-center, cross-sectional clinical study. Only a small sample of 99 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital was included, which may confound the results and potentially introduce selection bias. This may limit the generalizability of the study. At the same time, the study cohort was limited by the actual conditions of the admitted patients. Among the 99 COVID-19 patients, there were 80 non-severe cases and 19 severe ones. Non-severe COVID-19 patients were mainly young people, while severe COVID-19 patients were mainly elderly patients. The age data of the non-severe and severe COVID-19 cohorts could not be matched. In addition, inconsistencies in time periods between illness onset and admission might have led to missing data which could result in observation biases in the dynamic variations in immune cells.ConclusionsCollectively, our study suggests the plausible role of lymphocyte subsets in disease progression, which in turn affects prognosis and recovery duration in patients with severe COVID-19 and influenza A. The dynamic alterations in lymphocytes and their subsets provides valuable insights into the immunopathogenesis of disease progression in COVID-19.

San Francisco: The congregation of the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption praying on the steps, where they gathered to hear mass and pray during the influenza pandemic of 1918. Hulton Archive/Getty Images CNN — To gather or not to gather has been the question at the forefront of the minds of today’s religious leaders and their church members. During the 1918 influenza pandemic that ultimately killed 50 million to 100 million people, different answers to that same question resulted in either collective well-being or widespread, devastating loss. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, religious institutions worldwide closed their doors to save lives. St Louis Globe-Democrat/Newspapers.com The US Supreme Courtrecently decided 5-4 to grant religious organizations in New York state relief from restrictions on the number of people attending religious services. In light of this development, looking back a century can offer guidance for religious institutions deciding to stay shuttered or reopen. Self-inflicted decimation In 1918, many churches around the world closed their doors to save lives. Without financial support, some churches eventually closed permanently, while others survived with dropped-off donations and serving as hospitals instead of sanctuaries. For some families, the home became the altar. Those who refused to adapt to the pandemic reaped the consequences. "Churchless" Sundays left towns quiet in 1918. Democtrat and Chronicle In Zamora, Spain, “mass gatherings were positively encouraged — and at 3 per cent, or more than twice the national average, Zamora had the highest death rate of any city in Spain,” wrote science journalist Laura Spinney in her book “Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World.” In September, a local bishop rebelled against health authorities by ordering evening prayers for nine days “in honour of St. Rocco, the patron saint of plague and pestilence, because the evil that had befallen Zamoranos was ‘due to our sins and ingratitude, for which the avenging arm of eternal justice has been brought down upon us,’ ” Spinney wrote. WASHINGTON - JUNE 29: "Equal Justice Under Law" is carved into the facade of the United States Supreme Court building June 29, 2009 in Washington, DC.

At another church, the congregation was asked to adore relics of St. Rocco, which meant lining up to kiss them,” she wrote. “Organised religion shaped the pandemic much more obviously then than now, and it was more likely to take precedence over public health,” Spinney told CNN via email. “In the pages of Zamora’s newspapers … a notice announcing an upcoming mass at one of the city’s churches was printed next to a warning to avoid crowds. Nobody seemed to notice the incompatibility of the two.” A month later, Spinney notes in her book, the bishop wrote that science had proven itself ineffective and that people were beginning to “turn their eyes instead toward heaven.” People continued to attend gatherings in packed cathedrals and streets. When health officials tried to prohibit gatherings, the bishop accused them of interfering in church affairs. Not attending church services meant that some people took up other activities on Sundays. Clinton Daily Public/Newspapers.com By mid-November, Zamora had seen more illness and death than any other Spanish city. Although priests and parishioners lost their lives, Spinney wrote, the bishop praised those who had placated, in his words, “God’s legitimate anger” by attending services. The bishop’s followers didn’t hold him accountable but rather revered him, and he was awarded for his efforts and remained bishop for nearly a decade longer. Across the globe, villagers dwelling on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska were also experiencing the tail end of their pandemic nightmare around the end of November. On the last Saturday of the month, two visitors from Nome, Alaska, attended a standing-room-only service in the small local chapel. The Nome visitors relayed that many people back home were sick, but no one was seriously alarmed, wrote Gina Kolata, a science and medicine reporter for The New York Times, in her book “Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It.” Two days after the service of singing, prayer and feasting, villagers became sick with the flu. Of the 80 local Eskimo villagers, 72 died and their bodies were left frozen in igloos. In one igloo, dogs had scavenged corpses. Will Mullery/CNN Related article The Supreme Court's latest ruling exposes personal fissures among the nine justices “Another igloo looked at first like the site of utter devastation,” Kolata wrote. “And as rescuers peeked inside, they saw only a pile of corpses. Then, suddenly, three terrified children appeared from under deerskins and started shrieking. They had survived somehow on oatmeal, surrounded by the bodies of their family.” By the end of the three-week outbreak, the village housed only five adults and 46 orphaned children. According to Kolata’s book, Clara Fosso, a missionary’s wife who didn’t get sick, wrote a regretful letter to the Eskimos years later: “There was a spiritual revival among the Eskimos at the Mission on the last Sunday in November 1918, before the influenza disaster fell upon us. The whole settlement of Eskimos had crowded into the new school room for worship. We felt the spirit of the Lord among us, as the communicants stood at the altar and later met in prayer; many confessed to their faith. We were deeply moved. This was the last time we were gathered together. “By the following Sunday most members had gone to a more beautiful service with their Savior. You, who are the sons and daughters of these children of God, may remember that many of them died testifying to their Lord and singing the hymn that we had shared on that last Sunday, ‘I Can Hear My Savior Calling.’” Why some think services are worth the risk What people generally receive when attending religious services is a sense of comfort, spiritual community and grounding, said Dr. Christina Puchalski, the founder and director of the George Washington Institute for Spirituality & Health in Washington, DC. “People have that sense of connection and belonging, and then in a transcendent sense, maybe the experience of God, however people understand that. Rituals can be very healing and faith, for many people, is their source of hope. … That is what sustains them.” Brooks Pentecostal Church in Maine WMTW Related article Nearly 50 people contracted coronavirus after fellowship event at a small church in Maine During the pandemic, the rug has been pulled out from underneath believers and there are few places where they — and really, anyone — can feel hope, Puchalski said. “When it comes to religious services, it’s more than going out to a restaurant,” she said. “When you think historically, in countries where people were persecuted for their faith, people went to church or mosque or temple anyway, in spite of the possibility that they would be killed. Because that is so important to them. That is who they are at a very profound level.” “It is true that for a number of different religions, the creation of communities for rituals is incredibly important,” said Stephen Covell, the chair of the department of comparative religion at Western Michigan University. “And if you can’t come together to celebrate or worship or conduct whatever the ritual is, then it means you’re unable to fulfill the teachings of that religion or … the duties and responsibilities you have.” On the other hand, some churchgoers may have different beliefs about the severity of the pandemic and how to handle it, Puchalski said. And some vary in how they assess risk. Others might be fed up with isolation burnout, deciding that attending church is worth the risk and that if they catch coronavirus, maybe their sickness would be mild. Denial is one coping mechanism that could give people subconscious permission to live life as normal. Any of those schools of thought could lead someone “to make decisions accordingly,” Puchalski said. Indiana: Where opportunity was found amid crisis The innovative spirit for reimagining religious services during pandemics didn’t start in 2020. Although much less technologically savvy, religious leaders and parishioners living during the 1918 pandemic devised ways to maintain both individual faith and community spirituality. When influenza struck in Indiana in the fall of 1918, the second and worst wave of the 1918 flu, health officials imposed a statewide quarantine beginning October 6 of that year. Nevertheless, religious leaders took advantage of the opportunity to ingeniously unite and console their parishioners, wrote Casey Pfeiffer, a historian with the Indiana Historical Bureau, a division of the Indiana State Library.

Library of Congress Related article What we can learn from 1918's deadly second wave The press, for one, acted as a sort of liaison between leaders and members: Through local papers, leaders stayed connected with members by providing hope and ways to practice their religion. Readers were encouraged to study scripture readings or Sunday school lessons, or worship alone or with family. In a published statement, a reverend suggested that families pray at the same time that services were usually held. And once the quarantine was extended to the end of October, First Presbyterian Church in Rushville, Indiana, urged families to make Sunday “a day of prayer and meditation in their homes.” As the pandemic droned on, some newspapers shifted to having larger sections designated for guides to at-home Sunday services. In “Worship with the Star,” a series by the Indianapolis Star newspaper, there was a full page that featured opening and adjourning hymns, scripture lessons and sermons. 2BGPDP0 Protection Against Influenza - Men gargling with salt and water after a day working in the War Garden at Camp Dix.

Recognizing the danger, health authorities and law enforcement intervened in some places, either by discouraging the services, denying permission to have them or dispatching officers to meetings. At the height of the fall wave, some pastors and rabbis used their buildings as makeshift hospitals. Photo-Illustration: Getty Images/CNN Related article What the 1918 flu pandemic can teach us about coronavirus In late November 1918, some religious institutions slowly reopened while imagining the future of church — which included, for example, curtailing the length or number of services, mandating mask wearing and instructing preachers to dedicate a portion of their messages to guidance for proper ventilation in members’ homes and workplaces. “It was challenging then; it’s challenging now,” Pfeiffer said. “Religious leaders, both then and now, are trying to do the best that they can to meet their parishioners’ needs, while keeping their safety and health at the (forefront) as well. There are definitely parallels to draw from and hope to be had.” Staying spiritually connected individually and together Although we’ve had the carpet pulled out from underneath our feet, “there are many things that provide that sense of being grounded, sort of a replacement for that carpet,” Puchalski said. There are “so many creative ways that I’m participating myself. I could go to Mass all over the world, because of YouTube. It’s so neat to hear homilies from different places.” Today’s believers have stayed connected via virtual Bible or prayer meetings, service livestreams, drive-in services and more. “Covid is still here, there’s no really effective treatment, and there’s no vaccine yet that’s available,” Puchalski said. “As long as that’s the case, I would continue to follow the CDC (guidelines).” Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. The crux of the situation “ultimately boils down to a relationship with God,” Puchalski said. “Yes, for many people, their faith is practiced in community, no question — a huge loss for many people who, for them, that is important. “We get so caught up with that that maybe we forget another way that we can honor that belief within us that just might be safer. And that the bigger picture is the relationship with, again, God, divine or sacred, however you understand it.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Oakland, California, in this file photo from Dec. 19, 2014.(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)At a GlanceCases of the flu spike in winter.Researchers say influenza is more stable in drier, cooler temperatures.Being inside in winter might provide more opportunities to spread germs.We've all heard it from our moms or grandmothers, or even a kind neighbor or teacher: "Put your coat on! You'll catch a cold!"But does cold weather, or a sudden drop in outside temperature, really make you catch a cold or other infectious diseases?The answer is no, although some viruses, especially influenza, do thrive in cooler temperatures."The fact that it's cold outside doesn't mean that someone's going to get a cold," Dr. Isaac Bogoch, a researcher at the University Health Network in Toronto and an infectious disease expert, told Global News. "The fact that it's cold outside means that the season is changing, and there are some infections which become more viable in the winter months."Cases of the flu spike in winter, with February most often being the top month for infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control. While it can be caught year-round, flu season in the U.S. usually runs from about October to March.AdvertisementResearchers say that's because the influenza virus remains more stable and in the air longer, and thus is more easily transmitted, in cooler temperatures and dry weather. That same weather can also exacerbate chronic respiratory conditions.In general, it can seem like more people get ill when it's cold outside, but Bogoch theorized that could be because so many people are stuck inside together. Closer proximity to people equals a higher likelihood of germs being spread."We tend to huddle together more, and there's probably more opportunities for people to transmit infections from person to person," he said.Experts say the best ways to protect yourself against getting sick are washing hands and getting the flu shot."The flu shot is useful for everyone in terms of reducing either the chance of getting influenza, and also, if you do get it, it should reduce the severity of it by giving some primed immunity to the virus itself," Dr. Michelle Murti, a public health physician with Public Health Ontario, told Global News.

Book Excerpts If cholera, plague, influenza pandemics have taught us anything — don’t celebrate prematurely In ‘The Age of Pandemics’, Chinmay Tumbe writes that the outcomes of pandemics are strongly influenced by politics — whether the plague or the Spanish Flu. Chinmay Tumbe 29 November, 2020 12:36 pm IST 1 FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedin Cholera vaccination in India at the time of the 1893 epidemic. Reproduction, 1894, of a wood engraving | Wikimedia Commons Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ The Age of Pandemics shows us that pandemics can originate anywhere and at any time. As proven by the most recent cholera pandemic, which originated in Indonesia, there was nothing truly ‘Indian’ about the disease. And yet, in the nineteenth century, it was a widely held belief that British India was the home of cholera or ‘the factory of cholera’, as described by one French delegate at the 1894 International Sanitary Conference. But we now know that the Cholerae vibrio thrived in certain maritime ecosystems and only occasionally found its way to human bowels. Similarly, there was nothing ‘Chinese’ or ‘Indian’ about the plague, and reservoirs for plague foci existed in other parts of the world as well. It was a disease that essentially hurt rodents first, and then humans. If the 1889–90 influenza pandemic was dubbed the ‘Russian flu’ on the basis of its supposed origin, the more accurate term for the 1918 pandemic would be the ‘American flu’, certainly not the ‘Spanish’ flu. In fact, at different times, influenza earned a variety of names based on its most proximate source. In Japan, it was referred to as ‘American Influenza’, in Ceylon as ‘Bombay Fever’, in Dakar (Senegal) as ‘Brazilian Flu’ and in Northern Rhodesia as ‘White Man’s Flu’. Such labels may appear harmless but have, in the past, led to discrimination against migrants coming from the region where the disease is supposed to have originated. This is why the WHO, sensibly, does not prefix a disease with a location. The phrase ‘Chinese virus’ for COVID-19, as used by some political leaders, is unwarranted. This is not to rule out the possibility of a country deliberately creating a pandemic in the future through biochemical weapons. In the infamous Unit 731 in north- eastern China in the 1930s, Japanese forces experimented with cholera, plague and other diseases and in 1949, a few of the Japanese soldiers were indicted by the Russians for using bio-weapons against the Chinese during World War II. Curiously, the official name for Unit 731 was Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Department and its overall efforts backfired spectacularly when the diseases they unleashed killed their own soldiers.

The Age of Pandemics had many of them: pilgrims and soldiers for cholera, traders and tailors for the plague, and postal service officials and army personnel for influenza. The migrant labourer was also frequently abused. In the blame games, identities such as race, caste and religion would invariably crop up as attested in numerous reports littered across the nineteenth century. In the current pandemic, religious congregations came under close scrutiny, first, groups related with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in South Korea, and then in India, with the Tablighi Jamaat. Both groups attracted outsized blame for weeks, amplified by the media, and exposed classic pandemic fears. This behaviour was reminiscent of the British colonial authorities blaming Hindu and Muslim pilgrims and merchants for spreading diseases a century ago. Fortunately, the blame game stopped in India when some political leaders pointed out that the coronavirus does not consider the religion of the person it attacks. The long history of pandemics from ancient times till today suggests that there may be no particular pattern to the timing of pandemics. It is true that the Age of Pandemics occurred just as the world was becoming more globalized, but in the past century, with the world more connected than ever before, the real mystery is why pandemics have not affected us to as large an extent as they did in the 100 years before 1920. Mutations of bacteria and viruses are ongoing affairs and their outbreaks cannot be forecast in any meaningful sense. Pandemics can be curtailed, not eradicated. Also read: In 1918 Flu, towns with Indian officers saw 15% less deaths than those with British officers Pandemic Politics The Age of Pandemics tells us that the outcomes of pandemics are strongly influenced by politics. How much a state or government intervenes will be decided by the extent to which it is accountable to its citizens and the magnitude of their resistance. When to intervene will depend on the timing of the next elections or on how much attention the government wants the public to focus on the pandemic. And once the intervention has been chosen, its impact will always be benchmarked to someone doing worse than you. In the late nineteenth century, this meant that colonial powers would invest heavily in upgrading public health infrastructure in their own backyards but provide endless excuses to avoid doing the same in their colonies. Cholera ceased to have a major impact in most of Europe and North America by the late nineteenth century but continued to ravage territories in Asia. It would be naïve to attribute the burden of pandemics on colonialism per se since the princely states of India or the few non-colonized parts of the world such as Siam or Thailand also suffered immensely during the Age of Pandemics. But colonialism’s link with commerce and the compulsion to keep trade channels open did provide an excuse to look away from pandemic outbreaks. In the few instances of massive interventions, such as with the plague in India in 1896–98, the authorities found such strong resistance that they quickly backtracked and shirked their responsibilities, citing oriental fatalism rather than creating a meaningful engagement with their subjects. The strengthening of democracy over the twentieth century thus played an important role in increasing investments in the health infrastructure of many countries, making them better prepared to face pandemics. As more countries experience democratic processes and the routine of elections, the timing of intervention in a pandemic has also come to depend on political strategies. If during the 1918 influenza pandemic, few states intervened lest it took attention away from the war effort, today’s interventions can be based on whether elections are around the corner or not. A cross-country study already shows how electoral concerns appear to have influenced the response to COVID-19 in the first few months of 2020. Countries with elections due soon cannot afford to showcase the economic contraction that accompanies a stringent lockdown and act accordingly. Further, pandemic management almost always involves the dispersal of crowds and some curtailment of religious freedoms and civil liberties, which is a political issue, as the British discovered in India in the nineteenth century. Winning the trust of the public while doing so is thus of paramount importance, just as it was eventually enshrined in India’s plague policy after years of misadventure. Ultimately, the politics of pandemics revolves around showcasing your success. Of lives saved. Of places doing worse than you. Of your timely actions. However, the Age of Pandemics tells us to do no such thing. Premature celebrations came back to haunt the British in India as pandemics tore through the subcontinent. And hence, honest politics, if there is such a thing, should be aware of two fallacies of pandemic management: concerning the number of deaths and regional variation. Close to 12 million deaths due to plague in India in the Age of Pandemics was a disaster, however one looks at it. But zero deaths should not necessarily be seen as a success.

When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, however, he took on a role of lead COVID-19 surveillance for the WHO European Region. Freshly back in Melbourne, Dr Fielding shares his insights from the experience. By Royal Melbourne Hospital's Dr James Fielding, infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Doherty Institute. Dr Fielding in front of our helicopter transport to the Turkmenistan border crossing with Afghanistan. I was seconded to the WHO Regional Office in June 2019 to be the influenza surveillance lead for the WHO European Region. Initially, my role had two specific areas of responsibility: to oversee and develop the regional influenza surveillance practice and policy for the 53 Member States of the Region; and analyse and report on influenza epidemiology for the weekly Flu News Europe bulletin, as well as international meetings and publications. I also represented the WHO European Region in development of global influenza surveillance guidelines, policy, strategy, and protocols, and at relevant global meetings. Whilst initially a little nervous at the scope of my brief, I was also very excited to be working in a region with history and diverse cultures I’ve had a long interest and fascination in. The role was also the perfect opportunity to pursue my passion of developing infectious diseases epidemiology expertise and capacity in resource-limited settings. As I arrived in the northern hemisphere summer, I was able to launch into the development work very quickly, with missions to Uzbekistan, Serbia, and Ukraine to review their influenza sentinel surveillance systems - a critical preparedness mechanism for an influenza pandemic, as well as assessment of the onset, magnitude, duration and severity of seasonal influenza. This work is supported by the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, a collaboration between WHO, Member States, industry, and other stakeholders. In exchange for a financial contribution, industry partners can use influenza viruses submitted by Member States’ surveillance programs to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to manufacture vaccines, diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the funds provided are allocated for pandemic preparedness capacity building in priority countries and response activities during the time of an influenza pandemic. There are six PIP Framework Member States in the WHO European Region: Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. As well as the in-country missions to Ukraine and Uzbekistan, I also oversaw consultants conducting the same activities in the other Member States. With my WHO colleagues, I assisted in the delivery of a successful annual meeting in Armenia and conducted a training workshop on calculating pandemic influenza severity assessment indicators for Russian-speaking Member States in Georgia. Perhaps the most memorable and daunting mission of my time in Europe was taking part in the Geneva International Discussions. Co-chaired by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Union and the United Nations, this group is a negotiating format that brings together representatives from Georgia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Russian Federation and the United States and discusses security matters and humanitarian issues following the August 2008 war between the Russian Federation and Georgia. In January 2019, crossing restrictions were imposed at the Abkhaz administrative boundary line following reports of increased influenza activity in Georgia. That’s how I became involved and, with a colleague from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Sweden, gave an information session to the representatives and co-chairs on the topic “Public health: best practices for managing communicable diseases”. Supported by regional surveillance data, the presentation described the key epidemiological features of how influenza pandemic strains arise before becoming seasonal strains, what seasonal influenza activity usually looks like, and recommended control measures for seasonal influenza. Regular reporting for the Northern Hemisphere influenza season started in October and the focus of the work then shifted to overseeing regional analysis of the influenza surveillance data from various system reported by member states, assembling the weekly Flu News Europe Bulletin with partners from the ECDC, and other analyses such as a surveillance report for the bi-annual influenza vaccine composition meeting at WHO Headquarters in Geneva to select strains for the following year’s influenza vaccine. Press conference at the conclusion of the WHO-ECDC mission to Italy. Everything changed in early January, however, when COVID-19 emerged and imported cases began appearing in Europe. An Incident Management Support Team was quickly established in the WHO European Regional Office and I was appointed to the role of surveillance lead for COVID-19 for the Region. Working with colleagues in WHO Headquarters, WHO Country Offices, ECDC and Ministries of Health, much of my role was in the development of COVID-19 surveillance strategies, protocols, and reporting. In late February, the number of cases in Italy increased suddenly and quickly. With 24 hours’ notice, I was deployed to Rome as a part of a joint WHO-ECDC team to better understand the situation and evolution of the outbreak in Italy and support the immediate national response. Whilst the data showed a rapidly escalating situation, during my time there the gravity of the situation and implications for Europe more broadly became ominously evident, and there was a lot of media interest in our mission. More and more flights to and from Italy were being cancelled and the usually bustling streets and restaurants of Rome were steadily emptying of people. Towards the end of the mission, I took an eerie evening walk and vespa ride past some of the great buildings and monuments of Rome with barely another soul to be seen. Outbreak responses are always high-intensity situations and a challenge for the mission team was to provide the best value to our Italian counterparts without impeding their critical response work. Working with local epidemiologists and another surveillance epidemiologist from ECDC, we developed a surveillance and laboratory testing and prioritisation strategies, tailored to epidemic phases, providing practical guidance for the response. One of the early challenges in the Italian response was coordinating a national response, as much of the legislative authority for infectious disease surveillance, response and control sits with regional governments. This distribution of authority is very similar to Australia’s national and state governments, and I was struck by the similarity of challenges this creates for surveillance in both countries (although Italy has 27 regions coordinate rather than Australia’s eight states and territories)! I was part of another really interesting mission to Turkmenistan in early July. There was a lot of interest in the mission, because at that point (and as of November 2019) Turkmenistan was the only Member State in the WHO European Region that hadn't reported any COVID-19 cases. The 10-day mission included the three cities of Turkmenabat, Ashgabat and Turkmenbashy, with a busy schedule of visits and meetings with representatives from the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, state, regional and local departments of Sanitary Epidemiological Service, hospitals, laboratories, customs and quarantine facilities, the Afghanistan and Turkmenistan border crossing checkpoints, and other United Nations agencies in Turkmenistan. As part of a suite of measures, the mission team recommended that Turkmenistan further activate the critical public health measures that are cornerstones to the response to COVID-19: scale up surveillance and testing for all suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and isolating and caring for the sick. After seeing the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of different countries, I’ve been really fascinated by the similarities and differences between countries and individuals. Whilst there is a generally common goal to mitigate the health impacts of COVID-19, approaches have been varied and each country has its own demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and political factors that require tailored approaches. Inequities in access to and quality of healthcare and laboratory testing capacity across the globe is a perennial issue and highlights the importance of initiatives such as the PIP Framework. At an individual level, I’ve seen that everyone has a different perception and tolerance of risk, and it’s not defined by nationality, ethnicity, age, sex, education, or wealth. We all need to recognise, accept, and try to understand these differences in each other to be a better society on the other side of this pandemic.

Here, we report that for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) this paradigm does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 moderate-to-severe patients with COVID-19 hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-λ and type I IFN production were both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they became critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were produced before IFNs in all patients and persisted for a prolonged time. This condition was reflected in blood transcriptomes wherein prominent IFN signatures were only seen in critically ill patients who also exhibited augmented inflammation. By comparison, in 16 patients with influenza (flu) hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to those of COVID-19 and 24 nonhospitalized patients with flu with milder symptoms, IFN-λ and type I IFN were robustly induced earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were only acutely produced. Notably, higher IFN-λ concentrations in patients with COVID-19 correlated with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance and a higher IFN-λ to type I IFN ratio correlated with improved outcome for critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 correlated with longer hospitalization and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19, contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.

One of the most notable features of SARS-CoV-2 infection is that it goes unnoticed for a remarkably prolonged period of time, running a course of a mild or uncomplicated illness for weeks until sudden and severe symptoms develop in a subgroup of patients, requiring hospitalization, oxygen support and/or admission to an intensive care unit (ICU)3,4. This scenario is consistent with an unusually long incubation period of the virus, ranging from 2 to 14 d and an unusually long presence of virus in the respiratory tract, often being detectable for over a month after initial infection by conventional molecular diagnostic tests5,6. By comparison, influenza virus infection, the main respiratory virus accounting for pneumonia hospitalizations until now, has an incubation time of 1 to 4 d, a short window of virus positivity of a few days and an abrupt onset of symptoms causing pneumonia within 1–3 d7,8. Other frequent respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial viruses, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumonoviruses and common cold coronaviruses have also shorter incubation times (ranging from 1–5 d) and more rapid and acute manifestation of symptoms9, rendering SARS-CoV-2 quite unique in that respect. The basis of this difference is unknown but is likely to be a key driver of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 underlying its distinctive disease course and clinical manifestations.The hallmark of COVID-19 is the development of a hyper-inflammatory response, also known as ‘cytokine storm’, impairing the gas-exchange function and leading to ARDS, multi-organ failure and death10,11,12. We and others have previously shown that a finely tuned antiviral response, orchestrated by IFN-λ (type III IFN) and type I IFN is critical for balancing immunity for optimal protection and minimal damage13,14,15. Deviation from this balance can unleash a detrimental ‘cytokine storm’ with devastating consequences for human health. A recent study suggested that in patients with COVID-19, type I IFN and IFN-λ are not produced as they could not be detected in the sera of a small COVID-19 cohort of otherwise unspecified clinical characteristics16. In contrast, another study reported that type I IFN is induced in patients with COVID-19 and indicated that its concentration might be reduced in those that are critically ill17. Such discrepancy could be due to the fact that each of these studies focuses on a single and likely distinct snapshot of an apparently heterogeneous disease process. Therefore, pursuing kinetic analyses is pertinent to delineating the course of the immune response, especially given that cytokines are transiently produced. This criterion is particularly true for IFNs, which are expressed early during infection and are rapidly downregulated thereafter.Here, we have performed a comprehensive temporal analysis of type I and type III IFNs and major inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 patients with COVID-19 and 16 patients with flu hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia and longitudinally followed up according to current World Health Organization guidelines18. Both groups of patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics and comparable disease severity on admission (Supplementary Table 1). We have also analyzed 24 patients with milder cases of flu with no radiological findings of pneumonia and no need for hospitalization (referred to as mild flu; Supplementary Table 1), as well as 10 healthy individuals. Using high-sensitivity Luminex and ELISA assays, we quantified 18 cytokines and chemokines relevant to antiviral immunity and hyperinflammation in patient serum collected at defined time intervals following hospital admission (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). This analysis aligns patients on the basis of the same clinical criteria of disease symptoms and severity, mainly the presence of pneumonia and the requirement for oxygen support.Fig. 1: Temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns of patients with COVID-19 and flu in relation to hospital admission.a, Schematic showing the experimental design with sampling at specific time intervals after hospital admission of 32 patients with COVID-19 and 16 patients with flu with pneumonia followed longitudinally. Dashed lines indicate the time of the first and last onset of critical disease, respectively. b, Serum levels of IFN-λ1, IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 and CCL3 at various time intervals after hospital admission. Data are presented as scatter plots with dots showing individual patient measurements, columns median values and error bars the range. For COVID-19, n = 16, 17, 21, 15, 11 and 8 for each of the six consecutive time intervals. For flu, n = 16, 14 and 11, respectively. For healthy, n = 10. Gray shading marks the limit of quantification of the assay. P values were determined by a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test for nonparametric comparisons. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 show significance over healthy controls. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 show significance between COVID-19 and flu groups.Full size imageWe found that patients with COVID-19 had profoundly impaired induction of both IFN-λ and type I IFNs. IFN-λ and type I IFNs were not detectable in most patients with COVID-19 (with median levels at the limit of quantification of the assay), although some patients made IFN-λ and fewer of them also made IFN-α (Fig. 1b). This observation contrasts patients with flu who almost uniformly expressed both types of IFNs, within the first (day 1–3) time interval of admission and at significantly higher concentrations. At all cases, IFN expression was transient, with type I IFN levels rapidly declining after the first 3 d of hospitalization, whereas IFN-λ persisted for longer. Notably, despite their limited ability to make IFNs, patients with COVID-19 robustly expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ and CCL3 that were maintained at high concentrations for a prolonged time (Fig. 1b). Other cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-12, IL-23 and CCL4 were also significantly upregulated at specific time intervals compared to healthy individuals, reflecting the heterogeneity of the disease course (Extended Data Fig. 2).A similar pattern emerged when comparisons were made according to disease symptom onset (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited markedly delayed and reduced IFN-λ and type I IFN levels, which were detectable only in a fraction of the patients and from days 7–10 onwards of symptom onset (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). By comparison, all patients with flu exhibited high levels of these cytokines during the first 6 d (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Although patients with COVID-19 made little IFN during the first 6 d of symptom onset, they potently produced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and CCL3 at concentrations similar to flu (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Moreover, they exhibited prolonged expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, with high concentrations of TNF, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 and CCL4 remaining detectable for over 3 weeks of onset, whereas in patients with flu a number of these were by that time downregulated.Notably, patients with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital with similar markers of systemic inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio to patients with flu (Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 4a–f). They even had lower fever and a lower CURB-65 score, a commonly used measure of pneumonia severity19 (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). However, during follow up, patients with COVID-19 developed a much higher incidence of ARDS requiring ICU support. In our cohort, 16 out of 32 patients (50%) developed critical disease, 3 of whom died, compared to only 3 out of 16 patients with flu (18.7%), none of whom died (Extended Data Fig. 5). Patients with COVID-19 became critically ill over a much broader time window (with the first patient onset at day 1 and the last at day 9 after hospital admission; Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 5) than patients with flu, who manifested critical disease within the first day after admission. This finding is in agreement with the high incidence and protracted course of severe respiratory failure described for COVID-19 (refs. 4,12). Interestingly, among patients with COVID-19, those who became critically ill had higher CRP concentrations, WBC and neutrophil counts and N/L ratio on admission (Extended Data Fig. 4a–f), but not CURB-65 or fever (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h and Supplementary Table 2). Critically ill patients with flu also had a tendency for higher WBC and neutrophil counts, N/L ratio and CURB-65, whereas nonhospitalized patients with flu did not exhibit any of these increases (Extended Data Fig. 4a–h).We thus examined whether temporal cytokine patterns differ between the various patient groups. Notably, we observed that although patients with COVID-19 that did not become critically ill produced little type I or III IFN, the ones that became critically ill had IFN-λ levels that were significantly higher at the day 1–3 time interval compared to healthy and noncritically ill patients (Fig. 2a). Some of the critically ill patients also made IFN-α (Fig. 2a), albeit at significantly lower amounts compared to nonhospitalized patients with mild flu (Fig. 2a) or the total number of hospitalized patients with flu (both critically and noncritically ill; P < 0.05). On the contrary, all patients with COVID-19 made pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IFN-γ, with critically ill patients exhibiting also significantly higher concentrations of IL-6 and IL-7 than noncritically ill patients at specific time intervals and a tendency for higher IFN-γ, consistent with the increased hyper-inflammatory state they were in (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 6). Individual patient data further confirmed these trends (Extended Data Fig. 7). CCL3 was significantly higher than healthy controls in noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 but not in those that were critically ill (Fig. 2a). By comparison, critically ill and noncritically ill patients with flu did not differ in their ability to make type I and type III IFNs nor pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 or IL-7 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 6). Similarly, nonhospitalized patients with flu with mild disease exhibited strong production of type I and type III IFNs, indicating that across the spectrum of flu disease severity the antiviral response remains robust. They also exhibited similar production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 and IFN-γ but higher levels of CCL3 compared to either noncritically or critically ill hospitalized patients with flu. Visualizing these patterns on radar plot reveals a major imbalance in the induction of antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses of patients with COVID-19 that does not occur in flu (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2: Comparison of IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns between subgroups of patients with COVID-19 and flu according to disease severity.a, Serum levels of IFN-λ1, IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 and CCL3 for critically and noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 and flu and nonhospitalized patients with mild flu at days 1–3 and 7–10 time intervals after hospital admission or visit, respectively, as well as healthy individuals. Dots show individual measurements and lines median values of hospitalized patients and healthy individuals. Squares show nonhospitalized patients with flu. Gray shading marks the limit of quantification of the assay. b, Radar plots of median cytokine levels and range of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and flu developing critical versus noncritical illness, nonhospitalized patients with flu and healthy individuals at the day 1–3 time interval after admission. Each circle in the radar plot represents logarithmically increasing concentrations from 4–256 pg ml−1 as shown in the healthy controls. For days 1–3, n = 9, 7, 24, 13 and 3 for each of the five consecutive groups, respectively. For days 7–10, n = 8, 13, 15, 12 and 2, respectively. For healthy individuals, n = 10. P values were determined by a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test for nonparametric comparisons. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 show significance over healthy controls. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 show significance between COVID-19 and flu subgroups.Full size imageWe next sought to determine whether imbalanced cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 are related to systemic immune effects and parameters linked to disease severity. To that end, we obtained temporal WBC transcriptomes from five healthy individuals and nine patients with COVID-19, five noncritically and four critically ill, starting from day 1 of entry to the ward or ICU and at different time points thereafter. In total, 24 comprehensive RNA-seq gene expression datasets were analyzed. Clustering analyses revealed that samples group according to the severity of the clinical phenotype, indicating this as the main source of variation and providing a way to predict which patients will progress to develop critical or noncritical illness (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 8). Focusing at day 1 as the most relevant time point, we found that 4,225 genes were differentially expressed in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy individuals (Supplementary Table 3). When critically and noncritically ill patients were compared separately to healthy controls, 4,214 and 4,902 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed, respectively, of which 1,979 were common whereas the rest were uniquely found in one or the other patient group (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Of these DEGs, 2,674 genes were also significantly different between critically and noncritically ill patients (Supplementary Table 5). Volcano plots pointed out notable differences in the most highly regulated genes between the groups, with critically ill patients exhibiting stronger immune and antiviral response gene patterns (Fig. 3c–e). Pathway analysis of DEGs indeed revealed that the most significant pathways over-represented in critically ill patients were related to the positive regulation of the immune system, the activation of the innate immune response, the defense response to virus and the cellular response to IFN (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 6). Induction of the IL-1β production pathway and response to IL-1 were also prominent. By contrast, in noncritically ill patients these pathways were not significantly upregulated with the exception of the IL-1β production pathway (Fig. 3f). Other pathways over-represented instead included the regulation of the cellular component size and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 3f).Fig. 3: Kinetic analysis of blood transcriptional signatures of critically and noncritically ill patients with COVID-19.a, Principal-component analysis of peripheral WBC transcriptomes of critically ill (n = 4) and noncritically ill (n = 5) patients or healthy (H1–H5) controls (n = 5). b, Venn diagram showing the unique and common DEGs of peripheral WBC transcriptomes from critically ill (n = 4) and noncritically ill (n = 5) patients compared to healthy (n = 5) individuals. c–e, Volcano plots showing the most significantly upregulated and relevant DEGs in all patients with COVID-19 (c) and their critically (d) and noncritically ill (e) subgroups versus healthy individuals at day 1 of hospitalization.

Dot size indicates the number of genes differentially expressed per pathway, and the red color indicates statistical significance.Full size imageAccordingly, heat maps with temporal information unveiled strong induction of a long set of antiviral genes in critically ill patients compared to only a fraction of them being upregulated in the noncritically ill group (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). This set includes classical antiviral response genes, which can be induced by type I and III IFN, such as Stat1, Stat3, Irf1, Irf2, Socs3, Isg20, Oasl, Ifi5, Ifit1b, Ifit5, Ifitm10, Gbp1, Gbp2, Gbp4, Gbp5 and Gbp6, all significantly upregulated in critically ill patients over noncritically ill or healthy individuals and Irf3, Socs3, Mx1, Oas1, Ifi27, Ifi44 and Ifitm5 also upregulated in noncritically ill patients albeit to a lower extent than in critically ill patients (Supplementary Table 5). Comparison of the total set of antiviral genes expressed at day 1 as shown in Fig. 4a confirmed a statistically significant difference between critically and noncritically ill patients (P = 1.25 × 10−20), in agreement with the distinct patterns of production of IFN-λ and type I IFNs in these patients. This stronger type I/III IFN response in critically ill patients was unlikely to be due to higher expression of IFN receptor components, as no significant differences were observed between Ifnlr1, Il10rb and Ifnar1 mRNA levels among patient groups and healthy individuals except a twofold increase of Ifnar2 in critically ill patients (Supplementary Table 3).Fig. 4: Heat maps of DEGs of critically and noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy individuals.a–d, Heat maps showing temporal patterns of differentially expressed antiviral genes (a), inflammatory genes (b), inflammasome and PRR genes (c) and leukocyte genes (d) of critically ill and noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy individuals. Blue and yellow colors represent down- and upregulated genes, respectively. Data are expressed as log2 fold values over healthy controls. P, patient.Full size imageFurther heat map analyses pointed to a stronger systemic innate immune response in critically ill patients marked by increased expression of key pro-inflammatory mediators, including complement components (C2, C4bpa), cytokines (Csf1, Cxcl10) and matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp8, Mmp9) over healthy individuals (Fig. 4b). On the contrary, noncritically ill patients exhibited enhanced expression of Il10, a major anti-inflammatory protein-dampening cytokine storms and Il7, which is involved in maintaining T cell homeostasis in the periphery. Notably, inflammasome genes such as Nlrp6, Nrlc4, Nod2, Aim2, Casp9, Casp10, Il1rn and Il1r1, all linked to IL-1β production or response20, were also upregulated in critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas Pycard (Asc), a key component of inflammasome assembly, was downregulated in noncritically ill patients over healthy individuals, indicating a prominent role of the IL-1β pathway in more severe disease (Fig. 4c). Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in microbial recognition such as Ddx58 (Rigi), Aim2, Ifih1 (Mda5), Ifi16, Tlr2 and Tlr4, were also upregulated. Overall, when compared as a set, inflammasome and PRR genes shown in Fig. 4c were significantly different between the two groups (P = 9.72 × 10−7). At the cell-type level, gene expression analysis revealed a dominant activated neutrophil/myeloid cell signature (Mpo, Elane, Cd177, Itgam, Arg1, Ceacam8 and Fcgr1a) in the critically ill group that was milder and not significant in noncritically ill patients (Fig. 4d). On the contrary, T, B and NK lymphocyte lineage and related genes (Cd3d, Cd3e, Cd4, Cd8a, Cd19, Cd22 and Ncam1) were markedly downregulated in critically ill patients. These data are consistent with lymphopenia, high neutrophil counts and a high N/L ratio also present in these patients (Extended Data Fig. 4) and previously reported to be associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (refs. 3,4). Cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 may directly account for these effects, as they are well known to trigger the mobilization and activation of neutrophils, the development of lymphopenia and the induction of innate immune responses and systemic inflammation21,22. Thus, WBC transcriptomes of patients with COVID-19, early during hospitalization, can provide vital information about disease severity and guide treatment such as the administration of IL-1 inhibitors in a more personalized manner.Interestingly, imbalanced cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia were associated with a much worse disease outcome compared to flu. First, the COVID-19 group exhibited higher incidence of critical disease and mortality (Extended Data Fig. 5). Second, patients with COVID-19 overall, as well as when grouped as critically and noncritically ill, required longer hospitalization time than their flu counterparts (Fig. 5a–c). For noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19, median time was 14 and 23 d, respectively, compared to flu at 7 and 19 d (Fig. 5b,c). Prolonged hospitalization could be attributed to the untuned antiviral responses, leading to a more protracted clinical course of COVID-19 relative to flu and a need for longer recovery even for the noncritically ill group.Fig. 5: Correlation of IFN and cytokine expression patterns with disease outcomes.a–c, Comparison of hospitalization time between patients with COVID-19 and flu.

Dots show individual measurements of patients with COVID-19. Open and shaded dots correspond to noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19, respectively (e–i). For a–c, P values for the comparison of hospitalization curves between patient groups were determined using the log-rank test. For d–i, P values for the strength and direction of association between the two variables, as indicated in each panel, were determined using the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient for nonparametric data. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.Full size imageTo identify cytokines and cytokine combinations that can predict hospitalization time, and therefore be of prognostic value for risk stratification independently of known laboratory and clinical severity parameters (such as O2 saturation, respiratory rate or N/L ratio), we generated a correlation matrix of the cytokine levels at admission (day 1–3 interval) and the duration of hospital stay (Fig. 4d). We found that higher IL-6 and IL-10, and lower CCL3 concentrations, were directly proportional to the duration of hospitalization (Fig. 5d–f). The value of IL-6 and IL-10 as biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity has been reported4,23,24 but for CCL3 this is new. Notably, IFN-λ concentration also correlated with higher IL-6 and IL-10 and longer hospitalization time, consistent with their almost exclusive induction in critically but not noncritically ill patients (Fig. 5d).A question that arises is whether IFN levels induced in critically ill patients are beneficial, as delayed type I or type III IFN production has been shown in animal models to cause immunopathology13,14,25 or interfere with epithelial repair26,27, respectively. We found that higher IFN-λ concentrations during ICU entry were associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the respiratory tract and faster viral clearance (Fig. 5g,h). Moreover, a higher IFN-λ to type I IFN ratio at that time was linked to a shorter stay in the ICU (Fig. 5i), with the two patients with the highest IFN-α levels also exhibiting the longest stay (both 23 d over a median of 17 d). These data suggest that delayed IFN-λ induction may still be protective in critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas IFN-α may do more harm than good, at least in a subset of patients.Taken together, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not follow the conventional paradigm of antiviral immunity. Instead of activating first the antiviral response followed by the pro-inflammatory process as a second line of protection, it does the opposite; it triggers the pro-inflammatory response long before IFN-mediated antiviral defenses are induced, if at all. This scenario is a major paradox and helps explain many of the unique or unusual features of COVID-19. The long virus incubation time and persistence in the respiratory tract, giving positive SARS-CoV-2 tests for weeks, can be attributed to the delayed and/or reduced production of type I and III IFNs. The absent or very mild symptoms of patients for an unusually extended period of time, can be attributed to the lack or impaired and delayed expression of type I IFNs, principal mediators of flu-like disease and symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, fatigue, dyspnea and fever in humans28. Finally, the early and persistent expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines culminating into prolonged hyperinflammation can promote the sudden development of respiratory failure requiring hospitalization and frequently ICU admission. Noteworthy, in flu the swift induction of the type I and III IFN response, across the spectrum of disease severity, correlates with quicker recovery and markedly lower incidence of critical disease or mortality13,25. The recent demonstration in a retrospective cohort study of 446 patients with COVID-19 that early administration of IFN-α (IFN-a2b) is linked to reduced in-hospital mortality, whereas late IFN-α therapy leads to increased mortality and delayed recovery leaves little doubt that the timing of IFN production is also crucial in patients with COVID-19 (ref. 29). Conceivably, late production of type I or III IFN production might confer no viral resistance, but instead promote immunopathology.Whether this unique clinical course of COVID-19 is related to the presence of SARS-CoV-2-derived IFN inhibitors as previously proposed for SARS-CoV30,31 and MERS-CoV32 is not known but is a possibility. As with other viruses, inhibition may be overcome once higher viral loads are reached, for example after incubation of the virus and eventual spread in susceptible individuals. In our study, we did not see significant differences in virus levels between noncritically and critically ill patients at the time that IFNs were measured (Extended Data Fig. 9). However, higher virus load in severe over mild disease has been described in one study but not been confirmed in another33,34. Moreover, higher virus load can overcome SARS-CoV-2 dose-dependent suppression of IFN production in cultured respiratory epithelial cells16.Our study is not without caveats. First, it characterizes cytokine patterns in the circulation and although these are commonly used to analyze ‘cytokine storms’ in response to infection, how well they correlate to immune responses in the respiratory tract is difficult to know. Second, our study is relatively small and our findings await validation in other cohorts. Still, our study is uniquely informative as it addresses the production of IFNs and the activation of the ‘cytokine storm’ in COVID-19 in a temporal manner, from hospital admission to ICU entry, and should therefore be particularly useful for the design of clinical trials testing IFN therapies. It also describes biomarkers such as IL-6 and CCL3 and gene expression signatures that can be particularly useful for assessing the risk for critical disease development and duration of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 who are newly admitted to hospital. Finally, it provides a side-by-side comparison of COVID-19 with flu, studying patient populations with similar genetic, demographic and clinicopathological characteristics, and therefore uncovers important differences in the antiviral immune response between these two diseases that have not been previously suspected.MethodsStudy participantsIn this noninterventional study, 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia according to World Health Organization guidelines and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with reverse transcription (RT–PCR) testing on a respiratory sample (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchial aspirate) were included18. Patients were recruited between March and April 2020 from the 1st Respiratory and Critical Care Clinic ward and ICU of the ‘Sotiria’ General Chest Diseases Hospital of Athens, Greece. Healthy, asymptomatic individuals with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT–PCR at the time of inclusion served as the control group.The severity of COVID-19 cases was classified based on the adaptation of the Seventh Revised Trial Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guidance35. All patients had moderate-to-severe disease and presented with respiratory symptoms and radiological findings of pneumonia. They met any of the following criteria: 1. Respiratory distress (≥30 breaths min−1); 2. Oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest; 3. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤300 mm Hg with no other organ failure. Sixteen patients developed ARDS and critical illness due to respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg) requiring mechanical ventilation, with shock and/or other organ failure necessitating ICU care. Blood was drawn at various time intervals during hospitalization and at discharge; and WBCs and serum were collected and stored until further use.To better understand the immune response of COVID-19 infection, individuals from a cohort of patients with confirmed H1N1/H3N2 influenza A virus infection were also studied. In total, 40 patients were recruited between December 2018 and May 2019 at the 2nd Respiratory Clinic of the ‘Sotiria’ General Chest Diseases Hospital, Athens, Greece and the ‘Attikon’ University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece. Confirmation was obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel test (bioMerieux). Similarly to patients with COVID-19, those with flu were categorized according to the severity of the disease into mild cases with no radiological findings of pneumonia, no need for oxygen support and hospitalization, and moderate-to-severe cases with radiological findings of pneumonia (X-ray or computed tomography), oxygen need and symptoms requiring hospitalization36. Hospitalized patients with flu were subdivided into patients who did not develop (PaO2/FiO2 > 200 mm Hg) or developed critical disease (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg). Patients with flu had similar clinicopathological characteristics to patients with COVID-19 upon admission (Supplementary Table 1). All those included in the study were clinically evaluated and followed longitudinally during the whole period of hospitalization (from admission to discharge). All blood specimens were processed immediately for serum collection and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Additionally, serum from ten healthy individuals, three male and seven female, with a median age of 54.5 (41–70) years, was also collected and used as a control group.The study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval by the Ethics Committees of the ‘Sotiria’ General Chest Diseases Hospital, Athens, Greece (approval numbers 16707/10-7-18 and 8385/31-3-20) and the ‘Attikon’ University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece (approval number 1821A/22-9-16). All participants provided written informed consent.SARS-CoV-2 detectionRNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchial aspirates by using the Nuclisens easyMAG instrument (bioMerieux) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were used for initial diagnosis, while bronchial aspirates were used for assessing viral load in the ICU. Real time RT–PCR was performed on extracted nucleic acids targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 as described previously37.Cytokine analysisSerum samples frozen and stored at −20 °C, without other thawing, were analyzed for the presence of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17A, IL-23, CCL3, CCL4 and CX3CL1 with the MILLIPLEX MAP Human High-Sensitivity T cell Panel (Merck Millipore). Thawed serum aliquots were centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 °C immediately before testing. Each assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for serum samples, utilizing recommended sample dilutions and standard curve concentrations (Merck Millipore). Samples were analyzed on a Luminex 200 System using Luminex xPonent v.3.1 software according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Merck Millipore). For each cytokine on each assay, the lowest detection limits were in pg ml−1: 0.50 for IFN-γ, 0.42 for TNF, 0.2 for IL-1β, 0.24 for IL-2, 0.60 for IL-4, 0.16 for IL-6, 0.33 for IL-7, 0.30 for IL-8, 0.50 for IL-10, 0.24 for IL-12 (p70), 0.20 for IL-13, 0.50 for IL-17A, 8.00 for IL-23, 2.00 for CCL3, 0.80 for CCL4 and 10.00 for CX3CL1. High-sensitivity sandwich ELISA kits were used for the detection of human IFN-α (Abcam) and IFN-λ1 (BioLegend). Their sensitivity in pg ml−1 was 1.00 for IFN-α and 2.00 for IFN-λ1. Data were acquired and analyzed using Biotek Gen5 v.1.05 software.RNA-seq analysisFor RNA-seq analysis, total RNA was purified from whole blood leukocytes with the RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN). RNA samples were treated with DNase I (QIAGEN) and quantified on a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit v.2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality of the libraries was validated with an Agilent DNA 1000 kit run on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. This analysis returned the log2 fold changes of the treatment compared to healthy individuals for each time point. DEG transcripts of all, critically ill and noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 were selected based on an adjusted P value cutoff of 0.05 (false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%). Additional statistical comparison of critically ill and noncritically ill COVID-19 DEGs was performed. Pathway-enrichment analysis was conducted on DEGs over those of healthy individuals using the ClueGO and CluePedia plugin of Cytoscape. Heat maps were performed using TM4 MeV v.4.8 and Euclidean distance was used for hierarchical clustering. Clustering and dendrograms were performed with the hclust function and ggdendro package, respectively, in R.Transcriptomics analysesSamples sequenced on NextSeq 500 (Illumina) were analyzed using standard protocols. Briefly, raw reads were pre-processed using FastQC v.0.11.2 and cutadapt v.1.6, and then mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using the TopHat version 2.0.13, Bowtie v.1.1.1 and Samtools version v.1.1. The read count table was produced using HTSeq v.0.6. Following filtering of raw read counts with a threshold of 10 in at least one dataset, resulting in a total of 21,880 genes. DESeq2 analysis38 was performed among the critically ill and noncritically ill patients and healthy individuals, as well as among the critically ill and noncritically ill patients. This analysis returned the log2 fold changes of the treatment compared to healthy individuals for each time point. DEG transcripts were selected based on an adjusted P value cutoff of 0.05 (FDR 5%). Pathway-enrichment analysis was conducted using the ClueGO and CluePedia plugin of Cytoscape. Heat maps were performed using TM4 MeV v.4.8 and Euclidean distance was used for hierarchical clustering. Clustering and dendrograms were performed with the hclust function and ggdendro package, respectively, in R.Statistical analysisData were analyzed on GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance of differences among cytokine levels was assessed using the Mann–Whitney U-test for nonparametric data. Associations between cytokine levels and hospitalization time (in days) were tested using Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and visualized using the corrplot R package. Statistical significance of differences among gene groups was assessed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test for parametric data. Polar charts from the ggplot2 R package were used for the visualization of differences in cytokine response patterns.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The 29,000 chickens are now being slaughtered and a 10-kilometre observation area is being set up covering 482 nearby farms with about 644,000 poultry, the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte local government authority added. A series of outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in Europe in recent weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the illness. The disease has been found in countries including France, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Poland, after severely hitting Russia, Kazakhstan and Israel. Some 11 other farms in Germany have suffered outbreaks. About 10,500 turkeys were slaughtered after H5N8 was found at a farm in northern England, British authorities said on 29 November. Risk to humans from the disease is considered low, but past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive slaughtering programmes to contain. Read more about this story here.

Considering the deadly effects of the virus, people have taken extra precautions and measures to protect themselves from the virus. However, they're still grappling with the confusion caused by the combined effects of a cold, flu and COVID-19.2/5What is the claim?In light of the current pandemic, COVID testing has become one of the most important steps in detecting the virus in people. However, recently, many people have refrained from taking the test, claiming that while they're suffering from a cold or a flu or if they've taken a flu shot, they will definitely test positive for the virus. Many have taken to the social media to render the ineffectiveness and inaccuracy of the coronavirus tests, saying that they're not to be trusted at all.3/5The link between a common cold and COVID-19 testWhen it comes to associating common cold with a positive COVID-19 test, it all comes down to the antibody tests. These tests take samples of the blood and detect the disease-specific proteins produced by white blood cells to fight a virus and find out if a person has had a past infection. However, they should not be confused with a diagnostic test.As per the reports of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "a positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance that a positive result means you have antibodies from an infection with a different virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses)."4/5Flu, flu vaccine and COVID-19 testIn terms of the flu, the viruses that define it and the ones that determine the coronavirus are very different and distinct. The flu is caused by an influenza virus, not a coronavirus. Therefore, having contracted a flu or being vaccinated for it will not produce a positive result for COVID-19. According to a spokesperson at the the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), all the tests authorized by them for the coronavirus are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus. But none of them have observed cross-reactivity with any of the tests.5/5According to researchAs per recent study, the claim that that the common cold, flu and flu vaccine will all result in positive tests for the novel coronavirus is absolutely untrue. COVID-19 tests target a specific and distinct form of genetic material or proteins. Therefore, it is unlikely that other infections, diseases or vaccines will influence the coronavirus test in anyway. It's possible that the common cold will produce a positive result in an antibody test, but those aren't used to diagnose COVID-19.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousFrom blackbuck to sangai: Most unique deer species in Indiatravel10 reasons how sprouted moong can help control blood sugar levelsFoodIsha Talwar shows effortless ways to strike a pose​india​Shraddha Srinath's lively pictures to brighten your day​india​Sunlight filtering through Hummingbird: Award winning pics of Australian photographer​india7 tips to discipline a child without scolding or hittingindia​Ahaana Krishna mesmerises fans with her stunning photos​indiaSargun Mehta’s saree look is the ultimate festive must-haveindiaThis is why one must have pomegranates dailyFood Next123 Bigg Boss Arfeen refuses to shake hands with Avinash as he leaves BB18BB18: Kamya condemns Vivian; lauds Karan Veer MehraAll you need to know about Kashish-Digvijay's controversyBB18: Sara emotionally touches Eisha & Avinash's feetsBB 18's evicted Arfeen: Vivian was very aloof in the game but..BB 18: Arfeen Khan gets evicted from the showBB 18 promo: Rohit Shetty school Karan Veer MehraBB 18: Kanwar on netizens slamming him for the 'marriage proposal controversy'Bigg Boss 18 promo: Rohit Shetty schools Sara123 Photostories 5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf water5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom Shoaib Ibrahim calling Bigg Boss no more a personality show to Divyanka Tripathi admitting it is not her cup of tea: Celebs who have refused to do the show​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from school8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel richHow tall are Trump family membersBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​10 Countries with lowest IQ in the world123lifestyle videos03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

Most residents will receive spray instead of shot starting FridayCBC News · Posted: Dec 01, 2020 12:46 PM EST | Last Updated: December 2, 2020The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in people between the ages of two and 59. (Alan Hawes/The Post and Courier/Associated Press)Social SharingOttawa Public Health (OPH) is turning to a nasal spray as its primary flu vaccine for residents between the ages of two and 59. FluMist was originally available only for private purchase this year, but is now being offered by the Ontario government as demand continues across the province, according to a memo to the mayor and council from Dr. Vera Etches, the city's medical officer of health.The spray will be available at OPH clinics starting Friday. It will also be distributed to pharmacies and family physicians, OPH said.The unprecedented demand for the influenza vaccine this year caused some pharmacies to run out, delaying vaccination for some Ottawa residents.Nasal spray 'proven to be effective'Etches said the nasal spray, which is authorized for use in Canada in children and adults up to 59, is "proven to be effective" and has the support of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. OPH has distributed the spray in previous flu seasons, Etches said. Infants, adults over 60, people who are immunosuppressed, pregnant women and those with uncontrolled asthma will receive a flu shot instead of the spray.Concerned about the possibility of a "double pandemic" and the resulting strain on the health-care system, public health officials have been especially adamant about residents getting vaccinated against influenza this season, and residents have apparently heeded the call.More than 48,000 Ottawa residents have been vaccinated against influenza since OPH began the current campaign in October. That's more than four times the number vaccinated during the previous flu season. "OPH will continue to offer available appointments on our website based on community demand and vaccine availability," Etches wrote. "OPH continues to recommend that individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications seek out opportunities to get the flu vaccine as soon as possible."CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.More than the headlines.

(iStock: Dr_Microbe)abc.net.auews/sharp-rise-in-rsv-infections-among-children-covid-19-risk/12945930Link copiedShareShare articleAustralians are suffering from flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, at their highest level since social distancing measures took effect earlier this year, according to monitoring survey FluTracking. Key points:There have been increases in flu-like symptoms across Australia Lung infections among children are also on the rise Experts are worried it may indicate some Australians are starting to relax social distancing measuresThe levels of these symptoms across the whole population are still lower than in previous years, but there has been a sharp rise since mid-October. At the same time, children are presenting to emergency departments with respiratory conditions in higher numbers than the average peak over the past five years, with very high levels of pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The situation has researchers concerned the public may be relaxing behaviour around infection control and that could mean any potential COVID-19 outbreak may spread. Professor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the Westmead children's hospital, said the numbers were worrying, especially as the country relaxed its physical distancing measures."We're stepping somewhat into the dangerous unknown," he told the ABC.Professor Booy said with these infections on the rise, and state governments easing restrictions on physical distancing, the situation was "going to have to be closely monitored".Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicFlu symptoms, not the fluFlu-like symptoms in the community are monitored by FluTracking, an online survey that asks more than 140,000 people to detail what symptoms they have experienced in the past week.In recent weeks, the survey has seen as many as 0.7 per cent of respondents — or about one in every 140 — report flu-like symptoms, which is roughly triple the rate seen in October.The symptoms are not driven by influenza infections or COVID-19.The rise of flu-like symptoms is mostly among children aged between zero and 17 and aligns with a sharp rise of confirmed cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) since October, reported by NSW Health.RSV causes respiratory infections, most commonly in young children, and can be severe. It can lead to bronchiolitis, where the small tubes in the child's lungs become inflamed, and pneumonia — an infection in the lungs.The rise in those symptoms and lab-confirmed RSV also corresponds with a sharp increase in people going to emergency departments in NSW with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially in children under the age of five.That rate is now higher than the usual average peak in the past five years, despite being delayed by several months, with the high peak now occurring in warm weather when cases are usually low.Dr Craig Dalton, a public health physician from the University of Newcastle who runs the FluTracking survey, said the uptick in these viruses meant we were probably at an increased risk of COVID-19 spreading too."All other factors held constant — if we're seeing an increase in other viruses transmitting then there's possibly an increased risk because the conditions are right for COVID-19 to spread as well," he said.Dr Dalton said the sharp increase in these statistics could partly be a result of less immunity to these viruses in the community, following such strong social distancing earlier in the year. "But it's probably [also] a relaxation in physical distancing across the population," he said.He pointed to data that suggested people were increasingly engaging in activities that carried a risk of spreading viruses, such as using public transport.Data compiled by Apple shows mobility — including using public transport — was increasing. While it dropped to just 20 per cent of the usual levels back in April, it was now up to 60 per cent of pre-COVID levels.'May be the start of a wider epidemic'Professor Booy warned despite the infections being almost exclusively among children, it may not stay that way."Once it's entrenched in children it gets passed up to older siblings and parents," he said."It may be the start of a wider epidemic and just harder to pick in an adult who has prior immunity."Coronavirus questions answeredPhoto shows An illustration of a cell on an orange background with the word 'coronacast' overlayed.Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast.These viruses frequently go undetected in adults, since symptoms are often less severe, and so testing is less common.Professor Booy said the late peak in paediatric lung infections could explain why the level is unusually high."The longer you go between exposures, the less your [immune] memory is to the last exposure," he said."So a lot of children, instead of going six months between exposures, they've gone 12 months, their memory — the cell antibody memory — is reduced."As a result, there are more children with low immunity to the circulating virus, Professor Booy said.RSV doesn't come out of 'thin air'Professor Marylouise McLaws is an infection control expert from University of NSW who works on pandemics with the World Health Organization.She said the data was concerning."They don't get RSV out of thin air and it suggests to me that parents aren't upholding the advice," Professor McLaws said."They're probably hearing that children aren't likely to get COVID-19 and when they do get it they are less likely to get serious disease."But if the kids are getting sick, then the parents are also being exposed to other people's children and also other adults."Parents are probably becoming COVID-fatigued and moving back to normal and they're just very fortunate that there are very low levels of community spread of COVID."However, she said the high rates of testing for these illnesses was a positive, and patients were presenting to GPs and emergency departments.Professor McLaws said childcare operators were very aware of the measures required to minimise the spread of respiratory infections and the viruses were probably spreading in other settings."Possibly children are just starting to socialise more without the new social norm of trying to do it outside and trying to keep social distance," she said.Professor Booy agreed. "The more we socially interact, particularly children with each other and with adults, the more the rise is of new infections," he said.Influenza 'virtually eliminated'Meanwhile, there have not been any deaths from influenza in NSW since April, compared with 320 deaths in the same period last year. Between January and April, only 12 people died of influenza.Dr Dalton said few experts would have predicted that. "I'm not sure any infectious disease experts would have thought this was possible," he said. "Influenza is very hard to stop spreading, but we have, as a country, got to the point where it's almost eliminated — we have almost no transmission of influenza."Dr Dalton said influenza usually killed between 3,000 and 4,000 people each year, and most of those lives had been saved by social distancing measures put in place to control COVID-19.Ask us your coronavirus questionsPosted Sat 5 Dec 2020 at 7:18pmSaturday 5 Dec 2020 at 7:18pmSat 5 Dec 2020 at 7:18pm, updated Sat 5 Dec 2020 at 9:41pmSaturday 5 Dec 2020 at 9:41pmSat 5 Dec 2020 at 9:41pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

a 3km (1.9-mile) protection zone immediately around the location of the outbreak and a 10km (6.2-mile) surveillance zone around that.More Yorkshire storiesDefra's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: "We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it."Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises."The disease can spread to poultry and other captive birds when wild birds migrate from mainland Europe during winter, Defra added.Routine health advice is being offered to those working on the farm.Dr Gavin Dabrera, consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said the World Health Organisation has never confirmed any cases of H5N8 in humans to date.The Food Standards Agency said properly-cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, remain safe to eat.More on this storyBird flu outbreak at family theme parkPublished23 November 2020Bird flu killed wild birds in south west EnglandPublished11 November 2020Related internet linksDefraPublic Health EnglandFood Standards AgencyThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.From other local news sitesTop foodie trips across Yorkshire to take in autumnExternalNorthern EchoMoped fire in York started deliberately, crews sayExternalMalton Gazette and Herald'Lovely Sunday lunch' -

His administration launched a nationwide vaccination program to immunize every American citizen by the end of the year. (Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Library)Social SharingFor Pascal Imperato, a communicable disease epidemiologist who in 1976 was in charge of immunizing New York City against a potential swine flu epidemic, the effort to vaccinate the population against COVID-19 feels like a familiar challenge."We were going to vaccinate six million people in six weeks," he said in a phone interview. "And we were absolutely certain we could pull it off. And we would have."U.S. could begin COVID-19 vaccine rollout by mid-December, top health official saysU.K. approves Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for emergency useWould have, because, ultimately, the largest national immunization program that had ever been undertaken in the U.S. was cut short as the epidemic never materialized, and public skepticism about the program began to mount.Still, while the COVID-19 pandemic is very real, and the population is much larger, the vaccination program of 1976 may offer some lessons as governments around the world prepare to inoculate the public at large."If the program is well organized, mobilizing all of the resources that are capable of administering this vaccine, there [shouldn't] be any problem whatsoever," Imperato said. In March 1976, the administration of then president Gerald Ford launched a $137 million US nation-wide vaccination program to immunize every American citizen by the end of the year.The diagnosis of swine flu on a New Jersey army base had led to panic among top U.S. scientists and officials who feared the disease could spread and potentially precipitate a health crisis similar to the deadly Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.Even though it was cut short, by December 1976 more than 40 million Americans — about one-fifth of the population — had been vaccinated, and about 650,000 in New York City.Utilizing volunteers, setting up sitesImperato said that on any given day they had about 900 people who were involved in getting the vaccine out to the general public. That included 500 to 600 volunteers who were recruited each day through the city's chapter of the American Red Cross.University graduates, sanitary inspectors and public health nursing assistants were also hired and trained to use automatic jet injectors and to give cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Sixty vaccination sites were established in places that included schools and police precincts."Anywhere we could," said Imperato, who is the founding dean and distinguished service professor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center School of Public Health.Mary O'Brien, 77, resident of the St. Augustine Home, Chicago, winces as she is inoculated against the swine flu in 1976. (Bettmann Archive/Getty Images)As well, 15 mobile teams were created to vaccinate over 40,000 people in more than 200 nursing homes and about 100,000 people in 150 senior citizen centres."This required military organization, if you will, and we were able to put together a team and put into place the people that we needed to bring this about," he said.A great deal of administrative and clerical support goes into a program of this kind, he said."We have to have people register. We had to have as much information about them as possible, because we needed to know who we were vaccinating and if any of them had any reaction. We had to have teams of people checking on adverse events."Local capacity can be the 'weak link'Nationwide, however, there were some logistical problems, said Harvey Fineberg, a physician who was tasked with co-authoring a review into the 1976 Swine flu vaccine program.The actual immunizations were quite erratic in their frequency in different communities, he said."So a lesson that's still relevant today, whether in different provinces in Canada or different states and counties and the U.S., is the local capacity," he said."That last mile, getting the immunization into the arms of the recipients, that's the weak link in the chain."What made the difference was the degree of organization and capacity of the public health departments in each community to plan and administer the vaccine, Fineberg said."So it wasn't that it was only cities or only rural, rich or poor. It boiled down to ability to deliver."WATCH | Experts discuss strategies for Canada's COVID-19 vaccine rollout COVID-19 vaccine rollout: What the experts say4 years agoDuration 3:56As Canada prepares to distribute millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, Chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization Dr. Caroline Quach-Thanh and David Levine, who managed the H1N1 vaccine rollout for Montreal, say this vaccination campaign won't be without challenges.Dealing with 'coincident events'But one of the more significant problems of the program was the poor job officials did in communicating to the public when headlines emerged linking potential adverse effects to the vaccine, experts say.Some companies will make big money off their COVID-19 vaccines — but not as much as they could"There are definitely — and this is going to be true this coming year — there will be coincident events," Fineberg said."Preparing the public for expected coincidences simply because stuff happens every day, that's really, really key," he said.During the 1976 vaccination program, three elderly people in Pittsburgh had heart attacks after receiving their vaccine. The publicity and headlines it generated led to a handful of states suspending their vaccination programs while they investigated a potential association, said George Dehner, an associate professor of history at Witchita State University and author of Influenza: A Century of Science and Public Health.While no link to the vaccination was found, polls at the time showed a significant decrease in the number of people who said they would get the vaccine because they feared some adverse effect, Dehner said.A patient takes part in Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial in May. On Sunday, a U.S. health official said the country's first immunizations could begin on Dec. 12. (University of Maryland School of Medicine/File/The Associated Press)There will be a certain expected death rate of people of a certain age on any given day, Pascal said. And what one has to look at is the death rate above the expected rate when running an immunization program."And so the CDC in this particular case did not do a good job of anticipating that and explaining that," Dehner said.But the vaccination rollout also saw dozens of people come down with the rare neurological disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome at a much higher rate than would be expected. Unlike the heart attacks, where no link was found, a scientific review has found there was an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome after the swine flu vaccinations, according to the CDC. The exact reason for this link remains unknown.In a 2009 interview with the The Bulletin, the health journal of the World Health Organization, Fineberg said those cases wouldn't have been "a blip on the screen had there been a pandemic but, in the absence of any swine flu disease, these rare events were sufficient to end the programme." Focus on science, not politicsWhen Guillain-Barre syndrome increased, some members of the public "became very skeptical and saw the whole thing as politically based, and not science-based," said Richard Wenzel, emeritus chairman and professor of the Department of Internal Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University."There was a concern that maybe politics was driving some public health responses," he said."One of the things that I would say we're still trying to learn is: policy should be scientifically based.... whoever gives the message has to say, 'Here's what we know; here's what we don't know; and here are the assumptions we're making currently that guide our policy.'"That sounds simple, but it's rarely done, even today."ABOUT THE AUTHORMark GollomSenior ReporterMark Gollom is a Toronto-based reporter with CBC News.

Rotherham Council is urging all poultry, game and captive bird keepers to ensure they are aware of new legal requirements - whether they keep birds commercially or as pets. An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) has been declared following recent confirmed cases of H5N8 avian flu in England, in captive and wild birds. This introduces a legal requirement for all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures to help prevent the disease spreading to more birds. Bird keepers across England, Wales and Scotland must: Ensure that areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds, and by removing wild bird food sources. Feed and water birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birds. Minimise movement in and out of bird enclosures. Clean and disinfect footwear, and keep areas where birds live clean and tidy. Reduce any existing contamination by cleansing and disinfecting concrete areas, and by fencing off wet or boggy areas. Keepers with more than 500 birds will also need to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites, workers will need to change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and site vehicles will need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Rotherham Council’s Assistant Director of Community Safety and Street Scene, Tom Smith, said: “Whether you keep a few birds in your back garden or are running a large-scale commercial operation – you’re now legally required to take these additional biosecurity standards. Indeed, it’s in your own interest to protect your birds by taking measures to prevent the spread of this highly infectious disease. “However Public Health England has confirmed the risk to the public is very low, and the Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.” Poultry keepers and members of the public should report dead wild birds to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77, and keepers should report suspicion of disease to the Animal and Plant Health Agency on 03000 200 301. The prevention zone will be kept under regular review by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as it monitors the threat of bird flu.

Full details of the Vaccination UK schedule, including which schools are due to be visited when, is available at Flu Vaccines. Parents can also download a consent form online if they have mislaid theirs. Any child who has missed their free vaccine at schools which have already been visited by nurses from Vaccination UK can get it at their GP or by attending one of a number of catch-up clinics. These are scheduled to take place at Phoenix Health Centre on Saturday 5 December and Park Village Education Centre on Saturday 19 December. The award-winning Flu Fighters campaign is back for a third year to encourage children to get vaccinated, with free copies of this year's out of this world storybook, Flu Fighters in Close Encounters of the Germed Kind, being distributed to all primary-aged pupils. All pupils, including those in Year 7, also receive consent forms and information about the nasal spray. Councillor Jasbir Jaspal, the City of Wolverhampton Council's Cabinet Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "The vaccine is the best way to protect your children and other family members from becoming ill with the flu. I would urge parents to return their consent forms as soon as they receive them so that their children can have their free vaccine and become a Flu Fighter!" To find out more about the vaccine, and to read and download free copies of the first two Flu Fighters books, Flu Fighters Versus Chilly, Achy and Snotty and Flu Fighters in The Battle of Planet Bogey, please visit Flu Vaccines. The free nasal spray is also available to children aged 2 and 3, and children aged 11 and over with some long term health conditions, via GPs. Adults people with long-term health conditions, people who were shielding from coronavirus and their families, the over 65s, carers and health and social care staff, people in long-stay care and pregnant women are also eligible for free flu jabs through their GP or pharmacist. People aged 50 to 64 will also get a free flu vaccination from next month as part of expanded flu vaccination programme this winter.

Read our privacy noticeWhile we’re working hard on the Isle of Man to avoid a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, we now also need to be on our guard about another possible pandemic - avian influenza (or ’bird flu’).It can have harmful effects on humans, usually linked to the respiratory tract, and it’s often fatal in birds - be they wild or captive.Although some bird species such as geese may no show clinical signs of having the disease, infected birds usually present with one of more of the following symptoms:A swollen headAlso in the newsPetition launched to oust Isle of Man government Business staff to run Isle of Man charity shopTime to vote winner of Douglas city centre customer service awardHospice At Home look to fundraise by taking on 'Warden's Walks' challenge across the islandBlue discolouration of the neck and throatLoss of appetiteRespiratory distress such as a gaping beak, coughing, sneezing, gurgling, or rattlingDiarrhoeaFewer eggs laidAvian influenza isn’t an airborne disease, and it spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. It can also be spread via contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear.The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people. But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between people.There have been several outbreaks of avian influenza in the last month in the UK, with hot spots in Kent and Devon and, much closer to home, western Cheshire.Migratory wild waterfowl (ducks, geese and swans) and gulls pose a continual threat for the introduction of avian influenza into premises where poultry, game birds, pet and other captive birds are kept. Anyone who keeps poultry must keep a close watch on them for any signs of disease, and must seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns.Owners of poultry in the UK are being urged to strengthen their bio-security measures in order to prevent further outbreaks. These measures include:Ensuring the areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds, and by removing wild bird food sourcesFeeding and watering captive birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birdsMinimising movement in and out of bird enclosuresCleaning and tidying areas where birds liveDisinfecting footwear when leaving bird enclosures, and washing hands thoroughly.It may only be a matter of time before the Isle of Man is affected by avian influenza, and so owners of birds should start putting extra precautions in place.However, we should not be deterred from feeding wild birds, particularly at a time of year when they need our help the most. Keeping bird feeders, tables and water bowls clean, and washing your hands thoroughly after you’ve touched them, will help to keep the virus at bay.If you have an injured or sick bird, wild or captive, please do not take it into a veterinary surgery’s waiting room - keep it outside in a container so that a vet can examine it in the car park. This will minimise the risk of contamination.On a positive note, Public Health England advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.More About:Manx SPCAcovidDevonSPREAD THE NEWSCommentsThis article has no comments yet. Be the first to leave a comment.

It is February 10 in Beijing and President Xi Jinping, who for weeks has been absent from public view, is addressing hospital staff in the city of Wuhan as they battle to contain the spread of a still officially unnamed novel coronavirus.From a secure room about 1200 kilometres from the epicenter, Mr Xi expressed his condolences to those who have died in the outbreak. He urged greater public communication, as around the world concerns mounted about the potential threat posed by the new disease.That same day, Chinese authorities reported 2478 new confirmed cases - raising the total global number to more than 40,000, with fewer than 400 cases occurring outside of mainland China. Yet CNN can now reveal how official documents circulated internally show that this was only part of the picture.READ MORE: Rush to publish COVID-19 research saw errors in top medical journals triple, study findsThis photo taken on February 4, 2020 shows a medical staff member (L) taking samples from a person to be tested for the new coronavirus at a quarantine zone in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, in China's central Hubei province. . (Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT (Photo by STR/A (AFP via Getty Images)In a report marked "internal document, please keep confidential," local health authorities in the province of Hubei, where the virus was first detected, list a total of 5918 newly detected cases on February 10, more than double the official public number of confirmed cases, breaking down the total into a variety of subcategories. This larger figure was never fully revealed at that time, as China's accounting system seemed, in the tumult of the early weeks of the pandemic, to downplay the severity of the outbreak.The previously undisclosed figure is among a string of revelations contained within 117 pages of leaked documents from the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, shared with and verified by CNN.Taken together, the documents amount to the most significant leak from inside China since the beginning of the pandemic and provide the first clear window into what local authorities knew internally and when.The Chinese government has steadfastly rejected accusations made by the United States and other Western governments that it deliberately concealed information relating to the virus, maintaining that it has been upfront since the beginning of the outbreak. However, though the documents provide no evidence of a deliberate attempt to obfuscate findings, they do reveal numerous inconsistencies in what authorities believed to be happening and what was revealed to the public.Medical personnel work in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital designated for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province Monday, Feb. 24, 2020. There are still over 9,000 COVID-19 patients in critical conditions in China by Monday.- PHOTOGRAPH BY Feature China / Barcroft Studios / Future Publishing (Photo credit should read Feature China/Barcroft Media via Getty Images) (Barcroft Media via Getty Images)The documents, which cover an incomplete period between October 2019 and April this year, reveal what appears to be an inflexible health care system constrained by top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis. At several critical moments in the early phase of the pandemic, the documents show evidence of clear missteps and point to a pattern of institutional failings.One of the more striking data points concerns the slowness with which local COVID-19 patients were diagnosed. Even as authorities in Hubei presented their handling of the initial outbreak to the public as efficient and transparent, the documents show that local health officials were reliant on flawed testing and reporting mechanisms. A report in the documents from early March says the average time between the onset of symptoms to confirmed diagnosis was 23.3 days, which experts have told CNN would have significantly hampered steps to both monitor and combat the disease.China has staunchly defended its handling of the outbreak. At a news conference on June 7, China's State Council released a White Paper saying the Chinese government had always published information related to the epidemic in a "timely, open and transparent fashion.""While making an all-out effort to contain the virus, China has also acted with a keen sense of responsibility to humanity, its people, posterity, and the international community," the White Paper says."It has provided information on COVID-19 in a thoroughly professional and efficient way. It has released authoritative and detailed information as early as possible on a regular basis, thus effectively responding to public concern and building public consensus."Firefighters prepare to conduct disinfection at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. (Getty)CNN has reached out to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and National Health Commission, as well as Hubei's Health Commission, which oversees the provincial CDC, for comment on the findings disclosed in the documents, but received no response.Health experts said the documents laid bare why what China knew in the early months mattered."It was clear they did make mistakes - and not just mistakes that happen when you're dealing with a novel virus - also bureaucratic and politically-motivated errors in how they handled it," said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, who has written extensively on public health in China."These had global consequences. You can never guarantee 100 per cent transparency. It's not just about any intentional cover-up, you are also constrained with by technology and other issues with a novel virus. "But even if they had been 100 per cent transparent, that would not stop the Trump administration downplaying the seriousness of it. It would probably not have stopped this developing into a pandemic."Tuesday, December 1, marks one year since the first known patient showed symptoms of the disease in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, according to a key study in the Lancet medical journal.At the same time that the virus is believed to have first emerged, the documents show another health crisis was unfolding: Hubei was dealing with a significant influenza outbreak. It caused cases to rise to 20 times the level recorded the previous year, the documents show, placing enormous levels of additional stress on an already stretched health care system.The influenza "epidemic," as officials noted in the document, was not only present in Wuhan in December, but was greatest in the neighboring cities of Yichang and Xianning. It remains unclear what impact or connection the influenza spike had on the COVID-19 outbreak. And while there is no suggestion in the documents the two parallel crises are linked, information regarding the magnitude of Hubei's influenza spike has still yet to be made public.A woman and a child wearing protective face masks to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in China. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)The leaked revelations come as pressure builds from the US and the European Union on China to fully cooperate with a World Health Organisation inquiry into the origins of the virus that has since spread to every corner of the globe, infecting more than 60 million people and killing 1.46 million.But, so far, access for international experts to hospital medial records and raw data in Hubei has been limited, with the WHO saying last week they had "reassurances from our Chinese government colleagues that a trip to the field" would be granted as part of their investigation.The files were presented to CNN by a whistleblower who requested anonymity. They said they worked inside the Chinese healthcare system, and were a patriot motivated to expose a truth that had been censored, and honor colleagues who had also spoken out. It is unclear how the documents were obtained or why specific papers were selected.The documents have been verified by six independent experts who examined the veracity of their content on behalf of CNN. One expert with close ties to China reported seeing some of the reports during confidential research earlier this year. A European security official with knowledge of Chinese internal documents and procedures also confirmed to CNN that the files were genuine.Metadata from the files seen by CNN contains the names of serving CDC officials as modifiers and authors. The metadata creation dates align with the content of the documents. Digital forensic analysis was also performed to test their computer code against their purported origins.Sarah Morris, from the Digital Forensics Unit at Britain's Cranfield University, said there was no evidence the data had been tampered with or was misleading. She added the older files looked like they had been used repeatedly over a long period of time. "It's almost like a mini file system," she said. "So, it's got lots of room for deleted stuff, for old things. That's a really good sign [of authenticity]."World got more optimistic data than realityThe documents show a wide-range of data on two specific days, February 10 and March 7, that is often at odds with what officials said publicly at the time. A medical worker takes a swab from a resident for the novel coronavirus test in Wuhan, Hubei, China. (Getty)This discrepancy was likely due to a combination of a highly dysfunctional reporting system and a recurrent instinct to suppress bad news, said analysts. These documents show the full extent of what officials knew, but chose not to spell out to the public.On February 10, when China reported 2478 new confirmed cases nationwide, the documents show Hubei actually circulated a different total of 5918 newly reported cases. The internal number is divided into subcategories, providing an insight into the full scope of Hubei's diagnosis methodology at the time."Confirmed cases" number 2345, "clinically diagnosed cases" 1772, and "suspected cases" 1796.The strict and limiting criteria led ultimately to misleading figures, said analysts. "A lot of the suspected cases there should have been included with the confirmed cases," said Mr Huang, from the Council on Foreign Relations, who reviewed the documents and found them to be authentic."The numbers they were giving out were conservative, and this reflects how confusing, complex and chaotic the situation was," he added.That month, Hubei officials presented a daily number of "confirmed cases," and then included later in their statements "suspected cases," without specifying the number of seriously ill patients who had been diagnosed by doctors as being "clinically diagnosed." Often in nationwide tolls, officials would give the daily new "confirmed" cases, and provide a running tally for the entire pandemic of "suspected cases," also into which it seems the "clinically diagnosed" were added. This use of a broad "suspected case" tally effectively downplayed the severity of patients who doctors had seen and determined were infected, according to stringent criteria, experts said.William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said the Chinese approach was conservative, and the data "would have been presented in a different way had US epidemiologists been there to assist."Employees line up for medical workers to take swabs for the coronavirus test at a large factory in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province Friday, May. 15, 2020. Wuhan have begun testing inhabitants for the coronavirus as a program to test everyone in the Chinese city of 11 million people in 10 days got underway. (Chinatopix Via AP) CHINA OUT (AP/AAP)He said Chinese officials "seemed actually to minimise the impact of the epidemic at any moment in time. To include patients who were suspected of having the infection obviously would have expanded the size of outbreak and would have given, I think, a truer appreciation of the nature of the infection and its size."Protocols for coronavirus diagnosis, published by China's National Health Commission in late January, told doctors to label a case "suspected" if a patient had contact history with known cases, and a fever and pneumonia symptoms, and to elevate the case to "clinically diagnosed" if those symptoms were confirmed by an X-ray or CT scan. A case would only be "confirmed" if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or genetic sequencing tests came back positive.Andrew Mertha, director of the China Studies Program at John Hopkins University, said officials might have been motivated to "lowball" numbers to disguise under-funding and preparedness issues in local health care bodies like the provincial CDC.According to Mr Mertha, the documents, which he reviewed and considered authentic, seemed to be organised so as to allow senior officials to paint whatever picture they wished."You are giving them all the options there without putting somebody in an explicitly embarrassing position - giving them both the anvil or the life-raft to then choose from."Chinese officials did soon improve the reporting system, placing the "clinically diagnosed" cases into the "confirmed" category by mid-February. Top health and provincial officials in Hubei were also removed from their positions at that time, who would have been ultimately responsible for the reporting. Furthermore, wider and improved testing meant "suspected" cases could be clarified quicker and featured less in reporting. Separately, China's diagnostic criteria have been criticised by health experts for their continued, public decision to not count asymptomatic cases.Death tolls listed in the documents reveal the starkest discrepancies. On March 7, the total death toll in Hubei since the beginning of the outbreak stood at 2986, but in the internal report it is listed as 3456, including 2675 confirmed deaths, 647 "clinically diagnosed" deaths, and 126 "suspected" case deaths.A discharged COVID-19 patient waves from the bus while departing Wuchang Fang Cang makeshift hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. (Getty)Dali Yang, who has extensively studied the outbreak's origins, said that in February numbers "still mattered because of global perceptions.""They were still hoping it was like 2003, and like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) would be eventually contained, and everything can go back to normal," added Professor Yang, who is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. He pointed to the February 7 call between presidents Donald Trump and Mr Xi. "I think that's also the (wishful) impression that Trump got - that this is going to disappear."The documents, however, are by no means clear cut. On two occasions, the public death numbers are narrowly over reported, with the internal figures indicating single-digit discrepancies of five and one, respectively.On other occasions, the data provides glimpses of new information but without vital context. Even though China has never revealed the total number of COVID-19 cases in 2019, a graph in one document appears to suggest a much higher number had been detected. In the bottom left hand column of the graph marked 2019 the number of "confirmed cases" and "clinically diagnosed" cases appears to reach around 200 altogether. The documents do not elaborate further. To date, the clearest indication of how many cases were detected in 2019 is the 44 "cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause)" that Chinese authorities reported to the WHO for the period of the pandemic up to January 3, 2020.Funeral workers disinfect themselves after handling a virus victim in Wuhan. (AP)Long wait time for testsTesting was inaccurate from the start, the documents said, and led to a reporting system with weeks long delays in diagnosing new cases. Experts said that meant most of the daily figures that informed the government response risked being inaccurate or dated.On January 10, one of the documents reveals how during an audit of testing facilities, officials reported that the SARS testing kits that were being used to diagnose the new virus were ineffective, regularly giving false negatives. It also indicated that poor levels of personal protective equipment meant that virus samples had to be made inactive before testing.The high false-negative rate exposed a series of problems China would take weeks to rectify. According to reports in Chinese state media in early February, Hubei health experts had expressed frustration with the accuracy of nucleic acid tests. Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code, and were thought to be more effective at detecting the infection, particularly in the early stages.However, the tests carried out at that time resulted in only a 30 per cent to 50 per cent positive rate, among already confirmed cases, according to officials quoted in state media. In order to avoid "false negative" results, health officials began to test suspected cases repeatedly.By early February, laboratories in Hubei had capacity to test more than 10,000 people a day, according to state media reports. To cope with the high volume, officials decided to begin incorporating other clinical diagnosis methods, such as CT scans. This led to the creation of category referred to internally as "clinically diagnosed cases."

(Photo by Hector RETAMAL / AFP) (Photo by HE (AFP via Getty Images)It was not until mid-February that the clinically diagnosed cases were added to the confirmed case numbers.Other, yet graver issues noted in the documents were raised by health experts.In the first months of the outbreak, the average time required to process a case - from the patient experiencing symptoms (onset) to being confirmed diagnosed was 23.3 days.The persistent delay would likely have made it much harder to direct public health interventions, said Dr Amesh Adalja, at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."You're looking at data that's three weeks old and trying to make a decision for today," he said.The report notes that, by March 7, the system had much improved, with over 80 per cent of the new confirmed cases diagnosed that day being recorded in the system that same day.Multiple experts described the time lag as extraordinary, even when factoring in the initial difficulties faced by authorities."That adds another layer of understanding as to why some of the numbers that came out from the higher levels of government probably were off," said Schaffner from Vanderbilt University. "In the United States, Britain, France and Germany, there's always a lag. You don't know instantaneously. But 23 days is a long time."Early warning system hamperedA lack of preparedness is reflected throughout the documents, sections of which are highly critical in their internal assessment of the government's support for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention operations in Hubei.The report characterises the Hubei CDC as underfunded, lacking the right testing equipment, and with unmotivated staff who were often felt ignored in China's vast bureaucracy.The documents include an internal audit, which forensic analysis shows was written in October 2019, before the pandemic began.Workers driving excavators at the construction site of a field hospital on January 24, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The builders completed the 1,000-bed hospital by early February to cope with the surge of patients in the city. (Getty)More than a month before the first cases are believed to have emerged, the review continues to urge the health authorities to "rigorously find the weak link in the work of disease control, actively analyse and make up for the shortcomings."The CDC internal report complains over an absence of operational funding from the Hubei provincial government and notes the staffing budget is 29 per cent short of its annual target.After the outbreak, Chinese officials swiftly moved to assess the problems. Yet more than four months after the virus was first identified, major issues continued to hamper disease control efforts in key areas, the documents show.The report also highlights the CDC's peripheral role in investigating the initial outbreak, noting that staff were constrained by official processes and their expertise not fully utilised. Rather than taking a lead, the report suggests CDC staff were resigned to "passively" completing the task issued by superiors.Officials were also faced with a lumbering and unresponsive IT network, known as the China Infectious Disease Direct Reporting System, according to state media, installed at cost of $227 million after the 2003 SARS outbreak.Theoretically, the system was supposed to enable regional hospitals and CDCs to directly report infectious diseases to a centrally managed system. This would then allow the data to be shared instantly with CDCs and relevant health departments nationwide. In reality, it was slow to log into, one audit said, and many other bureaucratic procedural restrictions hampered rapid data recording and gathering.According to Mr Huang, from the Council on Foreign Relations, the report belies China's claim to have massively invested in disease control and prevention after the 2003 SARS outbreak."If you look at the local level, the picture is not as rosy as the government had claimed," he said.Large outbreak of flu in HubeiThe documents also reveal a previously undisclosed a 20-fold spike in influenza cases recorded in one week in early December in Hubei province.The spike, which occurred in the week beginning December 2, saw cases rise by approximately 2059 per cent compared to the same week the year before, according to the internal data.Notably, the outbreak that week is not felt most severely in Wuhan - the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak - but in the nearby cities of Yichang, with 6135 cases, and Xianning, with 2148 cases. Wuhan was the third worst hit with 2032 new cases that week.A supplied image obtained on Thursday, April 9, 2020, shows a medical supplies on pallets from Wuhan, China.

(AAP Image/Supplied by Australia China Goodwill Association) NO ARCHIVING, EDITORIAL USE ONLY (PR IMAGE)Public data shows a nationwide spike in influenza in December. Experts, however, note the rise in influenza cases, while not unique to Hubei, would have complicated the task of officials on the lookout for new dangerous viruses.Though the magnitude of the Hubei flu spike has not been previously reported, it is difficult to draw any hard conclusions, especially in regard to the potential prevalence of previously undetected COVID-19.The documents show that testing carried out on the influenza patients return a high number of unknown results. However, experts cautioned that this did not necessarily indicate that the unknown test results were in fact undetected coronavirus cases."They're only testing for what they know - this [coronavirus] is an unknown unknown," said Dr Adalja, the JHU academic, adding that such a scenario that was not uncommon, globally."We're just not that great at diagnosing them. We look for the usual suspects. We're always looking for the horses, but never the zebras."The Wuhan CDC later conducted retrospective research into influenza cases dated as early as October 2019 in two Wuhan hospitals, in an attempt to look for traces of coronavirus.But, according to a study published in the journal Nature, they were unable to detect samples of the virus dating back earlier than January 2020. Similar studies have yet to be carried out in other Hubei cities.Separately, the flu spike could have helped to unintentionally accelerate the coronavirus' early spread, said Mr Huang."Those people were seeking care in hospitals, increasing the chances of COVID infection there," he said.The influenza data also points to the influenza outbreak being worst in Yichang. While the influenza spike and the emergence of COVID-19 are not linked in the documents or by other evidence, data pinpointing a flu-like outbreak in multiple cities in Hubei will likely be of interest to those researching the origins of the disease.The Chinese government has previously pointed to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan as the likely initial epicenter of the outbreak in mid-December, where meat of exotic wild animals was sold. Yet that claim has been at least partially challenged by a Lancet study of the first December patients, which determined one third of the 41 infected that month had no direct connection to that market.Yichang, 320 kilometers west of Wuhan, was hit hardest by the influenza outbreak - almost three times as many as Wuhan in the same week beginning December 2.Mr Mertha, the China expert from JHU, said the spike in Yichang, while not connected to COVID-19 in the documents, could nonetheless open up new theories about where the virus began."The order of magnitude of change means there has to be something going on," he said.An unfolding crisisChina's leaders were the first to confront the virus, implementing a raft of draconian restrictions beginning in late January intended to curb the spread of the outbreak. Patients infected with the coronavirus take rest at a temporary hospital converted from Wuhan Sports Centre in Wuhan. (Xinhua)Using sophisticated surveillance tools, government officials enforced strict lockdowns across the country, largely restricting more than 700 million people to their homes, while sealing national borders and carrying out widespread testing and contract tracing.According to a study published in the journal Science in May, the stringent measures adopted during those first 50 days of the pandemic likely helped break the localised chain of transmission.Today, China is close to zero local cases and although small-scale outbreaks continue to flare, the virus is mostly contained.In February, however, it was a different story. As case numbers soared nationwide, government officials were facing a potential crisis of legitimacy, with public opinion fast turning against the ruling Communist Party over its perceived mishandling of the deadly new disease.During the last 30 years, analysts say, many in China have appeared willing to relinquish political freedoms in return for increased material wealth, social stability and greater opportunities.The virus fundamentally threatened that social contract - putting hundreds of millions at risk while damaging an economy already weakened by an ongoing US-China trade war. In late January, Mr Xi, China's most powerful leader in decades, publicly ordered "all-out efforts" to contain the virus' spread.At the time, China was celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday, its most important annual holiday. The notion of an impending pandemic seemed to many like an abstract distraction, as people returned home to spend time with their families.Mr Xi's highly public intervention, which came just days after Wuhan was placed under lockdown, carried with it a clear message: Failure is not an option.Throughout this period, the gulf between public statements by Chinese officials and the internally distributed data is at times blunt. The leaked documents show the daily confirmed death toll in Hubei rose to 196 on February 17. That same day, Hubei publicly reported just 93 virus deaths.Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, checks the treatment of hospitalized patients at the monitoring center and talks to medical staff on duty via a video link at Beijing Ditan Hospital in Beijing, capital of China, on Feb. 10, 2020. Xi on Monday inspected the novel coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control work in Beijing. (Photo by Xie Huanchi/Xinhua v (Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images)Another report also records the deaths of six health care workers from COVID-19 by February 10. Their deaths were not public at the time, and were highly sensitive, given the volume of sympathy over-worked health care staff, on the frontline of the pandemic, were getting on social media at the time.As the virus spread, local officials were accused of downplaying the outbreak and its risk to the public. In late December, a young doctor named Li Wenliang in one of Wuhan's main hospitals, was among other medical workers summoned by local authorities and later received formal "reprimand" from the police for attempting to raise the alarm about a potential "SARS-like" virus. State media reported their punishment and warned public against rumour mongering.Li, 34, later contracted the disease. His condition quickly worsened and in the early morning of February 7 he died, resulting in almost unprecedented levels of anger and outrage across mainland China's heavily censored internet.It is not clear to what extent the central government was aware of the actions taking place in Hubei at that time, or how much information was being shared and with whom.The documents offer no indication that authorities in Beijing were directing the local decision-making process. However, Mertha, the JHU academic, said the mismatch between the higher internal and lower public figures on the February death toll "appeared to be a deception, for unsurprising reasons.""China had an image to protect internationally, and lower-ranking officials had a clear incentive to under-report - or to show their superiors that they were under-reporting - to outside eyes," he said.Conversely, however, the leaked documents also provide something of a defense of China's overall handling of the virus. The reports show that in the early stages of the pandemic, China faced the same problems of accounting, testing, and diagnosis that still haunt many Western democracies even now - issues compounded by Hubei encountering an entirely new virus.Similarly, no mention is made by officials of a so-called laboratory leak, or that the virus was man-made, as some critics, including top US officials, have claimed without evidence. There is one mention of sub-par facilities at a bacterial and toxic species preservation center, though the point is not elaborated on, nor is its significance made clear.China and its healthcare workers were under immense strain as the outbreak took hold, said Yang, from the Council of Foreign Relations.Funeral home workers remove the body of a person suspected to have died from the coronavirus outbreak from a residential building in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province. (AP)"They had a massive run on the medical system. They were overwhelmed. There was truly despair among medical professionals by the end of January, because they were extremely overworked and they were also enormously discouraged by the high number of deaths that were occurring with a disease they had not treated previously," he added.Hubei, which lags far behind Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese administrative divisions in terms of GDP per capita, was the first region to confront a virus that would go on to confound many of the world's most powerful countries.Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, said many of the comments in the documents might have been made in the US, "where, over the past 15 to 20 years, at particularly the state and the local level, public health funding has become constrained."The documents show health care officials had no comprehension as to the magnitude of the impending disaster.Nowhere in the files is it indicated that officials believed the virus would become a global pandemic.Today marks exactly 12 months since the first patient in Wuhan started showing symptoms, according to the Lancet study. The death toll and number of people infected by the virus, now known to the world as COVID-19 and impacting the lives across the planet, continues to grow, day on day.Continue readingCoronavirusCOVID 19healthDiseaseChina newsWorldCONTACT USSend your stories to contact@9news.com.auProperty News: Renovated estate on Brisbane's best street smashes city house price record.Top StoriesAdult killed, child injured after truck crashes into Victorian kindergarten14 minutes agoHe charged a machine gun one minute before WWI endedInside the Sydney Harbour mansion that sold for $26 million29 minutes agoTeen arrested after getting tangled in fence during wild police chase36 minutes agoAboutContactWatch TVLive TVTV ShowsCategoriesConnect your TVHow to watchTV GuideNewsLatestNationalWorldPoliticsTechWeatherFinanceToday ShowA Current Affair60 MinutesSportLive ScoresOlympicsNRLCricketTennisAFLRugbyFootballAthleticsGolfCombatLifestyleLatestRoyalsStyleCelebrityKitchenTravelCoachYouParentingMoneyHoroscopesEntertainmentLatestTV ShowsMAFSThe BlockLove IslandLego MastersTipping PointThe SummitGetawayTravel GuidesProduct ReviewsTechnologyBeautyStyle + FashionLivingKitchenHealth + FitnessParentingGift IdeasRadio2GB3AW4BC6PRStanTV ShowsMoviesSportStan OriginalsDomainAdvice & GuidesProperty SearchHome LoansHome Price GuideDriveCar ReviewsCar NewsNew Car ShowroomCars for SalePedestrian TVEntertainmentNewsOnlineTelevisionCouponsUber EatseBayAmazonNikeHomeNewslettersWork with usAdvertise with usSupportTerms of usePrivacy© 2024 Nine Entertainment Co.People Are Noticing How The Scenario Of The 1918 Spanish Flu Seems Eerily Similar To What We’re Currently Going Through | Bored Panda Bored Panda works better on our iPhone app Continue in app Continue in browser Get Premium Dark mode theme is available exclusively for premium users.

These may include people who deny actual medicine and vaccines or think they know viruses and diseases better than doctors who have studied the subjects for decades. History shows that during the 1918 pandemic (Spanish Flu), people were dealing with very similar problems we’re dealing with today. “I’ve been reading about the 1918 pandemic, and this paragraph stuck out,” one man shared on Twitter and attached an excerpt from a book. Reading it surely feels eerily familiar.More info: Twitter Jesus Jiménez—a reporter for Dallas Morning News—shared an excerpt from a book about the 1918 pandemicShare iconImage credits: jesus_jimz“It is impossible to quantify how many deaths the lies caused,” the excerpt from the book The Great Influenza reads. “It is impossible to quantify how many young men died because the army refused to follow the advice of its own surgeon general. But while those in authority were reassuring people that this was influenza, only influenza, nothing different from ordinary ‘la grippe,’ at least some people must have believed them, at least some people must have exposed themselves to the virus in ways they would not have otherwise, and at least some of these people must have died who would otherwise have lived. And fear really did kill people. It killed them because those who feared would not care for many of those who needed but could not find care, those who needed only hydration, food, and rest to survive.”ADVERTISEMENTAnd the struggles seem eerily familiar to the ones we’re going through in the current pandemicShare iconImage credits: jesus_jimzPeople online were not super surprised that history is repeating itself. “Also, the surgeon general’s advice was to wear a mask and keep two arms’ length apart. Nothing much has changed,” someone commented on Imgur. “The difference now is that we have Facebook connecting the dumbest among us to create an enormous hive mind of impenetrable abject stupidity,” another user added.The excerpt is from John M.

For example, Napoleon invaded Russia in June of 1812 and retreated after the army began to freeze to death in December. Just over 100 years later, Hitler tried the same thing, invasion began in June, army began to freeze to death in December resulting in retreat.

No masks - no distance - no closings. And death. So, I don't think we've learned all that much.

Trump provided the supplies and equipment that states requested and then didn't bother to use since they didn't want to give credit to Trump (remember those naval hospital ships that went unused in New York and California - easier to just return Covid positive patients to care homes where they can kill a bunch of old people - who make the decision in the state government NOT to use those ships). Or how about a group of doctors who insisted that the cheap, readily available drugs that Trump referenced MUST NOT BE USED because they have been untested against Covid and might be dangerous - except that those drugs have been used for years and years on hundreds of thousands of people, and there were many doctors who used them and found them useful - those doctors were shut down by big tech.. Only now we find out that their reason for condemning them was because they didn't want to give any credit to Trump. Those drugs could have saved thousands and thousands, but no the woke doctors had TDS. Yours is a typical response on Bored Panda - anything that can be used to condemn, Trump or conservatives must be demolished.
