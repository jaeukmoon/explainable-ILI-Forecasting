Timely selection of optimal seed viruses with matched antigenicity between vaccine antigen and circulating viruses and with high yield underscore vaccine efficacy and supply, respectively. Current methods for selecting influenza seed vaccines are labor intensive and time-consuming. Here, we report the Machine-learning Assisted Influenza VaccinE Strain Selection framework, MAIVeSS, that enables streamlined selection of naturally circulating, antigenically matched, and high-yield influenza vaccine strains directly from clinical samples by using molecular signatures of antigenicity and yield to support optimal candidate vaccine virus selection. We apply our framework on publicly available sequences to select A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine candidates and experimentally confirm that these candidates have optimal antigenicity and growth in cells and eggs. Our framework can potentially reduce the optimal vaccine candidate selection time from months to days and thus facilitate timely supply of seasonal vaccines.

However, hemagglutinin (HA), the primary target of these vaccines, can undergo antigenic change, enabling virus to evade existing host immunity elicited by natural infections and/or vaccinations. Annual updates of vaccine composition are conducted to match between vaccine and circulating viruses. This is a resource and time-consuming process that requires global private and public collaboration coordinated through the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)1,2.A major activity of GISRS is to make global recommendations for the most appropriate vaccine viruses and to provide corresponding candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for distribution to manufacturers of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Once sourced, manufacturers then further optimize CVV growth properties for use in vaccine manufacture. An ideal CVV must have the appropriate antigenic properties, maintain these properties through the production pipeline, and have a high growth phenotype. Timely selection of an effective high-yielding CVV is critical for optimal seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing. In the 2003–2004 influenza season, an A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus was preferred as the recommended A(H3N2) vaccine virus, but the inability to identify CVVs led to a vaccine mismatch3. During the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, vaccine supply was delayed due to the poor yield of initial CVVs4, and a global vaccine campaign was not initiated until better yielding viruses were obtained which was after the second pandemic wave5.Efforts to generate high-yield CVVs for vaccine manufacturing in embryonated chicken eggs or cultured cells continue year-round even before recommended vaccine viruses are finalized for the upcoming influenza season. The conventional strategy to achieve high yield often involves additional passages in eggs or cells6, and genetic approaches rely on reassortment with a donor strain that exhibits high yield traits in eggs or cells7. Both approaches may take up to 6 months as well as have limitations. Egg or cell adaptation can result in undesired antigenic changes due to additional mutations in HA and reassortment strategies do not always lead to substantial improvements in yield8,9,10,11. Therefore, identifying influenza vaccine viruses with high-yield phenotypes directly from sequences obtained from clinical samples would be ideal and could potentially accelerate vaccine production timelines.Over the past few years, several computational models12,13,14 have been developed to identify influenza antigenic variants using genomic sequences (See the discussion section in Supplementary Information (SI)). However, none of these models can be used to directly identify antigenic match and high-yield viruses based on genetic sequences.In our study, we propose an approach to overcome challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection. We introduce MAIVeSS, a framework that employs machine learning algorithms, to predict antigenic and yield phenotypes using viral genomic sequences from clinical samples. We validated MAIVeSS by screening A(H1N1)pdm09 for ideal CVVs and confirmed the high yield nature of the identified CVVs in both cells and eggs. Our results show that that MAIVeSS can facilitate the selection of naturally circulating influenza vaccine strains with matching antigenicity and high-yield as seed viruses for influenza vaccine production.ResultsMachine-learning assisted influenza vaccine strain selection frameworkThis study aimed to design MAIVeSS to learn genetic features associated with three key influenza virus biological properties: antigenicity, growth, and receptor-binding (Fig. 1). We implemented and compared a set of machine learning models within MAIVeSS and found that the multi-task learning group-guided sparse learning model (MTL-GGSL) outperformed other state-of-the-art models for predicting antigenicity and glycan binding, while the generalized hierarchical sparse model (GHSM) outperformed other models for assessing growth (see Supplementary Data 1–3).Fig. 1: Machine-learning Assisted Influenza VaccinE Strain Selection framework (MAIVeSS).This model has been developed to select high-yield vaccine seeds that match the antigenicity of circulating influenza strains. To achieve this, a library of viruses with mutations in the receptor binding sites of the HA protein is generated and analyzed for their serological reactivity, replication efficiency in eggs and cells, and glycan profiling using microarrays. A sparse learning model will then be applied to identify genetic features that correlate with these phenotypes. Based on these features, a predictive model will be developed to quantify antigenic distances from the currently used vaccine strains and the yield ability in eggs and cells using HA protein sequences as input data. This strategy can be adapted for other subtypes of influenza viruses, and the model can also be modified to incorporate NA sequences. Part of this figure was created with BioRender.com.Full size imageUsing the features learned, MAIVeSS scores CVVs using a query HA protein sequence based on two properties: (1) antigenic properties, and (2) yield properties in eggs and/or cells (HYcell, high-yield in cells; HYegg, high-yield in eggs; HYboth, high-yield in both cells and eggs; LYcell, low-yield in cells; LYegg, low-yield in eggs; LYboth, low-yield in both cells and eggs). In this study, the WT virus is defined as a reassortant with wild-type HA and NA genes from A/California/04/2009(H1N1pdm09) (CA/04) and six internal genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8). High-yield is defined as a > 10-fold increase in TCID50/mL compared to the WT on the same substrate. By leveraging these predictive models, MAIVeSS can rapidly identify influenza viruses that are both antigenically matched and high-yielding from genome sequences obtained during surveillance. MAIVeSS is accessible through both GitHub (https://github.com/FluSysBio/MAIVeSS) and a webserver (http://sysbio.missouri.edu/software/MAIVeSS).In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our machine learning models using A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses as an exemplary application, but the same principles can be readily applied to other subtypes of influenza viruses.Development of an A(H1N1)pdm09 mutant library for machine learningTo enhance the reliability of feature selection for high-yield viruses, we established a random mutant virus library that targets the HA receptor binding site (RBS) of CA/0415. All the mutants were subjected to antigenic analyses using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays, yield analyses in both MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs, and receptor-binding profiling through glycan microarrays. The phenotypic data collected were then used as training and testing data in MAIVeSS to identify the molecular features associated with antigenicity and yield and to establish predictive models.In total, we generated 822 HA-containing plasmids, each carrying one to seven random mutations within or near the HA RBS (residues 119–241, H1 numbering; 126–244, H3 numbering). Using these mutant plasmids, we then generated corresponding mutant viruses via reverse genetics. Rescued mutant viruses had an HA from the mutant pool, a NA gene from CA/04, and the remaining 6 gene segments from PR8. To increase the likelihood of successful virus rescue, the transfection products underwent three passages. If none of the three passages yield positive results, we will conclude that the mutant cannot be rescued.As a result, a total of 189 mutant viruses bearing unique amino acid substitutions with different biochemical properties were successfully generated (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of the mutant viruses that were successfully rescued, 96 had substitutions within the 119–190 region of the HA, 15 had substitutions within the 190–241 region, and 78 had substitutions in both regions. The positions of the substitutions overlapped with the reported HA antigenic sites Sa (n = 11), Sb (n = 9), Ca1 (n = 7), and Ca2 (n = 7). For consistency, specific amino acid positions in the mutants described in the following context are numbered according to the H3 numbering system. Eighty of the mutant viruses had a single substitution, 80 had two, and 29 had three or more. Interestingly, all substitutions present in the rescued viruses were located outside of the receptor binding site (RBS) and did not directly interact with the receptor molecule (Fig. 2A). In contrast, virus rescue was unsuccessful when substitutions were present within the RBS pocket.Fig. 2: Characterization of mutant viruses targeting the receptor-binding site of the HA protein.The HA of A/California/04/2009(H1N1) (CA/04) was used as the template to develop the error-prone PCR mutant library. A The regions in the HA receptor-binding site where viable mutant viruses were obtained are shown in green, while the regions where no viable mutant viruses were obtained are shown in red. The receptor binding pocket includes the 130-loop, 150-loop, 190-helix, and 220-loop. B The key residues associated with antigenicity are located in five HA antigenic sites: Sa (in purple), Sb (in raspberry), Ca1/Ca2 (in green), and Cb (in blue), as well as outside these antigenic sites (in orange). C The key residues associated with virus yield in cells and eggs are located near the receptor binding site or outside the receptor binding site. The residues are shown in two views of the structures, and the overlapped residues are boxed. The HA protein structure was modeled using PyMOL with the CA/04HA protein structure from the Protein Databank (PDB) 3LZG as the template.Full size imageMost mutations did not alter antigenic propertiesTo determine the antigenic properties of the mutant viruses generated, we performed HAI assay using post-infection ferret antisera. Out of 189 mutant viruses, only 5 mutants had a ≥ 4-fold reduction in their HAI titers relative to the antisera’s homologous virus (Supplementary Data 4). These 5 antigenically distinct mutants had at least one substitution in known HA antigenic sites, with other substitutions mostly present within or close to the Ca1, Ca2, Sa, or Sb regions16,17,18,19. Of note, ferret antisera generated against WT CA/04 were unable to neutralize the triple mutant HA D131E-S193T-A198S.We integrated the serological data of the 189 mutants with archived public data for seasonal A(H1N1) (1977-2009) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (2009–2016)20. By using these integrated HA sequence and serological data, we utilized MAIVeSS to identify residues that were associated with antigenic changes. The results showed that 30 residues were associated with the antigenicity of A(H1N1) viruses (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 5), and most of these residues were located within or close to the antigenic sites, particularly Ca1, Ca2, Sa, and Sb (Fig. 2B). Of these 30 residues, only position 225 has been reported in the literature to potentially harbor an egg-adapted substitution for 2009 H1N1 viruses (Table 1 and Supplementary Information).Table 1 Antigenicity associated residues selected by MAIVeSS for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virusesFull size tableAmino acid substitutions near the HA RBS can result in high-yield traits in both cells and eggsWe next assessed how the amino acid substitutions introduced affected virus yield in both cells and eggs by measuring the infectious titers (TCID50) for each mutant after growth. We identified 14 HYcell mutants that showed at least a 10-fold increase in virus yield compared to the WT virus as well as 29 LYcell mutants that showed at least a 10-fold decrease (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 4). The highest yield was observed in the HA N159D-K166I mutant, with a yield of 1.52 × 107 TCID50/mL, which was about 100-fold higher than WT. Additionally, 33 HYegg mutants and 19 LYegg mutants were identified. The HA D131E-S193T-A198S, HA N159D-K166I, and HA I169F-D225G mutants had the highest titers in eggs, which were approximately 800-fold higher than the WT virus. Of note, these three mutants also exhibited high-yield traits in cells and were thus designated as HYboth.By using the HA protein sequence and their associated yield data, we applied MAIVeSS and identified 38 residues were associated with virus yield (Table 2 and Supplementary Data 6). The majority of these residues were located on the surface of the HA trimer and in close proximity to the RBS pocket (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, we observed that different substitutions at the same position could lead to different outcomes. For example, a change from small polar amino acids to nonpolar amino acids at residue 142 was predicted to enhance virus yield, whereas substitution to polar/charged amino acids at the same position was predicted to reduce virus yield in eggs and cells (Table 2).Table 2 Amino acid substitutions associated with yield traits selected by MAIVeSS for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virusesFull size tableDiversified glycan binding facilitates virus replication in cells and eggsTo investigate if the high-yield trait correlates with glycan substructure binding properties, we analyzed the receptor-binding properties of the 189 mutant viruses using glycan microarrays comprising of 75 glycoforms (Supplementary Fig. 3). The binding signals to these glycan isoforms varied widely among the mutants (Supplementary Fig. 4). Notably, all mutants exhibited strong binding avidity to glycans that were terminated with SA2,6 Gal, as we had expected.We further used a matrix of 27 glycan substructure features to group the glycans based on their internal and terminal substructures as well as their linkers (Supplementary Fig. 5). Our analysis revealed that HYcell mutants displayed elevated binding avidities to glycans terminated with Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc (6′SLN), but not to Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (3′SLN), Neu5Aca2-3Galβ1-4(Fuca1-3)GlcNAc (sLeX) or Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc. In contrast, HYegg and HYboth mutants (such as HA D131E-S193T-A198S and HA I169F-D225G) showed increased binding affinities to glycans terminated with 3′SLN and sLeX. Interestingly, a few HYegg and HYboth mutants also exhibited significant increases in binding avidities to a glycan that is terminated with Neu5Gcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc or Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc.By employing biolayer interferometry analyses (BLI) for glycan binding profiling, we confirmed the broadened binding specificity of the HYboth mutant HA D131E-S193T-A198S. Specifically, we demonstrated that this mutant not only binds to 6′SLN, but also to 3′SLN and sLeX (Supplementary Fig. 6).We used MAIVeSS (see Online Methods) to identify the glycan substructures associated with yield traits in cells and eggs associated with binding preference to these glycan substructures (Supplementary Data 7–11). Our analysis revealed several glycan terminal substructures that were significantly associated with high-yield traits, including 6′SLN, 3′SLN, sLeX, and Neu5Gcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc. Additionally, we found that certain internal substructures, such as core lactose, GlcNAcb1-2, and Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAc, had a significant impact on glycan binding.A subset of antigenically matched A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic viruses were high-yield in both cells and eggsWe utilized MAIVeSS to predict both yield in eggs and cells and antigenic properties of sequenced A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (2009–2020, n = 11,424) (Supplementary Data 12). Using the antigenic distance matrix generated by MAIVeSS, we created a sequence-based antigenic cartography map, which revealed two antigenic clusters, CA/09 and WI/19 (Fig. 3). The acquisition of N159K in the Sa antigenic site was predicted to cause an antigenic drift of the A/Wisconsin/588/2019(H1N1) (WI/19) HA from that of CA/09, which was consistent with those reported in other studies21,22.Fig. 3: Antigenicity and yield of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from 2009 to 2020 as predicted by MAIVeSS.A Two major antigenic variant clusters for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were visualized by antigenic cartography. B Visualization of the distribution of high-yield viruses within the phylogenetic tree of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageUsing MAIVeSS as the prediction tool, a total of 155 viruses were identified as potential HYegg, 433 as HYcell, and 761 as HYboth. Of the 1349 viruses identified as high-yield variants, 897 had HA sequences that were directly generated from clinical swabs, while the remaining sequences were generated from viruses grown either in cells (n = 331) and eggs (n = 83). The virus source for HA sequence was unclear for the remaining 38 high-yield variants.Among predicted as HYboth, 294 were CA/09-like viruses (38.6%), while 467 were WI/19-like viruses (61.4%). These high-yield strains were not geographically clustered and were scattered across the phylogenetic trees, without clear association with any particular HA lineages (Fig. 3B). However, the number of HYboth strains increased significantly after the emergence of WI/19-like variants (Fig. 3D). Specifically, 256 out of 2,198 (11.65%) viruses in 2019 and 386 out of 895 (43.13%) viruses in 2020 were estimated to be HYboth strains. MAIVeSS analysis predicted that the vaccine strain WI/19 has an increase of approximately 105-fold and 23-fold in virus yield in cell and eggs, respectively compared to CA/04.Multiple amino acid substitutions associated with high yield were observed in the HYboth strains, but the specific amino acid substitutions varied across influenza seasons and even within the same season, depending on the strain (Supplementary Data 13). However, after the 2018–2019 influenza season, viruses with HA K133aN, N159K/D/S, K166Q, S206T, and/or K214R were more likely to be high-yield strains (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4: Validation of the predicted antigenic and yield properties for the MAIVeSS-selected vaccine viruses.A Amino acids located in the residues associated with antigenicity and yield properties for three A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines (i.e., CA/04, MI/15, and WI/19) selected by WHO and the four vaccine candidates selected by MAIVeSS.

Antigenic cartography was constructed by using AntigenMap (http://sysbio.missouri.edu/AntigenMap)61, which employed a low-reactor cutoff of 1:10. To minimize noise in the HAI data and reflect antigenic distances embedded in the data, low-rank matrix completion and multiple dimensional scaling were utilized to generate the map. Each unit in the antigenic map corresponded to a log2 unit In the HAI titers. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo validate the predictions of our model, we synthesized the HA and NA genes of 4 viruses predicted as having desirable features, and subsequently generated 4 reassortant viruses (i.e. rgSP/16, rgCQ/17, rgBRU/19 and rgMAS/20) with PR8 as the backbone and determined their antigenic and yield phenotypes. Antigenically, 2 reassortant viruses were experimentally confirmed to be CA/04-like and the other 2 WI/19-like (Fig. 4B). All 4 reassortant viruses grew to final titers of >108 TCID50/mL in both eggs and cells, which were at least 100-fold higher than the WT virus, which is a reassortant with wild-type HA and NA genes from CA/04 and six internal genes from PR8. (Fig. 4C). These results corroborated both antigenicity and yield predicted by the MAIVeSS model.Taken together, our findings indicate that the high-yield trait of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was distributed across different genetic clusters and has become more prevalent since 2018. Our experimental results confirm MAIVeSS’s ability to identify antigenic matches and high-yield vaccine strains for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.Diversifying influenza virus glycan binding profile facilitates the acquisition of high-yield propertiesIt is well-documented that CA/04 exhibits an exclusive binding preference for 6′SLN and does not bind to 3′SLN23. Here we hypothesized that a small portion of naturally circulating A(H1N1)pdm09, such as those we predicted as CVVs, acquired high-yield properties by binding to additional sialylated glycan receptors, particularly 3′SLN, or by increasing their glycan binding avidity to 6′SLN. To test this, we conducted BLI for 6A(H1N1)pdm09 variants, including LYboth MI/15 and HYboth WI/19, as well as 4 HYboth vaccine candidates predicted by MAIVeSS. The results showed that 3 of the MAIVeSS predicted CVVs, rgSP/16, rgCQ/17 and rgMAS/20, bound to both 3′SLN and 6′SLN, whereas MI/15, WI/19, and one predicted CVV, rgBRU/19, bound only to 6′SLN (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5: Glycan binding properties for the MAIVeSS-selected vaccine viruses.A The binding avidity to the synthetic glycan analogs, 3′SLN and 6′SLN for two A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines (i.e., MI/15, and WI/19) selected by WHO and the four vaccine candidates selected by MAIVeSS. The virus abbreviations are shown in the legend of Fig. 4. The virus receptor binding affinities were determined by BLI with an Octet RED instrument (Pall ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA). Two biotinylated glycan analogs, Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNacβ-PAA-biotin (3′SLN) and Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNacβ-PAA-biotin (6′SLN) (Lectinity Holdings, Moscow, Russia) were used. The glycans ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 ug/ml were preloaded onto streptavidin-coated biosensors at up to 0.3 µg/ml for 5 min in 1 × kinetic buffer (Pall FortéBio, Menlo Park, CA). Each test virus was diluted to a final concentration of 100 pM. Responses were normalized by the highest value obtained during the experiment, and binding curves were fitted by using the binding-saturation method in GraphPad Prism 8 (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). The normalized response curves report the fractional saturation (f) of the sensor surface as described in elsewhere58. The horizontal dashed line represents half of the fractional saturation (f = 0.5). Results showed that rgSP/16, rgCQ/17, and rgMAS/20 bound to both 3′SLN and 6′SLN, whereas MI/15, WI/19, and rgBRU/19 bound only to 6′SLN. The rgBRU/19 showed an increased binding avidity to 6′SLN (RSL0.5 = 0.085) compared to MI/15 (RSL0.5 = 0.135). The rgSP/16, rgCQ/17, and rgMAS/20 still exhibited a stronger binding affinity to 6′SLN (RSL0.5 = 0.147, 0.263, and 0.134, respectively) compared to 3′SLN (RSL0.5 = 0.498, 0.653, and 0.347). B Structural modeling suggesting the amino acid substitution N159K facilitates the binding affinity of HA to SA2-3Gal. The three-dimensional structure of HA protein was modeled based on the crystal structure of CA/04 HA in complex with 6′SLN (PDB ID# 3UBN) and 3′SLN (PDB ID# 3UBQ). Coot was used to introduce the desired mutation to the three subunits of a HA trimer. The mutated coordinates were subsequently refined by energy minimization using Phenix. Structure figures were made using Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageOf the residues linked to the high-yield traits of WI/19 and the four MAIVeSS selected viruses, only about half were conserved (Fig. 4A). However, HA N159K, K166Q, and S206T were consistently present in most of the naturally occurring high-yield strains (Supplementary Data 12) and high-yield mutants from our mutagenesis study (Supplementary Data 4).We further investigated the effect of HA N159K, K166Q, and S206T on glycan binding affinity by conducting structural modeling based on the crystal structure of CA/04 HA complexed with 6′SLN and 3′SLN (Fig. 5B). In both complex structures, N159 was substituted with K, and energy minimization was performed to detect any possible allosteric structural changes that could affect ligand binding. In the HA:3′SLN structure, the sidechain of K159 flips toward the 190-helix, forming hydrogen bonds with the sidechains of both Q196 and Q192. This could cause a shift or tilt in the orientation of the 190-helix, resulting in a more compact receptor binding pocket and stronger binding with 3′SLN. In contrast, 6’SLN in the HA:6′SLN complex closely interacts with the 190-helix even in the original CA/04 structure, so the K159 mutation does not significantly enhance the binding of 6’SLN binding to HA. Additionally, K166Q may impact the conformation of the 130-loop, while S206T substitution has the potential to modify the structural conformation of the 220-loop (Supplementary Fig. 7), thus affecting the binding of HA to glycan receptors. Therefore, our modeling analysis supported that these three substitutions in HA can substantially increase the binding affinity of 3′SLN without major impact on the binding of 6′SLN.In summary, diversity at the HA RBS of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses can enhance virus yields in both cell and egg substrates by increasing sialylated glycan binding avidity or diversifying virus binding to different sialylated glycan receptors.DiscussionIn this study, we developed MAIVeSS, a machine learning based framework, that can accurately predict both antigenicity and growth phenotypes based on HA protein sequences. The training dataset consisted of a library of 189 mutant viruses generated by epPCR-based reverse genetics targeting residues 126–244 (H3 numbering). We observed that acquisition of HA N159K, a key marker for antigenic drift according to our model, led to changes in antigenicity from CA/09 to WI/19, as determined by post-infection ferret antisera, consistent with published reports21,22 and facilitated acquisition of the high-yield trait in a significant proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic strains during recent influenza seasons (Fig. 3E). While our current model focuses on HA, it is important to note that antigenic drift of neuraminidase (NA) has also been well-documented in A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses24,25. In addition, it’s worth noting that the antigenicity data used in our model training were derived from ferret antisera generated from native ferrets. While the antigenicity data reflected by sera generated from native ferrets and human sera without virus priming (such as infants) are generally comparable, it’s important to note that they can differ from those generated from individuals with pre-existing immunity, particularly in adults. This is because adults commonly have a complicated influenza priming history with multiple infections and/or vaccinations, which can significantly affect their immune response26. As such, our ongoing efforts are aimed at expanding the MAIVeSS prediction capacity to include both HA and NA proteins, as well as human serological data for training antigenicity analyses.To determine if the high-yield trait correlates with glycan substructure binding properties, we analyzed the receptor-binding properties of all 189 mutant viruses. The glycan profiling analysis conducted on 43 high-yield mutants suggested that diversifying glycan binding profiles could enhance virus replication in both eggs and cells. Specifically, increased binding avidities to SA2-6Gal results in higher virus yield in mammalian cells, while broadening glycan binding capabilities to SA2-3Gal or sLeX improves virus yield in eggs (Supplementary Data 4). Our studies indicate that a small subset of A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic viruses naturally bind to both SA2-6Gal and SA2-3Gal, allowing them to replicate efficiently in both cells and eggs without adaptation. On the other hand, similar to CA/04 and MI/15, some high-yield strains (e.g. WI/19) bind only to 6′SLN but not 3′SLN (Fig. 5A), indicating that other glycan substructures present in eggs and/or cells may be involved in the high-yield trait for these epidemic viruses. It should be noted that both virus and host factors, such as innate immune responses and virus fitness, in addition to virus-receptor binding can impact virus replication in mammalian cells. Further studies are needed to investigate these possibilities.Both SA2-6Gal and SA2-3Gal receptors are expressed in MDCK cells and chicken embryonated eggs. However, SA2-3Gal receptors are predominantly expressed in eggs while MDCK cells contain a similar amount of SA2-6Gal and SA2-3Gal27. In addition to SA2-3Gal and SA2-6Gal, neutral glycans such as high-mannose glycans and glycans terminated with Gal and GalcNAc are also commonly found in eggs. Mass spectrometry analyses showed some glycans in eggs are fucosylated28. CA/04, the prototype A(H1N1)pdm09 virus which showed poor replication in both MDCK cells and eggs, had a strong binding preference for SA2-6Gal and did not bind to SA2-3Gal29. In humans, there is no direct selection pressure to increase cell-based or egg-based replication efficiency. Thus, our findings suggested that ad hoc substitutions at the HA RBS across A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses likely enabled a subset of these variants to expand their binding preference from SA2-6Gal to both SA2-6Gal and SA2-3Gal, resulting in the acquisition of a high-yield trait. This study illustrates the feasibility of selecting HA sequences from naturally circulating strains as high yield candidates for recombinant vaccine development, by eliminating the need for further engineering.In summary, the data from the proof-of-concept experiments in this study confirmed that MAIVeSS enables rapid selection of antigenically matched and high-yielding influenza strains directly from clinical isolates as potential seed viruses to accelerate vaccine production and facilitate timely supply of seasonal vaccines.MethodsEthics statementAnimal study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Mississippi State University (#14-039) and University of Missouri-Columbia (#9656). All animal experiments were performed in an animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL2) research facility at Mississippi State University. Standard operating procedures for work with infectious influenza viruses were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee at Mississippi State University (#16-09 and #022-16) and University of Missouri-Columbia (#19-09) and performed under BSL2 conditions.Machine-learning assisted influenza vaccine strain selection framework (MAIVeSS)Machine learning models have been shown to be effective in identifying antigenicity associated features in protein sequences from different subtypes of influenza A viruses30,31,32,33,34,35, We developed machine learning models to identify the specific sequence features in HA proteins that determine three important phenotypes: antigenicity, yield in cells and eggs, and receptor binding. To achieve this, we trained our models on large datasets of HA protein sequences and associated phenotype information. We also developed a quantitative function that allows us to measure the distances between sequences based on their phenotypic characteristics. Our ultimate goals for these machine learning models are to identify: 1) mutations in the HA RBS that affect virus antigenicity; 2) mutations in the HA RBS that increase or decrease virus yields in cells and/or eggs; and 3) specific glycan substructures (glycan motifs) on the surface of cells or eggs that are associated with increased yields of influenza virus. By achieving these goals, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the molecular determinants of these important viral phenotypes and to identify potential targets for the development of improved influenza vaccines.We approached the problem of identifying genetic features associated with influenza virus phenotypes using a sparse learning model. Mathematically, this model involves a linear regression loss function with regularization, which allows us to determine the most relevant genetic features associated with a given phenotype. The sparse learning model combines a least squares loss with a regularized term and takes into account genetic distance matrices among HA proteins or glycan sequences (denoted as X), phenotypic differences (denoted as y), and sample numbers (denoted as N). This approach enables us to identify the key genetic features that contribute to different influenza virus phenotypes, such as antigenicity, yield, and receptor-binding.The objective of our sparse learning model is to solve:$$\min L\left(X,y,w\right)+\lambda R\left(w\right),$$ (1) where \(L(X,y,w)\) is the loss function, λ is a pre-defined regularization parameter, \(R(w)\) denotes the regularization term, and w denotes the numerical weights of individual features (either a single residue or a group of neighboring residues). Absolute values of the weights indicate the impact of each mutation of a specific feature to phenotypes (i.e., antigenic, yield, and receptor-binding properties). The larger the absolute weight, the greater the impact.Based on the features learned from sparse learning, we developed a predictive model to assess antigenic or yield properties given HA sequences. Specifically,$$\hat{y}={xw},$$ (2) where \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted phenotypic distance (either antigenicity or yield) between the two viruses; x is the feature distance vector; and w is the weight vector for those features, which can be associated with either antigenicity or yield.Multi-task learning group-guided sparse learning (MTL-GGSL) modelTo address the challenges associated with integrating serological data generated from different platforms (e.g., turkey and guinea red blood cells), we utilized a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach with Group Graphical Sparse Learning (GGSL) to analyze antigenicity. This approach allowed us to consider both N-linked glycosylation and amino acid features when analyzing the data. MTL allows us to learn multiple related tasks (i.e., analyzing antigenicity from different serological platforms) simultaneously, while GGSL considers the dependencies between different groups of features to improve the accuracy of the analysis. By utilizing MTL-GGSL, we were able to overcome the challenges associated with integrating data from different platforms and provide a more comprehensive analysis of antigenicity20,36.One advantage of using the group LASSO regularization in MTL-GGSL for antigenicity analyses is that it encourages multiple predictors from related tasks to share a subset of features. This is in contrast to the LASSO regularization, which may lead to sparse solutions where only a few features are selected for each task independently. Our previous study has shown that incorporating information on N-linked glycosylation can improve the performance of sparse learning models in predicting antigenic properties of influenza viruses20. By adopting MTL-GGSL, we are able to integrate information on both glycosylation and amino acid sequences from serological data generated using different platforms, which can further enhance the accuracy of our predictive models for influenza antigenicity.Specifically, we define$$L\left(X,y,w\right)=\frac{1}{2}{{{{{{\rm{||}}}}}}Y-{XW}{{{{{\rm{||}}}}}}}_{F}^{2},$$ (3) and$${\lambda R\left(W\right)=\lambda }_{1}{R}_{1}\left(W\right)+{\lambda }_{2}{R}_{2}\left(W\right)+{\lambda }_{3}{R}_{3}\left(W\right),$$ (4) and the model is formulated as:$$ \mathop{\min }\limits_{W}\frac{1}{2}{{||Y}-{XW||}}_{F}^{2}+{\lambda }_{1}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=1}^{p}{{||}{W}_{j}.{||}}_{1}+{\lambda }_{2}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=1}^{k}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{l=1}^{q}{{\alpha }_{l}{||}{W}_{{G}_{l},t}{||}}_{2}\\ \,\,\,+{\lambda }_{3}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=1}^{k}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{l=1}^{q}{{\alpha }_{l}{||}{W}_{{G}_{l},t}{||}}_{1},$$ (5) where \({\lambda }_{1}\), \({\lambda }_{2}\), and \({\lambda }_{3}\) are regularization parameters, j is the subscript for feature, p is the total number of features, \({G}_{l}\) denotes feature group, q is the number of feature groups, \({\alpha }_{l}=\surd {m}_{l}\) is the weight of feature group \({G}_{l}\); \({W}_{j}\) denotes the weights for the j-th feature among different tasks, and \({W}_{{G}_{l},t}\) as the weight for feature group \({G}_{l}\) of the t-th task. Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)37 was employed to solve the optimization problem.The generalized hierarchical sparse model (GHSM)To consider synergistic effects of multiple features on the phenotypes, we adopt GHSM38 in this study. The GHSM model aims to minimize: \(L(W)+{\sum }_{k=1}^{K}\frac{\lambda }{{\alpha }^{k}}{{||}{W}^{\left(k\right)}{||}}_{1}\). GHSM model solves the following objective:$$\begin{array}{c}\mathop{\min }\limits_{W}\frac{1}{2}{\left|\left|y-\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k=1}^{K}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k}}^{d}{w}_{ < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > }^{\left(k\right)}{z}_{ < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > }^{\left(k\right)}\right|\right|}_{2}^{2}+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k=1}^{K}\frac{\lambda }{{\alpha }^{k}}{\big|\big|{w}^{\left(k\right)}\big|\big|}_{1},\\ s.t.{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}{w}_{i}^{\left(1\right)}{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}\ge {{{{{\rm{||}}}}}}{e}_{i}^{\left(2\right)}\odot {w}^{\left(2\right)}{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}}_{1}\ge \cdots \ge \left|\left|{e}_{i}^{\left(K\right)}\odot {w}^{\left(K\right)}\right|\right|_{1},i\in {{\mathbb{N}}}_{d},\end{array}$$ (6) where λ and α are two regularization parameters controlling the sparsity and the decay in the coefficients for interactions of different orders, \({z}_{ < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > }^{(k)}={x}_{{i}_{1}}\odot {{x}_{i}}_{2}\odot \cdots \odot {{x}_{i}}_{k}\) denotes a data vector for the k-th order interaction corresponding to \( < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > \), an interaction index \( < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > \), where \({i}_{1} < \cdots < {i}_{k}\), is an index to uniquely indicate the interaction among the covariates \({i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k}\), W denotes the set of parameters \({\{{w}^{(k)}\}}_{k=1}^{K},{w}^{(k)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{\left(d\atop k\right)}\) for \(k=1,\cdots,K\) is a vector of length \(\left(d\atop k\right)\) = \(\frac{d!}{k!\left(d-k\right)!}\) with \({w}_{ < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > }^{(k)}\) as its element corresponding to the index \( < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > \), \({{||}\cdot {||}}_{2}\) denotes \({l}_{2}\) norm of a vector and \(\odot\) denotes the element wise product of two vectors. The constrains associated with each covariate i have a chain of \((K-1)\) inequality constraints, and there is a total of d chains. The application of these models for antigenicity, yield, receptor-binding are detailed as below.Antigenicity analysesIn this study, we used eight individual tasks, each corresponding to an individual HAI dataset, including those for seasonal A(H1N1) viruses (1977–2009), A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (2009–2020), swine A(H1N1) viruses, and mutants generated from this study. In each task, the low-rank matrix completion algorithm was used to minimize data noise and the challenges derived from low reactors and missing values in the HAI datasets, and antigenic cartography was then used for antigenic distance calculation20,39. Two groups of features (i.e., amino acid mutations and N-glycosylation sites) were used in the model to quantify influenza virus antigenic distances. We defined 327 residue features and 6 N-glycosylation site features. GETAREA software (http://curie.utmb.edu/getarea.html) was used to predict whether these residues were on HA’s surface. The A(H1N1)pdm09 three-dimensional HA structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB] identifier [ID] 3LZG) was used as the template. A total of 138 residues were predicted to be located at the HA protein’s surface (Supplementary Data 14). All amino acid residues, with a variant rate >10%, were considered as non-conserved sites and included in the machine learning model. Finally, a total of 86 residues with 4 N-glycosylation sites were used as features in the machine learning model.Yield analysesIn this study, we analyzed the yield of 189 mutants compared with the parent WT CA/04, which is 6:2 reassortant virus, in both cells and eggs. To analyze the data, we utilized two groups of features: amino acid substitutions and N-glycosylation sites. Furthermore, we employed the GHSM approach to identify synergistic amino acid substitutions associated with virus yield in eggs or cells. Specifically, to ensure the feasibility of our analyses, we constrained the highest order to 3. It’s worth noting that there were 3468 second-order interactions and 12,337 third-order interactions in our GHSM analyses.Glycan binding analysesIn this study, we used a glycan microarray with 75 glycoforms (Supplementary Fig. 1), which were grouped based on their internal and terminal substructures and linkers into a matrix of 27 glycan substructure features. We then utilized the Multi-Task Learning with Group Graphical Sparse Learning (MTL-GGSL) approach to determine the substructures associated with yield traits in cells and eggs. In the model, we employed three groups of features, including terminal substructures (n = 16), internal substructures (n = 8), and base substructures linked to the array (n = 3).Model comparison, parameter optimization, and bootstrapping analysesIn order to ensure the robustness of our analyses on antigenicity, yield, and glycan binding, we compared MAIVeSS with five other sparse learning models, including the L1-norm regularized method (LASSO)40, the L2-norm regularized method (RIDGE)41, the sparse group LASSO method (SGL)42, the L1- and L2-norm regularized method43, and the L1- and L∞-norm Composite Absolute Penalties method (iCAP)44 (Supplementary Data 1–3). The latter two models incorporate both L1- and L2-norm regularization.For antigenicity analyses, our comparison additionally included three primary machine learning models mentioned in the literature, along with three deep learning approaches. The conventional machine learning methods consist of Support Vector Machine (SVM)45,46,47, Naïve Bayes14,48,49,50, and Random Forest35,51,52. The deep learning methods include Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer. As the source codes for these models from the literature are not publicly accessible, we utilized the machine learning models available in MATLAB package (R2023a) for comparison.To develop and evaluate our models, we allocated 90% of our data for training and validation, and the remaining 10% for testing. The testing dataset was excluded from parameter optimization to avoid potential overfitting. Within the combined training and validation dataset, we employed 10-fold cross-validation by segregating the data, 90% for training and the remaining 10% for validation, to fine-tune our parameters and evaluate the training performance (Supplementary Figs. 8–13). As the results, we set \({\lambda }_{1}\) equals 2, \({\lambda }_{2}\) equals 0.01, and \({\lambda }_{3}\) equals 0.01 as optimal parameter for MTL-GGSL model, and λ equals 0.0001 and α equals 10 for GHSM model.To evaluate the performance between models in MAIVeSS and the previously mentioned comparison models, we assessed their RMSE and Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted values and ground truth for both training (using 10-fold cross-validation) and testing datasets for antigenicity, yield, and glycan binding analyses. For antigenicity analyses, we also recast it as an antigenic distance classification problem to assess the model’s efficacy in identifying antigenic variants. A virus pair is classified as an antigenic variant if its paired antigenic distance is 4-fold or greater; otherwise, it is not53. We included accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score as performance metrics for both training and testing (detailed in the Supplementary Information).To investigate the effect of amino acid substitutions on both yield and glycan binding phenotype, we employed a grouping method for amino acids54. Each amino acid was assigned to one of three groups based on its biophysical properties: nonpolar (V, L, I, M, C, F, W, and Y), small polar (G, A, and P), and polar/charged (S, T, N, Q, H, D, E, K, and R). HA protein sequence was encoded into a vector \({X}_{i}\) by comparing to a wild-type sequence and if a mutation occurred in residue j (e.g., nonpolar to small polar), we encoded the j-th element of \({X}_{i}\) to 1; otherwise, we encoded it to 0. To evaluate the directionality of amino acid substitutions on both yield and glycan binding phenotype, we used three different sparse models (LASSO, RIDGE, and SGL) and performed bootstrap analyses (detailed in Supplementary Data 5–7). In brief, we selected all features with a bootstrap value cutoff of 80 from 100 independent runs.Predictive modelIn this study, a predictive model was developed to estimate the antigenic distance between two viruses based on their genetic sequences. The model was defined as follows:$$\hat{y}=x\left(\mu {w}^{{global}}+\left(1-\mu \right){w}^{{local}}\right),$$ (7) where x is the genetic distance vector between the two viruses, y ̂ is the predicted antigenic distance between them, wglobal is the global weight representing the average of weights across different tasks, wlocal indicates the weights from each individual task, and μ is set to 0.4 to balance the global and local weights.In addition, a scoring function was proposed to measure yield differences between two viruses based on their amino acid sequences. The scoring function is defined as follows:$$\hat{y}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k=1}^{K}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k}}^{d}{w}_{ < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > }^{\left(k\right)}{z}_{ < {i}_{1},\cdots,{i}_{k} > }^{\left(k\right)},$$ (8) Here, w and z were the weight and feature matrices used in the GHSM approach mentioned above. The detailed prediction results for both the antigenic distance and yield differences are presented in Supplementary Data (Supplementary Data 12).Cells and virusesHuman embryonic kidney (293T) cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) CCL-34 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, NY; catalog number 11965-092) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA; catalog number S12450H) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; catalog number 15140122) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The HA gene of CA/04 was cloned into the vector pHW2000 and used as a template to construct the mutant library. The viruses generated by reverse genetics were propagated in MDCK cells and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Opti-MEM medium (GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, NY; catalog number 11058-021) supplemented with 1 μg/ml of TPCK (N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone)-Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; catalog number T1426) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; catalog number 15140122). The virus titers were determined by TCID50 in MDCK cells.Sequence and serological DataSerologic data for A(H1N1) viruses were collected from data described elsewhere13,55,56, and included HAI titers generated between 1,015 viruses and 194 serum samples (Supplementary Data 15). A total of 11,424 A(H1N1)pdm09 HA protein sequences from 2009 to 2020 were obtained from GISAID (https://gisaid.org).Construction of plasmid library, gene synthesis, and rescue of mutantsThe mutant plasmid library with random mutations in the HA RBS was generated using the epPCR strategy15. Four primers were used to generate the HA-pHW2000 RBS mutant library: 1) 130loop_F: 5’-TCA TGG CCC AAT CAT GAC TCG AAC-3’; 2) 190helix_F: 5’-TGG GGC ATT CAC CAT CCA TCT ACT-3’; 3) 190helix_R: 5’-AAC ATA TGT ATC TGC ATT CTG ATA-3’; and 4) 220loop_R: 5’-TAG TGT CCA GTA ATA GTT CAT TCT-3’. The epPCR product (2 μl) was transfected into XL1-Blue Supercompetent Cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; catalog number 200236). The transformed cells were directly inoculated onto LB (Luria Bertani) agar plates, and the clones were propagated in 5 ml of LB media. The clones generated from the RBS mutant library were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using the sequencing primer 5’-GAA CGT GTT ACC CAG GAG ATT-3’. Mutant viruses were rescued by plasmid-based reverse genetics with the NA genes from CA/04 and six internal genes from PR8, as described elsewhere57. To compare the phenotypes of the predicted vaccine candidates, we also generated the WT virus, a parent prototype 6:2 reassortant virus ith wild-type HA and NA genes from CA/04 and six internal genes from PR8, by using reverse genetics. To confirm the lack of any undesired egg or cell-adapted amino acid changes, each mutant’s HA genes were confirmed by using Sanger sequencing post-rescue and propagation.To validate the antigenic and high-yield properties of the viruses predicted by our computational model, we synthesized the HA and NA genes for four MAIVeSS-predicted potential vaccine viruses from epidemic strains (Gene Universal Inc., Newark, DE) and then generated reassortant viruses with the HA and NA from each of these testing epidemic strains and the six internal genes from PR8 using reverse genetics: A/Saint-Petersburg/RII57/2016(H1N1) (HA,NA)×PR8(rgSP/16), A/Chongqing-Yuzhong/SWL1453/2017(H1N1)(HA,NA)×PR8(rgCQ/17), A/Brunei/25/2019(H1N1)(HA,NA)×PR8(rgBRU/19), and A/Malaysia/33075487/2020(H1N1)(HA,NA)×PR8(rgMAS/20).Evaluation of viral yieldTo evaluate the effect of mutations on viral yield, we performed cell culture assays and embryonated egg assays. For the cell culture assays, we inoculated MDCK cells with each influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 and incubated the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. After incubation, the inocula were removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, the cells were incubated with Opti-MEM I (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY; catalog number 11058-021) containing TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; catalog number T1426) (1 µg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 48 h, 200 µl of supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. For the embryonated egg assays, 9-day-old specific pathogen-free chicken eggs were inoculated with 200 TCID50 of each virus and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h, and allantoic fluid were collected. The viral titers in the samples from both the MDCK cells and the embryonated eggs were determined using TCID50 assays in MDCK cells.Conventional methods for quantifying yields of inactivated influenza vaccines rely on the HA protein, typically determined by SDS-PAGE gel following PNGase treatment. However, this procedure is labor-intensive, preventing us from quantifying the yields of all 196 mutants propagated in both eggs and cells. We quantified the total proteins obtained from ultracentrifugation purification of supernatants from virus-infected cell or egg cultures and analyzed their correlations with the viral titration TCID50. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the total protein yields are positively correlated with TCID50 (Supplementary Fig. 14). Additional SDS-PAGE analyses indicated that approximately 40% of the total proteins are HA proteins (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). Consequently, in this study, we used TCID50 titers to assess vaccine yield.Virus concentration and purificationViruses for the glycan microarray analysis were purified as described elsewhere23. Briefly, viruses were purified from the cell supernatant or allantoic fluid by low-speed clarification (2482 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to remove debris and then followed by ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 30–60% sucrose in a 70Ti Rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) (100,000 × g, 3 h, 4 °C). The virus pellet was re-suspended in 100 μl of PBS and stored at −80 °C until use.Glycan microarrayTo identify unique substructures bound specific sets of mutants, a glycan microarray with 75 glycoforms were printed on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)–derivatized slides23. The 75 glycans were selected to represent four different glycan categories, including N-glycans, Asn-linked N-glycans, Gangliosides, Thr-linked O-mannosyl glycans (Supplementary Fig. 3). These glycans on the microarray have the same base structures and spacer arms but different terminal structures. The glycans were printed in replicates of four in a subarray, and sixteen subarrays were printed on each glass slide. All glycans were prepared at a concentration of 100 mM in phosphate buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5). The slides were fitted with a 16-chamber adapter to separate the subarrays into individual wells for assay. The unreacted NHS groups on the slides are blocked with 50 mM ethanolamine in 50 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.2) at 4 °C for 1 h and then the slides are rinsed with water. Before the assay, slides were rehydrated for 5 min in TSMW buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween). Viruses are purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and titrated to about 32,000 hemagglutination units/ml. Then 10 μl of 1.0 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.0) was added to 80 μl of virus, and the virus was incubated with 10 μg of Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Esters (Succinimidyl Esters; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; catalog number A20100) for 1 h at 25 °C. After overnight dialysis to remove excess Alexa 488, viruses HA titer were checked and then bound to glycan array. Labeled viruses were incubated on the slide at 4 °C for 2 h, washed, and centrifuged briefly before being scanned with an InnoScan 1100 AL fluorescence imager (Innopsys, Carbonne, France).Haemagglutination and HAI assaysHaemagglutination and HAI assays were performed by using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes as described by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network Manual for the Laboratory Diagnosis and Virological Surveillance of Influenza. Turkey erythrocytes were obtained from Lampire Biological Products (Everett, PA; catalog number 7209403). The turkey erythrocytes were washed three times with 1 × PBS (pH 7.2) before use and then diluted to 0.5% in 1 × PBS (pH 7.2). Ferret antisera used in the HAI assays were produced by infecting influenza seronegative ferrets (see details in Supplementary Information) or obtained from BEI Resources (https://www.beiresources.org) or International Reagent Resource (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org).Biolayer interferometry assays (BLI)The virus receptor binding affinities were determined by BLI with an Octet RED instrument (Pall ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA). Five biotinylated glycan analogs, Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNacβ-PAA-biotin (3′SLN) (Lectinity Holdings, Moscow, Russia; catalog number 0036-BP), Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNacβ-PAA-biotin (6′SLN) (Lectinity Holdings, Moscow, Russia; catalog number 0997-BP), Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucβ1-3)GlcNacβ-PAA-biotin (sLeX), Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-PAA-biotin (3′SLN(Gc)), or Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucβ1-3]GlcNAcβ-PAA-biotin (SLeX(Gc))] were used. Among them, SLeX, 3′SLN(Gc), and SLeX(Gc) were synthesized. The glycans were preloaded onto streptavidin-coated biosensors at up to 0.3 µg/ml for 5 min in 1 × kinetic buffer (Pall FortéBio, Menlo Park, CA; catalog number 18-1092). Each test virus was diluted to a final concentration of 100 pM with 1 × kinetic buffer containing 10 µM oseltamivir carboxylate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; catalog number HY-13318) and zanamivir (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; catalog number SML0492-10MG) to prevent cleavage of the receptor analogs by NA proteins of virus. Association was measured for 30 min at 25 °C. Responses were normalized by the highest value obtained during the experiment, and binding curves were fitted by using the binding-saturation method in GraphPad Prism 8 (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). The normalized response curves report the fractional saturation (f) of the sensor surface as described in elsewhere58. The RSL0.5 values were calculated to determine the binding affinity between a virus and glycan analog pair, using the binding-saturation method in GraphPad Prism 8 software. Higher RSL0.5 values indicate weaker binding affinity between the virus and glycan analog.Structural modeling and visualization of proteins structureThe three-dimensional structure of HA protein was modeled based on the crystal structure of CA/04 HA in complex with 6′SLN (PDB ID# 3UBN) and 3′SLN (PDB ID# 3UBQ). Coot (https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/) was used to introduce the desired mutation to the three subunits of a HA trimer. The mutated coordinates were subsequently refined by energy minimization using Phenix (https://phenix-online.org). Structure figures were made using Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC).Statistics and reproducibilityTo minimize the risk of overfitting and ensure a reliable assessment of our model’s performance, we randomly assigned 90% of our dataset for training and validation, reserving the remaining 10% exclusively for testing. Importantly, the testing set remained untouched during parameter tuning to maintain an impartial evaluation of the model’s generalization capabilities. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the model performance and the association between the total protein yields and TCID50 for a testing influenza virus. The model performance matrices include accuracy, specificityecall, sensitivity, precision, and F1 score (see details in Supplementary Information). Bootstrap experiments were used to evaluate the robustness of the model in feature selection. A total of 100 independent bootstrapping experiments were conducted, with each experiment randomly selecting 80% of the data. The frequency of a feature’s selection across these experiments was used as an indicator of its importance, and the higher the frequency, the more important the feature. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, and no data were excluded from the analyses. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Table 3 Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers of the vaccinate candidates selected by MAIVeSS for 2009 H1N1 virusesFull size tableReporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

California acute care hospitals must offer influenza vaccination at no cost to HCP, require HCP to receive the annual influenza vaccination or declare in writing that he/she declines vaccination, and report vaccination data to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) (Health and Safety Code section 1288.7). To reach the Healthy People 2020 goal, statewide vaccination among HCP should be at least 90% in the 2022–23 influenza season. During the 2022–23 influenza season, an average 74% of HCP received the influenza vaccine across hospitals. Influenza vaccination among HCP in California hospitals increased by 1.4% during the 2022–23 influenza season compared with the 2021–22 influenza season (Figure 2). Figure 2. Hospital Health Care Personnel Influenza Vaccination Coverage by Year Overall, of 391 hospitals only 58 (15%) hospitals achieved the 90% Healthy People 2020 goal (Table 2). CDPH recommends that all HCP receive annual influenza vaccination. In response to this report, CDPH is providing reminders of the importance of HCP influenza vaccination on monthly healthcare facility calls and webinars, and upon request will provide each local public health agency with a list of hospitals in their jurisdiction that have vaccination rates less than 90% and identify which hospitals should be targeted for local public health intervention.

These are the states getting hit the hardest now. By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 07, 2024 Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn It’s been a rough winter when it comes to respiratory illnesses. Influenza, COVID-19 and RSV have been circulating at high levels throughout the U.S. for several weeks, and new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that respiratory virus activity remains elevated. There are signs that COVID and RSV infections may be easing, according to the CDC. However flu levels are once again picking up after a post-holiday drop, the latest data shows. The U.S. saw about a 2 percent increase in positive flu tests the week of Feb. 2, compared to the previous week. Flu activity is especially high in a number of ﻿southern and mid-Atlantic states, with New Mexico, Georgia, South Carolina, and New York City reporting extremely high levels. It’s too early to tell if this bump is an indication that we’ll see a second flu wave this winter, says Rebecca Wurtz, M.D., an infectious disease physician and professor at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health. “This time of year is sort of the limbo time. We always expect a spike early in the season with the winter holidays, and then we expect it to decline,” Wurtz says. But in February, she adds, it’s not uncommon for trends to “wobble.” In fact, February is often an active time of the year for flu, says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Activity typically recedes in March, Schaffner says, but “can smolder along at low levels, sometimes even poking its nose into April.” The CDC estimates that at least 20 million Americans have had the flu so far this season. There have been at least 230,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths. Not too late for a flu shot Because flu season isn’t over and could be with us for several more weeks, health experts say it's not too late to get your flu shot if you haven't had it yet. More than half of U.S. adults (about 53 percent) haven’t received this year’s vaccine, which targets the influenza viruses that are currently circulating. That share shrinks when looking at data for older adults, who are at higher risk for serious illness and flu-related complications, such as pneumonia. An estimated 33 percent of the 60-plus population skipped out on this season’s shot. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT A new AARP survey of individuals age 18 and older finds that just over half (52 percent) of adults who say they are unlikely to get the flu shot are passing on it because they don’t think they need it. About 26 percent of those not getting the vaccine say it’s because they never get the flu. Schaffner says another reason he hears from reluctant patients is that the flu vaccine “isn’t very good.” However, he says, the vaccine “provides very substantial protection against getting serious disease,” which is especially important for older adults. During the 2022-2023 flu season, older adults accounted for 72 percent of influenza deaths and 52 percent of hospitalizations, federal data shows. Don’t abandon precautions﻿ Another way to stay protected from flu as the season persists, Wurtz says, is to wear a face mask. A mask can also help to block RSV, which is tapering off after a holiday-season surge, and the coronavirus. CDC data shows that more than 22,600 people are still being hospitalized weekly for COVID-19; about 1,000 people are dying each week from the virus. Schaffner recommends masking up in crowded indoor settings — when you’re in the grocery store, at a religious service or attending a sports game. “It offers another layer of protection,” especially for those at higher risk, he says. Like with flu, there are also vaccines for RSV and COVID-19. However, uptake has been low. About 2﻿2 percent of adults have received the latest COVID-19 vaccine; a similar share of individuals 60 and older have had the new RSV vaccine. If you do get sick this winter, don’t sit on your symptoms, Schaffner says. Reach out to your doctor right away to get tested. “We have treatments both for flu and for COVID — treatments that﻿, like the vaccine﻿, will help keep you out of the hospital. But we have to start the treatment as early as possible,” he says. %{postComment}% Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.

In a study published in PLoS Pathogens, the authors explored the developmental potential of 4’-fluorouridine (4’-FlU), a clinical drug candidate, for influenza therapy. They resistance profiled the compound against influenza viruses and mapped possible routes of viral escape, addressing specifically whether resistance affects viral pathogenicity and ability to transmit. In previous studies, 4’-FlU demonstrated broad oral efficacy against seasonal, pandemic and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in cell culture, human airway epithelium cells and two animal models, ferrets and mice. Seasonal influenza viruses pose a major public health threat, infecting nearly 1 billion people worldwide each year and causing millions to require hospitalization and advanced care. Annual flu vaccines provide moderate protection, but the benefit is marginal when vaccines are poorly matched with circulating virus strains or when novel, pandemic virus strains emerge. While three different classes of antivirals are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use against influenza, they each have a low genetic barrier against viral resistance. One of these classes is no longer recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to widespread presence of resistance mutations in circulating human and animal influenza A virus strains. Resistance has also been frequently observed to the other two classes of antivirals in human viruses. “Developing novel therapeutics to mitigate seasonal influenza and improve preparedness against future influenza pandemics is an urgent priority because of pre-existing or rapidly emerging resistance of influenza viruses to approved antivirals,” said Carolin Lieber, first author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Translational Antiviral Research in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. “In this study, we tested the potential of 4’-FlU as an influenza drug and found that resistant influenza A virus variants are severely weakened in mice. In ferrets, these resistant variants are impaired in their ability to invade the lower respiratory tract and cause viral pneumonia, in addition to being transmission-defective or compromised,” Lieber said. In cell culture, six different escape lineages with distinct mutations were found. The mutations adhered to three distinct structural clusters that are all predicted to affect the active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, leading to moderately reduced viral sensitivity to the drug, according to the study’s findings. The study also found that oral 4’-FlU administered at the lowest efficacious dose (2 mg/kg) or elevated dose (10 mg/kg) overcame moderate resistance when mice were infected with a lethal amount of influenza virions. This was demonstrated by significantly reduced virus load and complete survival, the authors reported. “We discovered that we could fully mitigate lethal infection with the resistant variants and viral spread with standard or five-fold elevated oral dose of 4’-FlU,” said Richard Plemper, senior author of the study, Regents’ Professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences and director of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research at Georgia State. “These results demonstrate that partial CA09 escape from 4’-FlU is feasible in principle, but escape mutation clusters are unlikely to reach clinical significance or persist in circulation.” Additional authors of the study include Hae-Ji Kang, Megha Aggarwal, Jeong-Joong Yoon and Robert M. Cox of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State; Nicole A. Lieberman, Elizabeth B. Sobolik and Alexander L. Greninger of the University of Washington Medical Center; and Michael G. Natchus of the Emory Institute for Drug Development and Emory University School of Medicine.

Back to Healio Influenza vaccine manufacturers in the United States said this week that they have plans to remove a potentially extinct influenza B lineage from their vaccines and offer only trivalent shots next season. Seqirus, which previously made three versions of a quadrivalent influenza vaccine, announced that it would remove B/Yamagata from all its influenza vaccines for the 2024-2025 season. U.S. flu vaccine manufacturers are removing a potentially extinct virus from their vaccines. Image: CDC/Brandon Clifton GSK told Healio in an email that it also plans to remove B/Yamagata from its vaccines and offer trivalent formulations next season after producing two quadrivalent shots last year. Sanofi said it would be able to offer trivalent shots if there is a definitive switch from quadrivalent shots. (FDA advisors usually meet in March to select viruses for U.S. influenza vaccines.) There has not been a confirmed infection with an influenza B/Yamagata virus since March 2020, according to WHO, which recommended last year that the B/Yamagata-lineage be dropped from seasonal influenza vaccines, which typically include two influenza A and two influenza B viruses. WHO was not able to confirm recent reports of a few B/Yamagata infections as occurring naturally and said it is “unlikely” that B/Yamagata-lineage viruses are still circulating. Several reasons have been given for the disappearance, including COVID-19 mitigation measures, although B/Yamagata viruses had declined in circulation even before the pandemic. Because B/Yamagata has not been detected in more than 3 years, FDA vaccine advisors have also advocated for the lineage to be removed from U.S. vaccines. References: CDC. TABLE.

WuIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty.February 5, 2024 ShareSave Listen-1.0x+0:008:01Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.In Arnold Monto’s ideal vision of this fall, the United States’ flu vaccines would be slated for some serious change—booting a major ingredient that they’ve consistently included since 2013. The component isn’t dangerous. And it made sense to use before. But to include it again now, Monto, an epidemiologist and a flu expert at the University of Michigan, told me, would mean vaccinating people “against something that doesn’t exist.”That probably nonexistent something is Yamagata, a lineage of influenza B viruses that hasn’t been spotted by global surveyors since March of 2020, shortly after COVID mitigations sent flu transmission plummeting to record lows. “And it isn’t for lack of looking,” Kanta Subbarao, the director of the WHO’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, told me. In a last-ditch attempt to find the missing pathogen, a worldwide network of monitoring centers tested nearly 16,000 influenza B virus samples collected from February to August of last year. Not a single one of them came up Yamagata. “The consensus is that it’s gone,” Cheryl Cohen, the head of South Africa’s Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, told me. Officially removing an ingredient from flu vaccines will codify that sentiment, effectively publishing Yamagata’s obituary.Read: The flu may never be the sameLast year around this time, Subbarao told me, the WHO was already gently suggesting that the world might want to drop Yamagata from vaccines; by September, the agency had grown insistent, describing the ingredient as “no longer warranted” and urging that “every effort should be made to exclude it as soon as possible.” The following month, an advisory committee to the FDA unanimously voted to speedily adopt that same change.But the switch from a four-flu vaccine to a trivalent one, guarding against only three, isn’t as simple as ordering the usual, please, just hold the Yams. Trivalent vaccines require their own licensure, which some manufacturers may have allowed to lapse—or never had at all; manufacturers must also adhere to the regulatory pipelines specific to each country. “People think, ‘They change the strains every season; this should be no big deal,’” Paula Barbosa, the associate director of vaccine policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, which represents vaccine manufacturers, told me. This situation is not so simple: “They need to change their whole manufacturing process.” At the FDA advisory-committee meeting in October, an industry representative cautioned that companies might need until the 2025–26 season to fully transition to trivalents in the Northern Hemisphere, a timeline that Barbosa, too, considers realistic. The South could take until 2026.In the U.S., though, where experts such as Monto have been pushing for expedient change, a Yamagata-less flu vaccine could be coming this fall. When I reached out to CSL Seqirus and GSK, two of the world’s major flu-vaccine producers, a spokesperson from each company told me that their firm was on track to deliver trivalent vaccines to the U.S. in time for the 2024–25 flu season, should the relevant agencies recommend and request it. (The WHO’s annual meeting to recommend the composition of the Northern Hemisphere’s flu vaccine isn’t scheduled until the end of February; an FDA advisory meeting on the same topic will follow shortly after.) Sanofi, another vaccine producer, was less definitive, but told me that, with sufficient notice from health authorities, its plans would allow for trivalent vaccines this year, “if there is a definitive switch.” AstraZeneca, which makes the FluMist nasal-spray vaccine, told me that it was “engaging with the appropriate regulatory bodies” to coordinate the shift to a trivalent vaccine “as soon as possible.”Quadrivalent flu vaccines are relatively new. Just over a decade ago, the world relied on immunizations that included two flu A strains (H1N1 and H3N2), plus one B: either Victoria or Yamagata, whichever scientists predicted might be the bigger scourge in the coming flu season. “Sometimes the world got it wrong,” Mark Jit, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told me. To hedge their bets, experts eventually began to recommend simply sticking in both. But quadrivalent vaccines typically cost more to manufacture, experts told me. And although several countries, including the U.S., quickly transitioned to the heftier shots, many nations—especially those with fewer resources—never did.Now “the extra component is a waste,” Vijay Dhanasekaran, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, told me. It’s pointless to ask people’s bodies to mount a defense against an enemy that will never attack. Trimming Yamagata out of flu-vaccine recipes should also make them cheaper, Dhanasekaran said, which could improve global access. Plus, continuing to manufacture Yamagata-focused vaccines raises the small but serious risk that the lineage could be inadvertently reintroduced to the world, Subbarao told me, as companies grow gobs of the virus for their production pipeline. (Some vaccines, such as FluMist, also immunize people with live-but-weakened versions of flu viruses.)Some of the researchers I spoke with for this article weren’t ready to rule out the possibility—however slim—that Yamagata is still biding its time somewhere. (Victoria, a close cousin of Yamagata, and the other B lineage that pesters people, once went mostly quiet for about a decade, before roaring back in the early aughts.) But most experts, at this point, are quite convinced. The past couple of flu seasons have been heavy enough to offer even a rather rare lineage the chance to reappear. “If it had been circulating in any community, I’m pretty sure that global influenza surveillance would have detected it by now,” Dhanasekaran said. Plus, even before the pandemic began, Yamagata had been the wimpiest of the flu bunch, Jit told me: slow to evolve, crummy at transmitting, and already dipping in prevalence. When responses to the pandemic starved all flu viruses of hosts, he said, this lineage was the likeliest to be lost.Read: The pandemic broke the fluEventually, companies may return to including four types of flu in their products, swapping in, say, another strain of H3N2, the most severe and fastest-evolving of the bunch—a change that Subbarao and Monto both told me might actually be preferable. But incorporating a second H3N2 is even more of a headache than returning to a trivalent vaccine: Researchers would likely first need to run clinical trials, experts told me, to ensure that the new components played nicely with each other and conferred additional benefits.For the moment, a slimmed-down vaccine is the quickest way to keep up with the flu’s current antics. And in doing so, those vaccines will also reflect the strange reality of this new, COVID-modified world. “A whole lineage of flu has probably been eliminated through changes in human behavior,” Jit told me. Humanity may not have intended it. But our actions against one virus may have forever altered the course of another.About the AuthorKatherine J.

Here, we provide evidence that the FluPol-RNAP II binding interface, beyond its well-acknowledged function in cap-snatching during transcription initiation, has also a pivotal role in replication of the viral genome. Using a combination of cell-based and in vitro approaches, we show that the RNAP II C-terminal-domain, jointly with ANP32, enhances FluPol replication activity. We observe successive conformational changes to switch from a transcriptase to a replicase conformation in the presence of the bound RNPAII C-terminal domain and propose a model in which the host RNAP II is the anchor for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Our data open new perspectives on the spatial coupling of viral transcription and replication and the coordinated balance between these two activities.

The viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (FluPol) is a key determinant of viral host-range and pathogenicity, and a prime target for antiviral drugs3. It is a ~260 kDa heterotrimer composed of the subunits PB1 (polymerase basic protein 1), PB2 (polymerase basic protein 2) and PA (polymerase acidic protein)4. In viral particles each of the eight negative-sense RNA genomic segments (vRNAs) is associated with one copy of the viral polymerase and encapsidated with multiple copies of the nucleoprotein (NP) to form viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs)5. Upon viral infection, incoming vRNPs are imported into the nucleus in which FluPol performs transcription and replication of the viral genome through distinct primed6 and unprimed7 RNA synthesis mechanisms, respectively. Determination of high-resolution FluPol structures by X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have revealed that a remarkable conformational flexibility allows FluPol to perform mRNA transcription8,9,10,11,12. Recently, first insights into the molecular process of FluPol genome replication were revealed, however the molecular details remain largely to be determined13,14,15,16.Transcription of negative-sense vRNAs into mRNAs occurs via a process referred to as ‘cap-snatching’, whereby nascent 5’-capped host RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcripts are bound by the PB2 cap-binding domain9, cleaved by the PA endonuclease domain8, and used as capped primers to initiate transcription10. Polyadenylation is achieved by a non-canonical stuttering mechanism at a 5′-proximal oligo(U) polyadenylation signal present on each vRNA12,17. Influenza mRNAs, therefore, harbour 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A) structures characteristic of cellular mRNAs and are competent for translation by the cellular machinery. The accumulation of primary transcripts of incoming vRNPs leads to de novo synthesis of viral proteins, including FluPol and NP, which are thought to trigger genome replication upon nuclear import18.Replication generates exact, full-length complementary RNAs (cRNAs) which in turn serve as templates for the synthesis of vRNAs. Unlike transcription, replication occurs through a primer-independent, de novo initiation mechanism which occurs either at the first nucleotide of the 3′-vRNA template or at nucleotide 4 and 5 of the 3′-cRNA template followed by realignment prior to elongation7,19,20. Nascent cRNAs and vRNAs are encapsidated by NP and FluPol to form cRNPs and vRNPs, respectively21. Progeny vRNPs can then perform secondary transcription and replication or, late during the infection cycle, be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to be incorporated into new virions.FluPol associates dynamically with many cellular proteins, among which the interaction with the host RNAP II transcription machinery22,23,24 and the nuclear acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32)25 are essential for a productive viral infection. A direct interaction between FluPol and the disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNAP II subunit is essential for ‘cap-snatching’26. In mammals, the CTD consists of 52 repeats of the consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S727. To perform ‘cap-snatching’, FluPol binds specifically to the CTD when phosphorylated on serine 5 residues (pS5 CTD), which is a hallmark of RNAP II in a paused elongation state28. Structural studies revealed bipartite FluPol CTD-binding sites for influenza type A, B and C viruses22,23,29. For type A viruses, both CTD-binding sites, denoted site 1A and site 2A, are on the PA-C-terminal domain (PA-Cter) and consist of highly conserved basic residues that directly interact with pS5 moieties of the CTD23.The host ANP32 proteins consist of a structured N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a disordered C-terminal low complexity acidic region (LCAR) and are essential for influenza virus genome replication30,31. Differences in avian and mammalian ANP32 proteins represent a major driver of FluPol adaptation upon zoonotic infections of mammalian species with avian influenza viruses25,31,32. A type C virus FluPol (FluCPol) co-structure with ANP32A shows that the ANP32A LRR domain binds to an asymmetrical influenza polymerase dimer, which is presumed to represent the FluPol replication complex13. The two FluPol conformations observed in this dimer would represent the RNA-bound replicase (FluPol(R)), which synthesises de novo genomic RNA and the encapsidase (FluPol(E)), which binds the outgoing replication product and nucleates formation of the progeny RNP18. In addition, the ANP32 LCAR domain was shown to interact with NP15,16, leading to a model in which the ANP32 LCAR domain recruits NP to nascent exiting RNA, thus, in combination with the FluPol(E), ensuring efficient co-replicatory encapsidation of de novo synthesised genomic RNAs.Structural, biochemical and functional studies to date have led to a model in which the FluPol binds either to the pS5 CTD or to ANP32, driving RNPs towards transcription or replication, respectively18. Here, we provide genetic evidence that the FluPol CTD-binding interface is essential not only for transcription but also for replication of the viral genome. We show that the CTD, jointly with ANP32, enhances FluPol replication activity and we demonstrate in structural studies that CTD-binding to the FluPol is consistent with replication activity. We therefore propose a model in which transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome occur in association with the RNAP II CTD thereby allowing an efficient switching between the two activities.ResultsThe FluPol CTD-binding interface is essential for replication of the viral genomePrevious studies demonstrated that the FluPol PA-Cter domain is crucial for FluPol transcription by mediating the interaction between the FluPol transcriptase (FluPol(T)) and the host RNAP II pS5 CTD for ‘cap-snatching’ through direct protein-protein interaction (Fig. S1A, FluPol(T))22,23. Recent cryo-EM structures of FluCPol suggest that the PA-Cter domain is also involved in the formation of the FluPol replication complex13. As there are no structures published for an equivalent FluAPol complex, we used the FluCPol structures to generate a model of the FluAPol replicase-encapsidase complex (Fig. 1A FluPol(R) and FluPol(E)). According to our model, the key CTD-binding residues are surface exposed and potentially competent for CTD-binding in the FluPol(R) (Fig. 1A, left). Strikingly, FluPol(E) CTD-binding residues are in close proximity to the ANP32-binding interface (Fig. 1A, right). We therefore hypothesised that the FluPol CTD-binding interface may have a role beyond the described association with the pS5 CTD in the FluPol(T) conformation namely in the assembly of the FluPol(R)-ANP32-FluPol(E) replication complex.Fig. 1: The FluPol CTD-binding interface is essential for replication of the viral genome.A Model of actively replicating Zhejiang-H7N9 FluAPol replicase-ANP32-encapsidase (FluPol(R)-ANP32A-FluPol(E)).

The model was constructed by superposing Zhejiang-H7N9 elongating FluAPol domains (PDB: 7QTL)43 for the FluPol(R) and apo-dimer Zhejiang-H7N9 FluAPol (PDB: 7ZPL)43 for the FluPol(E), on those of FluCPol replication complex (PDB: 6XZQ)13.

Luminescence signals are represented as the fold-change (FC) relative to the background, which is defined as the sum of signals measured when the FluPol(CTD-) and FluPol(R-/T-) were transfected alone (mean ± SD, n = 4, *p < 0.033, **p < 0.002, ***p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA; Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageTo assess this dual role hypothesis, we examined whether binding of the A/WSN/1933 (WSN) FluPol to human ANP32A (huANP32A) is altered by previously described FluPol CTD-binding mutations (PA K289A, R454A, K635A or R638A)23. For this purpose, we made use of cell-based G. princeps split-luciferase protein-protein complementation assays as described before in refs. 33,34. As expected from our previous work23, steady-state levels of the wild-type (WT) and mutant PA protein are similar or slightly reduced in the case of the PA K635A mutant (Fig. S1B) and each mutation reduces FluPol binding to the CTD (Fig. 1B, grey bars) as well as FluPol activity as measured in a vRNP reconstitution assay (Fig. 1B, hatched bars). Remarkably, they also reduce FluPol binding to huANP32A (Fig. 1B, light blue bars) as well as chicken ANP32A (chANP32A) (Fig. 1B, dark blue bars). We then tested mutations previously shown to impair viral multiplication more strongly, either double mutations (PA K635A + R638A in site 1A, K289 + R454A in site 2A)23 or mutations in site 2A (PA S420E, ∆550-loop)22. Steady-state levels of the mutant PA proteins remain unchanged (Fig. S1C). The observed reductions in CTD-binding signal are in the same 25–50% range as with the first series of single mutants (Fig. S1D, grey bars), suggesting that disruption of a single site, 1A or 2A, largely preserves the CTD-binding signal through the remaining intact binding site. Nevertheless, stronger reductions in huANP32A- and chANP32A-binding and FluPol activity are observed with the second series of mutants compared to the first (Fig. S1D, blue and hatched bars, compared to Fig. 1B), thus reflecting their stronger impact on viral multiplication22,23.We then quantified the accumulation of viral RNA species (NA mRNA, cRNA and vRNA) in the vRNP reconstitution assay by strand-specific RT-qPCR35. All tested mutants show decreased mRNA accumulation levels (Fig. 1C, grey bars). Strikingly, the PA R454A, K635A, S420E and ∆550-loop mutants also show decreased cRNA and vRNA levels, indicating that both transcription and replication are affected (Fig. 1C, light and dark blue bars, respectively). The variations in cRNA and vRNA levels mirror the variations in FluPol chANP32-binding signal shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. S1D. Such a correlation is not observed with the FluPol huANP32-binding signal, most likely because in our G. princeps split-luciferase protein-protein complementation assay huANP32A binds FluPol weakly compared to chANP32, in agreement with previous reports33. We speculate that in the presence of huANP32 the assay is not discriminant enough to resolve mutant-to-mutant differences. In the presence of the PA K289A and R638A mutants, cRNA and vRNA levels appear unchanged or even increased (Fig. 1C). However, like the R454A and 635A mutants, they show not only a ~80% decrease of mRNA:vRNA ratios (Fig. S1E, grey bars) but also a ~50% decrease of cRNA:vRNA ratios (Fig. S1E, blue bars), indicating an imbalance in the accumulation of replication products compared to the WT FluPol.To further support the notion that the FluPol CTD-binding interface is essential for replication, we made use of transcription-defective (FluPol(T-), PA D108A)8 and replication-defective (FluPol(R-), PA K664M)36 mutants of the WSN FluPol. When expressed alone, FluPol(T-) and FluPol(R-) show low activity, as expected (Fig. 1D). However, when they are both co-expressed, FluPol(T-) and FluPol(R-) trans-complement each other and the signal exceeds the background defined as the sum of the activity of FluPol(T-) and FluPol(R-) alone. This trans-complementation system was used to reveal a defect in transcription or in replication (Fig. 1E, F). Upon co-expression with the FluPol(R-) mutant, trans-complementation is observed for most of the investigated CTD-binding mutants (Fig. 1E), confirming that they are transcription-defective. Similarly, upon co-expression with the FluPol(T-) mutant, trans-complementation is observed for most of the investigated FluPol CTD-binding mutants (Fig. 1F) demonstrating that a replication defect is introduced when the CTD-binding interface is mutated.Overall, our findings show that the FluPol CTD-binding interface, beyond its function for FluPol ‘cap-snatching’, is also involved in the FluPol-ANP32 interaction and is essential for genome replication. They are not limited to the WSN strain, as a dual-effect of the mutations PA K289A, R454A, K635A and R638A on CTD-, huANP32A- and chANP32A-binding is also observed with the FluPol of the human isolate A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) (Anhui-H7N9), a virus of avian origin which harbours the human-adaptation signature PB2 K627 (Fig. S1F, G). Sequence alignments of the PB1, PB2, PA and NP proteins from the influenza A viruses used in this study are shown in Fig. S2.Serial passaging of FluPol PA K289A, R454A, K635A, R638A mutant viruses selects for adaptive mutations which restore FluPol binding to the CTD and huANP32AWe previously rescued by reverse genetic procedures recombinant WSN PA mutant IAVs (PA K289A, R454A, K635A, R638A) that were highly attenuated, formed pinhead-sized plaques and had acquired multiple non-synonymous mutations23. In order to investigate whether and how the recombinant viruses adapt to defective CTD and ANP32-binding (Fig. 1), we subjected them to eight serial cell culture passages in MDCK-II cells followed by titration and next generation sequencing (NGS) of the viral genome at passage 1 to 4 and 8 (Fig. 2A, p1–4 and p8). The plaque size of the passaged viruses progressively increased (Fig. 2B and S3A), which went along with distinct patterns of adaptive mutations (Source data file), suggesting that cell culture passaging increased the replicative capacity of the PA mutant viruses. True reversions that require at least two nucleotide substitutions did not emerge. The observed second-site mutations are primarily located on the FluPol subunits as well as the NP (Fig. 2C, S3B and S4A) and are mostly surface exposed (Fig. 2D and S4B–D). Several FluPol second-site mutations are located close to the FluPol CTD-binding sites (Fig. 2D, PA D306N, C489R, R490I, R496Q) while some PB2 second-site mutations are located in flexible hinge-subdomains (Fig. 2D, PB2 D253G, S286N, M535I). Overall, the FluPol second-site mutations show no local clustering or common function, indicating that diverse routes of adaptation occurred. NP second-site mutations are also surface exposed, but to our knowledge have not been associated to date with any specific function (Fig. S4D)37. The observed reversion pathways most likely represent a fraction of possible reversion pathways, especially as passaging was performed at low MOIs and, therefore, less frequent variants may have been lost.Fig. 2: Serial passaging of mutant WSN viruses with mutations at the FluPol-CTD interface selects for adaptive mutations which restore FluPol binding to the CTD and huANP32A.A Schematic representation of the passaging experiment.

Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageWe first focused on the reversion pathway of PA K289A mutant virus. Recombinant viruses with combinations of FluPol second-site mutations observed along the PA K289A reversion pathway at p1, p4 and p8 recapitulate the progressive increase in plaque size observed during serial passaging (Fig. 2E and S3C), demonstrating that the FluPol second-site mutations are leading to the observed increase in viral replicative capacity. PB2 and PA proteins with second-site mutations which occurred during passaging of PA K289A mutant virus, accumulate at similar levels compared to the WT proteins (Fig. S3D). However, the combinations of FluPol second-site mutations result in sequential increases and decreases of CTD-binding, huANP32A-binding and/or FluPol activity (Fig. 2F). The highest levels of CTD-binding, huANP32A-binding and FluPol activity are observed for the combination of mutations observed at p8 (PA K289A + PB2 D253G + PA C489R), which goes along with the highest replicative capacity observed for the passaged virus at p8 (Fig. 2B, E).The reversion pathways of the PA R454A, K635A and R638A mutant viruses were analysed in the same way (Fig. S3E). Across the tested combinations of primary FluPol mutations and second-site mutations that occurred during passaging, FluPol activity shows a strong positive correlation with huANP32A-binding (Fig. 2G, left panel) as well as a positive correlation with CTD-binding (Fig. 2G, middle panel) but not with FluPol-binding to other known cellular partners, such as DDX5 (Fig. 2G, right panel) or RED (Fig. S3F)38.Overall, we show that serial cell culture passaging of PA K289A, R454A, K635A and R638A mutant viruses selects for adaptive mutations that rescue viral polymerase activity by restoring FluPol binding to the CTD and/or huANP32A, which agrees with our initial observation that the investigated FluPol mutants are impaired for CTD-binding as well as ANP32-binding (Fig. 1).CTD overexpression leads to an increased binding of FluPol to huANP32To further document a potential interplay between CTD and ANP32-binding to FluPol, we tested the effect of mCherry-CTD (CTD-WT) overexpression on FluPol binding to huANP32A as well as FluPol oligomerisation in cultured cells. A FluPol binding-deficient CTD in which all serine 5 residues were replaced with alanines was used as a specificity control (CTD-S5A)22. mCherry-CTD-WT and -CTD-S5A accumulate to similar levels (Fig. S5A), however mCherry-CTD-WT leads to a significant increase of FluPol huANP32A-binding compared to the FluPol binding-deficient CTD-S5A mutant, suggesting that the CTD facilitates FluPol-binding to huANP32A (Fig. 3A). mCherry-CTD-WT overexpression also leads to significantly increased WSN FluPol oligomerisation compared to the FluPol binding-deficient CTD-S5A mutant (Fig. 3B), as measured in a split-luciferase complementation assay39. A similar increase in oligomerisation was also observed with the Anhui-H7N9 and B/Memphis/13/2003 FluPols (Fig. S5B). Various oligomeric FluPol species have been described13,40,41. There is evidence that the utilised split-luciferase-based assay, when FluPol is overexpressed in the absence of any other overexpressed viral or cellular protein, detects the symmetrical FluPol dimer species39,41,42. Upon CTD overexpression, it is unclear which oligomeric FluPol species is affected. However, the oligomerisation signal is still increased in the presence of the PB2 NEQ71-73AAA mutant, which abolishes FluPol symmetrical dimerisation (Fig. S5C–E)39,41, indicating that CTD overexpression affects FluPol oligomers distinct from the symmetrical FluPol dimer. Moreover, the increased signal upon CTD-WT overexpression is less pronounced in HEK-293T cells depleted for huANP32A and huANP32B (ANP32AB KO) (Fig. S5F, G), most clearly so for B/Memphis/13/2003 FluPol, suggesting that the CTD-dependent increase in FluPol oligomerisation is at least partially dependent on huANP32A and/or huANP32B. Altogether, the data show that CTD overexpression leads to increased binding of FluPol to huANP32A as well as FluPol oligomerisation, suggesting that the CTD can bring two or more FluPols in close proximity with each other in conjunction with ANP32A, thereby promoting FluPol replication.Fig. 3: FluPol replication activity is enhanced in the presence of CTD and ANP32A.WSN FluPol binding to huANP32A (A) and WSN FluPol oligomerisation (B) in the presence of increasing amounts of pS5 CTD, as assessed using split-luciferase-based complementation assays.

This polymerase, referred to below as Zhejiang-H7N9, derives from a human isolate of an avian strain that possesses PB2 E627 together with the mammalian adaptation mutation PB2 N701 (Fig. S2)44. The v51_mut_S template sequence derives from joining the first 30 and last 21 nucleotides (nts) of the respective 5’ and 3′ vRNA ends of Zhejiang-H7N9 segment 4. It was modified so that a stalled elongation product of 33 nts could be produced by using only AGC nts or replacing UTP in the reaction by non-hydrolysable UpNHpp (Fig. 3C, light blue letters). This 33-mer cRNA product was estimated to be long enough that its 5’ hook (1–10) could bind to the encapsidase, according to the modelled Zhejiang-H7N9 replicase-encapsidase structure. The addition of all NTPs would in fine produce a full-length 51-mer replication product without poly-adenylation (since the oligo-U sequence is reduced to 4xU due to changing U18 to A)12, assuming RNA synthesis proceeded to the 5’ end of the template, rather than terminating prior to reading through the 5’ hook (Fig. 3C, dark blue letters).De novo replication assays were performed with WT Zhejiang-H7N9 FluPol, using three (ACG) or four (ACGU) nts, excess apo-polymerase, that could serve as encapsidase, recombinant huANP32A and 6-repeats pS5 CTD peptide (pS5 CTD(6mer)) (Fig. 3D). In reactions with ACG only (Fig. 3D, lane 1–4), the principal product is around 38–40 nts (with another at ~45 nts), whose significant production is only visible in the presence of huANP32A (Fig. 3D, lane 2) and strongly enhanced when both the CTD and huANP32A are added (Fig. 3D, lane 2 vs 4). When all four nts are added (Fig. 3D, lane 5–8), the presence of CTD and huANP32A again strongly enhances RNA synthesis with the production of both a similar product as with ACG alone (38–40 nts) and a significant amount of a longer ~55–56 nts product (Fig. 3D, lane 6 vs 8). Although the apparent size of these products does not correspond with the theoretical length of the stalled and full-length products (they are consistently around 5–6 nts higher), nevertheless, we think that they correspond to these products for the following reasons. Firstly, for both the AGC+UpNHpp and AGCU reactions, we have obtained high-resolution cryo-EM structures of stalled elongation states, unambiguously showing products of size 33–mer and 35-mer respectively (32-mer/34-mer if RNA synthesis starts at G2 of the template instead of U1, see below) that we presume to correspond to the bands observed. Secondly, for the AGCU reaction, the difference in size of the two bands is 16–18 nts, which corresponds to the expected difference between the stalled and full-length (hook read-through) products. We are unable to explain the origin of the ~45 nts product with AGC only. Despite the remaining uncertainties in the assignment of the products, these results demonstrate the synergistic effect of CTD and huANP32A in significantly enhancing de novo cRNA synthesis.We further investigated which domains of huANP32A are essential for the enhancement of de novo RNA synthesis activity in the presence, or not, of pS5 CTD(6mer) peptide. We compared the full-length huANP32A (‘FL’ lane 1-6) with huANP32A subdomains corresponding to the LRR (‘1–149’ lane 7-10), the LRR and LCAR N-terminal region (‘1-199’ lane 11-14), or the LCAR and LRR C-terminal region (‘144–249’ lane 15–18) (Fig. 3E). While without addition of CTD, only FL huANP32A supported significant replication product synthesis, we show that the 144-199 region of huANP32A is most critical to observe the synergistic CTD- and ANP32-dependent enhancement of replication product synthesis (Fig. 3E, right panel). These in vitro findings are consistent with cell-based assays in which FluPol activity was investigated in the presence of the same huANP32A C-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 3F, G). While the presence of the CTD alone was shown to enhance FluPol transcriptional activity in vitro22,29, enhancement of FluPol replicational activity requires both the presence of the CTD and the 144-249 domain of ANP32, suggesting that CTD and the ANP32 LCAR domain are jointly priming FluPol for replication.Instead of using the WT Zhejiang-H7N9 FluPol, which forms a robust symmetrical dimer in vitro22 that could compete with the formation of an active asymmetric FluPol(R)-FluPol(E) dimer, we subsequently used a Zhejiang-H7N9 FluPol that harbours four mutations (PA E349K, PA R490I, PB1 K577G, and PB2 G74R) and is referred to below as the 4 M mutant. PA E349K, PB1 K577G, and PB2 G74R were shown to disrupt the symmetrical apo FluPol dimer interface39, while PA R490I appeared during passaging of the PA R638A mutant virus and increases FluPol-ANP32A binding in a cell-based assay (Fig. S3E). Indeed, Zhejiang-H7N9 4 M shows enriched monomeric particles while preserving a similar in vitro activity when compared to the Zhejiang-H7N9 WT FluPol (Fig. S6A, B). Accordingly, in cell-based assays Anhui-H7N9 4 M shows decreased FluPol oligomerisation, increased binding to huANP32A, while showing activity levels comparable to the WT Anhui-H7N9 FluPol as measured in a vRNP reconstitution assay (Fig. S6C).To determine whether 5’ triphosphorylated full-length replication products were actually synthesised, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of all RNAs present in the reaction mix (Fig. S6B, left panel, lane 8). To simplify the analysis by NGS of this heterogeneous RNA sample, we first degraded non-5’ triphosphorylated RNAs with a 5’-phosphate-dependent exonuclease. This removes the v51_mut_S template, which carries a 5’ monophosphate, and which is perfectly complementary to the expected product and could have formed unwanted double-stranded RNA (Fig. S6D). NGS analysis revealed that the majority of reads (i.e., premature and near full-length products) start with 5’-pppGC… instead of the expected 5’-pppAGC… (Fig. 3H). Despite the presence of many premature termination products (Fig. S6E), around 80% of near full-length products, are 50-mers, lacking the expected 5’ pppA, with few 51-mers (5’-pppAGC…) and 49-mers (5’-pppC…) (Fig. 3I). This suggests that, in vitro, most RNA synthesis products are initiated de novo with a 5’-pppG at the second position of the v51_mut_S template (3′-UCG…).Structural analysis shows that both replication and transcription are consistent with CTD-binding to the FluPolUsing cryo-EM, we then sought to determine structures of actively replicating Zhejiang-H7N9 4M FluPol in the presence of huANP32A, pS5 CTD(6mer) peptide mimic and excess apo FluPol, by freezing grids with the de novo reaction stalled with UpNHpp (Fig. S6B, left panel, lane 4). Several high-resolution structures were obtained from a Krios data collection (Table 1, Fig. 4 and S7). These include FluPol in the recently described intermediate structure, denoted PB2-C(I)/ENDO(T), where the cap-domain is swung out (Fig. 4A, left panel, 3.25 Å resolution)14,45. A second structure was obtained at 2.9 Å resolution where FluPol with PB2-C mid-link and cap-binding domains take a replicase-like configuration (PB2-C(R)), with the 627-domain remaining flexible (Fig. 4A, middle panel). However, the PA endonuclease is still in an unrotated transcriptase-like conformation (ENDO(T)), thus precluding the usual interaction with the PB2-NLS domain, as previously observed for FluAPol H5N1 replicase conformation (Fig. 4A, right panel)41. A third structure was obtained at a higher resolution (2.5 Å), in which PB2-C is not visible (Fig. 4B). These three structures show FluPol in the pre-initiation state mode A, with the 3′ end of the v51_mut_S template (3′-UCG…) in the active site and the priming loop fully extended and well ordered (Fig. 4C, D and S8A). The template is positioned with C2 and G3 respectively at the −1 and +1 positions, whilst only the phosphate of U1 is visible (Fig. 4C, D). In addition, a stalled elongation state was obtained at 2.9 Å resolution in which FluPol encloses a template-product duplex, with incoming UpNHpp at the +1 active site position, and the 3′ vRNA end bound to the secondary site (Fig. 4E and S8B). Finally, from a similar de novo reaction mix but in the presence of all NTPs (Fig. S6B, left panel, lane 8), we obtained a structure at 3.43 Å resolution of Zhejiang-H7N9 4 M FluPol in a self-stalled pre-termination state (Table 2 and Fig. S9). In this post-transfer structure, with the PPi reaction product visible, template U17 base pairs with A35 of the product cRNA at the +1 active site position, with a maximally taut connection of the template from the hook to the active site, as previously described12. This structure shows that even when all NTPs are present, under these conditions self-stalling prior to the hook can occur, as seen in the in vitro activity assays (Fig. 3D, E and S6A, B).Table 1 Cryo-EM structures data collection, refinement and validation statisticsFull size tableFig. 4: FluPol replication is consistent with CTD-binding to the FluPol.A Left: Cartoon representation of FluAPol Zhejiang-H7N9-4M in the intermediate conformation (obtained in this study) as previously described14,45, bound to pS5 CTD.

Each CTD pS5 repeat is indicated.Full size imageTable 2 Cryo-EM structures data collection, refinement and validation statistics (continued)Full size tableIn all structures, the pS5 CTD is observed bound in sites 1A and 2A. Continuous density between the two sites, with 25 connecting residues coming from five CTD repeats, is observed for the pre-initiation state and the elongation structures (Fig. 4F), whereas for the replicase-like structure, the connectivity is lost between both sites. Despite extensive cryo-EM data analysis, huANP32A was never visualised nor the putative replicase-encapsidase dimer.Altogether, these results show that in vitro, de novo RNA synthesis assays result in a heterogeneous mix of FluPol conformations intermediate between the full replicase and transcriptase configurations, reflecting the flexibility of the peripheral PB2-C and PA-N domains (Fig. S7). Importantly, a replicase-like initiation complex (PB2-C(R)/ENDO(T)) is observed for the first time, characterised by the radically different position of the cap-binding domain compared to the transcriptase conformation (Fig. 4A, middle panel)46, which was never observed during extensive studies of cap-dependent transcription12. However, the elongation state stalled with UpNHpp, in which the translocated 3′ end of the template has reached the secondary binding site (Fig. 4E), is similar to the previously described pre-termination transcription state since PB2-C is not visible12. Finally, all structures have the CTD peptide mimic bound in both sites 1A and 2A, suggesting that both replication and transcription are consistent with CTD-binding (Fig. 4A, B and E). The observation of the intermediate state (denoted PB2-C(I)/ENDO(T)) in the context of de novo RNA synthesis lends support to the suggestion that it is an important intermediate in the transition from transcriptase to replicase conformation45. Indeed, our structural results suggest that this transition might occur in the following sequence of steps: PB2-C(T)/ENDO(T), PB2-C(I)/ENDO(T), PB2-C(R)/ENDO(T), PB2-C(R)/ENDO(R), with the first and last being the full transcriptase and replicase, respectively. We suggest that the final step, ENDO(T) to ENDO(R) is more likely to happen after PB2-C(R) is established, which liberates the PB2-NLS domain so that it can interact with ENDO(R). Furthermore, we suggest that the full replicase conformation (including the otherwise flexible 627-domain) is only fully stabilised in the context of the replicase-encapsidase complex.The pre-initiation state structures show that at least in vitro, and using highly purified recombinant FluPol, the preferred position of the 3′ end of the vRNA template is with C2, rather than U1, at the −1 position. This leads to formation of pppGpC at the beginning of the product, consistent with the NGS results, or alternatively, would allow efficient priming by pppApG, if this dinucleotide was already available from another source. Internal initiation at position 2 of vRNA has been previously described20,47, but other authors report pppApG formation at position 17. We note that initiation at position 2 of vRNA implies that the 5′ end of the cRNA product lacks A1 and thus probably forms a less stable hook structure since the A1:A10 non-canonical base pair cannot form. This could explain why we do not observe in cryo-EM the cRNA hook bound in a putative encapsidase, even though there is excess apo-polymerase. This could further explain why the putative asymmetric FluPol(R)-FluPol(E) dimer is also not observed, since it seems likely that in vitro, for the FluAPol, the FluPol(R)-FluPol(E) -ANP32 complex is not so stable, unlike the case of FluCPol, where the FluPol(R)-FluPol(E) complex is stable even in the absence of ANP3213. These observations suggest that other cellular or viral factors and the RNP context might be required to recapitulate true terminal initiation of vRNA replication and further work is required to clarify this issue36.Restoration of CTD-binding interface rescues FluPol replication activity and enhances FluPol binding to huANP32ASecond-site mutations PA C489R and PB2 D253G were selected during passaging of the recombinant WSN virus with a PA K289A mutation (Fig. 2C) and conferred elevated FluPol-binding to the CTD as well as to huANP32A (Fig. 2F, grey and blue bars). PA C489 is in close proximity to the phosphoserine binding site in CTD-binding site 2A (Fig. 5A). The mutation PA C489R could therefore plausibly compensate for the loss of the positive charge of PA K289A and rescue the interaction with the CTD. Indeed, structural analysis by cryo-EM of Zhejiang-H7N9 WT FluPol in the symmetric dimeric form (Table 2 and Fig. S10) and bearing the double mutation PA K289A + C489R confirms that C489R points towards the phosphoserine binding site, although at a slightly greater distance than K289 (Fig. 5B, C). Despite this, the structure did not reveal CTD-binding to the Zhejiang-H7N9 PA K289A + C489R FluPol in this conformation. Therefore, we sought to analyse the functional impact of the single PA C489R reversion on the viral phenotype, and in cellular assays, on FluPol activity and FluPol-binding to the CTD and huANP32A (Fig. 5D–I).Fig. 5: Restoration of CTD-binding interface rescues FluPol replication activity and enhances FluPol binding to huANP32A.A Cartoon representation of the pS5 CTD-bound to FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 in site 2A (PDB: 7Z4O)22.

E WSN FluPol activity was measured by vRNP reconstitution in HEK-293T cells, using a model Fluc-vRNA. Luminescence signals are represented as a percentage of PA WT. F WSN vRNPs were reconstituted in HEK-293T cells using the NA vRNA segment. The steady-state levels of NA mRNA and vRNA were quantified by strand-specific RT-qPCR35, normalised to GAPDH by the 2−ΔΔCT method71 and are presented as ratios of mRNA to vRNA levels relative to PA WT (RNA levels are shown in Fig. S11B). G WSN FluPol binding to the CTD was assessed using a split-luciferase-based complementation assay. Luminescence signals are represented as a percentage of PA WT. H Accumulation levels of cRNA and vRNA in a vRNP reconstitution assay were determined by strand-specific RT-qPCR35 as in (F). Ratios of cRNA to vRNA levels relative to PA WT are shown (RNA levels are shown in Fig. S11B). I huANP32A-binding to WSN FluPol was determined as in (G). (mean ± SD, n = 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, *p < 0.033, **p < 0.002, ***p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA; Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageA recombinant WSN virus with the PA K289A + C489R mutations shows larger plaques compared to the PA K289A mutant virus, demonstrating that the PA C489R second-site mutation provides a significant growth advantage to PA K289A mutant virus (Fig. 5D and S11A). Indeed, WSN FluPol activity as measured in a vRNP reconstitution assay increases significantly when the PA C489R mutation is combined with PA K289A (Fig. 5E). This increase correlates with a restored mRNA:vRNA ratio (Fig. 5F and S11B) as well as an increased FluPol-binding to the CTD (Fig. 5G). Importantly, steady-state levels of the WT and mutant PA proteins are similar (Fig. S11C). These observations suggest that charge restoration in CTD-binding site 2A of the WSN FluPol in the transcriptase conformation rescues the interaction with the host RNAP II for ‘cap-snatching’ in cell-based assays and during live-virus infection. In cell-based assays, the Anhui-H7N9 FluPols with PA K289A and PA K289A + C489R show similar trends to those observed with the WSN FluPol counterparts, although with much less pronounced phenotypes (Fig. S11D). Therefore, we speculate that the fact that CTD-binding is not restored in vitro for Zhejiang-H7N9 PA K289A + C489R could be due to strain-specificities (Fig. S2) and/or to the presence of cellular factors that favour binding of the CTD to the PA K289A + C489R and are missing in the in vitro assay.Beyond the rescue of FluPol transcription, cRNA accumulation levels increase significantly when PA C489R is combined with PA K289A (Fig. S11B), which goes together with a rescue of the imbalanced cRNA:vRNA ratio associated with the PA K289A mutant (Fig. 5H), and with increased huANP32A-binding (Fig. 5I). Taken together our observations suggest that the second-site mutation PA C489R has another functional impact, namely restoring FluPol replication by enhancing huANP32A-binding.Similar results are obtained for the PA C453R revertant which has been shown to restore FluPol-binding to the CTD in site 1A by compensating the loss of positive charge of the PA R638A mutation (Fig. S12A)23,48. PA C453R rescues the attenuated viral plaque phenotype (Fig. S12B, C) as well as the reduced FluPol activity (Fig. S12D) associated with PA R638A, while it does not affect PA steady-state levels (Fig. S12E). Strikingly, PA C453R enhances huANP32A-binding when tested in combination with PA R638A (Fig. S12F), mimicking at CTD-binding site 1A the effects of PA C489R at site 2A.The mechanism of rescue of ANP32A-binding by the PA C489R and PA C453R mutations remains unclear and could possibly involve the FluPol(R) and/or FluPol(E) moieties. The mutations could enhance binding of the pS5 CTD in site 1A or 2A in the FluPol(R), leading to an enhanced priming of the replicase activity in conjunction with ANP32. They could as well increase binding of ANP32 through direct interactions at the FluPol(E)-ANP32 interface.DiscussionA model for RNAP II CTD-anchored transcription and replication of the influenza virus genomeThere is long-standing and extensive evidence that binding of FluPol to the pS5 CTD repeats of host RNAP II is essential for transcription of viral mRNAs26,49,50. Here, we show that CTD-binding not only stabilises the transcriptase conformation of the influenza virus polymerase (FluPol(T))22,29, but also enhances replication of the viral genome, in conjunction with the host protein ANP32A, which was recently described to bridge two FluPol moieties in an asymmetric replicase-encapsidase dimer (FluPol(R)-FluPol(E))13. Our findings open new perspectives on the spatial coupling of viral transcription and replication and the coordinated balance between these two activities.Early in infection, incoming vRNPs serve as a template for both primary mRNA transcription and the first round of cRNA synthesis51. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which incoming vRNPs switch from primary transcription to cRNA synthesis while remaining bound to the RNAP II CTD (Fig. 6A). It has been long understood that primary transcription requires FluPol(T) association with the RNAP II CTD to enable ‘cap-snatching’ for the priming of viral mRNA synthesis in the FluPol(T) conformation (Fig. 6B, C). Our structural and biochemical data reveal that a vRNA- and CTD-bound FluPol can adopt a FluPol(R) conformation and initiate vRNA to cRNA synthesis de novo, and that CTD-binding to the FluPol enhances cRNA synthesis. Importantly, during an ongoing infection the switch from a transcribing FluPol(T) to a replicating FluPol(R) can occur only after de novo synthesised FluPol and NP are imported into the nucleus (Fig. 6D) and an asymmetric FluPol(R)-ANP32A-FluPol(E) complex is assembled, ensuring encapsidation of the nascent viral RNA by the FluPol(E) moiety in conjunction with the NP. Our cell-based and in vitro assays show that the RNAP II CTD and ANP32 jointly enhance cRNA synthesis. The data support a model in which the replicating FluPol(R) remains associated to pS5 CTD repeats while being assembled into a FluPol(R)-ANP32A-FluPol(E) complex (Fig. 6E, F). The CTD is a low complexity disordered region and there is evidence that it drives phase separation and the formation of biomolecular condensates that concentrate RNAP II and transcription regulatory factors52. In infected cells, the RNPA II condensates may in addition concentrate the FluPol and its viral and cellular partners, allowing CTD-bound FluPols to switch efficiently between transcription or replication depending on the relative availability of, e.g. 5’ capped RNAs, NP and/or apo FluPol (Fig. 6G), and perform both activities in a coordinated manner.Fig. 6: A model for RNAP II CTD-anchored transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome.A model for RNAP II CTD-anchored transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome. Upon influenza virus infection, incoming vRNPs are imported into the nucleus and bind to the host RNAP II CTD through bipartite interaction sites on the FluPol (A). This intimate association allows FluPol, in the transcriptase conformation (FluPol(T)), to cleave short capped oligomers derived from nascent RNAP II transcripts in a process referred to as ‘cap-snatching’ to initiate primary transcription of viral mRNAs (B). Polyadenylation is achieved by a non-canonical mechanism involving stuttering of the viral polymerase at a polyadenylation signal (C). The 5′ and 3′ vRNA extremities always remain bound to the polymerase which allows efficient recycling from the termination to the initiation state (C–A). Upon translation of viral mRNAs, de novo synthesised FluPols in an apo state (not viral RNA-bound) and NPs are imported into the nucleus (D). The apo FluPol, in conjunction with the host factor ANP32, associates with the parental CTD-associated FluPol(T) and triggers its conformational transition into a replicating FluPol(R), to form an asymmetric FluPol(R)-FluPol(E) dimer (E) where FluPol(E) is encapsidating the newly synthesised cRNA in conjunction with NP (F). The FluPol(R)-ANP32-FluPol(E) replication complex remains associated to the RNAP II through direct binding of the CTD to FluPol(R). Anchoring of the parental vRNP to the CTD allows it to engage into successive cycles of either viral genome replication or mRNA transcription, depending on the availability of NP, apo FluPol and/or nascent capped oligomers derived from actively transcribing RNAP II (G). Such switching between both activities allows efficient adaptation to waving levels of de novo synthesised vRNP components in the nucleus of an infected cell and is key to ensure a correct balance between genome replication and mRNA transcription.Full size imageAlthough a structure for the asymmetric FluPol(R)-ANP32-FluPol(E) replicase-encapsidase dimer has so far been obtained only for vRNA-bound FluCPol(R), it is generally thought that the same type of asymmetric dimer is formed by a cRNA-bound FluPol(R)18. Therefore, the model proposed for incoming vRNPs (Fig. 6) may possibly be extended to neo-synthesised progeny vRNPs or cRNPs, consistent with vRNA synthesis being detected mostly in the chromatin-associated fractions53,54. In our model, RNPs could, therefore, remain anchored to the same CTD repeats and undergo several rounds of transcription (vRNPs) or genome replication (vRNPs or cRNPs). Progeny RNPs might in turn associate to the same or a close CTD, thereby generating a viral factory for RNA synthesis. Further studies will be needed to investigate the precise relationships between replicating vRNP, cRNPs and host RNAP II, given that cRNPs do not perform ‘cap-snatching’ and require transactivation by an apo FluPol, and could therefore be subjected to different regulatory networks21,41.Our model that the RNAP II CTD provides a recruitment platform for the different types of monomeric and multimeric polymerases raises the question of how the CTD is coordinating transcription versus replication in the context of chromatin in infected cells. Influenza infection was shown to strongly dysregulate RNPA II activities, as evidenced by a decreased RNAP II occupancy in gene bodies downstream of the transcription start site49,55, a widespread RNAP II termination defect and subsequent transcriptional read-through55,56,57, as well as a proteolytic degradation of the RNAP II at late stages of infection58,59. FluPol-binding to the CTD is dependent on S5 phosphorylation22,23,26, and our data show that pS5 CTD-binding is compatible with both transcription and replication activity of the FluPol. Consistently, a large proportion of vRNPs were found to colocalize with pS5 RNAP II at 6 hours post-infection, a stage when viral replication is becoming predominant over transcription55. S5 phosphorylation is considered as the hallmark modification of RNAP II initiation28. Because there is a short time window for the influenza polymerase to gain access to capped nascent RNAP II transcripts before the high affinity nuclear cap-binding complex binds the capped RNA, ‘cap-snatching’ is thought to occur in association with promoter-proximal paused RNAP II22,23,24. However, recent studies show that pS5 CTD can also occur during RNAP II elongation60, and it remains unknown to what extent the CTD phosphorylation dynamics is altered upon influenza infection. Therefore, in principle, pS5 CTD-bound FluPol could perform viral replication in association with initiating and/or elongating RNAP II. Investigating whether or not transcribing and replicating FluPol complexes are associated to the same phosphoforms of the CTD, in terms of complex phosphorylation patterns of residues S2, S5, S7 but also Y1 and P461, and/or localised to the same RNAP II condensates, could help address this question. Moreover, further investigation are required to gain a better understanding of how FluPol transcription and replication complexes interact with the full-length CTD and other RNAP II domains, and to what extent the CTD and/or host factors recruited by the CTD are controlling the balance between transcription and replication. Whether the viral-induced degradation of RNAP II observed at late time-points during influenza infection58,59 could favour the release of neo-synthesised vRNPs from the chromatin and their nuclear export also warrants investigation. Fully addressing these questions will require to overcome technical challenges such as structural analyses on the FluPol in the context of vRNPs and cRNPs, or high-resolution imaging in live-infected cells to visualise the subnuclear localisation of FluPol transcription and replication.MethodsCellsHEK-293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216 and ATCC CRL-11268) were grown in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). MDCK cells (provided by the National Influenza Center, Paris, France) were grown in Modified Eagle’s medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.PlasmidsA/WSN/33 (WSN) ORFs were encoded in pcDNA3.1-PB2, -PB1, -PA and pCI-NP plasmids22,23. The A/Anhui/1/2013 (Anhui-H7N9) pCAGGS-PB2, -PB1, -PA and NP plasmids were kindly provided by R. Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands)62. The B/Memphis/13/2003 ORFs were encoded in pcDNA3.1-PB2 and PA plasmids9. The WSN reverse genetics plasmids were kindly provided by G. Brownlee (Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, UK)63. For vRNP reconstitution assays, a pPolI-Firefly plasmid encoding the Firefly luciferase sequence in negative polarity flanked by the 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions of the IAV NS segment was used and the pTK-Renilla plasmid (Promega) was used as an internal control. For RNA quantifications in vRNP reconstitution assays by strand-specific qRT-PCR a pPR7-WSN-NA reverse genetic plasmid was used64. For the WSN and Anhui-H7N9 pCI-PB1-G1 and pCI-PB1-G2 plasmids used for G. princeps split-luciferase-based protein-protein complementation assays, the PB1 ORF was tagged C-terminally with the G. princeps fragments65. The Anhui-H7N9 PA open-reading frame (ORF) was subcloned into the pCI vector and the PA-X ORF was deleted when indicated by introducing silent mutations at the site of ribosomal frameshifting66. For CTD-binding assays, a C-terminal stretch of RPB1 (108 amino acids) in conjunction with 14 CTD repeats (termed CTD) were tagged C-terminally with the G. princeps fragments34. For ANP32A-binding assays, ANP32A was tagged C-terminally with the G. princeps fragments67. The pCI-mCherry-CTD-WT and mCherry-CTD-S5A plasmids were generated by replacing the G2 sequence in pCI-G2-CTD constructs22. ANP32A encoding the amino acids 1-249 (full-length), 1-199 and 1-149 were subcloned into the pCI vector with a C-terminal V5-tag and SV40 nuclear localisation signals (NLS). DDX5 and RED ORFs were encoded in the pCI vector and tagged N-terminally with the G. princeps fragments38,68. All mutations were introduced by an adapted QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) protocol69. The ORFs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Plasmid sequences are provided as a source data file and are available with annotations at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10462746].Generation of HEK-293T ANP32A and ANP32B knockout cellsCRISPR-Cas9-mediated HEK-293T (ATCC CRL-11268) ANP32A and ANP32B knockout cells (HEK-293T ANP32AB KO) and a control cell line (HEK-293T CTRL) were generated by lentiviral transduction. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting ANP32A (5′-ACCGTCAGGTGAAAGAACTTGTCC-3′ and 5′-AAACGGACAAGTTCTTTCACCTGA-3′), ANP32B (5′-ACCGGGAGCTGAGGAACCGGACCC-3′ and 5′-AAACGGGTCCGGTTCCTCAGCTCC-3′) and a non-targeting control (5′-ACCGGTATTACTGATATTGGTGGG-3′ and 5′-AAACCCCACCAATATCAGTAATAC-3′) were annealed and cloned into the BsmBI site of pSicoR-CRISPR-PuroR (a kind gift from Robert Jan Lebbink70). Replication-incompetent lentiviral particles were generated by transient transfection of HEK-293T cells with the pSicoR-CRISPR-PuroR plasmid harbouring gRNAs targeting either ANP32A, ANP32B or a non-targeting control gRNA as well as with the packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 (gifts from Didier Trono, Addgene plasmids #12259 and #12260, respectively). Supernatants were harvested 72 hpt, centrifuged to remove cellular debris and passed through 0.45 µm sterile filters. Fresh HEK-293T cells were plated in 6 well plates precoated with poly-D-lysine and were infected with 3 ml of lentiviral supernatant by constant centrifugation at 700 g for 40 min in the presence of 10 µg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). At 72 hpi, the medium was exchanged to selection medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin (PAA Laboratories) for one week. Surviving cells were then cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates. Individual cell clones were grown and ANP32A and ANP32B protein levels in cellular lysates of individual clones was assessed by immunoblotting. To generate HEK-293T cells with a double KO for ANP32A and ANP32B, two rounds of targeting were performed.Protein complementation assaysHEK-293T cells were seeded in 96-well white plates (Greiner Bio-One) the day before transfection using polyethyleneimine (PEI-max, #24765-1 Polysciences Inc). Cells were lysed 20-24 hpt in Renilla lysis buffer (Promega) for 45 min at room temperature (RT) under steady shaking. G. princeps luciferase enzymatic activity due to luciferase reconstitution was measured on a Centro XS LB960 microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies, MikroWin Version 4.41) using a reading time of 10 s after injection of 50 µl Renilla luciferase reagent (Promega). Mean relative light units (RLUs) of technical triplicates of G. princeps split-luciferase-based protein-protein complementation assays are represented. In the graphs each dot represents an independently performed biological replicate while at least three experiments were performed in each case. For FluPol-binding assays cells were always co-transfected with plasmids encoding the viral polymerase subunits (PB2, PB1, PA) tagged to one part of the G. princeps luciferase and the target protein tagged to the other part. For FluPol oligomerisation PB2, PA, PB1-G1 and PB1-G2 were co-transfected and when indicated an expression plasmid for mCherry, mCherry-CTD-WT or mCherry-CTD-S5A was added while the total amount of transfected plasmid was adjusted using an empty control plasmid. Plasmid combinations, orientations of tags as well as plasmid quantities used for transfections in a given experiment are available as a source data file.vRNP reconstitution assaysHEK-293T cells were seeded in 96-well white plates (Greiner Bio-One) the day before transfection. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the vRNP protein components (PB2, PB1, PA, NP), a pPolI-Firefly plasmid encoding a negative-sense viral-like RNA expressing the Firefly luciferase and the pTK-Renilla plasmid (Promega) as an internal control. For FluPol trans-complementation assays, equal amounts of expression plasmids expressing the trans-complementing PA mutants were co-transfected. The fold-change shown for FluPol trans-complementation assays represents the increase above the integrated background of the respective FluPol mutants alone. For FluPol activity rescue experiments in HEK-293T ANP32AB KO cells, expression plasmids encoding FL or truncated versions of ANP32A were co-transfected. Firefly luciferase activity due to viral polymerase activity and Renilla luciferase activity due to RNAP II activity were measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The graphs represent viral polymerase activity normalised to RNAP II activity. Luciferase activities were measured in technical duplicates at 20–24 hpt or at 48 hpt when indicated. In the graphs each dot represents an independently performed biological replicate while at least three experiments were performed in each case. For the quantification of mRNA, cRNA and vRNA levels, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding the vRNP protein components (PB2, PB1, PA, NP) and a low amount of WSN-NA RNA expressing plasmid (5 ng/well). Total RNA was isolated at 24 hpt with RNeasy Mini columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RNeasy Kits, Qiagen) and strand-specific RT-qPCRs were performed35. Briefly, total RNA was reverse transcribed using primers specific for NA mRNA, cRNA, vRNA and, when indicated, the cellular glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) with SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and quantified using SYBR-Green (Roche) with the LightCycler 480 system® (Roche, Light Cycler Software 1.5.0.39). RNA levels were normalised to GAPDH when indicated and analysed using the 2−ΔΔCT as described before71. Plasmid combinations and plasmid quantities used for transfections in a given experiment are available as a source data file.Antibodies and immunoblotsTotal cell lysates were prepared in RIPA cell lysis buffer72. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE™ 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were incubated with primary antibodies directed against pS5 CTD (clone 3E8, Active Motif, 1:1000), mCherry (26765-1-AP, Proteintech, 1:000), V5 (SV5-Pk1, Thermo Fisher, 1:5000), Tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:10000), PA73 (1:2500), PB2 (GTX125925, GeneTex, 1:5000), ANP32A (AV40203, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2500), ANP32B (EPR14588, AbCam, 1:2500) and subsequently with HRP-tagged secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). Membranes were revealed with the ECL2 substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce) and chemiluminescence signals were acquired using the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad) and analysed with ImageLab (Bio-Rad). Uncropped gels are provided as a source data file.Production and characterisation of recombinant virusesThe recombinant PA mutant influenza viruses (PA K289A, R454A, K635A, R638A) used for serial cell culture passaging were generated by reverse genetics followed by plaque purification under agarose overlay and one round of viral amplification (P1)23. For the serial passaging, three dilutions of the supernatant collected at passage N (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000) were used to infect MDCK cells at passage N + 1. The supernatant corresponding to one of these dilutions (the lowest dilution that resulted in the infectious titre greater than or equal to titre at passage N) was selected to infect MDCK cells at passage N + 2. These conditions resulted in MOIs in the 0.001 or 0.0001 range, depending on the passages. Upon infection, MDCK cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in DMEM containing TPCK-Trypsin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL. Viral supernatants were titrated on MDCK cells in a plaque assay74. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 µL of viral stocks using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For next-generation sequencing of the full viral genome reverse transcription and amplification of the eight genomic segments were performed using the RT-qPCR protocol adapted by the National Influenza Center (Institut Pasteur)75. Next-generation sequencing was performed by the P2M facility at Institut Pasteur using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina), the NextSeq 500 sequencing systems (Illumina) and the CLC Genomics Workbench 9 software (Qiagen) for analysis. Recombinant viruses with a selected subset of observed second-site mutations were generated by reverse genetics with an adapted protocol76. In brief, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates the day before transfection with the WSN reverse genetics plasmids63 in Opti-MEM (Gibco) using FuGene®6 (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The next day, MDCK were added to the wells in 500 µL Opti-MEM containing 0.5 µg/mL TPCK trypsin (Sigma). The following days, 500 µL Opti-MEM containing 1 and 2 µg/mL TPCK trypsin, respectively, were added. One day later, the supernatants were harvested, centrifuged and stored at −80 °C. The reverse genetics supernatants were titrated on MDCK cells and plaque diameters were measured upon staining with crystal violet using Fiji (ImageJ2 Version 2.3.0/1.3q)77.Influenza virus polymerase Zhejiang-H7N9 (WT, 4 M, PA K289A + C489R)The pFastBac Dual vector encoding for the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 (H7N9) polymerase heterotrimer subunits, PA (Uniprot: M9TI86), PB1 (Uniprot: M9TLW3), and PB2 (Uniprot: X5F427) was used as a starting point (Zhejiang-H7N9 WT)43. The mutations PA E349K, PA R490I, PB1 K577G and PB2 G74R were introduced by a combination of PCRs and Gibson assembly (Zhejiang-H7N9 4 M). A similar approach has been applied to clone the FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 PA K289A + C489R mutant. Plasmid sequences were confirmed by sanger sequencing for each polymerase subunit. All primer and plasmid sequences are available upon request.FluPols Zhejiang-H7N9 (WT/4M/PA K289A + C489R) were produced using the baculovirus expression system in Trichoplusia ni High five cells. For large-scale expression, cells at 0.8-1E06 cells/mL concentration were infected by adding 1% of virus. Expression was stopped 72 to 96 h after the day of proliferation arrest and cells were harvested by centrifugation (1.000 g, 20 min at 4 °C).Cells were disrupted by sonication for 4 min (5 s ON, 20 s OFF, 40% amplitude) on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol) with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After lysate centrifugation at 48.384 g during 45 min at 4 °C, ammonium sulphate was added to the supernatant at 0.5 g/mL final concentration. The recombinant protein was then collected by centrifugation (45 min, 4 °C at 70.000 g), re-suspended in the lysis buffer, and the procedure was repeated another time. FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 was then purified using His60 NiNTA Superflow resin (Takara Bio) from the soluble fraction. Bound proteins were subjected to two sequential washes using (i) the lysis buffer supplemented by 1 M NaCl and (ii) the lysis buffer supplemented by 50 mM imidazole. Remaining bound proteins were eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented by 500 mM imidazole. Fractions with FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 were pooled and directly subjected to a strep-tactin affinity purification (IBA, Superflow). Bound proteins were eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented by 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin and protein-containing fractions were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol) before loading on a third affinity column HiTrap Heparin HP 5 mL (Cytiva). A continuous gradient of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 M NaCl was applied over 15 CV, and FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 was eluted as single species at ~800 mM NaCl. Pure and nucleic acid free FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 was dialysed overnight in a final buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol), concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (50 kDa cutoff), flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further use.Influenza virus nucleoprotein Anhui-H7N9 monomeric mutant (R416A)The influenza virus NP Anhui-H7N9 gene was amplified from a pCAGGS plasmid (gift from Ron Fouchier)62 and introduced by Gibson assembly in a pLIB vector with an N-terminal double strep-tag followed by a human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease cleavage site. The NP R416A mutation was introduced by a combination of PCRs and Gibson assembly. Introduction of the desired mutation was confirmed by sanger sequencing. Monomeric influenza virus Anhui-H7N9 NP R416A was produced using the baculovirus expression system in Trichoplusia ni High five cells. For large-scale expression, cells at 0.8-1E06 cells/mL concentration were infected by adding 1% of virus. Expression was stopped 72–96 h after the day of proliferation arrest and cells were harvested by centrifugation (1.000 g, 20 min at 4 °C).Cells were disrupted by sonication for 4 min (5 s ON, 15 s OFF, 40% amplitude) on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol) with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After lysate centrifugation at 48.384 g for 45 min at 4 °C, the soluble fraction was loaded on a StrepTrap HP 5 mL (Cytiva). Bound proteins were eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented by 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 2 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol) before loading on an affinity column HiTrap Heparin HP 5 mL (Cytiva). A continuous gradient of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 M NaCl was applied over 15 CV, and Anhui-H7N9 NP R416A was eluted as single species at ~500 mM NaCl without nucleic acids (A260/280: 0.6). Pure and nucleic acid free Anhui-H7N9 NP R416A was dialysed overnight in a final buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol) together with N-terminal his-tagged HRV 3C protease (ratio 1:5 w/w). Tag-cleaved Anhui-H7N9 NP R416A was subjected to a last Ni-sepharose affinity to remove the HRV 3C protease, further concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (10 kDa cutoff), flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for later use.Acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32AHuman and chicken ANP32A genes (GeneScript) were introduced in a pETM11 vector with an N-terminal 6xHis-tag followed by a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. ANP32A constructs were expressed in BL21(DE3) E.coli cells. Expression was induced when absorbance reached 0.6, with 1 mM IPTG, incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1.000 g, 20 min at 4 °C).Cells were disrupted by sonication for 5 min (5 s ON, 15 s OFF, 50% amplitude) on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol (BME)) with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After lysate centrifugation at 48.384 g for 45 min at 4 °C, the soluble fraction was loaded on a HisTrap HP 5 mL column (Cytiva). Bound proteins were subjected to a wash step using the lysis buffer supplemented by 50 mM imidazole. Remaining bound proteins were eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented by 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing ANP32A were dialysed overnight in the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM BME) together with N-terminal his-tagged TEV protease (ratio 1:5 w/w). Tag-cleaved ANP32A protein was subjected to a Ni-sepharose affinity column to remove the TEV protease, further concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (3 kDa cutoff) and subjected to a Size-Exclusion Chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. Fractions containing exclusively ANP32A were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (3 kDa cutoff), flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for later use.Human ANP32A truncation constructs (1–199 and 144–249) were generated, expressed and protein purified as previously described ref. 78. The human ANP32A 1-149 construct was a gift from Cynthia Wolberger (Addgene plasmid #6724179) and was expressed and protein purified as previously described78.De novo FluPol replication activitySynthetic vRNA loop (‘v51_mut_S’) (5′-pAGU AGA AAC AAG GGU GUA UUU UCC CCU CUU UUU GUU UCC CCU GCU UUU GCU -3′) (IDT) was used for all in vitro replication activity assays. For all de novo replication activity assays, 2.4 μM FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 (WT or 4 M) were mixed with (i) 0.8 μM v51_mut_S and/or (ii) 8 µM ANP32A and/or (iii) 16 µM pS5 CTD(6mer) (respective molar ratio: 3 FluPols: 1 template: 10 ANP32: 20 pS5 CTD). Reactions were launched at 30 °C for 4 h by adding ATP/GTP/CTP/UTP (AGCU) or only ATP/GTP/CTP (AGC), α-32P ATP (PerkinElmer) and MgCl2 in a final assay buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 100 μM/NTP, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05 μCi/μl α-32P ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding 2X RNA loading dye, heating 5 min at 95 °C and immediately loaded on a 20% TBE-7M urea-polyacrylamide gel. Each gel was exposed on a storage phosphor screen and read with an Amersham Typhoon scanner (Cytiva). For each gel the decade markers system (Ambion) was used.Next generation sequencing of in vitro FluPol replication productsTo confirm the identity of the replication products (full-length cRNA product and stalled cRNA product) and address the discrepancy between expected size and urea-PAGE migration, sequencing of the total reaction product was performed from a de novo FluPol replication assay. 2.4 μM FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 4 M were mixed with (i) 0.8 μM v51_mut_S, (ii) 8 µM ANP32A and (iii) 16 µM pS5 CTD(6mer) (respective molar ratio: 3 FluPols: 1 template: 10 ANP32A: 20 pS5 CTD). Reaction was launched at 30 °C for 4 h by adding ATP/GTP/CTP/UTP and MgCl2 in a final assay buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 100 μM/NTP, 1 mM MgCl2. After completion of the reaction, proteins were removed using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) and 5′-mono-phosphorylated v51_mut_S templates were specifically digested with a terminator 5′-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (Biosearch technologies) and subjected again to the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). Total remaining RNAs were used for next-generation sequencing.Sample concentration and fragment size distribution were checked with the RNA Pico assay (Bioanalyzer, Agilent). 6 ng of sample was treated with 2 units T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 20 min. The treated samples were then taken into library preparation following the Takara SMARTer small RNA sequencing kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 13 cycles of PCR. The final library fragment size distribution was checked with the High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer assay. 8 pM of library was sequenced on a MiSeq to generate 76 bp single-end reads.Resulting total reads (13.073.371) were trimmed using Cutadapt v2.380 with settings recommended by the library preparation kit (-u 3 -a ‘AAAAAAAAAA’) omitting the filter for only reads longer than 20 bases (10.991.864). Trimmed reads were subsequently used as an input for pattern lookup. All reads exactly starting by these motifs have been kept for further analysis: AGCAAAAGCA/GCAAAAGCA/CAAAAGCA/AAAAGCA (7.776.959 reads). Each read starting exactly by these motifs 5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGGG/5′ -GCAAAAGCAGGGG/5′-CAAAAGCAGGGG/5′ -AAAAGCAGGGG were counted and plotted (Fig. 3H). Each read matching the exact sequence of a full-length replication product starting by 5′-AGC AAA…ACU-3′ (51-mer), 5′-_GC AAA… ACU-3′ (50-mer), 5′-__C AAA… ACU-3′ (49-mer) or 5′-___ AAA… ACU-3′ (48-mer) were counted and plotted as percentage (Fig. 3I).Electron microscopySample 1De novo pre-initiation and stalled elongation states were trapped by mixing 2.4 µM FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 4 M with (i) 0.8 µM v51_mut_S, (ii) 8 µM chANP32A, (iii) 16 µM pS5 CTD(6mer) and (iv) 4 µM Anhui-H7N9 NP R416A in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM MgCl2, ATP/GTP/CTP at 100 μM/NTP, and 100 μM of non-hydrolysable UpNHpp (Jena Bioscience).De novo reaction mix was incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 11.000 g and kept at 4 °C before proceeding to grids freezing.For grids preparation, 1.5 µl of sample was applied on each sides of plasma cleaned (Fischione 1070 Plasma Cleaner: 1 min 10 s, 90% oxygen, 10% argon) grids (UltrAufoil 1.2/1.3, Au 300). Excess solution was blotted for 3–5 s, blot force 0, 100% humidity, at 4 °C, with a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher) before plunge-freezing in liquid ethane.Automated data collection for sample 1 was performed on a TEM Titan Krios G3 (Thermo Fisher) operated at 300 kV equipped with a K3 (Gatan) direct electron detector camera and a BioQuantum energy filter, using EPU. Coma and astigmatism correction were performed on a carbon grid. Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a ×105,000 magnification giving a pixel size of 0.84 Å with defocus ranging from −0.8 to −2.0 µm. Gain-normalised movies of 40 frames were collected with a total exposure of ~40 e−/Å2.Sample 2The self-stalled elongation state was trapped using similar method as ‘sample 1’, but with UTP instead of the non-hydrolysable UpNHpp. The subsequent grid preparation and freezing steps are similar.Automated data collection for sample 2 was performed on a TEM Glacios (Thermo Fisher) operated at 200 kV equipped with a F4i (Thermo Fisher) direct electron detector camera and a Selectris X energy filter, using EPU. Coma and astigmatism correction were performed on a carbon grid. Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a × 130,000 magnification giving a pixel size of 0.878 Å with defocus ranging from −0.8 to −2.0 µm. EER movies were collected with a total exposure of ~40 e−/Å2.Sample 3For Zhejiang-H7N9 PA K289A + C489R structures, 0.8 µM FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 PA K289A + C489R was mixed with (i) 0.8 µM v51_mut_S and 16 µM pS5 CTD(6mer) in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. After 1 h incubation on ice, the sample was centrifuged for 5 min, 11.000 g and kept at 4 °C before proceeding to grids freezing.For grid preparation, 1.5 µl of sample was applied on each sides of plasma cleaned (Fischione 1070 Plasma Cleaner: 1 min 10 s, 90% oxygen, 10% argon) grids (UltrAufoil 1.2/1.3, Au 300). Excess solution was blotted for 3–5 s, blot force 0, 100% humidity, at 4 °C, with a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher) before plunge-freezing in liquid ethane.Automated data collection was performed on a TEM Glacios (ThermoFisher) operated at 200 kV equipped with a F4i (ThermoFisher) direct electron detector camera and a Selectris X energy filter, using EPU. Coma and astigmatism correction were performed on a carbon grid. Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a ×130,000 magnification giving a pixel size of 0.907 Å with defocus ranging from −0.8 to −2.0 µm. EER movies were collected with a total exposure of ~40 e−/Å2.Image processingFor the TEM Titan Krios dataset (sample 1), movie drift correction was performed using Relion’s Motioncor implementation, with 7 × 5 patch, using all movie frames81. All additional initial image processing steps were performed in cryoSPARC v3.382. CTF parameters were determined using ‘Patch CTF estimation’, realigned micrographs were then manually inspected and low-quality images were manually discarded. To obtain an initial 3D reconstruction of FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 4 M, particles were automatically picked on few hundreds micrographs using a circular blob with a diameter ranging from 100 to 140 Å. Particles were extracted using a box size of 360 × 360 pixels2, 2D classified and subjected to an ‘ab-initio reconstruction’ job. The best initial model was further used to prepare 2D templates. Template picking was then performed using a particle diameter of 120 Å and particles extracted from dose-weighted micrographs. Successive 2D classifications were used to eliminate particles displaying poor structural features. All remaining particles were then transferred to Relion 4.0. Particles were divided in subset of 300k to 500k particles and subjected to multiple 3D classification with coarse image-alignment sampling using a circular mask of 180 Å. For each similar FluPol conformation, particles were grouped and subjected to 3D masked refinement followed by multiple 3D classification without alignment or using local angular searches. Once particles properly classified, bayesian polishing was performed and re-extracted ‘shiny’ particles were subjected to a last 3D masked refinement. Post-processing was performed in Relion 4.0 using an automatically or manually determined B-factor. For each final map, reported global resolution is based on the FSC 0.143 cut-off criteria. Local resolution variations were estimated in Relion 4.0. Detailed image processing information is shown in Fig. S7.For the TEM Glacios datasets (sample 2 and 3), EER fractionation was set to 24, giving ~1e−/Å2 per resulting fraction. Movie drift correction was performed using Relion’s Motioncor implementation, with 5 × 5 patch81. All additional initial image processing steps were performed in cryoSPARC v4.0 or v4.382. CTF parameters were determined using ‘Patch CTF estimation’, realigned micrographs were then manually inspected and low-quality images were manually discarded. To obtain an initial 3D reconstruction, particles were automatically picked on few hundreds micrographs using a circular blob with a diameter ranging from 100 to 140 Å. Particles were extracted using a box size of 380 × 380 pixels2 (sample 2) or 340 × 340 pixels2 (sample 3), 2D classified and subjected to an ‘ab-initio reconstruction’ job. The best initial model was further used to prepare 2D templates. Template picking was then performed using a particle diameter of 120 Å and particles extracted from dose-weighted micrographs. Successive 2D classifications were used to eliminate particles displaying poor structural features.For sample 2, all remaining particles were subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job followed by a ‘3D classification’ job. Particles in a self-stalled elongation state were then subjected to a last non-uniform refinement. Post-processing was performed in Relion 4.0 using a manually determined B-factor. Reported global resolution is based on the FSC 0.143 cut-off criteria. Local resolution variations were estimated in Relion 4.0. Detailed image processing information is shown in Fig. S9.For sample 3, all remaining particles were subjected to an ‘Heterogeneous refinement’ job, with three symmetrical dimers and three monomers as initial 3D models. Particles from well-resolved dimeric 3D classes were subjected to a final non-uniform refinement. Post-processing was performed in Relion 4.0 using an automatically determined B-factor. Reported global resolution is based on the FSC 0.143 cut-off criteria. Local resolution variations were estimated in Relion 4.0. Detailed image processing information is shown in Fig. S10.Model building and refinementUsing the FluPol Zhejiang-H7N9 elongation complex as starting point (PDB: 7QTL)43, atomic models were constructed by iterative rounds of manual model building with COOT (version 0.9.8) and real-space refinement using Phenix (version 1.20.1)83. Validation was performed using Phenix (version 1.20.1). Model resolution according to the cryo-EM map was estimated at the 0.5 FSC cutoff. Figures were generated using ChimeraX (version 1.6.1)84.StatisticsStatistics were performed with the GraphPad Prism software (Version 9.5.1 (528)), as indicated in the figure legends.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Chris Goldberg/ Flickr cc The two cases were reported in January and are part of an uptick in human H5N1 infections in Cambodia, following a nearly decade-long absence. The WHO also added new details about the infections and investigations. One of the cases was found as part of severe acute respiratory illness surveillance, and the other was identified by a doctor at a site that wasn't in a surveillance network. Exposure to sick birds preceded both infections Both patients had been exposed to sick birds before their symptoms began. Backyard chickens were found dead around the 3-year-old child's house, and the 69-year-old patient had raised domestic birds and fighting roosters, of which three chickens were positive for H5N1. Monitoring and testing of the two patients' contacts yielded no other flu cases, except for an unrelated influenza B infection in one of the older patient's contacts. Risk remains where poultry are infected The two new cases put the number of H5N1 in Cambodia at 8 since 2023. Since the first infections were reported in 2003, the country has reported 64 cases, 41 of them fatal. The WHO said the risk to the general human population from H5N1 viruses remains low and that sporadic human infections will likely continue, especially in rural Cambodia and other countries where the virus is endemic in poultry. The agency urged people to avoid high-risk environments such as live-animal markets and to quickly report unexpected animal deaths to veterinary officials. In countries where avian flu is known to circulate, the WHO recommends wearing respiratory protection and barriers while slaughtering or handling slaughtered poultry. CARB-X funds development of rapid test for gonorrhea News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Diagnostics Gonorrhea The Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X) announced today that it will award biotechnology company Visby Medical of San Jose, California, up to $1.8 million to develop a portable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that can detect gonorrhea and assess its susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Although ciprofloxacin is no longer a recommended first-line antibiotic for infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae because of resistance, some strains of the bacterium remain susceptible to the oral antibiotic. Knowing which infections are susceptible to ciprofloxacin at the point of care could enable clinicians to reserve ceftriaxone, which is the last remaining antibiotic that remains widely effective against N gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is among the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that have been consistently climbing in the United States and other parts of the world over the past several years, and is the second most common bacterial STI. In 2020, roughly 82 million people worldwide reported gonorrhea infections. Need for rapid, accurate tests "The sexually transmitted infections epidemic continues to increase," Gary Schoolnik, MD, chief medical officer of Visby Medical, said in a CARB-X press release. "That is why healthcare providers in [emergency departments], urgent care clinics, community health centers and physicians' offices need accurate and rapid diagnostic tests to enable same-visit, data-driven treatment based on a test result that identifies the pathogen and its antibiotic susceptibility." CARB-X research and development chief Erin Duffy, PhD, said the PCR test should be "rapidly and highly deployable" in low-resource settings. "Additionally, for regions where ciprofloxacin remains a viable treatment, the Visby Medical diagnostic gives confidence that the physician is making the correct treatment decision," she said. The funding will also support development of a test for Chlamydia trachomitis and Trichomonas vaginalis in men based on urine samples. The test is the fourth project, and the first diagnostic, to receive funding from CARB-X's 2022-23 funding call. Since its launch in 2016, CARB-X has supported 95 research and development projects in 13 countries. First CWD case detected in Claiborne County, Mississippi News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Artur Pedziwilk / Flickr cc The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks confirmed the first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Claiborne County yesterday. The agency's CWD dashboard shows that it was one of six new detections in the state. The Claiborne County case was identified west of Port Gibson in the southwest part of the state, about 3 miles from the Mississippi River and 10 miles from CWD-positive Tensas Parish, Louisiana.The other new CWD detections in Mississippi were in DeSoto, Benton, and Marshall counties. The Natchez Democrat reports that a Mississippi State University test found CWD prions (misfolded proteins) in a Claiborne County scrape, or area that bucks defoliate by pawing, in June.CWD is a fatal prion disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease) that affects deer and other cervids. The disease can spread among animals through direct contact or from exposure to prion-infected saliva, blood, feces, or urine.While CWD isn't known to have infected people, health officials urge people to avoid eating contaminated meat and to use precautions when field-dressing deer. FDA removal of decongestants made with ineffective drug would disrupt drug supply chain, experts say News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Resilient Drug Supply Igor Vershinsky / iStock If the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pulls cough and cold medications containing the active ingredient phenylephrine from shelves, it will set off a wave of drug supply chain problems, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Toronto assert today in JAMA. In September 2023, the FDA's Non-prescription Drug Advisory Committee reviewed new data on phenylephrine, concluding that it is ineffective. The committee recommended that the drug, used in many over-the-counter nasal decongestants as a single ingredient or in combination with other ingredients, be removed from the market. For today's study, the researchers analyzed pharmacy and retail-outlet purchases of phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine—the only two nasal decongestants approved by the FDA—from 2012 through 2021 using IQVIA's Multinational Integrated Data Analysis quarterly sales-volume data. Few multi-symptom alternatives available During the study period, 732 unique phenylephrine medications (21 stand-alone, 711 combination products) and 495 pseudoephedrine preparations (54 stand-alone, 441 combination) were on the market. US pharmacies bought 19.8 billion units of phenylephrine products for $3.4 billion and 13.2 billion units of pseudoephedrine preparations for $3.8 billion. Phenylephrine sales declined significantly over time, from 1.68 billion units in 2012 to 0.98 billion units in 2021. A comparable pathway is needed for drugs that are sold over the counter as exists for post-approval monitoring of the risks and efficacy of prescription drugs. The researchers said that if the FDA decides to pull phenylephrine, most multi-symptom products will be unavailable as they undergo reformulation, as few pseudoephedrine alternatives are available. The FDA is requesting public comment before taking any action. In the event of an administrative removal of these products, the authors said clinicians and consumers could substitute oral pseudoephedrine or intranasal decongestants such as phenylephrine or oxymetazoline. "The FDA needs to hold over-the-counter drugs to a standard of effectiveness similar to that of prescription drugs," Timothy Anderson, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a university news release. "A comparable pathway is needed for drugs that are sold over the counter as exists for post-approval monitoring of the risks and efficacy of prescription drugs. This will require a substantial investment in infrastructure to expand capacity." Rhinovirus causes significant number of infant hospital admissions News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Misc Emerging Topics Though respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen associated with infant hospitalization and ventilation worldwide, infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) also make up a significant proportion of hospitalizations for viral bronchiolitis—up to two-thirds that of RSV-related hospital admissions, according to a new research letter in JAMA Network Open. GOLFX / iStock With recent developments with monoclonal antibodies and maternal vaccines, the landscape of infant hospitalizations due to RSV may soon change, the authors write, with RSV-related hospitalizations reduced by more than 80%. Less understood is the role HRV plays in infant hospitalizations. To assess the burden of HRV, the authors looked at a historical cohort of infants hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in Lyon, France, with laboratory-confirmed RSV or HRV infections between 2019 and 2022. From July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2022, a total of 1,122 RSV and 766 HRV infections were identified, meaning the admission rate due to HRV was 68% of the total for RSV. The hospitalization ratio of HRV to RSV days was 51% (3,608 of 7,017 infant-days), and for days of ventilation, 27% (392 of 1,426 infant-days). The temporal distribution showed that HRV-related burden was spread across the year, while RSV-related burden was seasonal. "The temporal distribution showed that HRV-related burden was spread across the year, while RSV-related burden was seasonal," the authors said. "To protect hospital and nonhospital pediatric settings from the devastating effects of multipathogen winter epidemics, efforts must be made to include HRV in the development of multipathogen vaccines and to continue to optimize patient management by developing tailored protocols for home enteral nutrition and home oxygen therapy for infants with moderately severe bronchiolitis," they concluded. Quick takes: US vector-borne illness strategy, Western equine encephalitis in Uruguay, Brazilian H1N1v flu case News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Dengue Heartland Virus Jamestown Canyon Virus Malaria Tick-borne Disease West Nile Zika Amid a rising threat of vector-borne illnesses due to multiple factors, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week published a national strategy to prevent and control the diseases in humans. The strategy was developed by a working group with contributions from 17 federal agencies, HHS said in a press release. Development of the strategy was directed by the 2019 Kay Hagan Tick Act—named after the US Senator who died of complications from a tick-borne illness. Along with identifying challenges and opportunities for improving control of vector-borne threats, the plan details an approach for developing new diagnostics, drugs, and treatments. The CDC has said vector-borne illnesses cases—caused by biting insects like mosquitoes and arachnids like ticks— have doubled in the past two decades because of shifting land-use patterns, increased global travel and trade, and climate change. It has also documented a geographic expansion of the vectors and a growing number of pathogens spread by vectors. "Yet only one vaccine is available to protect people against almost 20 domestic threats," HHS said.The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced that Uruguay has informed it of a human Western equine encephalitis (WEE) case, its first in than more than a decade. The detection follows recent cases in Argentina, which in December confirmed its first infection in more than 20 years. Both countries have reported several outbreaks in horses, which can also contract the disease from mosquitoes that carry the virus. Uruguay's case involves a 42-year-old man from a rural part of San Jose department in the south. His symptoms began in early January. He was hospitalized in intensive care for a few days but has since recovered. Investigators found that he lives in an area with known WEE circulation and the country's highest incidence of cases in horses, though he did not have contact with the animals. Uruguay has reported a rise in equine WEE outbreaks since November 2023.Brazilian health officials have notified the WHO about a variant H1N1 (H1N1v) swine flu case in a man from Toledo in Parana state. According to a WHO notification, the man has underlying medical conditions. He was hospitalized on December 16, 2023. He had no contact with pigs or sick people, and investigators found no other related illnesses among his contacts. The WHO said the case is likely sporadic and poses a low risk of community spread. Genetic analysis found that the virus from the man's sample is very similar to H1N1v viruses from recent human cases in Parana state in recent years, which the WHO said might signal ongoing spread in animals. Brazil has reported sporadic cases involving variant flu strains, but with no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. The virus has been sent to the CDC for further assessment.

Will there be a second wave?The latest trends from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that cases of the flu appear to have leveled off rather than continue their downward trajectory. Lab-positive cases of the flu, one of several indicators that the CDC uses to assess seasonal influenza activity, are stable after trending upward last week. Meanwhile, other key indicators like flu-related hospitalizations and visits to healthcare providers are similar to weeks prior.“We’re not out of the flu woods yet,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Professor of Infectious Disease and Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University.“There’s still plenty of flu out there and the anticipation is, as per usual, we will have flu through February and then it will really begin to taper during March,” he told Healthline.Of course, flu isn’t the only respiratory illness circulating right now either. COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV) are still highly active as well. According to the latest CDC numbers, there have been more than 133,000 emergency department visits nationally due to these three combined. Influenza is still the greatest driver, though, causing roughly 79,000 of those emergency room visits.Is this flu season worse than other years?There’s good reason to expect another bump in flu cases this year. Historically, influenza activity most often peaks in February, before finally falling off.“I don’t have a great crystal ball, but it wouldn’t surprise me if we saw fairly high case numbers through mid-March,” said Dr. Dean Winslow, a Professor of Medicine at Stanford Medicine and infectious disease expert.The 2023-2024 flu season has also been one of the most robust since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2020.Last year’s flu season was also strong, but it peaked much earlier, at the end of November, before crashing precipitously in December and January. This year, the season appears to have peaked in the last week of December. Right now flu cases are much higher than at the same time last year.“In general, the country has seen a diminution in new cases of influenza, but it’s still way above the annual epidemic level. Our influenza cases are down somewhat, but they’re on a plateau, basically. They’re maintaining themselves,” said Schaffner.Where are flu cases concentrated this week? Monitoring the extent and severity of flu season is complex. There are also important regional variations in flu activity across the United States. Southern states including Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, and South Carolina are all showing very high levels of flu activity. Meanwhile, many western states, from Colorado to Oregon show moderate to low levels. In order to establish what a national snapshot looks like, scientists at the CDC have to use a variety of indicators. For example, this week the number of laboratory-confirmed positive influenza cases sits at 15.8%. Out of more than 96,000 tested specimens, about 15,000 of them tested positive for the flu. The percentage of laboratory-confirmed tests has also been relatively stable for the past several weeks.Another indicator, reported flu-related doctor visits, is at 4.4%. That means that out of all cases reported through one of the CDC’s respiratory illness surveillance programs, 4.4% met the definition of an “influenza-like illness” or ILI. An ILI is defined as a fever of 100 degrees or more, accompanied by cough and/or sore throat.Deaths due to the flu have also been falling in recent weeks. There were 222 flu-related deaths in the past week, compared to 490 the week before. What to know about different flu strainsLike all viruses, the flu is prone to mutation, meaning that one flu season will differ from the next in terms of severity of symptoms and transmissibility. While there are four types of influenza viruses (A, B, C, and D), the first two are responsible for the annual flu season epidemic in the United States.Influenza A makes up the bulk of cases year after year, while influenza B makes up a much smaller proportion of illnesses.“There’s an old adage, if you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season. It’s usually the case that influenza B plays a minor role earlier in the annual outbreak and then becomes more prominent as we get through February into March,” said Schaffner.This year’s virus, “influenza A(H1N1)pdm09,” might sound familiar to some readers. That H1N1 designation is one you’ve seen before.“This particular strain of flu is very similar to the H1N1 virus which caused the catastrophic ‘Spanish Flu’ pandemic of 1918-19,” said Winslow.“Interestingly, during the 1918-19 Spanish flu, a lot of cases were seen late in the season also,” he added.H1N1 is a swine flu subtype of influenza A virus that, in addition to the famous 1918 pandemic, was also responsible for an outbreak in 2009-2010. At that time, it is estimated that the virus was responsible for somewhere between 43-89 million cases across 178 countries.How to avoid catching the fluThe number one thing you can do to stay well during this flu season is to get a flu shot. Both Winslow and Schaffner recommend getting one, especially if you fall into a high-risk category. Individuals who are 65 years of age or older, children younger than 5, pregnant, or have certain chronic conditions are considered at higher risk from flu-related symptoms.Other important considerations for staying well include minimizing time spent in large groups indoors and social distancing.The bottom lineFlu season isn’t over yet. Cases are overall down from their peak at the end of December but are still considerably elevated nationally.Cases have plateaued, but February is historically one of the peaks of flu season, and there is the potential for another wave.Experts recommend getting a flu shot, avoiding large indoor group activities, and social distancing to stay safe from the flu this season.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Gigen Mammoser on February 9, 2024 — Fact checked by Sarah Myers, PharmDRead this nextHow to Deal with Flu Season at SchoolMedically reviewed by Daniel Murrell, M.D.The flu virus can easily spread among students and staff in schools.

This flock included 102,000 chickens.Prior to this, the last case of HPAI in a U.S. commercial flock was confirmed on January 25, with that case involving a flock of 13,100 commercial turkeys in Daviess County, Indiana.So far in 2024, the following states have had commercial operations affected by HPAI: Nebraska, Indiana, South Dakota, Kansas, California and Wisconsin.This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in Nebraska in 2024, and the state was able to avoid any commercial flock infections in 2023. Although there were five backyard flock infections in 2023 in Nebraska, backyard flock infections do not have an impact on global poultry trade, according to World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) rules.Nebraska, however, was not as fortunate in 2022. That year, the state lost three commercial layer flocks, two commercial broiler flocks and two commercial upland gamebird flocks. The total bird losses then amounted to more than 6.7 million birds. Only Iowa lost more birds that year, having lost about 15.9 million birds. Nebraska’s 2022 cases were confirmed between April 11 and November 25.“While we are disappointed, we are not surprised, to see another case, as there have been several confirmed HPAI cases in surrounding states,” said Nebraska State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. “Poultry producers need to continue to be vigilant in protecting their flocks. It’s important for producers to know the signs and symptoms of HPAI and to continue to practice good biosecurity measures to help prevent the spread of this disease into their flocks.”View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

In the study published in Nature Communications, the researchers studied ferrets infected with a common respiratory virus such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus, which results in flu-like illness in the animals. One month after full recovery, animals received a non-lethal strain of canine distemper virus (CDV), which is closely related to human measles virus and causes a measles-like disease in ferrets. Two weeks later, animals developed lethal hemorrhaging pneumonia. “Acute lung failure after consecutive infection with two non-lethal respiratory viruses was unprecedented,” said Richard Plemper, senior author of the study, Regents’ Professor in the Georgia State Institute for Biomedical Sciences and director of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research. “We found that these animals did not succumb to the viral infection, but to bacterial pneumonia because they became unable to prevent lung invasion by commensal bacteria.” Screening for differences in gene expression between animals that had been infected with influenza virus or not, the study found that canine distemper infection results in expression of a group of protective host proteins in the lung called trefoil factors. “When the animals had recovered from influenza, trefoil factors were not upregulated, leaving the animals unprotected against normally harmless bacteria,” said Robert Cox, assistant professor in the Center for Translational Antiviral Research and first author of the study. “Usually, these animals would recover, but when exposed to CDV, this decrease in the levels of protective host proteins resulted in the development of severe bacterial pneumonia.” Using an experimental antiviral drug, GHP-88309, that Plemper has developed in recent work, they were able to prevent lethal bacterial pneumonia even when treatment was started very late after CDV infection. “We currently do not know whether measles virus causes enhanced disease when following unrelated earlier viral infections, but it very much adds to the concerns related to the resurgence of measles that we have seen in recent years globally,” Plemper said. “Measles is frequently followed by bacterial otitis media or bacterial pneumonia. Viral disease history of a child could be an underappreciated risk factor for developing these secondary sequelae.” “In addition to discovering that previous infections may play a critical role in disease severity, we were able to experimentally identify the window of opportunity to treat these viral infections and prevent the long-term immune suppression associated with measles-like disease,” Cox said. The researchers demonstrate benefit of treatment with GHP-88309 for over seven days after the window for therapeutic vaccination has closed, “which introduces a novel additional option to mitigate severe complications of measles-like disease,” Plemper said.

Wild bird migration is currently acknowledged as an important ecological process contributing to the global dispersal of HPAIV H5. However, this mechanism has not been quantified using bird movement data from different species, and the timing and location of exposure of different species is unclear. We sought to explore these questions through phylodynamic analyses based on empirical data of bird movement tracking and virus genome sequences of clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.3.2.1. First, we demonstrate that seasonal bird migration can explain salient features of the global dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4. Second, we detect synchrony between the seasonality of bird annual cycle phases and virus lineage movements. We reveal the differing exposed bird orders at geographical origins and destinations of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage movements, including relatively under-discussed orders. Our study provides a phylodynamic framework that links the bird movement ecology and genomic epidemiology of avian influenza; it highlights the importance of integrating bird behavior and life history in avian influenza studies.

In contrast to previous clades of the A/goose/Guangdong/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage, there have also been more persistent spillovers to local domestic poultry2,3,4,5,6, impacting the poultry farming industry. Despite no onward human-to-human transmission to date, occurrences of zoonotic jumps to humans pose potential threats to public health7,8,9,10,11,12.Plausible ecological mechanisms for the global movement of HPAIVs include the live poultry trade and wild bird migration13,14. Endemic in Asia, clade 2.3.2.1 spread throughout the Eurasian and African continents (Fig. S2). Since its outbreak in wild birds at Qinghai Lake in 200515, studies have shown that viral dispersal at long distances is related to wild bird migration16,17. Global dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4 continues to provide virological, epidemiological, and ecological evidence in support of the critical role of migratory wild birds in HPAIV spread and evolution at a global-scale. Compared to previous clades, clade 2.3.4.4a during 2014/15 outbreaks was less pathogenic to some species while being more effectively transmitted18,19,20, possibly enabling infected birds to migrate between continents. Subsequent phylodynamic work confirmed that the introduction of clade 2.3.4.4a into Europe and North America most likely occurred via long-distance flights of infected migratory birds21. During the 2016/17 outbreaks, the major circulating clade 2.3.4.4b was more transmissible22 and more virulent23, related to multiple internal genes22,23 and potentially their frequent reassortments3,4,5. Later phylogenetic analysis showed a clear link between the reassortments and migratory birds, as most reassorted gene segments were from migratory wild birds and originated at dates and locations that corresponded to their hosts’ migratory cycles24. Integrating host movement in studying HPAIV dispersal is important, though challenging. One challenge is insufficient bird movement data, which limited previous global-scale studies21 in accounting for the high variation in bird behaviors across species and locations.Another challenge of studying HPAIV dispersal in wild birds is the lack of HPAIV prevalence data. Only a few studies document longitudinal HPAIV prevalence in wild bird populations25. Compared to HPAIV, low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) has better long-term surveillance of infections or seroprevalence and related avian host ecology in disparate bird habitats, e.g., the United States Geological Survey surveillance of birds in Alaska26. While longitudinal records provide insights into the role of life history and ecology of local bird communities in LPAIV circulation27, their conclusions are limited to local dynamics and cannot be easily generalized. To resolve this challenge, ideally, we should have systematic global surveillance for HPAIV. However, this is impossible due to resource constraints.Instead, we could design effective surveillance strategies by identifying exposed avian species and high-risk geographical regions. Recently, researchers have addressed these questions at a higher taxonomic level to include more diverse species. For example, Hill et al. compared the different roles of species within the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in the dispersal and spillover of AIVs28. They concluded that wild geese and swans are the main source species of HPAIV H5, while gulls spread the viruses most rapidly. Hicks et al. found that the inter-species transmission of AIVs in North America is positively associated with the overlap of habitats, suggesting the importance of local bird community diversity29. However, they did not use empirical bird movement data. Furthermore, given the heterogeneous biogeographical pattern of bird migrations, identifying geographical hotspots requires linking global and local scales.To fill this gap, we here focus on two questions related to the contributions of birds, locally and globally, to the spatiotemporal dynamics of HPAIV H5 viruses; specifically, i) how does seasonal bird migration facilitate global virus dispersal and ii) which avian species are exposed to HPAIV H5 and where? To explore these questions, we first illustrate the global circulation history of clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017; 2018–2023) and clade 2.3.2.1 (2010–2017) using time-scaled phylogeographic analyses of hemagglutinin (HA) genes of HPAIVs sampled from wild birds and poultry. The split of clade 2.3.4.4 data is based on its history of evolution, epidemiology and sampling intensity, enabling us to maintain the genetic diversity of the dataset while keeping the computational burden manageable. Building upon previous evidence, we propose possible routes of long-distance virus dispersal. We acknowledge two caveats. First, while we only included HA, the neuraminidase (NA) and internal genes contribute to virus evolution, e.g., via reassortment24 and the major circulating subtype shift from H5N8 to H5N1 in clade 2.3.4.4. Second, the geographical bias of virus sampling has a strong impact on the virus lineage movement routes, especially for locations under-sampled. Based on the estimated routes and inferred virus dispersal history, we quantify the contribution of seasonal bird migrations to global virus dispersal and evolution. Second, we model the monthly geographical distribution of bird orders using species distribution models based on environmental factors and bird tracking data. We evaluate the risks of bird orders being exposed to HPAIV H5 at geographical origins and destinations of virus lineage movement by analyzing the statistical association of local bird distributions and virus lineage migration. Our study provides an approach that integrates bird migration ecology in HPAIV epidemiological studies to disentangle the mechanisms of interaction between HPAIV and wild birds.ResultsSeasonal bird migration associates with global HPAIV H5 dispersalIs the wide geographical range of HPAIV H5 caused by frequent introductions from one region to another, or a single introduction resulting in subsequent spread within the area? The discrete trait phylogeographical analysis of clade 2.3.4.4 HA genes (before 2018) exhibits scarce virus lineage movements between aggregated regions, most of which are unidirectional (Fig. 1B). It suggests that inter-regional viral introductions over long geographical distance occur at low frequency and in one direction. Furthermore, the sequences are highly clustered by region, implying viral persistence within each region after introduction. Clade 2.3.2.1 shows a similar pattern (Fig. S8). In contrast, clade 2.3.4.4 after 2018 (Fig. 1C) presents more mixed virus lineage movements between regions, suggesting more frequent dispersal between regions. In addition, the trunk composition of the phylogeny shows that most virus diversity is contained in Russia, Africa and Europe. While the two trees of clade 2.3.4.4 (before and after 2018) have shared branches (Fig. 1A), the resulting correlation does not qualitatively affect the subsequent analysis (Fig. 2, Fig. S4).Fig. 1: The evolutionary history of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.3.2.1.A Time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree of clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2023).

The phylogeographic GLM estimates were obtained from n = 1845, 1844, and 1163 viral sequences sampled over 12, 10, and 11 locations for clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023), 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017), and 2.3.2.1, respectively. The light blue, darker blue, and red colors indicate clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023), 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017), and 2.3.2.1, respectively.Full size imageTo test quantitatively whether seasonal bird migration is a key predictor of HPAIV H5 dispersal, we fit a generalized linear model (GLM) parameterization of the discrete phylogeography using a Bayesian model selection procedure30,31. Concurrently, we consider seasonal bird migration, live poultry trade and poultry population size as covariates of the diffusion rates between regions. To incorporate the potential seasonal difference in viral dispersal, we model a time-heterogeneous phylogenetic history32 with three seasons based on bird annual cycle in North Hemisphere: non-migration (mid-November to mid-February, mid-May to mid-September), spring migration (mid-Feburary to mid-May) and fall migration (mid-September to mid-November). Fig. 2 shows the posterior estimates of the inclusion probabilities and conditional effect sizes (on a log scale) of the covariates. It reveals that seasonal bird migration is the dominant driver of the global virus lineage movements of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4. This is shown by both the log conditional effect size of the seasonal bird migration (for clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017), mean log conditional effect size [95% highest probability density interval, HPDI]:~2.35 [0.87, 3.85]; clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023):~4.71 [3.60, 6.22]) and the statistical support for its inclusion (for clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017), posterior probability (PP) ~ 0.88 and Bayes factor (BF) ~ 56; clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023), PP ~ 1 and BF > 16565).In contrast, poultry population size and the international live poultry trade are not strongly or not consistently associated with the inter-region dispersal of HPAIV H5 (Fig. 2). This is also evident in both the effect size and the statistical support, e.g., the log conditional effect size of the live poultry trade (for clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017):~0.62 [0.19, 1.17]; clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023):~0.35 [0.08, 0.66]) and the statistical support for its inclusion (for clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017), PP ~ 0.60 and BF ~ 12; clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023), PP ~ 0.11 and BF ~ 1). For clade 2.3.2.1, neither wild bird migration nor live poultry trade is a major contributing predictor for the inter-regional virus lineage movements.The viral sample size at origin location might affect the results (clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017):~−1.22 [−1.75, −0.68], PP ~ 1 and BF > 2647; clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023):~−0.86 [−1.13, −0.05], PP ~ 0.99 and BF ~ 866; clade 2.3.2.1: ~ −1.52 [−1.85, −1.19]), PP ~ 1 and BF > 16,565. Unfortunately, because of the imprecision of host species records, it is challenging to down-sample the data while maintaining genetic diversity. Nevertheless, when controlling for viral sample size at the origin location and directly comparing wild bird migration and live poultry trade, the wild bird migration is clearly supported over the live poultry trade (Table S2). Based on these results, we used subsequent analyses to understand the importance of different bird species at the order taxonomy level in the global dispersal and local emergence of HPAIV H5.Exposed migratory bird orders at origin and destination regions of HPAIV H5 virus lineage movementWe identified virus dispersal routes (Bayes factor > 3) between the aggregated regions in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 3A) using the previous phylogeography analyses. Seasonality is reflected in northward and southward virus lineage movements of clade 2.3.4.4. Furthermore, it overlaps well with the bird migration seasonality. Before 2018, most virus lineage movements (14 of 20) show a single temporal peak (Figs. S3.3–3.4, 3A). The peaks of the northward routes overlap with spring bird migration and/or wintering period (upper rows of Fig. 3A, Fig. S3.3). Only one route (Japan-Korea to USA-Canada) overlaps with the summer breeding period. Most southward virus lineage movements peak during the Fall bird migration period, although some peaks continue in November when birds might still be migrating along some routes (lower half of Fig. 3A, Fig. S3.4). Only one route (Europe to Qinghai) overlaps with the wintering period. In summary, in the Northern Hemisphere, virus lineage movements from south to north occur mainly during the wintering period and spring bird migration, while southward virus lineage movements occur mainly during the fall migration period when birds fly to the south. Since 2018, southward virus lineage movements have expanded the time period to late summer and early winter in addition to fall (Fig. S3.6); northward virus lineage movements shift to mainly spring and summer (Fig. S3.5).Fig. 3: The synchrony of virus lineage movements between regions and bird distribution probability at the regions.A Probability density distribution of the virus lineage migration throughout the year, between locations summarized from the discrete trait phylogeography of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4 and the Markov jump counts (Section “Discrete trait phylogeography of HPAIVs and counts ofvirus lineage migration”). X axis: Virus lineage migration dates in a year; Y axis: origin region - destination region of the virus lineage migration. The width of the violins represents the virus lineage migration probability density. Non-breeding (blue), migration (yellow) and breeding (red) bird annual cycle phases in general are shown in the south-north migration direction and in the north-south migration direction. Boxes around bird photos show the statistically significant correlation of virus lineage movements and bird order distribution at origin, destination or both regions. We used the following images of bird species from the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology: Pandion haliaetus haliaetus (ML523577271) and Cygnus olor (ML72775261). Abbreviations of locations are the same as in Fig. 1. B Schematic diagram of cross-correlation analyses of virus lineage movement between two locations (O: origin, D: destination) and the bird distribution probability at each location. Block bootstrapping was used to calculate confidence intervals and two-tailed p values. See details in Methods “Discrete trait phylogeography of HPAIVs and counts ofvirus lineage migration”.Full size imageThis association of seasonality in bird migration and HPAIV H5 lineage movement of clade 2.3.4.4 implies that breeding grounds might be potential pools of HPAIV H5 genetic diversity for southward virus lineage movements associated with bird migration; wintering grounds might play a similar role for the northward viral lineage movements. Additionally, the results show more virus lineage movements during the fall migration (Southward Markov Jump counts: 11.71 ([8, 16] 95% HPDI, before 2018) and 78.76 ([68, 89], 2018–2023) per month, September-November) than the spring migration (Northward Markov Jump counts: 9.83 ([6, 14], before 2018) and 1.15 ([1, 3], 2018–2023) per month, March-May). Virus lineage movements also have higher relative frequency during the fall migration (shown in the higher peak in Fig. 3). Interestingly, birds also migrate in a larger abundance in the fall than during spring, as the population size becomes larger after breeding.In contrast, for clade 2.3.2.1, virus lineage movements show no seasonal variation across the year (Fig. S3.1–3.2). This difference might be due to the fact that largely wild birds contribute to the virus genetic diversity of clade 2.3.4.4, while that of 2.3.2.1 is not (Fig. S1); this suggests that clade 2.3.4.4 might be endemic in wild birds in some regions, i.e., wild birds might serve as the reservoir.Which bird orders might be exposed to HPAIV H5 at the origin or destination regions of virus lineage movements? To explore this question, we examined the synchrony of bird migration and virus lineage movements by testing the correlation between the 2 monthly time series. We then used block bootstrapping to test the statistical significance (See Methods). Along some routes, virus lineage movement frequency is correlated with monthly bird order distribution of the origin/destination location (Table S3). We assume that the bird population’s birth and mortality are stable, and there is no external intervention. Therefore, the change in bird distribution probability is only due to a positive net flux of incoming individuals through migration or a negative net flux of individuals via migration outside a given area. We highlight the following results for clade 2.3.4.4 between 2018 and July 2023 (Fig. S7, Table S3): Southern migration of Ciconiiformes from Europe synchronizes with more frequent viral dispersal from Europe to Africa (r = −0.47, 97.5% confidence intervals, CI: [−0.65, −0.29], p = 3.58 × 10−5), suggesting that Ciconniformes might be exposed to clade 2.3.4.4 when they start migrating south from Europe. Southern migration of Passeriformes to Africa synchronizes with more frequent viral dispersal from Western Asia to Africa (r = 0.52, 97.5% CI: [0.33, 0.79], p = 5.38 × 10−5), suggesting that Passeriformes might be exposed to the viruses when they migrate south to Africa. Northern migration of Pelecaniformes from Japan/Korea synchronizes with more frequent viral dispersal from Japan/Korea to Russia (r = −0.32, 97.5% CI: [−0.46, −0.03], p = 8.96 × 10−5), suggesting that Pelecaniformes might be exposed to the viruses when they migrate north from Japan/Korea. For clade 2.3.4.4 before 2018, we detected two virus lineage movement routes, both in Asia, with Anseriformes and Accipitriformes as exposed bird orders, respectively (Fig. 3, Table S3). We do not detect bird orders associated with virus lineage movements of clade 2.3.2.1 (Table S3). Although we cannot conclude any causal relationship from current analyses, the synchrony of virus lineage movement and bird migration suggests the birds might be exposed at the origin/destination location. Future work needs to be conducted to understand the casual relationship.DiscussionHere, we report a phylodynamic analysis linking the spatial ecology of avian hosts and HPAIV H5 virus lineage movements. Our results support previous findings on the important role of bird migration in disseminating HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.421. We found that the seasonal wild bird migration network is associated with the global diffusion and evolutionary dynamics of HPAIV H5. A previous study found that the 2014/2015 outbreaks of HPAIV H5 in Europe and North America were likely introduced by wild bird migration21 by comparing the inferred ancestral host-type and location traits of the viral genome sequences21. Our study advances this finding by directly integrating the bird migration network into the virus phylogeographic reconstruction. In addition, we found that the inter-regional live poultry trade is not associated with the global HPAIV H5 dispersal, consistent with previous studies13,21. The same previous study found that the international poultry trade’s direction is opposite to the global spread direction of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.421. Another study demonstrated large-scale H5N1 transmission dynamics are structured according to different bird flyways and driven by the Anatidae family, while the Phasianidae family, largely representing poultry, is an evolutionary sink13.Our results provide insights into relatively under-studied bird orders that may be relevant to HPAIV H5 dispersal. Historically, studies of host-pathogen interaction of AIV have focused on Anseriformes as wild bird hosts. However, many other under-studied orders have been affected by clade 2.3.4.4 recently33,34. Interaction of different avian orders might contribute to virus dispersal and local persistence28. A previous study showed that host origins of HPAIV H5 reassorted genes include Anseriformes, other groups of wild birds, and domestic poultry24. Our results highlight the exposure risk of specific under-studied bird orders in addition to Anseriformes, including Accipitriformes, Ciconiiformes, Passeriformes, and Pelecaniformes. Particularly, Passeriformes are rarely considered in avian influenza studies. It is possible that when Passeriformes have migrated south to Africa, they might be exposed to avian influenza from interacting or sharing habitat with the waterfowls in Africa, as Asia-Eastern Africa is a major migratory flyway where waterbirds, Passeriformes and other species migrate from Asia to Eastern Africa for wintering. However, due to the use of light-level geolocators (GLS) in some Passeriformes tracking studies, our results might be geographically inaccurate given the coarse spatial resolution (~200 km) of GLS location estimates35.Our results also highlight the seasonal pattern of virus dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4. Despite the low relative frequency of virus lineage movements during summer breeding and wintering, they may serve as a gene pool for following virus lineage movement during the migration. A previous study emphasizes the important role of the breeding period in inter-species virus transmission in North America29. Previous surveillance also shows that LPAI prevalence in waterfowls is higher during the wintering period of Eurasian migratory birds in Africa36. Interestingly, clade 2.3.2.1 does not show seasonality in virus lineage movements. The non-seasonal pattern might be because domestic poultry contributes to the virus genetic diversity more than wild birds for clade 2.3.2.1 (Fig. S1), while wild birds contribute much more to the reassortment of the viruses for clade 2.3.4.4 (Fig. S1,24). The difference also suggests that clade 2.3.2.1 might not be endemic in wild birds, while wild birds might be the reservoir for clade 2.3.4.4.By comparing clade 2.3.4.4 before 2018 and after (Fig. S4), our results suggest wild bird migration might be the same mechanism for geographical global dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4 throughout the years; differently, the viruses have become endemic in birds in wider geographical regions since 2018, and breeding time might have become more important in virus dispersal.Caveats. First, our data in bird tracking are much limited in species diversity due to low data availability in the tracking community (37). Despite variations in migration behaviors within bird orders, with the data, we are not able to account for the variations. Thus, it should be cautioned that not all species within the bird order we found relevant to the virus lineage movements may be exposed to HPAIV H5. Nevertheless, our tracking data are relevant for avian influenza circulation: the families we use in tracking data (Supplementary Dataset 2) included major wild bird species that have been sampled avian influenza viruses (Table S1). In addition, currently available tracking data may be more abundant in individuals that are easier to capture. Despite the use of the species distribution model to account for the empirical data bias, the uneven abundance of tracking data in species makes the model more accurate for species that are represented by better data. We are also not able to include the migration volume of birds in the migration network (Fig. S6). With the increasing availability of bird tracking data, our framework can further study the association of birds at the species level and virus lineage movements; we may find more associated species that are relatively under-studied; and we can also advance our binary bird migration network by integrating comprehensive bird movement models38,39.Secondly, the virus genome data are biased geographically and in host species. The under-sampling of viruses in some areas hugely impacted the inferred phylogeography. For example, we cannot conclude if the inferred viral lineage movement from Europe to Qinghai or Japan-Korea occurs directly or if geographically proximate areas, e.g., central Eurasia, are middle stops of the movement due to under-sampling in central Eurasia. Despite including sampling size in the phylogeographical analysis, we cannot adjust the geographical sampling biases due to the unknown magnitude of infections at locations. Therefore, our results might biased in highlighting the regions with better virus sampling. Fortunately, the sampling efforts in some historically under-sampled and no-sampled areas are growing, e.g., in Australia40. In the future, given more extensive and evenly sampled spatial data, we may find historically under-studied regions have risks of virus lineage movements. To avoid the effect of geographical sampling bias in phylogeography (although not for no sampling areas), our framework can also easily adapt structured coalescent methods, e.g., MASCOT41, when being applied to less geographical locations or less sequence data. In addition to the geographical sampling bias in virus genome data, our results may be affected by poultry-sampled viruses. To preserve genetic diversity, we included virus samples from domestic poultry when inferring virus diffusion. Therefore, some patterns in the results could reflect virus transmission between domestic poultry and spillover from wild birds to poultry rather than bird migratory patterns. In the future, with better-recorded host species in virus genome data, we can better understand the interaction and contribution of poultry and wild birds in virus evolution and dispersal, including hosts’ contribution to reassortment. Currently, we only considered the HA gene when inferring AIV diffusion and evolution. HA is a key gene in influenza viruses, as it is the receptor-binding and membrane fusion glycoprotein of influenza virus and the target for infectivity-neutralizing antibodies42. However, the reassortment events of all internal genes are also important in the dispersal and evolution of HPAIV H524.Finally, when analyzing the statistical association between bird distribution and virus lineage movements, we do not include time lags between the two time series. Therefore, some bird orders that synchronize with virus lineage movements with time lags may not be detected in our current analyses. Those birds may be exposed to the viruses because of inter-species transmission or environmental transmission if they are possible transmission routes among the birds - it should be noted, however, that currently, little is known about the mechanisms of transmission in wild birds, particularly inter-species transmission among seabirds. With finer-scale bird tracking data on movements other than migratory movements43, future studies could better integrate avian biology in understanding the inter-species transmission mechanism. With longitudinal bird tracking data at locations and virus sampling from the birds, our analysis framework could be advanced to understand the time lags of the synchrony and different roles of bird species in HPAIV H5 dispersal (Table S4). Another limitation in our methods is that bird migration networks in our analyses are binary. Therefore, when we model a non-bird-migration time period in Fig. 2, the binary network does not represent no migration; instead, it represents that all the relative migration rates between locations are the same.In conclusion, allocating more resources for global surveillance of avian influenza viruses in wild birds would enhance our ability to tackle the challenges of more virulent and transmissible HPAIV H5 spreading in wild birds. To achieve this goal, it is critical to understand “where and in which bird species surveillance is most needed and could have the greatest impact”14. Given sufficient data in the future, our framework could help conservation and public health policy-making in designing monitoring and surveillance strategies. More collaboration is needed between ornithologists, movement ecologists, bird conservation experts, avian influenza epidemiologists, disease ecologists and virologists on many aspects, including collaborative data collection/surveillance of AIV and data sharing. For example, if studies were to simultaneously obtain the movement tracking of bird populations and their serology and virology surveillance data, then they could link the bird movement directly with the virus transmission and dispersal. In addition, we need more AIV samples from water bodies to better understand environmental transmission. With such data, we would be able to understand the viral transmission at local scales and therefore develop disease models for bird conservation and potential zoonotic threats.MethodsViral sequence data and time-scaled phylogeny of HPAIVsTo infer the phylogeny of avian influenza HPAIV H5 viruses, we accessed sequences of HA genes, NA genes and six internal gene segments from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data44,45,46). Using the sequences, we estimated a maximum likelihood phylogeny (Fig. S1) for each gene segment, respectively, under a GTR+Γ nucleotide substitution model, with the randomly selected strains as representatives, by FastTree v2.1.447. Genotypes of internal gene segments (Fig. S1) were defined by clustering patterns with background sequences in a previous study48. On the phylogeny, the viruses with internal genes from wild birds, e.g., clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 2.3.4.4, showed wider geographical spread21,49, compared to poultry viruses, e.g., clade 2.3.4.1 and clade 2.2, despite the high similarity of their HA genes. This demonstrates the importance of gene reassortment in the evolution and transmission of HPAIVs.In this study, we focus on clade 2.3.4.4 and clade 2.3.2.1. We inferred their time-scaled phylogenies of HA genes. Before the inference, to test for the presence of phylogenetic temporal structure, we generated a scatterplot of root-to-tip genetic divergence against sampling date by TempEst v1.550. Strong phylogenetic temporal structure was detected in the phylogeny of each clade (Fig. S5). The final datasets were i) 1163 HA sequences of clade 2.3.2.1; ii) 1844 HA sequences of clade 2.3.4.4 (2010–2017); iii) 1845 HA sequences of clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023, after down-sampling). For clade 2.3.4.4 (2018–2023), we randomly down-sampled over-represented locations (with sequences more than 250) to 262 for each location to get a similar size of sequences across locations and to get a similar size of total sequences as previous clade 2.3.4.4. The spatial and temporal distribution of the sequences is shown in Fig. S2.Time-resolved HA phylogenies were estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST v1.10.451 with the BEAGLE library52. We used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model53, the SRD06 nucleotide substitution model54 and the Gaussian Markov random field Bayesian Skyride coalescent tree prior55. For each dataset, MCMC chains were run for 300 million (clade 2.3.2.1) and 400 million (clade 2.3.4.4) generations with burn-in of 10%, sampling every 10,000 steps. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked with Tracer v1.756. A set of 1000 trees for each clade was subsampled from the MCMC chain and used as an empirical tree distribution for the subsequent analysis.Animal mobility networks and their contribution to HPAIV phylogeographyThe bird migration network (Fig. S6) was summarized by searching publicly available migration data on Movebank. An edge between two locations in the network exists if any migration tracking record shows bird migration originating from the start location to the end location. The location-wise live poultry trade values were summed up from country-wise import and export of the live poultry recorded on United Nations Comtrade Database (comtrade.un.org/data/). We accessed the total net weight and trade value from 1996 to 2016 of live poultry, including fowls of the species Gallus domesticus, ducks, geese, turkeys and guinea fowls. Since there are no accessible data of the within-country poultry trade in China, we adapted the inferred poultry trade accessibility between provinces of China from a previous study57. Based on the ratio of the inferred accessibility and the empirical trade value between Hong Kong SAR and mainland China, we scaled all the accessibility to the trade value flows among Qinghai, North China and South China.With the summarized seasonal-varying bird migration network, we statistically quantified the contribution of wild bird migration to avian influenza virus dispersal. We applied the GLM extended Bayesian phylogeography inference31 with the 1000 empirical trees as the input. The aggregated locations in the previous discrete trait phylogeography were still used. The epoch model32 was used to account for the time heterogeneity of the contribution. For each clade and each predictor group, MCMC chains were run for 100 million generations with burn-in of 10%, sampling every 10,000 steps. Similarly, we assessed the convergence of the chains in Tracer v1.756.Wild bird movement tracking and distribution modelingTo assemble the global wild bird observation data, we accessed the worldwide bird tracking data from Movebank in 2021. This dataset amassed from 53 studies across the world58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131. The Movebank study ID, name, principal investigator, and contact person are listed in Supplementary Dataset 2. The dataset is collected by various research groups, and by various sensors, including Global Position System (GPS), Argos, bird ring, radio transmitter, solar geo-locator, and natural mark. It covers over 3542 individual birds (class: Ave), including ten orders and 95 species (Supplementary Dataset 2). For further modeling the migration of the wild birds belonging to different orders, we excluded the observation data on Movebank of Cuculiformes, Caprimulgiformes, Strigiformes, Columbiformes, Phoenicopteriformes, Piciformes, Sphenisciformes, and Procellariiformes, given their paucity and geographically restricted distribution. Additionally, we accessed GPS tracking data of 193 individuals, including 5 orders and 12 Species between 2006 and 2019 in China from a previous study (ref. 132). Accordingly, we combined the data from China with those on Movebank (Supplementary Dataset 2) and finalized a bird observation dataset consisting of 10 orders and 96 species.To model the wild bird distribution throughout a year, we developed a model framework based on the species distribution model (SDM). The response variable of the model is bird occurrence (1: presence; 0: pseudo-absence). The independent variables are 20 well-studied environmental predictors133,134,135,136,137 (Table S1). We divide the globe into 1-km resolution geographical cells for each month. For each cell, the value of the dependent variable is 1 if there is any observation of an individual in the target order in that month in the bird tracking data, otherwise 0. Furthermore, to infer the probability of bird occurrence between 0 and 1 for each cell, we trained a XGBoost binary classification model138 for each bird order, respectively. The method is adapted from a previous bird migration model139. We used true-presence and pseudo-absence data (marked as 1 and 0 respectively). We fitted the distribution of birds which manifest as true-presence data and pseudo-absence data. We randomly divided 67% of the data as the training set and the other 33% as the test set. The model finally outputs the probability of the distribution of migratory birds in each month across years. The accuracy was evaluated by the area under the curve in a test set of the ten orders: Pelecaniformes (0.97), Gruiformes (0.97), Passeriformes (0.97), Suliformes (0.98), Ciconiiformes (0.92), Falconiformes (0.98), Charadriiformes (0.94), Anseriformes (0.90), Accipitriformes (0.90). The modeled wild bird distribution was applied in the subsequent analysis to identify key bird orders associated with the global viral dispersal (see Methods) and local virus emergence.Discrete trait phylogeography of HPAIVs and counts of virus lineage migrationBased on empirical phylogenies, we used a non-reversible discrete-state continuous-time Markov chain model and a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach30 to infer the viral diffusion among locations: i) the most probable locations of the ancestral nodes in the phylogeny and ii) the history and rates of lineage movement among locations30. Sampled countries were divided into 10 locations: Africa, Central Asia, Europe, Japan-Korea, North China, South China, Qinghai, Russia, Southeast Asia and USA-Canada. This regional categorization was done according to the major wild bird breeding areas. Furthermore, to estimate the viral gene flows between locations, we used a robust counting approach140,141 to count virus lineage migration events. The basic idea is to count the expected number of lineage movements (Markov jumps) between the locations along the phylogeny branches, as applied in previous studies142,143,144,145,146. The count of virus lineage migration events was used for further analysis below. We also summarized monthly frequency distribution of the virus lineage migration for each pathway (Fig. S3).To target the key bird orders for each location, we explored the association of wild bird distribution across a year and the virus diffusion. The monthly wild bird distribution probability at each location is generated based on the location’s geographical coordinates on the modeled bird distribution probability raster map. We then applied block bootstrapping to generate samples of monthly virus lineage movement counts from all events while keeping the year and the month of the event. The number of samples is decided by \(\frac{20}{0.05}\times\) the number of routes × the number of bird orders. We summarized the counts by month in each sample to get a monthly count sample. We calculated Pearson’s correlation (r) for each sample between the virus lineage migration of each route and each bird order distribution at the origin/destination region, respectively. We define the two-tailed p value by doubling the proportion of the bootstrap samples with either r > 0 or r < 0 (whichever is smaller). To account for multiple comparisons of 9 bird orders, n routes, and 2 locations (origin/destination) on each route, we use p value \( < \frac{0.05}{9\times 2\times n}\) to define the statistical significance in the correlations. When bird distribution at the origin/destination is correlated with the virus lineage movements positively or negatively, we consider the bird order distribution at the origin/destination correlated with the virus lineage movements.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

In this study, epidemiological characteristics and spatiotemporal clustering analysis at the township level were performed. A descriptive study and a Joinpoint regression analysis were used to explore the epidemiological characteristics and the time trend of influenza. Spatiotemporal autocorrelation and clustering analyses were carried out to explore the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and aggregation. Furthermore, the hotspot regions were analyzed by spatiotemporal scan analysis. A total of 4025 influenza cases were reported in Yinchuan showing an overall increasing trend. The tendency of influenza in Yinchuan consisted of three stages: increased from 2012 to the first peak in 2019 (32.62/100,000) with a slight decrease in 2016; during 2019 and 2020, the trend was downwards; then it increased sharply again and reached another peak in 2022. The Joinpoint regression analysis found that there were three turning points from January 2012 to December 2022, namely January 2020, April 2020, and February 2022. The children under ten displayed an upward trend and were statistically significant. The trend surface analysis indicated that there was a shifting trend from northern to central and southern. A significant positive spatial auto-correlation was observed at the township level and four high-incidence clusters of influenza were detected. These results suggested that children under 10 years old deserve more attention and the spatiotemporal distribution of high-risk regions of influenza in Yinchuan varies every year at the township level. Thus, more monitoring and resource allocation should be prone to the four high-incidence clusters, which may benefit the public health authorities to carry out the vaccination and health promotion timely.

It is highly infectious and has quick transmission2. Influenza can aggravate the risk of corresponding complications, such as immune repression and intercurrent infection, and will bring a heavier disease burden to people3,4. According to the World Health Organization statistics, 3–5 million severe influenza cases are reported worldwide per year, and about 250–500 thousand cause death5. In 2021, more than 668 200 influenza cases were reported in China, accounting for 10.72% of the total infectious disease cases and the incidence is keeping increased6,7. Thus, influenza is still one of the serious public health problems in China threatening human health and has not yet been fully controlled, and deserves further studies.Due to frequent variations in the influenza virus, new viral subtypes continue to emerge. Since 1947, the World Health Organization (WHO) has monitored influenza virus strains and gradually developed a global surveillance system8. Each influenza season, the WHO collected influenza virus samples from different regions for analysis and monitoring. Based on this data, the WHO identified the recommended influenza vaccine strains to address potential subtypes that may become prevalent in future influenza seasons. With the widespread implementation of influenza vaccines, many countries9,10,11,12 have seen a certain reduction in influenza incidence. However, in the past decade, many regions worldwide have reported influenza outbreaks, such as Thailand13, Italy14, Taiwan15, and America16. Previous studies17,18,19,20 on influenza largely focused on epidemiological characteristics and the analysis of influencing factors. In addition, Morabia21 found that variation in social and healthcare-based determinants exacerbates influenza epidemics, and low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals are prone to bear the burden of infection. Zhang et al.22 also suggested that the insufficient influenza vaccine supplement, antigenic shift, and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in the outbreak. Diamond et al.23 found that within-year influenza patterns vary across mainland China concerning latitude and geographic location. However, there is limited research on associating epidemic characteristics with spatial clustering or spatiotemporal distribution features.Some researchers22,24,25 have applied spatial techniques and geographic information systems to probe the geographic distribution characteristics and identify influenza clusters for high and low-risk regions and periods in China. Most of them emphasized the geographic heterogeneity of influenza at the urban level in economically developed cities. However, due to spatial heterogeneity, variations in economic development, and disparities in health resource allocation, the epidemiological characteristics of influenza differ across China26. Also, conducting research at the scale such as the city level may result in a lower spatial resolution compared to the finer resolution achievable at the township level. This could lead to a loss of detail in capturing the specific distribution and variations of diseases within smaller areas27. More precisely, at the township level, there may be specific local influencing factors such as demography, socio-cultural factors, health resources, etc., which might be overshadowed at the city or county level. Studying in a smaller geographical unit makes it easier to discover these local influencing factors. As one of the economically underdeveloped regions in Western China, Yinchuan City is the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which has more densely populated communities and greater mobility of people than other cities in Ningxia. Moreover, Yinchuan has a temperate continental climate, with dry less rain, large temperature difference between day and night. Thus, this research aims to deepen the understanding of the geographic differences in influenza incidence in Western China, providing insights for targeted influenza prevention strategies and offering recommendations for the allocation such as vaccination and health resource allocation for policy-making departments.Materials and methodsStudy siteYinchuan is situated at 37°29′ N–38°53′ N and 105°49′ E–106°53′ E and administers 61 townships across three districts (Xingqing, Jinfeng, Xixia), two counties (Yongning, Helan), and a county-level city (Lingwu), with a total area of 9025.38 km2. By the end of 2022, Yinchuan has a permanent resident population of 2,859,074. The specific information is as follows: (1) Xingqing district: includes Fenghuang North street, Jiefang West street, and other 15 townships. (2) Jinfeng district: includes Mancheng North street, Huanghe East street, and other eight townships. (3) Xixia district: includes Beijing West street, Wenchang street, and other nine townships. (4) Yongning County: includes Tuanjie West street, Yanghe township, and other nine townships. (5) Helan County: includes Xigang township, Jingui township, and other ten townships. (6) Lingwu: includes Haojiaqiao township, Chongxing township, and other ten townships. Data collectionThe case data from 2012 to 2022 in Yinchuan City were obtained from the National Monitoring and Reporting Management System for Communicable Disease. All cases were diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms and laboratory test results according to the diagnostic guidelines issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health1. Demographic data were obtained from the Ningxia Statistical Yearbook and statistical bulletins of counties and districts (http:/xdata.com.cn/publish.htm?cn=G01). The town-level vector map of Yinchuan was derived from the Chinese National Fundamental Geographic Information System (http://www.ngcc.cngcc/). All cases were desensitized, geocoded by the specific administrative code, and matched to the town-level layers.MethodsDescriptive analysisWe described the epidemic characteristics of influenza in Yinchuan from 2012 to 2022, including reported incidence, reported number, onset time, gender, age, occupation, and regional distribution. We use the annual population composition and influenza incidence rate in each township of Yinchuan to calculate the standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) of influenza. The formula shows as follows:$$SMR=\frac{{y}_{it}}{{E}_{it}},$$ (1) where \({y}_{it}\) is the number of reported cases in township \(i(1\le i\le 61)\) during year \(t(2012\le t\le 2022)\) and \({E}_{it}\) is the expected cases in township \(i\) during year \(t\), which can be calculated by multiplying the annual population composition and the reported incidence of influenza in the county for a particular year \(t\).Joinpoint regression analysis and cross-correlation function (CCF) analysisJoinpoint regression analysis was created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)28,29 to analyze trend changes, primarily applied in the analysis of time series data. In our study, we used the sequence of observations (\({t}_{1},{y}_{1}\)),…… (\({t}_{n},{y}_{n}\)) , (\({t}_{i}\le \dots \le {t}_{n}\)) ,where \(t\) is the year from 2012 to 2022), \({\text{y}}\) is the cases of influenza and \(n\) is the period of the study to establish the regression model:$$E\left[\left.y\right|t\right]={e}^{{\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{1}t+{\delta }_{1}{\left(t-{\tau }_{1}\right)}^{+}+\dots +{\delta }_{k}{\left(t-{\tau }_{k}\right)}^{+}},$$ (2) where \(k\) is the number of turning points, \({\tau }_{k}\) is the unknown turning point, \({\beta }_{0}\) is the invariant parameter, \({\beta }_{1}\) is the regression coefficient, \({\delta }_{k}\) is the regression coefficient of the segment \(k\). When \(\left(t-{\tau }_{k}\right)>0\), \({\left(t-{\tau }_{k}\right)}^{+}=t-{\tau }_{k}\), otherwise \({\left(t-{\tau }_{k}\right)}^{+}=0\).Due to APC being calculated based on annual data, it provides a high-level overview of trends at the annual scale and may smooth out fluctuations due to seasonality or periodicity, resulting in an annual trend that appears more consistent upward. To analyze the data at different time scales, we also fitted the model by the monthly and annual cases, different ages, and different regions in Yinchuan successively. Using the annual percent change (APC), monthly percent change (MPC), average annual percent change (AAPC), and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe each line segment change, the change between the inflection point and the change over the entire period, respectively. The calculation formulas are shown as follows:$$APC=\left[\frac{{y}_{n+1}-{y}_{n}}{{y}_{n}}\right]=\left\{{e}^{{\beta }_{1}}-1\right\}\times 100,$$ (3) $$AAPC=(\frac{{\sum }_{i=1}^{k}\left({APC}_{i}\times {\omega }_{i}\right)}{{\sum }_{i=1}^{k}{\omega }_{i}}),$$ (4) where \({APC}_{i}\) is the \(APC\) for the \({i}\) th segment, \({\omega }_{i}\) is the length of each segment in the range of years. MPC denotes the monthly percentage change, with a calculation formula identical to that of APC, whose data pertains to monthly records. The method of cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis was given in Supplementary Material.Trend surface analysisBy fitting a two-dimensional non-linear regression function using the least squares method, we performed a Three-Dimensional Trend Surface Analysis to help visualize influenza spatial variations across different geographical locations30. The analysis decomposes the observed values, such as the incidence of influenza, into three components: local anomalies, regional trends and random errors. Based on the SMR of influenza from 61 townships in Yinchuan from 2012 to 2022, we calculate the average SMR value for each township as the dependent variable (Z-axis), with the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each township as the independent variables (X-axis and Y-axis). Then we conduct a spatial three-dimensional trend surface analysis to explore the overall distribution of influenza in Yinchuan.Within the graphical representation, disease indicator data points are meticulously projected onto two-dimensional planes (XZ plane and YZ plane). Through data fitting, the estimates derived reflect the nuanced changing trends of the studied phenomenon across the entire region. Employing polynomial fitting for three-dimensional data projection onto discrete points, on the XZ plane aligned with the Y-axis, the line illustrates the disease index trend variations in the north–south direction (latitude), with the arrow indicating northward. Similarly, on the YZ plane aligned with the X-axis, the line depicts the trend changes in the east–west direction (longitude), with the arrow indicating eastward31.Spatial auto-correlation analysisThe global and local spatial autocorrelation method is used to explore the overall aggregation of the study area and locate the specific area. Moran’s I was used to investigate the autocorrelation of global space, the value range is from −1 to 1. Statistically significant positive or negative values indicate positive or negative spatial autocorrelation and zero values indicate random spatial autocorrelation32. The Moran’s index \(I\) is calculated as follows:$$I=\frac{m{\sum }_{i=1}^{m}{\sum }_{j=1}^{m}{\omega }_{ij}\left({x}_{i}-\overline{x}\right)\left({x}_{j}-\overline{x}\right)}{\left({\sum }_{i=1}^{m}{\sum }_{j=1}^{m}{\omega }_{ij}\right){\sum }_{i=1}^{m}{\left({x}_{i}-\overline{x}\right)}^{2}},$$ (5) where \(m\) is the number of geographic regions, \({x}_{i}\) is the number of reported cases in \(i\)-th spatial feature, \({x}_{j}\) is the number of reported cases in \(j\)-th spatial feature, \(\overline{x}\) is the mean of the variable \(x\) across all geographic regions, \({\omega }_{ij}\) is a spatial weight matrix (when \(i\) is adjacent to \(j\), \({\omega }_{ij}=1\) otherwise \({\omega }_{ij}=0\)).Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) analysis is commonly used to explore specific aggregation patterns and regions33,34. The local Moran's I statistic is usually used to evaluate whether a feature at a particular location is correlated with its neighboring features and helps identify spatial clusters of high or low values and classifies locations into four categories: High–High (H–H), High–Low (H–L), Low–High (L–H), and Low–Low (L–L). These categories provide insights into whether similar or dissimilar values are clustered together in the spatial domain. The local Moran’s index I is calculated as follows:$${I}_{i}=\frac{{x}_{i}-\overline{x}}{{\sum }_{j=1}^{m}{\omega }_{ij}\left({x}_{j}-\overline{x }\right)},$$ (6) where \({I}_{i}\) is the local Moran’s index at geographical unit \(i\), the interpretations of the other parameters in Eq. (5) as above.Spatiotemporal scan analysisKulldorff’s scan statistics were applied to detect clusters of influenza cases in space–time settings35. Its sensitivity drives surveillance systems to detect outbreaks earlier than before. The method has strong statistical robustness and interpretability of the analytical results36. In practice, we create a scan window to explore the time of disease clusters by the log-likelihood ratio (LLR). If there is a larger LLR value and a smaller P value, we consider that the region is likely to be a high cluster area, and the risk can be evaluated by relative risk (RR). Scan analysis can not only reveal the law of the aggregation area in the geographical space with time, but also obtain the relative risk, and locate the position of the spatial aggregation area more accurately37,38,39.Statistical softwareDescriptive analysis was generated by SPSS 26.0, Joinpoint regression analysis was carried out by Joinpoint Program 5.0.2, trend surface analysis was completed by ArcGIS10.6, spatial auto-correlation analysis was performed by GeoDa 1.10 (Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA) and ArcGIS 10.6, whose number of Monte Carlo random repeated simulations was set to M = 999. Spatiotemporal scan analysis was performed by SaTScan 9.4.1 (Martin Kulldorff, Boston, MA, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsEpidemiological characteristicsA total of 4025 influenza cases were reported in Yinchuan from 2012 to 2022, with an average annual incidence of 15.47/100,000, which is lower than that of the national average level. Fig.S1. shows the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of influenza in Yinchuan from 2012 to 2022, and the spatial and temporal analysis at the township level may be beneficial to identify more high-risk areas. Except Lingwu was decreasing, the incidence in Xingqing, Jinfeng, Xixia, Yongning, and Helan was gradually increasing, among which Jinfeng with the fastest increase rate. Spatially, 1603 cases were in Jinfeng with an average annual incidence of 35.82 per 100,000, followed by Xingqing (1603, 13.37/100,000), Xixia (623, 14.93/100,000), Yongning (309, 10.80/100,000), Helen (148, 487/100,000) and Lingwu (233, 7.36/100,000).From 2012 to 2022, the tendency of influenza in Yinchuan consisted of three stages: increased from 2012 to the first peak in 2019 (32.62/100,000) with a slight decrease in 2016; during 2019 and 2020, the trend was downwards; then it increased sharply again and reached another peak in 2022, with the incidence of 33.96/100,000 (Fig. 1a). The seasonal trend analysis displayed there was a unimodal mode in Yinchuan, the peak appeared from November to March (as shown in Fig. 1b).Figure 1Epidemiological features of influenza in Yinchuan, China, 2012–2022: (a) distribution of annual influenza incidence by gender; (b) monthly distribution of influenza; (c) influenza distribution by age; (d) influenza distribution by occupation.Full size imageAmong these Influenza cases, 2103 (52.2%) were male and were distributed in all age groups, mainly in 0-(30.7%) and 5-(25.9%). It was worth noting that the cases under 19 account for 68.9% (Fig. 1c). In terms of occupational distribution, as shown in Fig. 1d, nursery, and diaspora children were the main group (41.9%), followed by students (27%) and housework and unemployed people (9.3%).Joinpoint regression analysis and cross-correlation function (CCF) analysisFigure 2. shows the changing trend of influenza in Yinchuan. The results found that there were 3 turning points from Jan. 2012 to Dec. 2022, namely the 97th month (January 2020), the 100th month (April 2020), and the 122nd month (February 2022), respectively. A "rise-fall-rise" trend was observed, and the MPC of four segments was statistically significant, as shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1. The annual cases of influenza from 2012 to 2022 appeared an upward trend (APC = 18.57, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2b). The children under 10 years old displayed an upward trend and were statistically significant. Among all groups, the 5–10 group is rising the fastest. One turning point was presented in the 60-year-old group, which displayed a “first rise then descend” trend (before 2019 APC was 28.30 and after 2019 APC was -41.13, respectively), other groups were the same as the overall trend (Fig. 2c). The cases showed an overall upward trend and were statistically significant in Yinchuan. Helan County had a turning point in 2019 (Table S1), while other regions showed a single upward trend, among them Lingwu presented a distinctive downward trend (Fig. 2d). In the cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis between influenza cases and influenza vaccination and Baidu index time series data, a strong positive correlation was observed, as shown in Fig. S2.Figure 2Changing trend of influenza in Yinchuan, China, 2012–2022: (a) changing trend of monthly cases of influenza in Yinchuan, 2012–2022; (b) changing trend of annual cases of influenza in Yinchuan, 2012–2022; (c) change in influenza cases in different age groups in Yinchuan, 2012–2022; (d) change in influenza cases at county level in Yinchuan, 2012–2022.Full size imageTable 1 Joinpoint analysis results of monthly reported cases of influenza in Yinchuan, 2012–2022.Full size tableSpatial distribution and trend surface analysisIn Fig. S3, we observed that the annual average incidence of influenza presented a significant spatial heterogeneity at the township level, and there was a shifting trend from northern to central and southern Yinchuan. According to the three-dimensional trend surface analysis (Fig. 3), the results also validated that the standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) of influenza in the North is slightly higher than that in the South, the Eastern is higher than that in the Western, and the central region was lowest.Figure 3Spatial three-dimensional trend surface analysis of influenza.Full size imageSpatiotemporal clustering analysisGlobal auto-correlation analysis indicated that the distribution of influenza presented a significant positive spatial auto-correlation at the township level since 2015, as displayed in Table S2. In Table S3 and Fig. 4, LISA analysis of influenza from 2012 to 2022 was performed to detect the hot spots in Yinchuan, and four hot spots of influenza were identified: Funing Street, Changcheng Middle Road, ShanghaiWest Road, Liangtian Town. The high-high cluster was mainly located in the central of Yinchuan, such as Changcheng Middle Road, Shanghai West Road, Liangtian Town, etc. The cases in cold spots were significantly lower than those in hot spots (\({\chi }^{2}\)=656.96, \({\rm P}\)<0.0001). The specific results are shown in Table S4. Another interesting fact was observed that the high-high cluster in 2016 covered the greatest number of towns, but the incidence was relatively lower.Figure 4Yearly local spatial auto-correlation of influenza at the township level in Yinchuan, China, 2012–2022.Full size imageSpatiotemporal aggregation scan analysisThe results of spatiotemporal aggregation scan statistics are in Fig. 5 and Table S5. We found that there were four high-incidence clusters of influenza. The most likely cluster was Changcheng Middle Road from January 2018 to December 2022 (RR = 7.72, LLR = 1031.70, P < 0.0001). Followed by Fenghuang North Street with a radius of 11.37 km (RR = 2.42, LLR = 75.99, P < 0.0001). In addition, Wutongshu Town (RR = 14.47, LLR = 64.28, P < 0.0001) and Chongxing Town (RR = 5.30, LLR = 26.46, P < 0.0001) were also the two high-incidence clusters of influenza in Yinchuan.Figure 5Spatiotemporal clusters of influenza incidences at the township level in Yinchuan, China, 2012–2022.Full size imageDiscussionWorld Health Organization reported that 290,000–650,000 people dead from influenza-related respiratory diseases worldwide per year, accounting for 8.2% of all respiratory disease deaths, causing a heavy social and economic burden40. As influenza is an airborne disease, vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes caused by influenza viruses. However, the influenza vaccine (such as LAIV3, IIV4, etc1) is a non-immunization program vaccine in most areas of China, and residents are vaccinated voluntarily, thus, accurately identifying the high-risk clusters and susceptible populations of influenza may provide a scientific basis for the planning for the influenza vaccines supplies as well as provision of other respective health care resources.The analysis found that the overall trend of influenza in Yinchuan was increasing from 2012 to 2019, which was consistent with the tendency of influenza in China41. Influenza reached its first peak period in 2019, with an incidence of 32.62/100,000. Then, we observed a remarkable decline in 2020, staying in step with the United States, Singapore, and China42,43,44. After nearly two years, influenza up-resurgence and reached another peak in 2022, as was reported in several studies before15. In 2019, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China released the "Influenza Diagnosis and Treatment of Influenza (2019)"45, which standardized the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting procedures of influenza, resulting in an increase in the reporting rate. In 2020, with the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Ningxia initiated a Level 1 response (Feb.2020) to a major public health emergency under relevant national laws and regulations. The results of CCF analysis also indicated that influenza cases have a strong positive correlation between vaccination and public health awareness. Some researchers12,46,47 have come to the same conclusion. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask-wearing, social distancing, travel restrictions, patient isolation, and other public health measures have limited people's exposure to the influenza virus, leading to a downward trend42,48. Since 2021, Ningxia achieved significant success against the epidemic. The response level was gradually adjusted to Level 2 and Level 3 (March and May 2020). Due to the prolonged absence of exposure to the pathogenic microorganism, there is an increasing number of individuals lacking immunity to the influenza virus49,50. Wang et al.51 quantified the population susceptibility to influenza viruses has increased by 45.1–72.9% after the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, once pandemic prevention measures are lifted, there is a significant surge. Such an "Immunity debt" phenomenon was also observed in other respiratory syncytial virus49,52,53.Regarding seasonal trends, influenza in China varies with latitude and shows diverse spatial patterns and seasonal characteristics23. Similar to other reports25,33, influenza in Yinchuan displayed an unimodal mode, with the peak appearing from December to March. Notably, the low influenza incidence appeared in July and August, in keeping with the school holiday and population mobility peak. The subpopulation analysis showed that nursery and diaspora children, students, housework, and unemployed workers were at high risk of influenza as well. Males were more susceptible than females, which may be related to different behavior patterns. Males often have more social pressure, work intensity, and outdoor activities, which would increase exposure and facilitate virus transmission54,55. Previous studies56,57,58 have indicated that confined spaces like schools and families accelerated the spread of the influenza virus and increased the possibility of infection among members. Beyond that, children under 19 years old accounted for over half of all cases (68.9%). Existing research demonstrated that school-based influenza vaccination can effectively reduce the incidence of influenza among school-age children. Lau et al.59 suggested that the incidence of vaccinated students was significantly reduced compared with those not vaccinated (7.7% vs.14.1%). Thus, kindergartens and schools should strengthen health education, and timely provide school-based influenza vaccination to effectively reduce influenza infections.Based on the Joinpoint regression analysis, the overall trend of influenza has been increasing from 2012 to 2022. Notably, we identified three turning points whose timings closely align with the implementation of NPIs in Ningxia. Previous studies42,48 observed similar trends in other respiratory diseases. Therefore, we have reasons to believe that NPIs significantly influence the incidence of influenza. Regarding different age groups, a single increasing trend over the entire period was displayed except for the age group of 60 years. Groups 5–9 years, 0–4 years, and 30–40 years groups exhibited a relatively higher APC among all groups, ranking the top three. During the peak influenza season, the annual infection rate of influenza in children under ten years old can reach 50%60,61. Individuals in the 30–40 years group often have more frequent interactions with others in career development, and the pressures of work can also impact the immune system, thereby increasing the chances of influenza transmission54. When stratified by region, Lingwu showed a decreasing trend, while other counties generally exhibited an upward trend. Among them, Jinfeng County experienced the fastest growth. Mamelund62 and Munday63 indicated that socioeconomic conditions influence influenza incidence. According to Yinchuan Statistical Yearbook64, Jinfeng District has better socioeconomic conditions compared to other counties. The high population density in this area facilitates the spread of the virus and the numerous medical institutions lead to a high diagnostic reporting rate. Those potentially contributing to its higher incidence compared to other counties.Global auto-correlation analysis and spatiotemporal scan statistics found that the distribution of influenza presented a significant positive spatial auto-correlation at the township level and four high-incidence clusters of influenza were detected in Yinchuan. The most likely cluster was Changcheng Middle Road with 7.72 times the risk than that outside the cluster area, and the 14 districts in the second spatial–temporal cluster principally concentrated in Xingqing and Jinfeng. The streets in Yinchuan possess different socioeconomic levels, infrastructure, and healthcare conditions, which might affect the spatiotemporal variations. Several studies have used spatial analysis to explore the distribution of influenza in many regions of China, such as Shanghai city65, Shandong province66, Guangzhou province24, and mainland China18. However, most of them are focused on a larger scale to analyze epidemical tendency, such as provincial and district level, there has been no report on the township level to study spatial epidemiological of influenza. As townships are the smallest units implementing basic public health services, their results are more targeted and geographically precise. The spatiotemporal clustering analysis result showed that the cases in cold spots were significantly lower than those in hot spots. Prevention is more cost-effective than treatment. Although increased attention and resources may be required in hot spots, cold spots should not be ignored to prevent potential outbreaks as well. Consider the following measures to strengthen surveillance in non-hotspot areas may be helpful. First, provide training for healthcare institutions and professionals and encourage healthcare workers to report unusual cases more diligently. Second, encourage residents to proactively report symptoms and conduct community outreach and education activities to promote self-protection. Third, set up health emergency response mechanisms to ensure a quick and organized response once disease outbreaks. Finally, incorporate modern technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analysis to enhance monitoring effectiveness.There are some reasons that may be responsible for the heterogeneity of influenza infection at a precise scale in Yinchuan, we first carried out a spatial regression model to capture the spatial correlation between the vaccine coverage and influenza incidence, as shown in Table S6 in supplementary material, including the Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error Model (SEM), and Spatial Dubin Model (SDM). However, due to the results of Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests being non-significant (P > 0.05), we subsequently conducted an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis and found that vaccine coverage was significantly negatively associated with influenza incidence (β = −1.3558, P < 0.05), which implied that vaccination may be an effective protective measure to reduce influenza incidence, see Table S7 for more details.Our results have important implications for the planning and optimization of immunization programs and healthcare provision at a finer scale. However, this study also has some limitations. First, we found that the number of vaccinations is associated with the incidence of influenza in Yinchuan City, however, due to the limited data source of economic factors, medical and health resources, etc. at the township scale, more influencing factors of the spatiotemporal variations of influenza at the township should be performed quantificationally. Second, the data of analysis sourced from the surveillance system, misdiagnosis, and misreporting are unavoidable because it is difficult to distinguish influenza from other respiratory viruses without laboratory testing22. Third, as mentioned above, health behavior and awareness of residents is one of the effective ways to prevent influenza, thus, carrying out fine-scale spatiotemporal surveillance results are more targeted and geographically precise. Fourth, prevention is more cost-effective than treatment. So more accurate disease monitoring and reporting enable local health authorities to swiftly identify and respond to potential outbreaks, which can mitigate these impacts and reduce their impact on the local economy. It also can guide the precise allocation and deployment of medical resources, enhancing the effectiveness of medical services and reducing unnecessary costs.ConclusionsThe study described the epidemiological characteristics of influenza and detected hotspot regions at the township level in Yinchuan, Ningxia, from 2012 to 2022. The tendency of influenza in Yinchuan consisted of three stages: increased from 2012 to the first peak in 2019 (32.62/100,000) with a slight decrease in 2016; during 2019 and 2020, the trend was downwards; then it increased sharply again and reached another peak in 2022, with the incidence of 33.96/100,000. Influenza in Yinchuan displayed an unimodal mode within 1 year, with the peak appearing from December to March. The Joinpoint regression analysis found that there were three turning points from January 2012 to December 2022, namely January 2020, April 2020, and February 2022. The children under ten displayed an upward trend and were statistically significant. The trend surface analysis indicated that there was a shifting trend from northern to central and southern. Global auto-correlation analysis and spatiotemporal scan statistics found that the distribution of influenza presented a significant positive spatial auto-correlation at the township level and four high-incidence clusters of influenza were detected in Yinchuan. Different measures for different regions should be guaranteed for effective prevention strategies such as vaccination and health resource allocation.

Organoid platforms have emerged in recent years as amenable in vitro tools that can bridge the limitations of traditional 2D cell lines and animal models for viral disease research. We highlight in this review the key insights that have contributed by organoid models to virus research, the limitations that exist in current platforms, and outline novel approaches that are being applied to address these shortcomings.

Influenza virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have collectively exemplified the substantiality of public health threat posed by emerging viruses. At the same time, urbanization1, climate change2 and wildlife trade3 are predicted to increase the propensity for viral disease emergence in the coming decades. As we usher in a new era of infectious disease, novel approaches to establish greater outbreak preparedness need to be employed. Within this framework, development of physiologically relevant laboratory models for studying disease pathophysiology and development of therapeutics to relieve disease burden needs to be prioritized.In recent years, organoids have gained significant recognition as physiologically relevant in vitro platforms in the realm of virus research, and existing platforms are being refined continuously to better accommodate human viral disease studies. In this review, we will highlight key virological findings that have been uncovered using organoid models. Additionally, we will discuss the limitations of existing organoid platforms, particularly with relevance to virological research, and novel strategies that are being explored to overcome these shortcomings.Traditional experimental models for viral diseasesTwo-dimensional (2D) cultured cell lines have served as tools for virus propagation since the early 1900s4, and remain the most used platform for studying viral diseases. Traditional 2D cell lines are easy to handle, affordable to maintain and amenable to a wide range of experimental techniques. However, most cell lines are genetically immortalized, cancerous, or transformed to enable long-term culturing, thus often possess defects such as dysfunctional innate immune signaling pathways. Inherent differences between 2D cell lines and normal cells in vivo can result in bottlenecks that select for cell line adapted viral mutants with altered entry receptor usage5, transmissibility6 and pathogenicity7,8 compared to their clinically isolated forms. An alternative in vitro platform is primary cells derived directly from patient tissues, which are of greater resemblance to human cells in vivo, but rely on steady sources of fresh tissue to generate as they typically can only be passaged a few times before showing signs of senescence9.Animal models are used to recapitulate viral disease processes that occur at the whole organism level. Model organisms have served as valuable platforms for determining disease-causative viral agents in fulfillment of Koch’s postulates10,11 and as preclinical platforms for vaccines and antivirals12,13. Certain physiological traits encompassed by individual animal models that are of high resemblance to those in humans have also been harnessed to study viral disease pathogenesis14. For example, ferrets are a favorable model for studying transmission of influenza viruses, owing to the high histological and anatomical similarity of their respiratory tracts to those of human15. However, inherent differences between host species limit clinical translatability of findings from animal studies, since viral disease is the end product of a myriad of virus-host interactions that are fine-tuned by evolution. Moreover, as viruses generally exhibit a narrow host range16, studies of human viruses in animal models often require extensive rounds of virus adaptation in the target species, resulting in adapted variants with mutations that may alter key viral phenotypes that are relevant to human disease17,18,19. Alternatively, specialized transgenic or humanized organisms with engineered susceptibility towards the viral target may be employed, but are generally costly, time consuming and labor intensive to generate20,21,22.Given the shortcomings of traditional experimental platforms in authentically recapitulating viral disease in human, developing improved models that can better represent cellular phenotype diversity, disease susceptibility and host responses, whilst being amenable to a wide range of experimental techniques, is a priority in virology. In the past decade, human stem cell-derived organoids have proven repeatedly to be an asset to virus research, unraveling critical viral disease mechanisms that were previously undeterminable in traditional experimental platforms, identifying viral and host factors that facilitate infection, and providing tools for propagating viruses that were previously challenging to cultivate in vitro. Applicability of organoid platforms to virus research was further demonstrated when they were rapidly employed for disease modeling early during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since contributed a wealth of knowledge towards the disease. In this review, we discuss how organoids have been employed to fulfill critical knowledge gaps in virology. We focus our discussion on viruses that have been studied extensively using organoid models in recent years.Organoid models for viral diseasesOrganoids are defined as multicellular structures or “mini-organs” derived from stem or progenitor cells that are composed of organ-specific cell types with the capacity to self-organize through cell sorting and spatially restricted lineage commitment23,24. Organoid models are generally three-dimensional (3D) structures that are either embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) gel or free-floating in medium, and require exogenous supplementation of growth factors that are essential for stem cell proliferation. In recent years, many 2D organoid models composed of cells that are directly grown on a flat surface with or without ECM coating, have also been established25,26,27,28. Organoids can either be derived from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (together referred to as PSCs) or adult stem cells (ASCs) (Fig. 1). PSC-derived organoids from fetal tissues or somatic cells are generated through a stepwise differentiation process that requires supplementation of specific growth factors at each stage29,30. Additionally, PSCs can be induced to differentiate into a wide range of tissue types from all three germ layers. Since PSC organoids are formed through processes that are unique to embryonic development, they make for ideal models to study organogenesis, in vivo development, and viral diseases known to impact these processes. ASC-derived organoids, which were first established for the intestine after the identification of Lgr5 as a marker of adult gut stem cells31,32, can be generated from tissue-resident stem cells in adult tissues or organs through mimicking the adult stem cell niche during tissue renewal or damage repair. Resultant ASC-derived organoids model adult cells in vivo with high accuracy, but generally only contain epithelial cells.Fig. 1: Generation of adult (ASC) and pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived organoid models.A Embryonic (ESC) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), together referred to as PSCs, can be derived from embryonic tissues or reprogrammed from terminally differentiated fibroblasts (and other somatic cells), respectively. These progenitors can be induced to form PSC organoids from all three germ layers through a stepwise differentiation process that requires supplementation of specific growth factors at each stage. PSC organoids contain niche components from the stroma in addition to epithelial cell types, but often present fetal or neonatal phenotypes that closer resemble developing organs rather than adult tissues. B ASC organoids are generated from stem cells isolated from adult tissues that have regenerative potential. Following isolation and expansion, ASCs can be cultured in vitro with specific combinations of growth factors to induce formation of organoids containing diverse epithelial cell types from the tissue origin. Figure created with BioRender.Full size imageFor 3D organoids, the cell surface is often embedded in the interior and inaccessible to viruses. As such, viral infection studies often require additional steps such as disrupting organoids into fragments, precision slicing of organoids33, microinjecting viruses into the organoid lumen34, or generating inverted organoids that adopt an “apical out” conformation in 3D35. In contrast, 2D organoids such as those differentiated on a Transwell at air-liquid interface (ALI), do not have this limitation and thus are frequently used as tools in virology. Comparisons of these available approaches have previously been reviewed36 and is illustrated in Fig. 2. In recent years, a wide range of organoid systems have been generated and applied to model human viral diseases.Fig. 2: Methods of infecting organoid cultures.Airway organoids are depicted as an example in this figure. Differentiated organoids generated for viral disease studies can be cultured as (A). 3D structures embedded in an ECM scaffold or (B). a 2D pseudostratified epithelial layer at air-liquid interface. 3D organoids typically require additional processing prior to infection to enable access to the apical layer that is embedded in the interior. This can be achieved through (C). enzymatically or mechanically disrupting organoids into fragments and re-embedding into ECM scaffolds prior to infection or (D). generating inverted apical-out organoids. Alternatively, viruses can be (E). microinjected into the lumen of intact 3D organoids. Figure created with BioRender.Full size imageNorovirusHuman noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the leading cause of acute and food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide37. Unsuccessful attempts in cultivating HuNoVs using primary and continuous cell lines have hindered understanding of disease pathogenesis and development of therapeutics for over three decades. Human intestinal organoids (hIOs) derived from human ASCs provided the first platform that allowed for in vitro HuNoV replication in a reproducible manner, and further aided identification of enterocytes as the predominant intestinal target for infection and replication38. Importantly, the study pinpointed bile as a strain-dependent required factor or enhancer for in vitro viral replication, the mechanism of which requires further investigation38. hIOs also provided a platform for assessing the effectiveness of virus inactivation strategies as disease countermeasures against different HuNoV strains39. Consistent with findings from animal and human studies40,41, hIOs demonstrated strain-dependent HuNoV binding specificity for histo-blood group antigens expressed on the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract, matchedness of which was necessary to enable viral replication in vitro42. Following successes in HuNoVs studies, hIOs have also been adopted to compare infectivity and host responses elicited by other enteric viruses such as human rotavirus43, echovirus (E11)44, coxsackie B virus (CVB)45 and enterovirus 7146. In contrast to observations from infected 2D intestinal cell lines conducted in the same study, infectivity and profile of inflammatory responses mounted by each enteric virus in hIOs were distinct. In particular, CVB and E11 were able to replicate in enteroids with greater efficiency, but robust induction of transcripts for ISGs, cytokines and chemokines associated with antiviral signaling was observed only following infection with E1147, collectively demonstrating the promise of hIOs as a human relevant model to unveil critical host-pathogen interactions at the gastro-intestinal cellular barrier.Influenza virusInfluenza A viruses (IAV) exhibit a diverse host range and display remarkable capacity to rapidly evolve under selection pressure and adapt to new hosts. IAVs possess a segmented genome and a low fidelity RNA polymerase, which continuously generate reassortants and antigenic variants that have the potential to cross species barriers and cause epidemics, and even pandemics. However, robust in vitro models for predicting zoonotic spillover potential of animal harbored IAVs had previously been lacking. A potential recourse for this is human ASC-derived airway organoids (AOs) that morphologically and functionally resemble human airways at near physiological levels. 2D AOs differentiated under defined conditions demonstrated the ability to distinguish the replicative capacity of human-infective IAVs from poorly human-infective avian and swine subtypes48. Importantly, high levels of serine proteases including TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, HAT and matriptase, which conduct proteolytic cleavage of the virus surface hemagglutinin preceding viral-host membrane fusion, were expressed intrinsically upon AO differentiation48. Another study comparing replication capacity and host innate immune responses elicited by avian H5 and H7 viruses isolated from human patients, and human pandemic H1N1, identified higher replication capacity of H1N1 and avian H7N9 in AO cultures, whereas secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-β were most pronounced following infection with high-pathogenic avian (HPAI) H5N149, for which cytokine dysregulation has been postulated to contribute to severe disease phenotypes in human patients. For H7 subtypes, higher replication capacity was displayed by the human-infective H7N9/Ah strain compared to the poorly human-infective H7N2 in AO49. These findings were consistent with observations in ex vivo human bronchus explants. In another study, human AO were used to assess the spillover risk of recent HPAI avian H5N6 and H5N8 isolates. Lower replication competence of H5N6/H5N8 isolates compared to human pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 in AO epithelial cells indicated low likelihood of these strains in contributing to severe disease in humans50. Taken together, these studies have substantiated the promise of using AO platforms to assess viral tropism and infectivity in human for pandemic risk assessment of zoonotic IAVs.Owing to the rapidly evolving nature of IAVs, seasonal influenza vaccine formulations need to be updated annually. Quadrivalent and trivalent inactivated vaccines (IIVs), which are most commonly administered around the world, contain only antigens representative of human IAV and IBV strains, with limited coverage for zoonotic subtypes. While exploration of novel vaccine modalities that can provide broad spectrum protection are underway, majority of pre-clinical vaccine assessments are conducted in mice or non-human primates, and observed responses are often poorly predictive of those in humans51,52. Primary human tonsil organoids were recently explored in proof-of-concept studies as a platform for evaluating humoral responses to influenza vaccines. Tonsil organoids cultured in vitro were able to functionally retain germinal centre (GC) features, including production of antigen specific antibodies, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation upon stimulation with a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)53. In another study, tonsil organoids isolated and expanded from a single individual established distinct cellular and antibody dynamics following stimulation by different antigen modalities originating from IIVs, LAIVs and IAVs, and has been proposed as a blueprint to profile in vivo immune responses in future clinical trials without the need for experimental animals54.SARS-CoV-2The COVID-19 pandemic has heralded an unprecedented volume of research activity over a short period of time. Notably, significant insights into SARS-CoV-2 tropism, replication kinetics and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis were elucidated using organoids. Consistent with findings from human COVID-19 cases55,56, ciliated cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were identified as the primary cellular target during initial infection in differentiated AOs derived from resected human airway tissues57. In severe COVID-19 cases, patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome that is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and formation of hyaline membranes that hinders gas exchange58,59. A recent study in a primary nasal epithelial organoid model identified that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors expressed on the surface of motile cilia and hijacks the host cell to trigger formation of elongated apical microvilli, which are used to traverse viral progeny across the mucus layer60. Importantly, depletion of epithelial cilia in this model inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting motile cilia as a novel target for blocking entry and spread of viruses in the airway60. Due to the lack of clinical material from early infection timepoints, characterization of COVID-19 pathophysiology in the distal lung during early infection has been a challenge. Studies using 3D distal lung organoids have aided identification of club cells as a cellular target in the lower airways61. Further, transcriptomic and histological analyses on alveolospheres cultured from primary human lung tissue have shed light on crucial constituents of the inflammatory state upon infection of the alveoli, including upregulation of interferon-mediated responses and apoptosis, as well as a loss of mature AT2 phenotype and AT2 cell death, as indicated by downregulated expression of genes encoding for surfactant proteins62,63,64,65, which corroborates with clinical findings in COVID-19 lung tissues66,67,68.Though COVID-19 primarily presents clinically as a respiratory disease, systemic symptoms that manifest during early infection or consequently as disease sequelae have also been reported widely69. Moreover, as ACE2 is expressed across various mammalian tissues, SARS-CoV-2 can potentially spread to other organs in the body following initial infection of the respiratory tract. Enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium, which express ACE2 abundantly, were shown to support robust SARS-CoV-2 replication in a small intestine organoid (hSIO) model. Genetic signatures induced by infection in hSIO included cytokines and IFN-stimulated genes associated with IFN type I and III responses70,71, which may contribute to gastrointestinal inflammation and in part give rise to gastrointestinal symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients72. The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP)-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2 had been identified early during the pandemic in a human AO model, which further pinpointed the multibasic cleavage motif (MBCS) on the virus spike protein to be an adaptation feature that facilitates efficient TTSP usage73. Importantly, loss of the MBCS motif is observed upon viral propagation in cells that lack TTSPs, but not in AOs differentiated at ALI74. A follow-up study conducted in CRISPR/Cas9 modified hIOs further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, as well as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, specifically utilize TMPRSS2 for entry, making it an attractive target for pan-coronavirus therapeutics. During the emergence of the Omicron variant, several studies reported a switch in viral entry pathway towards TMPRSS2-independent endosomal entry75,76. This was later demonstrated in AOs and CRISPR/Cas9 modified hSIOs to be a cell line-specific phenomenon, as TTSP-mediated entry was still efficiently utilized by Omicron in organoids77.Besides elucidating host-virus interaction and pathophysiological mechanisms, organoids have also shown promise as a translational platform for drug efficacy determination and identification of novel therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. In particular, cardiac, lung and hIOs have been adopted for drug screening, from which a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors78, replication suppressors63,79, as well as cardioprotective drugs80 that could be utilized as COVID-19 therapeutics had been identified. Additionally, innovative efforts to combine organoid models with gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 to identify host genetic factors implied in SARS-CoV-2 infection have recently been established in the form of a CRISPR-knockout biobank81. Combination of CRISPR/Cas9 technology with human PSC-derived hepatocyte and blood vessel organoids have also been implemented in studies for viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2, such as filoviruses, which have identified the guanine nucleoside exchange factor CCZ1 as an essential host factor that controls early replication of Ebola and Marburg viruses82. Such technique could be applied to future studies of other novel and emerging viruses to enable rapid characterization of host factors involved in pathogen interaction, and identify targets for antiviral development. Additionally, organoids can also be readily cultured from diverse host species, thus hold promise to model differences in virus susceptibility between hosts. New animal derived organoid models ranging from snake venom glands83 to bat intestines70 are being established rapidly, some of which had already been applied to study virus tropism and host responses, such as for SARS-CoV-270.Zika virusSince its identification in Africa, the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread extensively across the globe. Global footprint of ZIKV has increased drastically in the last two decades, and has caused large outbreaks in the Yap Islands in 200784, in French Polynesia in 201385 and in South America in 201586. While majority of ZIKV cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, concern of ZIKV-associated severe pathogenic effects became prominent during the 2015 outbreak in Brazil, where a substantial number of infections during pregnancy was associated with neurological abnormalities and in particular, microencephaly in newborns87. Due to the lack of accessibility to live infected human fetal tissues, clinical understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis in the fetal central nervous system were limited. Using human PSC-derived cerebral organoids and pregnant mouse models, multiple groups have demonstrated that ZIKV infection results in disruption of the cerebral cortical layers and decline in proliferative zones, as well as reduced levels of functional neurones88,89. In accordance with these findings, another study that used brain region-specific organoids grown in spinning bioreactors showed that both Asian and African ZIKV strains preferentially and productively infected neural progenitors and triggered premature differentiation90, which closely resembled infection patterns observed in human fetuses91. Subsequent studies in human PSC-derived brain organoids identified alterations in the DNA methylome of neural progenitors and differentiated neurons following ZIKV infection at genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders92, suggesting neuropsychiatric complications as a potential downstream effect of fetal ZIKV infection. Additionally, human cortical organoids have been adopted in drug repurposing screens for therapeutics that can limit ZIKV induced progenitor cell death from FDA-approved drug libraries93 as well as in characterizing the mechanism of action of novel anti-ZIKV compounds94.Limitations of organoid platforms in virologyAs organoid platforms gain increasing popularity as in vitro tools for modeling viral diseases, it is important to recognize the advantages and address the limitations of each organoid system to achieve improved models with optimal physiological relevance, and increase translational applicability of findings. For example, ASC-derived organoids can well represent the architecture and functional aspects of the adult tissue epithelium, and stably retain epigenetic signatures from the original tissue throughout passages95. As such, they are able to model responses to viral infections within different genetic backgrounds and disease states. However, ASC-organoids generally lack representation beyond epithelial phenotypes, which include stromal, immune and vascular niches, and thus are of limited representativeness of epithelial-microenvironment interactions in the context of viral diseases. On the other hand, PSCs are valuable for culturing organoids from tissues with stem cells that are difficult to access or are of embryonic derivative, such as the brain. PSC-derived organoids typically contain both epithelial and mesenchymal layers, making them of greater complexity than ASC-derived organoids and can support investigations of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during viral infections. However, even in a fully differentiated state, PSC models often retain cellular phenotypes that are fetal or neonatal, which limits their representativeness of viral-host interactions in adult functional tissues96,97.A shortcoming that is common in both ASC and PSC models is the general lack of immune cell populations, which is pivotal in the context of viral disease modeling, since excessive inflammation or dysfunctional immune responses often play an equally or more important role in inducing host damage than direct infection58,98,99. This infection-induced hyperinflammatory state has yet to be thoroughly modeled in any organoid platforms. Another aspect with room for improvement in both models is better definition of growth conditions to achieve greater reproducibility of findings. This may entail adopting culture methods that can limit artefacts from ECM derivatives, such as inflammatory proteins, which can lead to heterogeneity in organoid formation from study to study100. In terms of integrating organoid platforms into translational research, a major challenge is to generate high-throughput platforms that are complementary with organoid technology. In one study, human PSC-derived lung organoid cultured in a 384-well format was used for antiviral screening, and identified FDA approved drugs such as imatinib and mycophenolic acid to be able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry101. Other models have additionally incorporated custom-engineered platforms, such as a 96-well microchannel based ALI system, that is designed to be compatible with high resolution in situ imaging and real-time sensing. The platform supported replication of IAV and the human seasonal coronavirus NL63, for which detected viral copies could be reduced using oseltamivir and camostat mesylate respectively102. As of present, organoid platforms for certain high-risk pathogens such as causative agents for viral hemorrhagic fevers remain scarce, in part due to the stringency of BSL-4 containment facilities. However, research on these viruses —particularly those featured in the WHO priority list103—is critical for epidemic and pandemic preparedness. Finally, since viral disease pathophysiology rarely localizes in a single organ, employing novel strategies to capture inter-organ interactions would be essential to understand systemic effects of viral infections. Approaches to address these existing limitations are currently being explored progressively in organoid research.“Next-generation” organoid platformsImmune co-cultureFor viral disease studies, devising methods to include immune cell populations in organoid platforms is a critical consideration going forward, since exacerbated or dysfunctional immune responses are thought to underlie severe disease for many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 58,99,104, HPAI H5N1105 and Ebola106. Acute cardiac injury was shown to be associated with a significantly greater mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, but causes of myocardial histopathology is poorly understood. Previously, studies from post-mortem heart samples from COVID-19 patients have identified increased inflammatory infiltration of CD11b+ and CD68+ macrophages107,108,109,110. To model the effects of macrophage-mediated hyperinflammation in cardiomyocytes (CM), an immuno-cardiac co-culture platform was generated using human PSC-derived CMs and monocytes/macrophages. The study identified CCL2 as the primary chemokine secreted by CMs to recruit monocytes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and presence of macrophages to significantly reduce the incidence of infected CMs111. In a separate co-culture study, IL-6 and TNF-ɑ generated by recruited macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in increased levels reactive oxygen species and apoptosis of CMs. Inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-ɑ through drug blockage of the JAK/STAT pathway was able to protect CMs from macrophage-induced hyperinflammation112.A recent complex lung organoid model generated from intact human lung fragments was shown to retain differentiated lung epithelial lineages, mesenchymal components as well as tissue-resident immune cell subsets. Innate and adaptive immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection of the complex organoid mirrored clinical observations in vivo113. Importantly, virus-specific memory T cell responses was observed following infection in lung samples from SARS-CoV-2 seropositive donors, demonstrating the capacity for mounting of lung resident T cell memory in absence of peripheral lymphoid components in this co-culture system. While maintaining immune cell longevity and phenotype preservation is a major challenge for organoid immune co-cultures, the study observed that T cell-tropic cytokines helped to sustain organoid immune content over time114.Studies of other respiratory viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2 have also adopted immune co-culture models. Differentiated nasal epithelium co-cultured with human PBMCs were used to characterize epithelium-leukocyte crosstalk during exposure to the influenza H3N2 strain, identifying monocytes, NK cells and innate T cells as the first to be activated at early stages of infection115. By partitioning epithelial cells and PBMCs in culture with a Transwell insert, direct PBMC infection was prevented, allowing for identification of immune responses triggered by soluble factors that are released by the infected epithelium115. Co-cultures of human pulmonary organoids and neutrophils have also been established previously to investigate neutrophil migration patterns in the context of inflammation, and been adapted to study neutrophil-epithelium interactions during RSV infection, identifying cytokines such as IP-10 and RANTES to have a crucial role in recruiting leukocytes during early infection34.Recently, a co-culture study established using PSC-derived liver organoids (LOs) comprised of hepatocytes and Kupffer-like cells, and macrophages from the same donor, was used to elucidate the role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)116. In particular, infection with HCV upregulated host lipogenesis resulting in fatty acid accumulation in LOs, which was accentuated in the presence of macrophages. Moreover, therapeutics that are used to target non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and are currently in late-stage clinical trials elicited similar outcomes in the LO platform and in human cohorts, demonstrating the potential for the co-culture system to be used for future evaluation of NAFLD pathogenesis, and potentially other chronic liver diseases, as well as for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy116. Currently, novel organoids platforms to model immune responses to viral infections in the lymphoid microenvironment are also being established. Lymphoid organoids proliferated from murine splenocytes has established a basis for in vitro induction of GC-like B cells, which could be applied to elucidate mechanisms of mounting humoral B cell immunity during viral infections in humans, as well as development of vaccines and antibody-based immunotherapy against viral diseases117. As immune co-culture organoid systems advance rapidly and become increasingly incorporated into viral disease studies, additional considerations need to be accounted for, such as high variability of immune responses between individuals to viral infections, depending on their immunological history118. For this, individualized co-culture platforms generated from patient tissues and paired-blood samples can be utilized (Fig. 3). Additionally, future studies on immunological responses to viral infection will have to optimize co-culture systems to faithfully recapitulate immune cell states during infection, and support long-term preservation of immune cells in culture.Fig. 3: “Next generation” organoid models for virus research.A Organ-on-a-chip. Microfluidic-based single or multiple organ-on-a-chip platforms engineered to contain vascular flow and spatiotemporal mechanical and chemical gradients can be used to model complex interactions between the epithelium, stroma, and circulating immune components during virus infection. Multi-organ “body” chips can additionally capture inter-organ crosstalk during infection to model systemic disease. B Immune co-culture. ASC or PSC organoids can be cultured with immune cells isolated from a paired-blood sample or generated from PSCs to capture immune-epithelial crosstalk during viral infections. C CRISPR/Cas9-gene edited organoids. Knock-out organoid biobanks can be used to screen for and identify host factors utilized by novel viruses for entry. Biobanks can be generated from CRISPR/Cas9-edited ASC organoids, or edited iPSC progenitors that are subsequently expanded clonally into PSC organoids. Figure created with BioRender.Full size imageOrgan-on-a-chipWhile existing organoid platforms show promise in representing viral disease pathogenesis in individual tissues or organs, they lack the ability to recapitulate systemic disease, which involves signaling cues and crosstalk between epithelium components and their surrounding microenvironment. A possible avenue to bridge these limitations is microfluidics-based organ chips. Minimalistic organ chips are generally composed of cells from a tissue of interest, an ECM interface and a neighboring vascular and/or connective tissues which are seeded onto interconnected flow-through chambers of a microfluidic device119,120,121. Since the first development of a lung alveolus organ chip, numerous designs have become available at pre-commercial and commercial stages, allowing for prototyping of cellular, tissue, and organ level responses for different viral diseases122,123,124,125.Perfused human gut chip platforms have been applied to study enteric virus infection. In addition to an intestinal epithelial layer, a model additionally incorporated a vascular channel that is separated from the epithelium by a porous matrix-coated membrane to generate continuous fluid flow through the intestinal lumen126. Under consistent perfusion and cyclic mechanical strain, spontaneous formation of a differentiated 3D epithelial layer with villus-like structures containing proliferative crypts, mucus-secreting, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells that resemble the in vivo intestinal epithelium was enabled. Reconstituted human airways consisting of differentiated airway epithelium cultured in parallel channels with pulmonary microvascular components was used to recapitulate epithelial and endothelium dysfunction as in human airways in vivo when inoculated with IAV. The airway chip has also been utilized to study human rhinovirus-induced exacerbation of asthma, characterizing immune cell transendothelial migration and hallmark inflammatory markers of the disease state127. Perfusable, endothelialized microvessel chips have shown promise for studying vascular dysfunction resulting from infection with haemorrhagic viruses. In addition to identifying vascular integrity loss and the resultant increase in vascular permeability following infusion of Ebola virus-like particles, the platform also identified activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway to be a mediator of cytoskeleton remodeling which resulted in albumin leakage from the engineered vessels128. These chip platforms can potentially offer a new avenue for uncovering pathophysiological mechanisms and provide a basis for identifying candidate therapeutics for haemorrhagic viruses, which otherwise would typically require non-human primate model studies in specialized animal BSL-4 facilities.Organ-on-a-chip technology can imbue drawbacks of existing organoid platforms, such as presence tissue barriers, vascular flow, spatiotemporal mechanical and chemical gradients as well as recruitment of circulating immune cells (Fig. 3). Recent efforts have further built upon existing chip technology to integrate multiple organs on the same platform to form “body chips”, allowing simulation of inter-organ communication and systemic function129,130. However, existing microfluidic chip platforms still have drawbacks, particularly since they often contain immortalized cell lines. Increasing effort towards advancing chip platforms to contain organoid-derived cells would help attain greater physiological likedness. Achieving in vitro platforms that can model viral disease to high physiological relevance with reproducibility is of great priority, particularly as organoids and organ-on-a-chip models are gaining increased traction in translational research as a substitute for animal testing131,132. Integrating human-derived stem cells into chip compositions could also allow for generation of individualized organ chips composed of homogenous genotypes, which can serve as platforms for personalized therapeutic development.ConclusionOver the past decade, organoid platforms have contributed important findings to virus research by addressing critical knowledge gaps in viral-host interaction and disease pathophysiology. These models have shown to be advantageous in their tractability and high human physiological relevance compared to other traditional experimental platforms. As organoids become increasingly prominent as in vitro models for virology studies, crucial shortcomings that exist in platforms need to be addressed. Novel approaches to improve existing organoid systems are currently being explored widely. Next-generation organoid platforms such as immune co-culture models that can emulate epithelial-immune crosstalk during viral infections, microfluidics-based organ chips that can capture systemic effects of viral disease, and CRISPR-edited organoids that allow for precise identification of host targets that modulate viral infections, show great promise to help refine organoid technology to better accommodate viral research studies.

Avian influenza infects wild birds such as geese, ducks, and shore birds, and can infect domestic poultry. The risk of transmission to humans is low as the virus does not typically pass from birds to humans. All residents are reminded to avoid contact with sick or dead wild or domestic birds. Protect yourself, your pets, and domestic birds: Do not handle or feed wild birds. Ensure pets are kept away from sick or dead birds or animals. Avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild birds. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after unavoidable contact with birds or their droppings. Protect backyard flocks from contact with wild birds. As another layer of protection, KFL&A Public Health recommends that all residents get their annual flu shot. Although seasonal influenza vaccine does not prevent infection with avian flu viruses, it can reduce the risk of getting sick with human and avian flu viruses at the same time. If handling sick or dead wild birds is unavoidable, the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends wearing gloves and avoiding contact with blood, body fluids and feces. Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and warm water or use hand sanitizer containing at least 60 per cent alcohol. Residents who find dead birds on private property are advised to double-bag bird carcasses and consult their municipality for disposal instructions. Dead birds found on municipal property can be reported to the local municipality for pick-up. Dead or sick bird sightings can also be reported to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative using their online reporting tool or by calling 1-866-673-4781.

(Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention) Flu case counts up in Maine, no new deaths By Sean Murphy Maine PUBLISHED 1:23 PM ET Feb. 08, 2024 PUBLISHED February 8, 2024 @1:23 PM SHARE Cases of influenza are on the rise in Maine, with the number of positive tests and hospitalizations each hitting season-high numbers last week, according to new data from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Maine CDC data shows 51 hospitalizations for the week ending Feb. 3. It is the highest recorded number since the flu season began in October 2023. The number of positive tests, 797, also represents the highest recorded number in a single week since the season began. Outpatient visits related to the flu, expressed in a percentage, are also up. According to Maine CDC, the figure reached 3.24%, which is close to the highest percentage recorded. Maine CDC also reported 10 outbreaks of influenza in the week ending Feb. 3. Maine CDC defines an outbreak as two or more people exhibiting symptoms in the same school or long-term care facility within 72 hours. To date, Maine has had 35 outbreaks of the disease statewide this season. So far, there have been 16 influenza-related deaths this season, but Maine CDC data shows no new deaths in the week ending Feb. 3.

More than a third of all states are still experiencing high or very high levels of respiratory illness this season, according to the CDC. Jacob Wackerhausen/iStockphoto/Getty Images CNN — After a few weeks of decline, some measures show that flu activity is starting to pick up again and respiratory virus levels remain high overall in the United States. During the week ending January 27, more than 82,000 people who visited an emergency department were diagnosed with influenza, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an 8% bump, or about 6,000 more than the week before. The test positivity rate for flu also ticked up in the US overall. A sign advertises COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine shots at a Walgreens Pharmacy in Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S., August 14, 2023. REUTERS/Brian Snyder Brian Snyder/Reuters Related article Latest Covid-19 vaccine offers strong protection against symptomatic infection, including from JN.1, early CDC data shows A second surge of flu activity after the winter holidays is common, but experts say it’s notoriously difficult to predict exactly how long or how severe the full season will be. Sometimes this surge is the start of a full second wave, but it could also be a minor blip before a more consistent decrease, the CDC says. Video Ad Feedback 'Body aches, fever': Doctor distinguishes difference between Covid and flu (2023) 01:49 - Source: CNN A traditional second wave of influenza usually comes after a more significant downturn, when influenza B viruses start to overtake influenza A viruses that were predominantly circulating, said Alicia Budd, who leads domestic flu surveillance for the CDC. There’s no evidence of that happening yet, but it’s too early to rule anything out, she said. “We’re still at the midpoint of the season,” Budd said. “It’s too early to tell exactly where we are in our ultimate trajectory. We just don’t know yet. But we are still seeing a lot of activity right now.” Covid-19 and RSV also continue to circulate at high levels. Emergency department visits for Covid-19 and RSV have been declining for a month, but there were still more than 50,000 emergency department visits and about 23,000 hospitalizations for Covid-19 during the week ending January 27, CDC data shows. The downward trend for Covid-19 is coming as expected, and the peak for flu may be shifting a bit later this season, said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and chief science officer of eMed, a telehealth company focused on at-home testing. “It’s not so much that flu is now replacing Covid, it’s just like: Covid did its thing and now it’s coming down,” he said. “(Covid is) doing exactly the identical thing as it’s done, and in this case, we just have a flu season that shifted a little bit to the right. Flu shifts by orders of months actually from year to year. Covid is a little bit more consistent.” Video Ad Feedback Dr. Gupta's bottom line advice if you have Covid-19 right now (2023) 02:04 - Source: CNN While national trends are helpful, expert say that local trends are the best way to gauge risk and make decisions about how to stay safe and healthy. Overall, 18 states and Washington, DC, are still experiencing high or very high levels of respiratory illness, according to the CDC. New data from the CDC’s Center for Forecasting Analytics suggests that flu infections are growing in four states — Florida, New York, Oklahoma and Texas — and likely growing in five others: Arkansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, North Carolina and South Carolina. Wastewater surveillance suggests that Covid-19 levels are highest in the South, with forecasted case increases in South Carolina, in particular.

Experts say that trends in the US have stayed within expected ranges so far this respiratory virus season. But the burden of disease is still very high. The CDC estimates that there have been at least 20 million illnesses, 230,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths from flu so far this season. “It’s normal in terms of the amount of activity but it is a very, very high burden,” Budd said. There is early data to suggest that the latest Covid-19 vaccine and this year’s flu shot offer strong protection this season, and experts say it’s still not too late to get vaccinated. They also urge the public to practice etiquette — hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when sick — to avoid unnecessary spread. “That’s how we can help each other,” Budd said.

(Herald file photo) By Rick Sobey | rick.sobey@bostonherald.com | Boston HeraldUPDATED: February 6, 2024 at 7:00 PM ESTCanada geese are reportedly dropping dead in parts of the Bay State, as the bird flu virus spreads around the region.MassWildlife over the past few days has gotten reports of dead and dying Canada geese in Essex County and the surrounding coastal areas.These wild birds showed symptoms that are in line with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. Several samples have been collected for bird flu testing, and results are pending.This comes as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza has been detected in Essex County, according to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources’ Division of Animal Health.State agencies have depopulated and disposed of a non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flock (non-poultry) in Essex County due to the virus. Birds at the site died suddenly without exhibiting any other clinical signs consistent with the virus, and samples tested positive for the disease.“MDAR advises backyard and commercial poultry owners to practice strong biosecurity measures to prevent domestic poultry from having contact with wild birds, their feathers, and droppings,” the state agency said.“The HPAI virus is continuing to circulate in the wild bird population, particularly in wild waterfowl,” MDAR added. “Eliminating standing water and preventing domestic birds from having access to ponds, streams, and wetland areas that attract wild waterfowl is of critical importance.”While people are rarely infected with avian influenza viruses, humans who have prolonged close contact with sick or dead birds infected with the virus are at highest risk of becoming infected. “Officials are urging the public not to handle or feed any birds suspected of being infected,” MDAR said. “Pet owners should also prevent their dogs from making contact with wild birds.”People can report sick or dead domestic birds by calling 617-626-1795 or online via the Poultry Disease Reporting Form: www.mass.gov/forms/poultry-disease-reporting-form.Also, people can report sick or dead wild birds online at www.mass.gov/formseport-observations-of-dead-wild-birds.

Here's what's really going on, according to experts.By Julia RiesOn Assignment For HuffPostFeb 9, 2024, 03:01 AM ESTLEAVE A COMMENTvisualspace via Getty ImagesInfluenza cases are definitely more prominent this year, and experts have a few theories.If you suspected this flu season is rougher than previous ones, you’re not imagining it. Last season, flu activity had already peaked and was on the downfall by early January. This year, influenza continues to surge across the country and send tens of thousands of people to the doctor. Flu estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that 20 million to 39 million people have been sickened by the flu, up to 18 million have visited a doctor, up to 490,000 have been hospitalized and anywhere from 14,000 to 43,000 have died so far this flu season, from Oct. 1 to Jan. 27. Advertisement “That is a large impact from this season,” noted Alicia Budd, the CDC’s team lead for domestic flu surveillance.Though it’s tough to pinpoint any single reason for this season’s bustling flu activity, flu experts shed light here on what’s going on ― and why this flu season is setting records.Advertisement The flu is sending tons of people to the hospital. The first thing doctors are seeing this flu season: a lot of hospitalizations. The hospitalization rate recorded at the end of December was the the third-highest peak for flu-related hospitalizations recorded since the 2010-2011 flu season, according to Dr. Robert H. Hopkins Jr., the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). The cumulative hospitalization rate for the season is currently 47.8 per 100,000 people — that’s the fourth-highest rate for this time of year since the 2010-11 season. Advertisement “We’ve had high rates of emergency department visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations across the country,” Hopkins said. Adults 60 and older and kids younger than 5 are seeing the highest hospitalization rates. We haven’t seen quite as many deaths as in past seasons, according to Hopkins, but the data on deaths tends to lag, and we may very well see an uptick in flu-related deaths in the coming weeks. Though flu activity dipped slightly over the past few weeks, influenza continues to surge in the South, the Northeast, the Mountain West and the West Coast.The majority of flu cases this year have been caused by influenza A H1N1, a strain that tends to hit children and adults harder than influenza A H3N2, which typically is more severe in older adults, Budd said. Some data suggests that people infected with influenza A H1N1 are more likely to be admitted to intensive care, require mechanical ventilation or die. “Different strains affect people differently,” Hopkins said. We are also seeing an increase in cases caused by influenza B/Victoria, a strain that’s been linked to severe in-hospital outcomes. It’s unclear if the flu activity has peaked or if another wave will hit. There may very well be five to six more weeks left of flu season, Hopkins said.Advertisement SDI Productions via Getty ImagesIt's not too late to get your flu shot.Alarmingly low vaccination rates are fueling the spread.First, some good news: This year’s flu shot appears to be a strong match against the circulating strains, which include H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria, according to Hopkins. This means the shot is effective at preventing illness and, most important, reducing the severity of the infection and the risk of complications in those who do get sick. “It’s looks like the vaccine is pretty good,” Hopkins said.The problem is that flu vaccination rates are abnormally low this season. There continue to be racial disparities in vaccine coverage, and rates are lowest in rural communities and among those with low socioeconomic status.Lower vaccination rates mean more people aren’t protected and there are greater opportunities for the virus to spread. “If more people around you are spreading the virus, then the vaccine protects you from severe illness but it may not protect you as well against catching flu just because of the frequency of exposure and the number of exposures,” Hopkins explained. Advertisement It’s not too late to get your flu shot. Past flu seasons have lasted as late as May. As long as there is still flu activity (which there is), it’s smart to get vaccinated, Budd said.Take care of yourself if you get the flu.If you get sick with the flu, stick with the age-old advice: Get plenty of rest, drink fluids and keep a distance from other people while you recover. There are over-the-counter pain and fever reducers, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen, that can alleviate symptoms. Hopkins stressed it’s important to check in with your doctor before taking these because there are some conditions — such as kidney and liver disease and ulcers — that can worsen with some pain relievers.

Checking your oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter can also be useful. “If someone has a saturation below 90%, that would be a reason to touch base with your provider, even if you don’t feel short of breath,” Hopkins said. According to Hopkins, scheduling a telehealth appointment is a reasonable step for people who have milder symptoms or aren’t at risk for severe illness, though he adds a disclaimer: It’s really hard to tell how sick someone is through a video visit, and you may still have to go to your doctor’s office for a follow-up. Here’s when to schedule an in-person appointment: You have trouble breathing, you can’t control your fever, you are experiencing confusion or you were getting better but suddenly the fever returned and symptoms worsened. “Those are times you need to contact your health care provider right away,” Hopkins said. Advertisement If you test positive for flu, there are effective antiviral medications available that can shorten the course of your illness. They work best when you start them as soon as possible. Severe chest pain, extreme shortness of breath and loss of consciousness warrant a call to 911 or a trip to the emergency room.Finally, don’t be alarmed if your symptoms linger. It’s common for people to have a cough or congestion for up to two weeks, especially older adults and people with lung disease, Hopkins said. It takes some time for your immune system to settle down after revving up. Plus, the dry air doesn’t help, he said, and there’s always a chance you may have picked up another virus. Don’t let your guard down just yet — there’s no way of telling just how long this flu season is going to last.Relatedflu seasonWhat's The Deal With That Cough Everyone Seems To Have Right Now?These COVID Symptoms Are Red Flags That You Need Medical AttentionWhy Do My Symptoms Go Away Once I Arrive At My Doctor's Office?

To overcome this damage, the lungs depend on the regenerative capacities of vascular endothelial cells. As valuable as these cells are, they can, according to University of Pennsylvania scientists, benefit from a little help. The scientists, led by Andrew Vaughan, PhD, focused on a repair pathway involving vascular endothelial growth factor α (Vegfa) and the TGF-β receptor 2 (TGF-βR2). Using animal models and human tissue samples, the scientists showed that delivering Vegfa via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) greatly enhances modes of repair for damaged blood vessels. Details were published recently in Science Translational Medicine, in an article titled, “TGF-βR2 signaling coordinates pulmonary vascular repair after viral injury in mice and human tissue.” “Mice deficient in endothelial Tgfbr2 exhibited prolonged injury and diminished vascular repair,” the article’s authors wrote. “Loss of endothelial Tgfbr2 prevented autocrine Vegfa expression, reduced endothelial proliferation, and impaired renewal of aerocytes thought to be critical for alveolar gas exchange.” “We developed a lipid nanoparticle that targets the pulmonary endothelium, Lung-LNP (LuLNP),” the authors continued. “Delivery of Vegfa mRNA, a critical TGF-βR2 downstream effector, by LuLNPs improved the impaired regeneration phenotype of endothelial cell Tgfbr2 deficiency during influenza injury.” Vaughan’s team and other investigators had previously shown that endothelial cells are among the unsung heroes in repairing the lungs after viral infections. But Vaughan’s team noted that its work demonstrated that a “more granular understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving reconstitution of lung endothelium” could inform efforts to facilitate therapeutic vascular repair. “Here we’ve identified and isolated pathways involved in repairing this tissue, delivered mRNA to endothelial cells, and consequently observed enhanced recovery of the damaged tissue,” Vaughan said. “These findings hint at a more efficient way to promote lung recovery after diseases like COVID-19.” The team found Vegfa’s involvement in this recovery, while building on work in which they used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify TGF-βR2 as a major signaling pathway. The researchers saw that when TGF-βR2 was missing, it stopped the activation of Vegfa. This lack of signal made the blood vessel cells less able to multiply and renew themselves, which is vital for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the tiny air sacs of the lungs. “We’d known there was a link between these two pathways, but this motivated us to see if delivering Vegfa mRNA into endothelial cells could improve lung recovery after disease-related injury,” said first author Gan Zhao, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Vaughan laboratory. The Vaughan laboratory then reached out to Michael J. Mitchell, PhD, of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, whose laboratory specializes in LNPs, to see if delivery of this mRNA cargo would be feasible. “LNPs have been great for vaccine delivery and have proven incredibly effective delivery vehicles for genetic information,” said Mitchell, who is an associate professor of bioengineering at Penn Engineering and a co-author of the paper. “But the challenge here was to get the LNPs into the bloodstream without them heading to the liver, which is where they tend to congregate as its porous structure lends favor to substances passing from the blood into hepatic cells for filtration. So, we had to devise a way to specifically target the endothelial cells in the lungs.” The Mitchell laboratory’s LNPs proved effective in delivering Vegfa into endothelial cells, and as a result, the researchers saw a marked improvement in vascular recovery in their animal models. Within the animal models, the researchers saw improved oxygen levels, and in some, the treatment helped them recover their weight better than the control group. These treated mice also had less lung inflammation, shown by lower levels of certain markers in their lung fluid, and their lungs showed less damage and scarring, with more healthy blood vessels. “We’re looking forward to testing this delivery platform for other cell types in the lung, and it will be important to evaluate whether TGF-βR2 signaling is important in other injury contexts including chronic conditions like emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,” Vaughan said. “With this proof-of-concept being well validated, we’re sure that we’ll pave the way for new mRNA-based strategies for treating lung injury.” NewsCOVID-19InfluenzaNanoparticlesRNA-based therapeuticsSARS-CoV-2Signaling pathwaySingle-cell RNA sequencingVascular endothelial growth factor Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleVilcek Foundation Announce Prizes in Biomedical ScienceNext articleUltragenyx’s Gene Therapy Ameliorates Pediatric Neurodegenerative Disorder Kevin Mayer Also of Interest Wet AMD Treatments Could Work Better If Both VEGF and ANGPTL4 Are Targeted Direct RNA Sequencing Supports Novel Discoveries in RNA Biology Improving the Manufacture of mRNA Biologics Navigating the RNA Lipid Nanoparticle Landscape Ready to Fight Future Pandemics Prenatal Gene Therapy via LNPs Shows Promise in Model of Neurodevelopmental Disorder Related Media Space Race: 10x CEO Serge Saxonov Discusses Single Cell and Spatial Biology on “Close to the Edge” Perfect Pitch: Genome Editing Pioneer Fyodor Urnov on Commercializing CRISPR Therapies and Epigenomic Tuning Emerging Markets Collaborate to Succeed in Post-Pandemic World Dr. Fauci Reflects on His 54 Year Career at the NIH How COVID-19 Forever Changed the In Vitro Diagnostics Marketplace Lessons from the COVID Crisis: An Interview with Peter Hotez Related Content Wet AMD Treatments Could Work Better If Both VEGF and ANGPTL4 Are Targeted Direct RNA Sequencing Supports Novel Discoveries in RNA Biology Improving the Manufacture of mRNA Biologics Navigating the RNA Lipid Nanoparticle Landscape Read the Digital Edition ExploreAbout GEN Contact GEN GEN Staff Editorial Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Scientific Advisory Board AdvertiseMedia Kit and Planning Calendar Advertising Terms and Conditions ResourcesGet the GEN Magazine Get the GEN Email Newsletter Inside Precision Medicine Privacy Policy Copyright © 2024 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

(WITN) - A commercial turkey flock in Lenoir County has tested positive for high-path avian influenza.According to the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the case is the first of high-path avian influenza in a commercial flock in North Carolina since 2022 when it was found at nine poultry farms in Johnston and Wayne counties.This type of avian flu is considered a low risk to people according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control but is highly contagious to other birds, including commercial and backyard flocks of poultry.“It is unfortunate that we have this outbreak in a North Carolina poultry farm at this time,” said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler, “but we have handled this before, we have trained, and we have good partners. I am confident that we are as prepared as any state in the country to handle this.”“With HPAI in the wild bird population and other cases around the country, commercial operators and backyard flock owners have remained on heightened watch for any signs of the virus in their flocks,” said State Veterinarian Mike Martin. “Under HPAI protocols, we will be actively testing other flocks within the 10-kilometer zone or about 6.2 miles in collaboration with our federal and industry partners.”“The threat of high-path avian influenza is statewide,” said Martin. “Our poultry population is at high risk. Commercial operations and backyard flock owners should continue to follow strict biosecurity measures including keeping birds enclosed without access to wild birds or other domestic flocks. If your flock is experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away to your local veterinarian, the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Division, 919-707-3250, or the N.C. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System 919-733-3986.”Copyright 2024 WITN.

Home / What You Can Do to Fend Off the Stomach FluPediatricsPrimary CareWhat You Can Do to Fend Off the Stomach Flu February 05, 2024When stomach flu hits, it hits hard. The initial stages start with chills, fever, and nausea, which transition into vomiting, diarrhea, and severe aches and pains. Unfortunately, once the stomach flu makes a stop at your house, it has to run its course. It’s awful, and there is no cure but there are a few things you can do to try to fend it off. What is Gastroenteritis or the “Stomach Flu”?It’s easy to get confused about the difference between influenza, or “the flu,” and gastroenteritis, better known as “the stomach flu.” The stomach flu is not caused by the influenza virus, which gives you the seasonal flu. Getting the flu shot does not prevent you from getting the stomach flu, but it does prevent you from getting influenza.“Stomach flu” or gastroenteritis is not the flu at all. Instead, the term refers to a group of infections that cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. Gastroenteritis is caused by a number of viruses, mainly norovirus, which accounts for more than 50 percent of all cases, and others, like rotavirus. Bacteria, such salmonella and E. coli, can also be to blame. Viral gastroenteritis is contagious. It is spread through close contact with infected persons or by touching surfaces contaminated by an infected person and then touching one’s mouth. You’re most likely to get viral gastroenteritis when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. You may also be likely to get gastroenteritis if you share utensils, towels or food with someone who has one of the viruses that cause the condition.“The stomach flu is spread by the fecal-oral route, which means the viruses from infected feces or vomit find their way into our mouths from either touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face or eating/drinking contaminated foods and/or water. Compared to other viruses, noroviruses can live for days on household surfaces, which is why they spread easily,” said Lisa Nwokolo, a Nurse Practitioner with West Tennessee Medical Group. Treatment & PreventionThere’s no effective treatment for viral gastroenteritis, so prevention is key. If you know the stomach flu is going around, take extra precautions. Some basic ways to avoid getting the stomach flu include washing your hands regularly, keeping your hands away from your mouth, avoiding any food or water that may be contaminated and getting plenty of rest. Avoid close contact with infected people if possible.People can also reduce their chance of getting infected by prompt disinfection of contaminated surfaces as well as prompt washing of soiled articles of clothing. Persons who have viral gastroenteritis should not prepare food for other people while they have symptoms and for 48 hours after recovery from illness.Some other tips if the stomach bug makes a stop at your home:Use the dishwasher instead of washing dishes by hand when possible.Use soap and water instead of hand sanitizer.Keep a sick family member isolated. Restrict them to one bathroom and have the rest of the household use another.Clean countertops and surfaces with a disinfectant spray and be sure to wash clothes and bedding as well.Symptoms“Stomach flu symptoms include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea,” said Nwokolo. “A low-grade fever, chills and muscle aches aren’t uncommon to experience as well. Symptoms can start as little as 12 hours after exposure. These symptoms can last anywhere from one to 14 days, and unfortunately, the stomach flu is extremely contagious.”Nwokolo noted that while food poisoning symptoms can mirror those of the stomach flu, if your symptoms are caused by food poisoning, they tend to occur within hours after eating something. “If you can recall eating something questionable, or if others who ate the same thing as you and have similar symptoms, you probably have food poisoning,” she said. “If you are the only one who got sick, you more than likely picked up a viral illness.” There is no specific treatment for the stomach flu. People can usually manage stomach flu symptoms with home remedies such as resting, drinking fluids, and eating certain foods. Home treatment can help prevent dehydration and ease symptoms. Rest may give the body time to recover and heal. If you or someone in your home has signs of the stomach flu and home remedies are not helping, it is time to see the doctor.

After being diagnosed with bronchitis, subsequent laboratory analyses confirmed it as swine flu A(H1N1)v. The ECDC informs that the patient has fully recovered, and to date, no new cases have been detected among close contacts or among the worker's colleagues at the farm. SMC Spain 06/02/2024 - 18:20 CET Versión en castellano Expert reactions María Montoya - cerdos María Montoya Researcher in the Viral Immunology: Therapies and Vaccines group at the Margarita Salas Biological Research Center. Centre for Biological Research Margarita Salas - CSIC Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain The natural reservoirs of the influenza virus are aquatic birds. Different influenza viruses are capable of infecting birds and mammals, including humans and pigs, but they also infect sea lions, seals, horses, dogs... Influenza viruses that infect humans and pigs often have many similarities and can easily jump from humans to pigs. In fact, when analyzing the influenza viruses found on a pig farm, human influenza viruses are often detected. People who have more contact with these animals, such as farm workers, can transmit the viruses to the animals and become infected with the influenza viruses carried by the pigs. In fact, the virus of the first pandemic of the 21st century was a swine-origin influenza virus, an H1N1. The risks to the community are the same as those posed by circulating influenza viruses. The problem arises when a swine or human virus 'recombine' with another influenza virus. This gives rise to new viruses, such as the pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009. To prevent community risks, the most important thing is to conduct epidemiological surveillance of circulating viruses on farms and of people who are in contact with sick animals. This way, necessary measures can be implemented to protect both animals and people. Cases of swine influenza viruses infecting humans and vice versa are relatively common in people who have contact with infected animals. It should not be a cause for social alarm as long as we remain vigilant for possible new 'recombinant' viruses or new viruses with mutations. That's why it's so important to stay vigilant. The author has not responded to our request to declare conflicts of interest Language EN José Lliliane - cerdos José Ignacio Núñez Researcher. Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA) Llilianne Ganges Researcher. Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA) Science Media Centre Spain Is it likely that there will be more cases? "It is not likely; sporadically, humans can become infected with swine influenza viruses circulating in pig farms, but it is not common. Likewise, personnel in contact with animals should maintain biosecurity measures and it is recommended that they receive influenza vaccination, which reduces the likelihood of infection. Furthermore, the capacity for person-to-person transmission is very small." What are the risks for the community? "Due to this low capacity for human-to-human transmission, it does not pose a special risk. The symptomatology can vary from mild to that produced by common flu, so it is not expected to constitute a relevant problem." Are cases of humans affected by the A(H1N1)v virus common? "The pandemic A(H1N1) virus has been circulating seasonally in humans since it emerged in 2009 and spread globally. Subsequently, humans have transmitted the virus to pig populations where it also circulates, now predominantly, along with the usual pig subtypes. Swine influenza virus commonly circulates in pig populations. Sporadically, it can be transmitted to humans, mainly personnel in direct contact with the animals, via airborne route. It cannot be transmitted through consumption of pork products, so there is no risk of foodborne infection. When this jump occurs, it usually does not spread among humans; it has a low capacity for person-to-person transmission. The symptomatology is usually mild, or similar to common flu, which is why the origin of the virus often goes unnoticed. A different case was what happened with the pandemic A(H1N1) influenza virus in 2009. This virus, which had segments from avian, human, and swine viruses, jumped to humans causing a pandemic. It spread globally and humans have transmitted it to the pig population. In 2021, a scientific article was published by a group in China that identified a circulating virus in pigs with pandemic potential, but since then, no outbreak in humans has been reported. However, it is essential to know the viruses circulating in pig populations to analyze their genome. At IRTA-CReSA, we study the evolution of swine influenza virus to analyze if it is capable of escaping vaccination or how vaccination affects this evolution. Thus, we have corroborated that vaccination reduces the circulation of the virus, although it does not prevent its replication, and, most importantly, that vaccination reduces the capacity for virus recombination when co-infection with two different viruses occurs. This recombination of the influenza virus, which is due to its segmented genome, is responsible, along with its genomic variability, for the difficulty in controlling influenza." The author has not responded to our request to declare conflicts of interest Language EN Gustavo del Real - gripe porcina Cataluña EN Gustavo del Real Researcher at the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis and Transmission (CRIPT) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA and researcher at the National Institute for Agrarian and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain Swine influenza or swine influenza type A is endemic throughout the world and in Spain, Europe's leading producer of pigs, up to four different subtypes of this virus are circulating: H1N1, H1N2, H3N1 and H3N2. There is a certain affinity between swine and human influenza viruses and, in fact, there have been well-documented reciprocal transmissions for as long as this infectious disease has been known. When the genetic make-up of the different human and swine influenza viruses is analysed, this infectious promiscuity is clearly reflected in their respective phylogenetic trees. A worker at a pig farm in Lleida has just reported a punctual infection with a swine virus of the H1N1 subtype. The infection presented moderate symptoms typical of influenza and the causative virus could be identified in the nasal exudate. This is an isolated case and no transmission of the virus to other persons close to the patient has been reported. The last case similar to this one in Spain occurred in 2022 in a person from Navarra who also had contact with infected pigs. Since 2011, 19 cases have been reported in Europe and a total of 73 worldwide. It should be emphasised that these episodes come to light by chance, so the true incidence of swine-to-human virus transmission is not known exactly. In any case, this one-off case is a further warning that it is perfectly possible and not very unlikely that new strains of swine flu could be introduced into the human population on a stable basis, either directly or by combining with human strains, with the risk of causing a new pandemic like the one that occurred in 2009. It is therefore essential to implement epidemiological surveillance programmes specifically designed to detect this type of zoonosis immediately in order to be able to stop and/or prevent outbreaks leading to epidemics or pandemics with incalculable consequences.

The average school absenteeism rate last week was 8.44% among public schools. Columbia County’s school absentee rate was 6.33 percent. Lafayette County absenteeism was 5.84 percent. Other area county percentages were Nevada, 8.74; Ouachita, 9.36; and Union, 9.58.Arkansas has reported 40 influenza-related deaths in the 2023-24 flu season – 11 of the deaths were reported last week. Nationally, CDC estimates that there have been at least 20 million illnesses, 230,000 hospitalizations, and 14,000 deaths from flu so far this season.Arkansas reported no COVID-19-related deaths last week with a total of 699 deaths in 2023 and 66 since January 1, 2024.This flu season, 14 influenza outbreaks have been reported from nursing homes or other congregate setting institutions in Arkansas.The Arkansas Department of Health the Weekly Viral Respiratory Diseases Report. The report provides information on Influenza, COVID-19 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) activity in the state. The report also compares activities in Arkansas to the U.S. ADH receives reports of only a fraction of COVID-19 cases and flu cases since it only requires reports of flu hospitalizations, deaths, and outbreaks. RSV is not a reportable disease in Arkansas.Information in the weekly update is representative of the timing and location of activity, but it does not reflect the overall disease burden. It is presumed that there are many more people actually affected than the report shows. Click an emoticon to express your reaction to this article.

Hydration, fever control and rest is typically what we advise, and it takes about a week to feel better. We also are continuing to see burns from space heaters, including burns from house fires occurring due to overheated electrical circuits from portable electrical heating devices. People need to be so careful when deciding to use these devices.”Dr. Christopher Loewe -- Ascension St. John Hospital“We’re seeing a lot of children and adults with strep throat and the flu. If you get sick with flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care. In children look out for a fever over 100 degrees along with chest pain. That’s a warning sign to get medical care quickly. I’m also seeing patients with viral infections. The symptoms include runny nose, sore throat and cough. Children are at a high risk for these infections since they are often with other children who may be carrying a virus. Children may also wash their hands less frequently than adults.”Dr. Jennifer Stevenson -- Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Fairlane“We’ve seen a lot of strep, pharyngitis — especially in kids. We continue to see COVID-19 infections, and actually have had, a modest increase in the number that we’ve had to admit to the hospital. There’s a viral upper respiratory infection that’s been going around, also a viral gastritis. I anticipate the spring bloom is upon us, and we will start to see more asthma, exacerbation. It’s super important that our asthmatics, ensure that they have the rescue medication’s that they require on hand.”Oakland County – Influenza, Covid, RSV, pink eye, stomach viruses, strep throatDr. Steven McGraw -- Chair of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Southfield & Novi Campus“I am navigating patients testing positive for COVID-19 and the flu. I’m seeing a few hospitalizations. Patients with gastrointestinal viruses are pretty common right now with symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. Lastly, I’m seeing patients with strep throat and sinus infections.”Dr. Adam Vieder -- Emergency medicine physician, Corewell Health Farmington Hills“We are still seeing quite a bit of influenza A, Covid, and RSV. Many of the patients are well enough to be discharged home after ED care but some of those with significant comorbidities or in an immunocompromise state have required hospitalization.The recommendation and message to the community would be to continue practicing good hand hygiene, if you feel sick, don’t go out in public, but if you must, make sure to wear a mask as they do help reduce the potential spread of any viruses.”Dr. Susan Bork -- Director of Operations, Emergency, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital in Royal Oak“The warmer weather has leveled off the numbers of influenza, COVID and RSV infections but we still do see those circulating. Pink eye infections have also gone up on the less urgent side. Continue to take precautions of hand washing and avoid those with active infections. "Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“This week I have seen many patients with asthma exacerbations. A reminder to asthmatics to be compliant with home inhaler regimen. Asthma attacks are commonly complicated by upper respiratory infections and allergies. Smokers should stop smoking and patients should avoid known triggers when possible. "Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We’re seeing flu-like symptoms, respiratory symptoms and cardiac issues.”Washtenaw County– Influenza, RSV, stomach virusesDr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“In the Peds emergency department, we are still seeing a lot of viral gastrointestinal infections that cause vomiting and diarrhea. Also, we are still seeing a fair amount of influenza with some dwindling RSV.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Respiratory illnesses, influenza, Covid, strep throat, pneumoniaProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“This week at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital, we are seeing patients coming in with respiratory illnesses, influenza A and B, strep, pneumonia, and COVID-19.”Macomb County – Influenza, pneumonia, upper respiratory viruses, Covid, RSV, sinus infectionsDr. Richard Reidy -- Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb“There has been a significant increase in positive flu cases, presenting with symptoms of body aches and fatigue and, in some cases, nausea and vomiting. Several cases of pneumonia have been treated in patients experiencing a cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. Cases of viral upper respiratory infections continue to be the most common reason for seeking care in the emergency department, with symptoms of persistent cough, congestion, and fever.”Dr. Maria Samuel -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Sterling Heights“We’re seeing COVID-19, influenza, RSV and sinus infections from upper respiratory infections going around this week.”Livingston County -- Did not report this weekCopyright 2023 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Three of the people who died were from New Castle County, two were from Sussex County and one was from Kent County, the division said.The first suspected flu-related death of the season was recorded in December.The state has counted a total of 3,594 flu cases this season, with 379 new cases reported in the week ending Jan. 20, the last time the data was updated. There have been 110 flu-related hospitalizations this season as of Jan. 24, according to the state.In the 2022 flu season, only two flu-related deaths were recorded, according to health officials.While there appears to have been an increase in flu-related deaths over the past two seasons, a state spokesperson said that because the department moved away from "voluntary death data input," the numbers may not be comparable.In previous years, hospitals would notify state health officials of flu deaths, but there was no formal process or "official method of capturing," a spokesperson said.Who is vaccinatedLess than 1 in 3 Delawareans received the latest flu vaccine, the state reported. The only demographic with a vaccination rate of over 30% is people 65 years or older, with 65% of the age range having gotten their flu shots. Delawareans between 18 and 34 years old had the lowest flu vaccination rate at only 13.4%.During the 2022 flu season, 34.6% of Delawareans got their flu shots, according to state data. The percentage of each age range vaccinated remained roughly the same overall.Respiratory illnesses like the flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been on the rise in Delaware in recent months, prompting multiple health care systems to reinstate mask mandates.Anyone seeking additional information about the flu, how to stay safe or where to get vaccinated can call 800-282-8672 or visit flu.delaware.gov.MORE: How Delaware is addressing link between domestic violence, animal abuseSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

Activate your Online Access NowArticle contentSandy Pines Wildlife Centre in Napanee is answering calls about and receiving sick birds from Kingston, Prince Edward County and communities in between.Leah Birmingham, the centre’s assistant director, said the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative has been monitoring avian influenza for years and warned that rates were likely to increase.“We haven’t really been hit as hard as we’re getting hit now,” Birmingham told the Whig-Standard on Friday. “We are seeing more sick and dead birds this year, for sure.”In the Kingston region, the infection is largely affecting Canada geese, who live in large social groups, Birmingham said.Sick geese being brought to Sandy Pines are humanely euthanized, she said, to prevent other birds in the centre — such as their resident raptors — from becoming sick.The Kingston Whig-Standard's Noon News RoundupYour weekday lunchtime roundup of curated links, news highlights, analysis and features.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

I think the risk is relatively low for the average person, but someone who works in the poultry industry, it is a big concern from a financial perspective for poultry farms.” Leah Birmingham, Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre’s medical director, left, and Sandy Pines staff member Adriana Larios examine a Canada goose brought in to the wildlife centre in Napanee on Dec. 9, 2023. Photo by Meghan Balogh /The Whig-StandardCommercial poultry farms a concernThe potential threat to domestic poultry is very real, Birmingham said.“This can certainly devastate,” she said. “If you have a poultry farm and you get this into whatever species that you’re farming, it can be incredibly devastating quickly, and often in order to deal with it you have to cull everybody.”Advertisement 4Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentA news release from Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox and Addington Public Health on Friday said the avian influenza virus, also known as bird blu, has been confirmed in deceased Canada geese found in Lake Ontario Park in Kingston.“Avian influenza infects wild birds such as geese, ducks and shore birds, and can infect domestic poultry,” the public health agency said in its news release. “The risk of transmission to humans is low as the virus does not typically pass from birds to humans. All residents are reminded to avoid contact with sick or dead wild or domestic birds.”South Frontenac Township sent out a news release on Friday confirming bird flu has been found in Kingston and reminding residents that farmers or owners of backyard flocks and pet birds should follow biosecurity guidelines set out by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.Advertisement 5Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is also monitoring avian influenza because of its potential impact on Canada’s food system.Specifically, the agency is keeping a close eye on the confirmed presence of H5N1 in Canada, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).As of Feb. 6, 2024, the CFIA believes that more than 11 million domestic poultry have been affected by HPAI across Canada to date. Those numbers include farms that experienced infections in years past.In recent months, most domestic poultry instances of the virus are in commercial flocks in British Columbia and Alberta, but the virus is showing up on the East Coast in early 2024, with farms in Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario being listed as active primary control zones.Advertisement 6Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentThe CFIA said the virus “is not a food safety concern.”“There is no evidence to suggest that eating cooked poultry or eggs could transmit HPAI to humans,” the agency stated on its website.HPAI not yet identified in KingstonBirmingham said that while avian flu is confirmed in the Kingston region, it has not yet been identified as HPAI.“Whether or not this is the highly pathogenic form, they’re still determining that,” she said. “But we do know without a doubt that the birds that were killed in Kingston were killed because of avian influenza.”Birmingham said people who find dead birds on public property should contact their municipality, as some have protocols for cleanup.On private land, the current recommendation is to double bag a bird carcass and put it in the garbage, avoiding making contact with blood, body fluids or feces. A bird carcass can also be buried three metres deep.Advertisement 7Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentLocal public health urges residents to keep their pets away from sick or dead birds or animals, to avoid handling or feeding wild birds, and to wash hands thoroughly after contact with birds or their droppings.The Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative would like to hear about observed sick or dead birds. Local residents can report to the organization via its online reporting tool, or by calling 1-866-673-4781.Birmingham asked that people who reach out to Sandy Pines have patience with the organization’s volunteers as they work to deal with all of the sick bird calls.“I’ve just been letting people know that we’re helping out the best we can,” she said. “We are a not-for-profit that is volunteer-based. I don’t want people to think that we can necessarily dispatch someone immediately.“Everyone wants us to get there to help end the suffering for these animals, but it’s just not always feasible because there just aren’t the resources or the ability to be there right away.”mbalogh@postmedia.comArticle contentShare this article in your social network Share this Story : Avian influenza taking toll on local Canada goose population Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Stephen Ausmus d655-55 A commercial turkey operation in Lenoir County has tested positive for High Path Avian Influenza. The positive sample was first identified by the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Diagnostic Lab in Raleigh and confirmed by the USDA APHIS National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa. This is the first case of high path avian influenza in commercial poultry in North Carolina since 2022 when HPAI was found at nine poultry farms in Johnston and Wayne counties. “It is unfortunate that we have this outbreak in a North Carolina poultry farm at this time,” said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler, “but we have handled this before, we have trained, and we have good partners. I am confident that we are as prepared as any state in the country to handle this.” This type of HPAI virus is considered a low risk to people according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, but is highly contagious to other birds, including commercial and backyard flocks of poultry. The virus is also not considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food supply. “With HPAI in the wild bird population and other cases around the country, commercial operators and backyard flock owners have remained on heightened watch for any signs of the virus in their flocks,” said State Veterinarian Mike Martin. “Under HPAI protocols, we will be actively testing other flocks within the 10-kilometer zone (about 6.2 miles) in collaboration with our federal and industry partners. “The threat of high path avian influenza is statewide,” said Martin. “Our poultry population is at high risk. Commercial operations and backyard flock owners should continue to follow strict biosecurity measures including keeping birds enclosed without access to wild birds or other domestic flocks. If your flock is experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away to your local veterinarian, the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Division, 919-707-3250, or the N.C. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System 919-733-3986.” More information on HPAI in general and a listing of all N.C. cases since 2022 is online at https://www.ncagr.gov/divisions/veterinary/AvianInfluenza.

The average among the roughly 5,000 medical institutions stood at 16.15 in the week through last Sunday, with the total number of patients they reported up 8 percent from the previous week to 79,605, the data showed. Ishikawa Prefecture in central Japan saw the highest rise among the 47 prefectures with an average of 24.52 patients per institution, despite some reports not being included due to the disastrous impact of an earthquake on New Year's Day. Ishikawa and 40 other prefectures, including Tokyo, logged rises in the most recent week, and averages were also high in Fukushima at 24.49 patients per institution and Aichi at 22.55. Okinawa Prefecture saw the lowest figure at 8.94, followed by Osaka at 9.36 and Aomori at 10.75. New hospitalizations reported from approximately 500 medical institutions nationwide increased 4 percent from the previous week to 3,459. "COVID-19 cases are clearly rising as we are in the 10th wave," said Hiroshi Mukae, a director of the Japanese Respiratory Society and professor at Nagasaki University. He warned that influenza and other contagions are also spreading this winter. Following the downgrade of COVID-19 to the same category as seasonal influenza in May last year, the government stopped releasing the daily tally of new cases. It now only releases the weekly number of patients reported from the designated institutions, as well as the average number of cases among the facilities.

CDC's latest guidelines for 2024Skip to main content HomeLocalSportsThings to DoNation NowBusinessTravel & ExplorePoliticsOpinionInvestigationseNewspaperAdvertise with UsObituariesArchivesWeatherCrosswordsNewslettersAZ International Auto Show & New Car Buyer's Guide 2020 Model YearConnect With UsFor SubscribersContributor ContentIsrael WarHome & Garden Ideas It's a 'tripledemic.' What to do if you have COVID, the flu or RSVRaphael Romero Ruiz Arizona RepublicLeer en españolThe winter season drove a new wave of COVID-19 infections across the United States in early January, including in Arizona, where state data indicated a rise in those experiencing symptoms of respiratory illnesses like the flu and RSV.The “tripledemic” is how physicians and medical providers nicknamed all three viruses' seasonal surge. Numbers published by the Arizona Department of Health Services show a slowing in Influenza and RSV activity, though they remain higher than the average for the last five seasons for the week ending Jan. 27. AZDHS data also indicates that coronavirus infections have stabilized, remaining below the average of the last three seasons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest county snapshot categorizes overall respiratory illness activity in Arizona as "moderate."Though case numbers have trended downwards, the winter season can still drive more infections of respiratory illnesses. Here are a couple of things to know about the CDC's latest COVID-19 guidelines and how to avoid getting infected during the “tripledemic”:When should I get tested for COVID-19?If you start to experience symptoms, which include shortness of breath and fever, among others, or you know you have been exposed to COVID, you should get a test.How can I get a free COVID-19 test kit?At-home tests have become the quickest way to determine whether an individual has been infected with COVID-19. They are sold at drugstores like CVS, Walgreens, Fry's and other retailers. Individuals can also order free test kits and receive them in the mail from the federal government at www.covid.gov.These sorts of tests are Antigen tests that involve swabbing the inside of the nostril and then placing the swab in a liquid solution which is used on a test strip. Individuals can see results in approximately 20 minutes.What should I do if I have COVID?The CDC published recommendations for what to do if you have COVID-19 in May 2023. A blog post on their website lists four points: Protect yourself and others if you have COVID-19, stay at home for at least 5 days, wear a mask around other people for 10 days and get medicine if you think you might get very sick. The CDC clarifies that you should call your doctor as soon as you know you are sick with COVID-19. Where can I get vaccinated for COVID-19?To find a COVID-19 vaccine in your area, search for the nearest vaccination locations using the online tool Vaccines.gov, then call or visit the provider's website to make an appointment. More: 5 things Arizonans should know about new COVID vaccines (and they're not called boosters)What is RSV?RSV, or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, is identified as a common respiratory virus by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV is an illness that most people can recover from in a week or two. However, depending on underlying conditions and other factors in an individual's health, RSV can be serious. Symptoms for RSV show up within four to six days of getting infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified these symptoms tied to RSV: Runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. The CDC adds that the symptoms do not appear all at once but in stages. More severe infections can cause bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, pneumonia, and an infection of the lungs. Is there a shot to protect against RSV?In May 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Arexvy, the first RSV vaccine for use in the United States. The vaccine manufactured by GSK plc, a British pharmaceutical company, is intended for individuals 60 and older to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV. Since then, the FDA has approved a second vaccine, the first intended for pregnant individuals to prevent RSV in infants. Pfizer’s Abrysvo is indicated for individuals at 32 through 36 weeks of gestational age to prevent LRTD in infants from birth to 6 months of age. What is the flu and how does it spread?Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that most individuals know as the flu. Aside from the typical runny nose and sore throat, infected individuals can display symptoms like fevers, body aches, fatigue and headaches. The flu virus spreads through droplets, as described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk,” as a blog post details on the CDC website.If you are sick with the flu, it is good to know that individuals are most contagious in the first 3-4 days after the illness begins. The infection can be passed along to otherwise healthy adults even a day before symptoms develop and up to seven days after getting sick. Where can I get vaccinated for the flu?To find a flu vaccine in your area, you can search for the nearest vaccination locations using the online tool Vaccines.gov, then call or visit the provider's website to make an appointment.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Stabilisation or even a slight fall in the number of cases and in the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Decrease in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: Stabilisation of the number of influenza cases at a high level. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 29 January to 4 February 2024 (week 5), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 140 cases, compared to 156 cases the previous week (-10%). The positivity rate fell to 5.7% compared to 6.5% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is decreasing. [1] These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has stabilised. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant since week 47/2023 [2]. Influenza For the week of 29 January to 4 February 2024 (week 5), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 1,019 cases compared to 988 cases in the previous week, presenting an increase of 3%. These data largely coincide with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 29 January to 4 February 2024 (week 5), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 14 cases, compared with 26 the previous week, presenting an decrease of 46%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

In respect of people hospitalised with flu infection we are currently a lot worse than a year ago, while in terms of the gravity of coronavirus infections the situation is largely the same. The flu season generally peaks between the 7th and 10th week of the year, but the highest figures can vary greatly from one year to another. The coronavirus pandemic, for instance, put a serious dent into the spread of the flu (see graph below). The number of people seeking medical help with influenza-like symptoms per 100,000 population (488.8) was higher than currently only three times in the past 12 cold seasons (in 2014/15, 2016/17 and in 2018/19), while it is only a tad worse than in 2017/18 (486.3). For the 52nd week of 2023, the NNK published only a couple of figures, hence the gaps in the graphs. The timeline on the second graph goes up only to the 5th week for a closer look. On the 5th week of 2024, a total of 271,000 people sought medical help with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), of whom 47,400 (17.5%) had flu-like symptoms. The former figure marks a 16.1% increase and the latter a 28.5% jump growth over the 4th week. We can also compare the SARI and flu numbers for 100,000 inhabitants. Despite the relief observed between the 51st week of 2023 and the 1st week of 2024, chances are that the epidemic will be more severe in 2023/24 than in 2022/23. We need to highlight that this year authorities perform more tests than a year ago, even though the number of samples tested remains extremely low (398 in total on a national level last week, up from 298 a week ago, and this season's record so far). The early zeal has abated by now, though. While initially six, eight, and even ten times more samples were tested, the multiplier is now just over two. The COVID-19 positivity rate dropped further to 4.5%, while the influenza positivity rate climbed higher to 32.4% from 28.9% on the 4th week. As regards all samples tested up to the 5th week, the Covid positivity rate continues to stand out. The share of coronavirus in all samples tested (orange lines) was about half than currently a year ago (13.6% vs. 25.3% currently), while the percentage of influenza in the samples (green lines) is way lower now than in the fourth week of 2023 (9.4% vs. 22.6%). As regards the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the samples (blue lines), the situation is much better in the current cold season than in 2022/23, with the share only at 2.0% on the fifth week this year versus 9.6% a year ago. Note that these are the percentages of the select pathogens found in all samples tested up to the 5th week. If we take a look at the positivity rates on the individual weeks, we find that there was a turnaround on the 2nd week, with the influenza positivity rate (14.0%) higher than the Covid positivity rate (13.6%) for the first time in the current flu season. Since then the gap has widened and it is now considerable: 32.4% flu vs. 4.5% Covid. If you're wondering how the weekly positivity rates might turn out, here's how it went down last year, not that it is any guarantee that it will be repeated, but still: For the ninth consecutive week in this flu season, people who tested positive for influenza virus and RSV also had to be hospitalised. The 47th week was the first one when one of the samples showed influenza infection (up at 378 in total by the end of the 5th week). Other pathogens identified between the 40th and 5th week were SARS-CoV-2 (1,021), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 80), adenovirus (3), parainfluenza (5), human metapneumovirus (HMPV, 24, and rhinovirus (37). THERE WERE 291 PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL WITH SARI ON THE 5TH WEEK, VERSUS 222 A WEEK AGO. 20.3% OF THEM WERE TREATED WITH COVID-19, up slightly FROM 18.5% A WEEK EARLIER, while a quarter of them (25.4%) were treated with influenza, up from 22.5% on the 4th week. The graphs below show a comparison with the previous 'flu season'. In 2022/23, there were no reports of people with Covid in hospitals, but that doesn't mean there weren't any (there were 100 on the first week of 2023, so it's a pretty safe bet that not all of them got to that stage overnight). The second chart depicts the number and share of people infected by influenza virus in hospitals. As you can see (orange columns, light blue curve), this 'flu season' is much worse in this respect than the previous one. The chart starts on the 49th week because that was the first week in this season when someone infected with influenza virus had to be hospitalised. We have the same graph for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which shows that this infection was a lot more severe in the previous 'flu season', although both the number of RSV infections and related hospitalisations did pick up on the fifth week of 2024. Another important indicator of the severity of an epidemic is how many of those hospitalised end up in the intensive care unit. As mentioned above, there were 291 people with SARI in hospital on the week under review, up from 222 a week earlier. 35 of them were in the ICU, which corresponds to a 12.0% ratio, which figures compare with 19 (8.6%) a week earlier. 30.2% of those hospitalised with SARI were children aged 2 years or younger (down a tad from 31.1% a week ago), while 39.5% of them were aged 60 and over (down slightly from 40.1% on the 4th week). Majority of those with SARI are children Finally, we have an age breakdown both for SARI and flu patients. Children up to the age of 14 are on top of the SARI age rankings in terms of numbers, and for the first time this season they are also on top in the flu rankings, while the second hardest-hit cluster is the 15-34 age group. The right-hand charts show the share of people with SARI and flu-like symptoms by age group. Looking back on the 2022/23 data we find that the 0-14 age group was the hardest hit throughout the flu season in terms of SARI, while in terms of flu-like symptoms they were the most affected age group between the 3rd and the 15th week of this year, i.e. from mid-January to mid-April. On the 5th week this year, more than 140,000 children sought medical help with SARI, nearly 52% of all people that turned to the doctor with some respiratory infection. They also stand out when it comes to flu-like symptoms (41% of all), with their number up at over 19,000 from 14,000 a week ago.

Know From An Expert By OnlyMyHealthFeb 07, 2024 07:24 ISTInfluenza is a common health problem and the best way to prevent it is by vaccination. Onlymyhealth editorial team spoke to Dr. Anjali Kumar, Director - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon, about why pregnant women should get vaccines for influenza. If seasonal flu or influenza occurs in a pregnant woman, then she is at a higher risk of getting severe. Here's how you can prevent seasonal flu: 1. Social distancing, wearing masks and washing your hands regularly is an important part to protect yourself. Influenza is an old virus which can be prevented and treated through vaccination. Flu shot is a vaccine that can protect you and your baby from seasonal flu or influenza. Mostly, the medical bodies also advice that pregnant women should be given a flu shot. 2. If the flu shot is given during pregnancy, it decreases the chances of infection in the pregnancy by almost 50%. It also decreases the chance of getting hospitalised due to influenza by 40% and it also gives protection to the newborn. Along with the mother, even the baby will be protected from influenza for atleast 6 months. This flu shot is easily available and inexpensive. It is a simple intermuscular injection. It is given directly into the muscle and any healthcare provider can do the same. It can be given at any point during pregnancy. However, the best time to take a flu shot is before the onset of influenza season. In India, October and November is the season of influenza. This vaccine is safe and has no major side effects. Some pain or swelling is a common minor side effect. You can talk to your doctor for getting this vaccine.

To provide additional context on the figures and trends, the percentage of country sentinel sites reporting for the week is also included. Reporting below 80% is indicated as ▼low reporting and – is no report available. Please refer Seasonal Influenzafor Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) - ILI Surveillance Attached is the weekly bulletin for your reference and additional information. Actual increase in the number of ILI cases has been seen in CNMI, Palau, Tokelau, Tuvalu and Wallis & Futuna. Additionally, the number of SARI cases increased in Samoa and Tonga while COVID-19 cases were reported in Samoa for the week. The reduction in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, New Caledonia, Samoa and Tonga. Moreover, the number of SARI cases decreased in Fiji, French Polynesia and CNMI and COVID-19 cases decreased in Fiji, French Polynesia, FSM, CNMI, Palau, and Tokelau for the week. The decreased ILI cases seen in FSM may be due to the decreased number of sites reporting for the week No ILI cases reported from Pitcairn Islands and no SARI cases reported from Kiribati, RMI, FSM, New Caledonia, Palau, Pitcairn islands, Tokelau, and Tuvalu. Furthermore, no COVID-19 cases were identified in Kiribati, RMI, FSM, New Caledonia, Pitcairn islands, Tonga and Tuvalu for the week. No reports were available from Guam, Niue, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu for the week. American Samoa and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease. Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus in PICs: For W04, Fiji tested 86 samples for Influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Results: 0% positive for Influenza and 2 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2. During Epi Week 04, CNMI observed a 47% decrease in COVID-19 cases from 6 to 3, with no hospitalizations. Meanwhile, Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) cases rose by 32%, resulting in one pneumonia-related hospitalization and four clinically diagnosed pneumonia cases (2 ILI, 2 PF). Among 103 tests conducted, there were 2 Flu A and 1 Flu B cases, with no confirmed RSV cases reported. (Situation report WK 04, 2024). For WK4, French Polynesia reported 13 new cases of influenza A out of 106 tests, with 4 cases requiring hospitalization. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and RSV were also circulating. The Ministry continues preventive measures and an ongoing vaccine campaign for Influenza and COVID-19 until April 1, 2024. A single booster dose of the new Comirnaty Omicron® XBB.1.5 vaccine is recommended, especially for those over 60 years old. In addition, there were 6 new COVID-19 confirmed cases from 105 tests, showing a 5.7% decrease from the previous week. In this wave, a total of 56 cases were admitted to the hospital, and one (1) death was reported. Sequencing at the ILM identified Omicron sub-variants, with 8% being EG.5.1 (ERIS) and 92% being JN.1 in WK52,2023. Source: Bulletin de surveillance sanitaire Polynésie française N° 4- 2024. As of 29, August 2023, Wallis and Futuna have reported 191 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 164 in Wallis and 27 in Futuna. Since October 2023, there have been 13 hospitalizations, including 3 in intensive care, resulting in the death of a 36-year-old man in week 4.

Subsequently, on January 28, 2024, another avian influenza A(H5N1) case was reported—a 69-year-old male from Siem Reap province. Further details are under verification and monitoring on avian influenza in Cambodia. Source COVID -19 A large proportion of the BA.2.86 sequences belong to the sub-lineage JN.1. As of 19 December 2023, due to its rapid increase in proportion, WHO classified JN.1 as a separate variant of interest (VOI) from the parent lineage BA.2.86. The most likely driver of the success of BA.2.86-descendant lineages is immune escape in a population where immunity is increasingly derived from XBB-variants.

A statement said that over the last three years, avian influenza has wreaked havoc on both wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide. Migratory birds, with their significant role in virus transmission across continents, contribute to this global concern. The wetlands of Jammu and Kashmir, which witness around 4 lakh migratory birds annually, are possibly integral to this interconnected web of avian influenza transmission. The project led by Dr. Nadeem Shabir, Assistant Professor at the Division of Animal Biotechnology, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, SKUAST-K, takes a comprehensive one-health approach. The initiative aims to model the transmission of the virus from wild birds to domestic poultry, providing critical insights into the transmission patterns of the virus. Collaborating with renowned Influenza experts in India such as Dr Pervaiz Koul, Director Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences and Dr Varsha Potdar from the National Institute of Virology, the project also involves mapping the possible transmission of the virus to poultry handlers of the region considering the zoonotic nature of the virus. Prof.Nazir Ahmad Ganai, Vice Chancellor of SKUAST-K while emphasising the significance of the project, said, “Avian Influenza poses a significant threat to both animal and human health. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics of the virus in domestic and wild birds of Jammu and Kashmir, contributing vital information for effective prevention and control strategies.” Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

In the final week of January and the initial days of February, temperatures plummeted to a chilly 5°C in certain regions of the UAE. A series of heavy to moderate showers spanning across the country has prompted residents to resort to warmer clothing. Evenings have particularly been windy with additional forecasts for such weather conditions. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. However, the vagaries of the weather are contributing to a rise in respiratory infections such as the flu and the common cold, resulting in fever. Additionally, the fluctuating weather is also triggering seasonal allergies. Get medical advice early Children and adults are walking into the clinics displaying symptoms such as coughing, a runny nose, congestion, sore throat, and even high-grade fever. Dr Fatma Elzahra, Specialist Pediatrician, Thumbay University Hospital said, “During the peak of flu season in the UAE, which spans from October to February, we often see kids presenting themselves with high-grade fevers. These can be caused by various viruses or bacteria floating around, including Influenza A or B, Adenovirus, and even the Epstein–Barr virus, which can feel just like the flu." Dr Fatma Elzahra Medics say that symptoms can start in a subtle manner, such as with a runny nose. “It's easy to chalk it up to something harmless like being in an air-conditioned room or picking up germs on the bus. But it's better to be safe and get professional medical advice early on.” When it comes to why these fevers happen, she explained “it's mostly due to respiratory infections, usually viral ones like colds or the flu. But bacterial infections like ear infections, sinus issues, or even urinary tract infections are common too these days.” Spreading allergens Several airborne allergens could be to blame. Doctors stressed that even air conditioning units can spread bacteria and viruses affecting both children and adults. Dr Joseph K. Joseph, Internal Medicine Specialist, Zulekha Hospitals, Dubai said, “Around 10-15 per cent of patient footfall has increased after the cold weather has intensified. There are multiple variable factors for this rising number of fever and cough cases. One is pollution, then the vagaries of the weather. On one day it is sunny, the next day it's rainy, and the day after it is cold. So, frequent fluctuations in temperature are flummoxing for the body's immune system meaning the body cannot adjust to that frequent temperature variations. In the afternoon it's sunny, but at night it becomes cold, and one has to wear a jacket.” Dr Joseph K. Joseph “Sometimes, people go on a desert safari and are exposed to dust and fumes. Another important factor that determine may be the filter inside air conditioners need to be cleaned every three months. People fall sick because there is no proper maintenance of ACs,” he added. Influenza A or B Healthcare professionals describe that it starts with a mild fever, but if the patient fails to undergo effective treatment within the initial two to three days of the ailment, it could get severe. Dr Atul Rane, Specialist Paediatrics, Aster Clinic, Bur Dubai (AJMC) said, “Upon investigation of such cases, more than 70-80 per cent of the time, fever is found to be due to a viral infection, which is self-limiting and recovers spontaneously over five to seven days. Viral infections currently identified are 30-40 per cent Influenza A or B virus.” High fever Due to the weather change, children are reporting high fever with temperatures above 38°C. Dr Doaa Fathy, Specialist Peadiatrician, Prime Medical Center, Al Nahda Branch, Sharjah said, “High fever is caused due to viral causes such as cold, flu, hand foot mouth disease, and chickenpox among others. It also happens due to bacterial causes such as tonsillitis, ear infection, urinary tract infection, chest infections like bronchitis, and Pneumonia. Parents should worry if a child has a persistent fever of more than 40°C and is not responding to treatment.” Dr Doaa Fathy Adults are advised to closely monitor their children for symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and difficulty breathing. Dr Syed Adnan Munaf, Consultant Pediatrics, Saudi German Hospital Dubai, said, “Most of these viruses cause respiratory symptoms like cough, cold, runny nose, reduced appetite with a fever. These illnesses are usually self-limiting and not usually a cause for concern. However, parents should seek medical attention if the fever lasts beyond five days.” Dr Syed Adnan Munaf ALSO READ: UAE: Influenza vaccine recommended to some residents as infections rise UAE medical experts share how to avoid flu as cases rise Covid-19, flu, RSV: Vaccines safeguard against 'tripledemic', UAE expert says Lifestyle Newsletters UAE Nandini Sircar Nandini Sircar has a penchant for education, space, and women's narratives.
