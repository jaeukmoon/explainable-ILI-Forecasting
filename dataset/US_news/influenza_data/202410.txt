Many were previously healthy.“I’ve taken care of kids who have ultimately died from flu. And almost universally, their parents tell me, ‘I had no idea that flu could do this to my child,’” Dr. Kristina Bryant said.A 3-year-old receives a vaccine in Needham, Mass., in 2022.Joseph Prezioso / AFP via Getty ImagesMarch 9, 2024, 12:04 AM UTCBy Erika EdwardsMore than 100 children have died of the flu this season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.The number of pediatric deaths — 103 so far — is not a seasonal record. While kids with underlying health problems are more at risk for severe outcomes from the flu, the latest CDC numbers provide a stark reminder that flu can indeed be devastating to any child.“This is certainly sobering information, but it’s not something necessarily unexpected,” said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team.More than half of the children who died (53%) had no medical issues before their influenza infection, Budd said.Among the 10 new pediatric deaths in the most recent report, most died within the last few weeks, Budd said.Although cases seem to be peaking across the country, flu season is not over. The CDC estimates that the nation has logged at least 28 million flu illnesses, resulting in 310,000 hospitalizations so far this year. In addition to the 103 pediatric deaths, about 20,000 others have died of flu.“There is a popular misconception among families that flu is just another cold virus, and that it’s no big deal,” said Dr. Kristina Bryant, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Norton Healthcare in Louisville, Kentucky.“I have taken care of kids who are critically ill in the intensive care unit with flu,” Bryant said. “I’ve taken care of kids who have ultimately died from flu. And almost universally, their parents tell me, ‘I had no idea that flu could do this to my child.’”Small airways, big immune reactionThe vast majority of children infected with flu every year recover. One of the virus’ biggest mysteries is how it can quickly and swiftly kill otherwise healthy and robust children without warning.Kids have smaller airways, so breathing becomes compromised once a virus infects and inflames those airways, said Dr. Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.Children’s immune systems are superprimed to attack any new germ that comes their way, said Yonts. Sometimes those immune responses go too far.As with a lot of viral illnesses, more than anything it’s the body’s immune response that determines the severity of the symptoms.“There’s something about influenza that is particularly immunogenic to our bodies and can create these massive cytokine storms and fevers that end up landing kids in the ICU with a sepsis-like picture,” Yonts said.Flu vaccines for kids effective this yearThe CDC’s Budd said that nearly 90% of the children who died of flu this year were not fully vaccinated. For most kids, this means just one shot per year. But kids younger than age 8 need two doses if they’ve never received the flu shot before.Just over 50% of kids got the flu shot this season, slightly lower than 53.3% last year. Preliminary CDC data shows the vaccine is up to 61% effective in keeping kids with flu out of the hospital.“The vaccine can reduce the risk of a child needing to have a medical visit by about two-thirds,” Budd said. “And it can reduce their risk of hospitalization by about half.”Experts can’t predict which flu virus strains might be more virulent in any given year. About half of the pediatric deaths in the 2023-24 season were due to an influenza A strain, the CDC reported, while 47 were attributed to an influenza B strain. One child had both A and B strains.The 2014-15 flu season was a particularly severe one that took the lives of 141 children. Gianna Wehrkamp, a perfectly healthy and energetic 2-year-old, was one of them.It was Jan. 8, 2015, when Gianna came home from day care with a slight fever — not even 100 degrees. Her mother, Angie Wehrkamp, said Gianna was playing normally and did not act like anything was wrong. “She was just as bossy as always,” she said.The next morning, the normally smiley, spunky little girl was not herself.“She just looked like she didn’t feel good,” Wehrkamp, 46, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said. “You could see it on her face.”A trip to the doctor revealed that Gianna had influenza A. The doctor assured Wehrkamp that Gianna would soon be on the mend.Gianna spent the day resting at home with her beloved teddy bear named “Dog” and watched cartoons; “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse” and “Frozen” were favorites. Gianna perked up a bit at dinner, eating black olives one by one off of the tips of her fingers. Her fever never rose above 101 degrees.At bedtime, Wehrkamp said that Gianna’s lungs sounded “a little rattly,” so she brought the little girl into her bed to keep an eye on her overnight.“Around 2 a.m., I woke up and she was not breathing,” Wehrkamp said. It took paramedics nearly an hour to get Gianna’s heart beating again.By then, it was too late.Less than 48 hours after she started showing symptoms, Gianna died of influenza.“It all just happened so fast,” Wehrkamp said. “We did not know that healthy children could lose their lives to the flu.”The little girl hadn’t received the flu shot the year she died.“We had every intention of getting Gianna vaccinated,” her mother said. “But it just kind of fell off the radar as busy parents, and unfortunately we paid the ultimate price for that. Failing to make that a priority will forever be my greatest regret.”Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoCracking the Code on a Universal Flu Vaccine | Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine Leave Your PrintDonate Today!

Runny nose. Sore throat. Muscle aches. These symptoms are all familiar to anyone who’s contracted the common flu, a respiratory illness that affects one billion people each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend most people receive yearly flu shots because the seasonal influenza virus mutates constantly, creating new strains that circulate from person-to-person leading to seasonal flu epidemics. These yearly vaccines are formulated to protect against the specific virus strains expected to spread and cause illness during that flu season, typically October through May. A flu pandemic, such as the 1918 pandemic that infected around one-third of the world’s population and caused an estimated 50 million deaths, occurs when a global outbreak of a new strain of influenza A virus emerges that is radically different from the currently circulating strains. Because seasonal flu shots are specifically formatted to combat certain strains of influenza — including the virus type that causes the flu in birds and some mammals, including humans — current vaccine formulations offer no protection against a novel strain. At present, it takes about six months to formulate and produce large quantities of flu vaccine, during which time widespread infection can cause severe illness and even death. Led by Dr. Suresh Mittal, Distinguished Professor of Virology in the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, researchers are working on the development of a universal vaccine, one that would offer protection against all forms of influenza A that infect humans, regardless of the strain. Such a vaccine could eliminate the need to reformulate seasonal flu vaccines and provide the health care system with a jumpstart in combatting the next flu pandemic. “Every year, the flu vaccine gets updated because its components are strain specific,” Dr. Mittal said. “A universal vaccine would strengthen the efficacy of seasonal flu vaccines. In the case of an influenza pandemic, the universal vaccine could be used to help control a global outbreak until a variant-specific vaccine is developed.” The current seasonal influenza vaccines predominately stimulate the production of influenza-specific antibodies, the proteins produced by an immune system to protect the body from infectious agents, such as viral infections. Antibodies attach to the outside of viruses, facilitating their neutralization and removing them from the body. The influenza virus’s major surface protein, called hemagglutinin — from the Greek word for blood and the Latin word for glue — binds to the mucosal lining of the upper respiratory tract and initiates viral infection. Hemagglutinins also mutate frequently, creating new strains of influenza virus. Dr. Mittal’s research team is investigating a novel approach to fight influenza. Rather than boosting the antibody specific to the virus surface proteins, the team’s work targets an internal nucleoprotein that is conserved in multiple strains of influenza A viruses. Because the nucleoprotein doesn’t mutate the way hemagglutinins do, attacking it stands a better chance of fighting off the flu, regardless of the strain. The method relies on generating a T cell response, rather than an antibody response. “Our cells go through a natural cellular recycling process called autophagy that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components,” Dr. Mittal said. “By attaching an autophagy-inducing peptide to the nucleoprotein, it forces the antigen to go through autophagy. This triggered an enhanced T cell response which was shown to be effective in inducing protection against several influenza viruses having different hemagglutinin subtypes.” The study, published in the February 2024 journal Vaccines, tested the immunization response against the five subtypes of influenza A viruses known to cause human infections (H1, H3, H5, H7, and H9). In laboratory testing, nucleoprotein-targeted vaccines administered through the nose provided immunity against all five strains. “We were initially surprised by the results,” Dr. Mittal said. “To ensure we had not made any mistakes during immunization, we ran the experiment a second time. The results were the same. This study indicates that development of a universal influenza vaccine could be possible. It also suggests intranasal delivery of the vaccine, rather than intramuscular injections, may be a better method of administration for vaccines designed to protect against contagious respiratory illnesses.” Dr. Mittal served as principal investigator for the study. A co-author, Dr. Suryaprakash Sambhara, Immunology Team lead in the Immunology and Pathogenesis Branch of the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is also Dr. Mittal’s longtime research collaborator. Dr. Ekramy Sayedahmed, a research scientist on Dr. Mittal’s research team, led the laboratory testing. The research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the National Institutes of Health. In the next phase of testing, the researchers plan to conduct a durability study to determine the length of time immunization with the universal flu vaccine is effective. Current seasonal flu vaccines provide immunity for about six months. If that study proves successful, the hope is to move to human clinical trials. “As a veterinarian, I believe in the concept of one health,” Dr. Mittal said. “Human health is closely linked to the health of domestic and wild animals and the wider environment. Migratory birds are the main culprit for the spread of influenza viruses to humans, poultry, pigs and other animals. Everything is interdependent.” After more than two decades of research in the field of virology, Dr. Mittal remains optimistic that a universal flu vaccine will one day be available to the public. And the technology and methodology introduced through this groundbreaking study will have a significant impact on the improvement of global health. “Our team has been working toward a universal influenza vaccine for 20 years,” Dr. Mittal said. “As scientists, we can’t work for those breakthrough moments of discovery because they may not happen. When they do happen, it’s very satisfying to know we were heading in the right direction.” Writer(s): Kat Braz | pvmnews@purdue.edu Category: Faculty & Staff, Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Our People, Research Latest Stories: “Paws Up” – brought to you by the PVM Wellness Committee New Dean Takes Helm of Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine PVM Bids Fond Farewell to Alumnus and Key Administrator Embarking on Exciting New Challenge PVM Admissions Office Welcomes new Admissions Process Manager Halloween PVM-Style: A Retrospective — Newsroom — — View All News — — Academics — — Our Impact — — Our People — — Research — — Services — — In the News — Communication OneCampus Portal Brightspace BoilerConnect Office 365 Outlook myPurdue Campus Faculty & Staff Human Resources Purdue Careers Colleges & Schools Purdue Directory Campus Map Education Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Nursing Graduate Programs Residency & Internships Community Engagement Continuing Education Resources Intranet PVM Careers PVM Connect PVM Directory Veterinary Medical Library Hospital & Diagnostic Services Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, 625 Harrison Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907, 765-494-7607 © 2024 Purdue University All Rights Reserved | Educational Inclusivity Statement | Integrity Statement | EA/EO University | DOE Degree Scorecards | Copyright Complaints | Privacy Policy Maintained by Purdue Veterinary Medicine Communications.

Experts who advise the FDA voted unanimously to change the formula for flu vaccines from four strains to three. Joe Raedle/Getty Images/FILE CNN — For 10 years, Americans have had access to flu shots that protect against four strains of the virus: two A strains and two B strains. Starting this fall, however, all the flu shots distributed in the United States will contain only three strains, and the change happened in part because of Covid-19. On Tuesday, a panel of experts who advise the US Food and Drug Administration on vaccines voted unanimously to recommend three-strain flu vaccines that will exclude any viruses from B strains that are part of branch of the flu’s family tree called Yamagata. Yamagata viruses were in decline before the pandemic, and all the precautions that helped people avoid Covid-19 – including masking, staying at home and better ventilation – appear to have finished them off. They haven’t been detected in testing since March 2020. One Yamagata strain was typically included in each year’s flu shot recipe, so vaccine designers faced a quandary this year: Should they drop the strain from the formula or keep it in, since B-viruses are known to be cagey? In the 1990s, when Yamagata was in its heyday, another branch of B-strain flu viruses called Victoria was seen only sporadically in testing, but it had a resurgence in the 2000s. What if Yamagata came back after a lengthy absence? It’s not quick or easy to change how flu vaccines are manufactured, and those changes require regulatory review and approval.

(Carline Jean/South Florida Sun Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Carline Jean/South Florida Sun Sentinel/TNS/Getty Images/FILE Related article Moderna says mRNA flu shot generates better immune response in study than currently available vaccine In September, the World Health Organization said that “inclusion of the Yamagata-lineage antigens in influenza vaccines is no longer warranted,” and in October, the FDA’s vaccine experts also said the Yamagata strains should be dropped as quickly as possible. “We’ve been talking about this for four years,” said Dr.Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC. The change is happening faster than expected, said Dr. Arnold Monto, another VRBPAC member. He noted that in October, when the committee first voted to recommend removing Yamagata from flu vaccines, they were told that it might be impossible to exclude it next season because of regulatory red tape. Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the FDA’s Division of Viral Products, said Tuesday that the agency has been working with manufacturers to get the Yamagata strain out of US vaccines in time for the 2024-25 flu season. “At this point in time, each of the US influenza vaccine manufacturers have submitted updated regulatory files related to a trivalent influenza vaccine, and approval of all the necessary regulatory submissions is on track for 2024-25” season, he said during the advisory committee’s meeting. In fact, Weir noted, the US was able to move faster than some other countries because all the vaccine manufacturers already had approvals for trivalent flu vaccines here. It’s taking longer in other parts of the world to make the switch. For that reason, the committee also voted to recommend a four-strain formula – including one from B/Yamagata – for vaccines that will be manufactured in the US but distributed in other countries. “And I think we should congratulate both FDA and the manufacturers of making this possible, because the problem seems to be totally logistic,” Weir said. There are good reasons for dropping the Yamagata strain, Offit said. “You don’t want to be vaccinating people for something they don’t need,” he said. There may also be some harms in continuing to include it, said Dr. Jodie Guest, senior vice chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, who is not a member of the FDA committee. “Anytime these flu vaccines are being produced, they are – depending on which vaccines you are talking about – using live or attenuated virus, and you do have to grow it,” she said. Growing something in a lab also means it could escape from that lab. “So while it would be an anticipated, incredibly small risk, there is the possibility you could reintroduce it into the population by having it contained in a vaccine,” Guest said.

Other researchers have pointed out that dropping the Yamagata strain would free up production capacity to increase the number of doses made globally, something that would benefit countries affected by shortages. In an article on the expected changes published February 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine, Monto, Weir and Dr. Maria Zambon from the UK Health Security Agency said the move opens the door to considering new vaccine formulas. Since the shot’s B/Victoria and A/H1N1 strains are often more effective than the A/H3N2 component, some experts have suggested doubling the dose of H3N2 or perhaps slipping in a second member of that family. But as the authors note, any such change would require testing and regulatory approval, and for that reason, it’s not likely we’ll see the return of four-strain flu shots very quickly. Instead, they say, it will be “more of a long-term goal for improving vaccine effectiveness.” In the meantime, scientists will keep testing flu viruses, just to make sure Yamagata really has been relegated to the history books.

America's flu shots for the 2024-2025 season will guard against three types of flu virus, rather than four. (Image credit: andreswd via Getty Images) A type of flu virus that used to sicken people every year hasn't been spotted anywhere on Earth since March 2020. As such, experts have advised that the apparently extinct viruses be removed from next year's flu vaccines.The now-extinct viruses were a branch of the influenza B family tree known as the Yamagata lineage. Scientists first reported the apparent disappearance of Yamagata viruses in 2021. At that time, experts speculated that precautions taken to stop the spread of COVID-19 — such as masking and social distancing — had not only driven the overall number of flu cases to historic lows but may have completely snuffed out this type of flu virus. Now, according to news reports, a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has unanimously agreed that Yamagata viruses should be dropped from the flu shot formulation for the 2024-2025 flu season. For the past decade, U.S. flu vaccines have protected against four types of flu — two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains — but that number will now fall to three.The advisory committee has been pushing for this change for some time, STAT reported, and in fall 2023, the World Health Organization raised the same recommendation on a global scale. Related: Is it too late to get a flu shot?Dropping Yamagata from flu shot formulations could help boost manufacturers' production capacity, so they can make more doses. Plus, it would eliminate any potential risks associated with growing the virus in a lab — a process currently required to make flu vaccines, CNN reported. And at baseline, experts emphasized that people needn't be vaccinated for something that appears to be extinct, STAT reported.

"We've been talking about this for four years," Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA advisory committee, told CNN.

Making the switch requires manufacturers to clear various regulatory hurdles. But with the FDA advisers pushing ahead, manufacturers are prepared to make trivalent vaccines for the U.S. starting this upcoming season; other countries will likely follow later, in accordance with their regulatory policies, STAT reported.According to CNN, Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's Division of Viral Products, confirmed at the meeting Tuesday that all U.S. flu shot manufacturers have submitted the required regulatory paperwork and should be on track to make trivalent vaccines next season. As these changes take effect, scientists around the world will continue to watch out for Yamagata alongside other flu viruses that infect people.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

How Big is Influenza Diagnostics Market Share? Influenza can be hard to diagnose as its most apparent indicators, such as fever, coughs, and aches, are homogenous to several other customary diseases. Healthcare donors have many varied ways to decide if the patient has the flu. The rapidly rising demand for the influenza diagnostics market can be attributed to the fact that speedy influenza diagnostics tests can distinguish influenza in under 30 minutes utilizing swabs or specimens of discharge seized from a patient's nose or throat. However, these tests can capitulate incorrect beneficial or incorrect dismissive outcomes, and they might need to be capable of specifying which particular strain of flu the patient has. The influenza diagnostics market growth can be attributed to government resourcefulness and financing for influenza scrutiny. Governments extensively fund observation schemes to observe eruptions, trace virus genera, and execute public health proceedings. This resourcefulness intends to expose and counter influenza outbreaks, decreasing healthcare implications and reducing public health influence.

Classical prediction theory is based on a, typically long, sequence of prior observations and is rooted in assumptions on statistical stationarity of the underlying stochastic process. These algorithms have trouble predicting chaotic dynamics, “Black Swans” (events which have never previously been seen in the observed data), or systems where the underlying driving process fundamentally changes. In this paper we develop (1) a global and local prediction algorithm that can handle these types of systems, (2) a method of switching between local and global prediction, and (3) a retouching method that tracks what predictions would have been if the underlying dynamics had not changed and uses these predictions when the underlying process reverts back to the original dynamics. The methodology is rooted in Koopman operator theory from dynamical systems. An advantage is that it is model-free, purely data-driven and adapts organically to changes in the system. While we showcase the algorithms on predicting the number of infected cases for COVID-19 and influenza cases, we emphasize that this is a general prediction methodology that has applications far outside of epidemiology.

The key element of prediction is reliance on collected data over some time interval for estimation of evolution over the next time period. Mathematicians have long worked on formal aspects of prediction theory, and separate streaks such as the Wiener–Kolmogorov,1, Furstenberg2 and Bayesian prediction3 have emerged. However, all of these are concerned with prediction of future events based on a, typically long, sequence of prior observations. This is rooted in assumptions on statistical stationarity of the underlying stochastic process.Furthermore, classical methods have difficulty in predicting chaotic systems due to their sensitivity to initial conditions leading to large divergence of initially close-by initial conditions (“Butterfly effect”). There have been some work in the machine learning literature that seek to make arbitrarily long prediction, such as Fan et. al.4. In that paper, the authors combine reservoir computing systems with an infrequent data assimilation step to extend the prediction window past one Lyapunov time. However, the paper considers predictions models for single systems, assuming they do not change, and do not consider the case where the underlying dynamics can fundamentally change.In contrast to the Butterfly effect, which is an inherent property of some nonlinear, deterministic dynamical systems, another difficulty for classical prediction algorithms is a “Black Swan” event (a hard-to-predict and rare event beyond the realm of normal expectations) or in the dynamical context a sudden fundamental change in the underlying driving process. For typical learning algorithms these type of events are devastating; the learning algorithm has to be restarted as otherwise it would learn the deviation as normal.This paper develops a model-free, purely data-driven prediction algorithm that can handle both the “Butterfly” effects and “Black Swan” events. The point of view on prediction in this paper is quite different: we view the process over a short (local) time scale and extract its coarse-grained ingredients. We proceed with prediction of the evolution based on these, learning the process and building a global time-scale on which such prediction is valid. Then, we monitor for the change in such coarse-grained ingredients, detect if a substantial change is happening, and switch back to local learning and prediction. In this way, we accept the limitations on predictability due to, possibly finite time, nonstationarity, and incorporate them into the prediction strategy.The developed algorithm is rooted in Koopman operator theory5,6,7,8,9,10 in its recently developed form that is applicable to nonstationary stochastic processes11,12. The Koopman operator theory is predicated on existence of a composition operator that dynamically evolves all the possible observables on the data, enabling the study of nonlinear dynamics by examining its action on a linear space of observables. The key ingredients of this approach become eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and the associated Koopman Mode Decomposition (KMD) of the observable functions, which is then approximated numerically using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The numerical approach used in this work relies on lifting the available data to higher dimensional space using Hankel–Takens matrix and on the improved implementation of DMD algorithm for discovering the approximations of the Koopman modes with small residuals. The obtained Koopman mode approximations and the related eigenvalues, called Ritz pairs, are crucial for obtaining satisfactory predictions using KMD.The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) Development of purely data-driven global and local prediction algorithms, (2) a method of switching between the two, and (3) a “retouching” algorithm that tracks what predictions would have been if the underlying dynamics had not changed and uses these predictions when the underlying process reverts back to the original dynamics. While we show the application of the methods on epidemiology examples (e.g. predicting COVID-19 number of infected) in the main text, we emphasize that this is a general method with applications well outside of epidemiology. We refer the reader to the Supplementary Information for mathematical details and additional examples.MethodsOur starting assumption is that observed data is generated by a dynamical process realized on some underlying state space. This is a broad enough assumption to cover data generated by both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems9. The (internal) state is often inaccessible; instead, an observable (output) is given as a function \(f({\textbf{x}}(t))\) of the state vector \({\textbf{x}}(t)\).The Koopman operator and the KMD The Koopman operator family \({\mathscr {U}}^t\), acts on observables f by composition \({\mathscr {U}}^t f ({\textbf{x}}) = f({\textbf{x}}( t))\). It is a global linearization tool: \({\mathscr {U}}^t\) is a linear operator that allows studying the nonlinear dynamics by examining its action on a linear space \({\mathscr {F}}\) of observables. In data analysis, for the discrete time steps \(t_i\), the discrete sequence \({\textbf{z}}_i\approx {\textbf{x}}(t_i)\), generated as numerical software output, is then a discrete dynamical system \({\textbf{z}}_{i+1}={\textbf{T}}({\textbf{z}}_i)\), for which the Koopman operator reads \({\mathscr {U}}f = f\circ {\textbf{T}}\).The key of the spectral analysis of the dynamical system is a representation of a vector valued observable \({\textbf{f}}=(f_1,\ldots ,f_{d})^T\) as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions \({\varvec{\psi }}_j\) of \({\mathscr {U}}\). In a subspace spanned by eigenfunctions each observable \(f_i\) can be written as \(f_i({\textbf{z}}) \approx \sum _{j=1}^{\infty }{\varvec{\psi }}_j({\textbf{z}}) ({\textbf{v}}_j)_i\) and thus (see e.g.6,13)$$\begin{aligned} \!{\textbf{f}}({\textbf{z}}) = \!\left( {\begin{matrix} f_1({\textbf{z}}) \\ \vdots \\ f_{d}({\textbf{z}})\end{matrix}}\right) \approx \sum _{j=1}^{\infty } {\varvec{\psi }}_j({\textbf{z}}) {\textbf{v}}_j,\; \text{ where }\;\; {\textbf{v}}_j =\! \left( {\begin{matrix} ({\textbf{v}}_j)_1 \\ \vdots \\ ({\textbf{v}}_j)_{d}\end{matrix}}\right) \!\!, \end{aligned}$$ (1) then, since \({\mathscr {U}}{\varvec{\psi }}_j=\lambda _j{\varvec{\psi }}_j\), we can envisage the values of the observable \({\textbf{f}}\) at the future states \({\textbf{T}}({\textbf{z}})\), \({\textbf{T}}^2({\textbf{z}}), \ldots\) by$$\begin{aligned} ({\mathscr {U}}^k{\textbf{f}})({\textbf{z}}) {\mathop {=}\limits ^{\mathrm {\tiny def}}} {\textbf{f}}({\textbf{T}}^k({\textbf{z}}))\approx \sum _{j=1}^{\infty } \lambda _j^k {\varvec{\psi }}_j({\textbf{z}}) {\textbf{v}}_j, \;\;k=1,2,\ldots \end{aligned}$$ (2) The numerical approximation of KMD can be computed using for example DMD algorithms. Different versions of the algorithm used in this work are described in details in Supporting Information-Methods.Finite dimensional compression and Rayleigh–Ritz extractionFor practical computation, \({\mathscr {U}}\) is restricted to a finite dimensional space \({\mathscr {F}}_{{\mathscr {D}}}\) spanned by the dictionary of suitably chosen functions \({\mathscr {D}}=\{ f_1, \ldots , f_d\}\), and we use a matrix representation \({\mathbb {U}}\) of the compression \({\varvec{\Psi }}_{{\mathscr {F}}_{{\mathscr {D}}}}{\mathscr {U}}_{|{\mathscr {F}}_{{\mathscr {D}}}} : {\mathscr {F}}_{{\mathscr {D}}}\rightarrow {\mathscr {F}}_{{\mathscr {D}}}\), where \({\varvec{\Psi }}_{{\mathscr {F}}_{{\mathscr {D}}}}\) is a \(L^2\) projection e.g. with respect to the empirical measure defined as the sum of the Dirac measures concentrated at the \({\textbf{z}}_i\)’s. Since \({\mathbb {U}}\) is the adjoint of the DMD matrix \({\mathbb {A}}\) associated with the snapshots \({\textbf{z}}_i\), the approximate (numerical) Koopman modes and the eigenvalues are the Ritz pairs (Ritz eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of \({\mathbb {A}}\), computed using the Rayleigh–Ritz method. The residuals of the Ritz pairs can be computed and used to check the accuracy14. See Supporting Information-Methods.The Hankel-DMD (H-DMD)The data snapshots (numerical values of the observables) can be rearranged in a Hankel–Takens matrix structure: for a subsequence (window) of \({\textsf{w}}\) successive snapshots \({\textbf{f}}_b, {\textbf{f}}_{b+1}, \ldots , {\textbf{f}}_{{\textsf{w}}-1}\), split \({\textsf{w}}= m_H + n_H\) and then define new snapshots as the columns \({\textbf{h}}_i\) of the \(n_H\times m_H\) Hankel–Takens matrix (see15,16,17, and Supporting Information)$$\begin{aligned} {\mathbb {H}}= \!\! \begin{pmatrix} {\textbf{f}}_{b} &{} {\textbf{f}}_{b+1} &{} \cdots &{} {\textbf{f}}_{b+m_H} \\ {\textbf{f}}_{b+1} &{} {\textbf{f}}_{b+2} &{} \cdots &{} {\textbf{f}}_{b+m_H+1} \\ \vdots &{} \vdots &{} \ddots &{} \vdots \\ {\textbf{f}}_{b+n_H-1} &{} {\textbf{f}}_{b+n_H} &{} \cdots &{} {\textbf{f}}_{b+n_H+m_H-1} \\ \end{pmatrix} \!= \!\begin{pmatrix} {\textbf{h}}_1&\ldots&{\textbf{h}}_{m_H+1} \end{pmatrix} \!. \end{aligned}$$ (3) Then, for this data we compute the KMD and use (2) for prediction. Predictions of the observables \({\textbf{f}}_i\) are then extracted from the predicted values of the observables \({\textbf{h}}_i\).The introduction of Hankel–Takens matrix alleviates issues that arise from using a basis on a potentially high dimensional space: namely, taking products of basis elements on 1-dimensional subspaces—for example Fourier basis on an interval in \({\mathbb {R}}\). Such constructions lead to an exponential growth in the number of basis elements, and the so-called curse of dimensionality. The Hankel–Takens matrix is based on the dynamical evolution of a one or more observables—functions on state space—that span a Krylov subspace. The idea is that one might start even with a single observable, and due to its evolution span an invariant subspace of the Koopman operator (note the connection of such methods with the Takens embedding theorem ideas16,17,18). Since the number of basis elements is in this case equal to the number of dynamical evolution steps, in any dimension, Krylov subspace-based methods do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.Global/local Koopman prediction and “Black Swan” detectionWe briefly describe at a high level the Global Koopman Prediction algorithm (GKP), detection of “Black Swan” events, and the local prediction algorithm. For full details, we refer the reader to the Supplementary Material (S1.4, S1.7, S1.7.2). We start we Global Prediction algorithm which relies on a sliding window Hankel DMD. Set an active window size w. If the present time moment is \(t_{p-1}\), take the snapshots \(\{{\textbf{f}}_{p-w}, \dots , {\textbf{f}}_{p-1}\}\) and form a Hankel–Takens matrix as in (3). Using an algorithm such as DMD19 which returns a set of Ritz pairs \(\{\lambda _i, {\textbf{v}}_i\}_{i=1}^n\), and their associated residuals \(\{r_i\}\), we can obtain the approximate decomposition of the considered dynamics using a truncated version of (1). If the residuals of the Ritz pairs are small, we can have an accurate decomposition, which can be used for the prediction far out this active window.Detection of “Black Swan” events or major disturbances to the system are based on the spectral information computed above. In the absence of disturbances, one would expect that the spectral radius for the Ritz values corresponding to the active window would not change too much. Furthermore, the DMD algorithm should compute Ritz pairs with reasonably small residuals. Choosing thresholds \({\mathscr {I}}\) and \(\eta\), one can flag the active window as possibly containing a Black Swan event if the spectral radius is greater than \({\mathscr {I}}\) or, alternatively, if all residuals are greater than \(\eta\). If the Black Swan event is detected, to successfully predict after it, some retouching process is applied to the data so that original dynamics is decoupled from this disturbance.In some cases, the global prediction algorithm is not feasible. For instance, when we just start collecting the data, we have not enough information for a GKP analysis. The other situation is when GKP recognizes the beginning of a Black Swan event. In that case, due to the fact that dynamics changed, the available data can not be used for prediction since there will be not enough Ritz pairs with small residuals that can give the accurate decomposition. Thus one can switch to Local prediction algorithm with much smaller active window size. In the Local Koopman Prediction LKP algorithm we change the size of the active window depending on the success of the previous prediction. The idea is to assimilate as much acquired data as possible, so we set Hankel matrix dimension variable with prediction moment. We start with a minimum Hankel size. If the error between the prediction and the actual value are below a certain threshold, we assimilate the newly acquired data into the active window by increasing the size of the Hankel matrix by 1 in each dimension.ResultsWe apply our algorithms to a few case studies in epidemiology: Influence epidemics and COVID-19. We do emphasize that the techniques are general and can be applied to any system that experience a drastic change in its fundamental behavior.Case study: influenza epidemicsAs first example for showing our prediction methodology, we use the set of data associated with influenza epidemics. Clearly, not driven by an underlying deterministic dynamical system, the influenza time series exhibits substantial regularity in that it occurs typically during the winter months, thus enabling coarse-grained prediction of the type “we will see a very small number of cases of influenza occurring in summer months”. However, predicting the number of influenza cases accurately is a notoriously hard problem20, exacerbated by the possibility that a vaccine designed in a particular year does not effectively protect against infection. Moreover, the H1N1 pandemic that occurred in 2009 is an example of a Black Swan event.The World Health Organization’s FluNet is a global web-based tool for influenza virological surveillance. FluNet makes publicly available data on the number of specimens with the detected influenza viruses of type A and type B. The data have been collected from different countries, starting with the year 1997, and are updated weekly by the National Influenza Centers (NICs) of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and other national influenza reference laboratories, collaborating actively with GISRS. We use the weekly reported data for different countries, which consist of the number of received specimens in the laboratories, the distribution of the number of specimens with confirmed viruses of type A.The Koopman Mode Decomposition was used in the context of analyzing the dynamics of the flu epidemic from different—Google Flu—data in21. We remark that the authors of that paper have not attempted prediction, and have analyzed only “stationary” modes—e.g. the yearly cycles, thus making the paper’s goals quite different from the nonstationary prediction pursued here.We first compare the global and the local prediction algorithms. The KMD is computed using active windows of size \({\textsf{w}}= 312\), and the \(208 \times 104\) Hankel–Takens matrices. In Fig. reff1a, we show the performances of both algorithms, using the learning data from the window April 2003–April 2009 (shadowed rectangle). In the global prediction algorithm the dynamics is predicted for 104 weeks ahead. The first type of failure in the global prediction algorithm and forecasting appears after the Black Swan event occurred in the years 2009 and 2010. This is recognized by the algorithm, so that it adapts by using the smallest learning span and, with this strategy, it allows for reasonably accurate forecasting, at least for shorter lead times. This data, in addition to those from Supplementary Information section S2.4 show the benefits of monitoring the prediction error and switching to local prediction. The initial Hankel–Takens matrix is \(3\times 2\), and the threshold for the local prediction relative error in Supplementary Information Algorithm S4 is 0.005.Figure 1Influenza data (USA). (a) The data are collected in the window April 2003–April 2009 (shadowed rectangle) and then the dynamics is predicted for 104 weeks ahead. The local prediction algorithm recovers the prediction capability by forgetting the old data and using narrower learning windows. The local prediction algorithm delivers prediction for one week ahead. (b) The active window (shadowed rectangle) is July 2004–July 2010, and the dynamics is predicted for 104 weeks ahead. The global prediction fails due to the Black Swan data in the learning window. (Some predicted values were even negative; those were replaced with zeros.) The global prediction algorithm recovers after the retouching the Black Swan event data, which allows for using big learning window. Compare with positions of the corresponding colored rectangles in Fig. 2.Full size imageRetouching the Black Swan event dataNext, we introduce an approach that robustifies the global algorithm in the presence of disturbances in the data, including the missing data scenario. We use the data window July 2004–July 2010, which contains a Black Swan event in the period 2009–2010. As shown in Fig. 1b, the learned KMD failed to predict the future following the active training window. This is expected because the perturbation caused by the Black Swan event resulted in the computed Ritz pairs that deviated from the precedent ones (from a learning window before disturbance), and, moreover, with most of them having large residuals. This can be seen as a second type of failure in the global prediction.The proposed Black Swan event detecting device, built in the prediction algorithm (see Supplementary Information Algorithm S3), checks for this anomalous behaviour of the Ritz values and pinpoints the problematic subinterval. Then, the algorithm replaces the corresponding supplied data with the values obtained as predictions based on the time interval preceding the Black Swan event. Figure 1b shows that such a retouching of the disturbance allows for a reasonable global prediction.Note that in a realistic situation, global predictions of this kind will trigger response from authorities and therefore prevent its own accuracy and induce loss of confidence, whereas local prediction mechanisms need to be deployed again.Figure 2The real and imaginary parts of Ritz values with residuals bellow \(\eta _r=0.075\) for sliding active windows. The color intensity of eigenvalues indicates the amplitudes of the corresponding modes. Pink rectangles mark ends of training windows with no acceptable Ritz values. Note how the unstable eigenvalues (\(\Re (\lambda )>0\)) impact the prediction performance, and how the retouching moves them towards neutral/stable—this is shown in the yellow rectangle in panels (a) and (c). Also influenced by the disturbance are the eigenvalues in the light blue rectangles in panels (a), (b); retouching moves the real parts of eigenvalues towards neutral/stable and rearranges them in a lattice-like structure22, as shown in panels (c), (d). Compare with Fig. 1b.Full size imageMonitoring and restoring the Ritz valuesWe now discuss the effect of the Black Swan event and its retouching to the computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We have observed that, as soon as a disturbance starts entering the training windows, the Ritz values start exhibiting atypical behavior, e.g. moving deeper into the right half plane (i.e. becoming more unstable), and having larger residuals because the training data no longer represent the Krylov sequence of the underlying Koopman operator.This is illustrated in the panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 2, which show, for the sliding training windows, the real and the imaginary parts of those eigenvalues for which the residuals of the associated eigenvectors are smaller than \(\eta _r=0.075\). Note the absence of such eigenvalues in time intervals that contain the disturbance caused by the Black Swan event.On the other hand, the retouching technique that repairs the distorted training data restores the intrinsic dynamics over the entire training window. The distribution of the relevant eigenvalues becomes more consistent, and the prediction error decreases, see panels (c) and (d) in Fig. 2, and in Supplementary Information Figure S16.DiscussionOur proposed retouching procedure relies on detecting anomalous behavior of the Ritz values; a simple strategy of monitoring the spectral radius of active windows (absolutely largest Ritz value extracted from the data in that window) is outlined in Supplementary Information. Note that this can also be used as a litmus test for switching to the local prediction algorithm. In Supplementary Information, we provide further examples, with the influenza data, that confirm the usefulness of the retouching procedure. In general, this procedure can also be adapted to the situation when the algorithm receives a signal that the incoming data is missing or corrupted.COVID-19 predictionThe second set of data we consider is that associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Because the virus is new, the whole event is, in a sense, a “Black Swan”. However, as we show below, the prediction approach advanced here is capable of adjusting quickly to the new incoming, potentially sparse data and is robust to inaccurate reporting of cases.At the beginning of the spread of COVID-19, we have witnessed at moments rather chaotic situation in gaining the knowledge on the new virus and the disease. The development of COVID-19 diagnostic tests made tracking and modeling feasible, but with many caveats: the data itself is clearly not ideal, as it depends on the reliability of the tests, testing policies in different countries (triage, number of tests, reporting intervals, reduced testing during the weekends), contact tracing strategies, using surveillance technology, credit card usage and phone contacts tracking, the number of asymptomatic transmissions etc. Many different and unpredictable exogenous factors can distort it. So, for instance the authors of23 comment at https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing that e.g. “The Netherlands, for instance, makes it clear that not all labs were included in national estimates from the start. As new labs get included, their past cumulative total gets added to the day they begin reporting, creating spikes in the time series.” For a prediction algorithm, this creates a Black Swan event that may severely impair prediction skills, see section “Retouching the Black Swan event data”.This poses challenging problems to the compartmental type models of (SIR, SEIR) which in order to be useful in practice have to be coupled with data assimilation to keep adjusting the key parameters, see e.g.24. Our technique of retouching (section “Retouching the Black Swan event data”) can in fact be used to assist data assimilation by detecting Black Swan disturbance and thus to avoid assimilating disturbance as normal.In the KMD based framework, the changes in the dynamics are automatically assimilated on-the-fly by recomputing the KMD using new (larger or shifted) data snapshot windows. This is different from the compartmental type models of infectious diseases, most notably in the fact that the procedure presented here does not assume any model and, moreover, that it is entirely oblivious to the nature of the underlying process.An example: European countriesAs a first numerical example, we use the reported cumulative daily cases in European countries. In Supplementary Information section S1.5, we use this data for a detailed worked example that shows all technical details of the method. This is a good test case for the method—using the data from different countries in the same vector observable poses an additional difficulty for a data driven revealing of the dynamics, because the countries independently and in an uncoordinated manner impose different restrictions, thus changing the dynamics on local levels. For instance, at the time of writing these lines, a new and seemingly more infectious strain of the virus circulating in some parts of London and in south of England prompted the UK government to impose full lockdown measures in some parts of the United Kingdom. Many European countries reacted sharply and immediately suspended the air traffic with the UK.In the first numerical experiment, we use two datasets from the time period February 29 to November 19. and consider separately two sets of countries: Germany, France and the UK in the first, and Germany, France, UK, Denmark, Slovenia, Czechia, Slovakia and Austria in the second. The results for a particular prediction interval are given in Figs. 3 and 4. For more examples and discussion how the prediction accuracy depends on the Government Response Stringency Index (GRSI25,26) see Supplementary Information section S1.5.Figure 3Prediction of COVID-19 cases (35 days ahead, starting July 11) for Germany, France and United Kingdom.

Right panel: The Koopman–Ritz values corresponding to the first two computations in Fig. 3 (magenta circles and blue pluses, respectively) and the the first two panels in this Figure (orange x-es and cyan squares, respectively). Note how the corresponding Koopman–Ritz values nearly match for all cases considered.Full size imageIn the above examples, the number of the computed modes was equal to the dimension of the subspace of spanned by the training snapshots, so that the KMD of the snapshots themselves was accurate up to the errors of the finite precision arithmetic. In general, that will not be the case, and the computed modes will span only a portion the training subspace, meaning that the KMD of the snapshots might have larger representation error. (Here we refer the reader to Supplementary Information section S1.3, where all technical details are given.) This fact has a negative impact to the extrapolation forward in time and the problem can be mitigated by giving more importance to reconstruction of more recent weights. This is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6, where the observables are the raw data (reported cases) for Germany, extended by a two additional sequence of filtered (smoothened) values.Figure 5Prediction experiment with data from Germany.

Right panel: Prediction errors for the period October 11 – November 7. Compare with the third graph in Fig. 5.Full size imageThe figures illustrate an important point in prediction methodology, that we emphasized in the introduction: a longer dataset and a better data reconstruction ability (i.e. interpolation) does not necessarily lead to better prediction. Namely, weighting more recent data more heavily produces better prediction results. This was already observed in27 for the case of traffic dynamics, and the method we present here can be used to optimize the prediction ability.An example: USA and worldwide dataWe have deployed the algorithm to assess the global and United States evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The evolution of the virus is rapid, and “Black Swans” in the sense of new cases in regions not previously affected appear with high frequency. Despite that, the Koopman Mode Decomposition based algorithm performed well.In Fig. 7a we show the worldwide forecast number of confirmed cases produced by the algorithm for November 13th, 2020. The forecasts were generated by utilizing the previous three days of data to forecast the next three days of data for regions with higher than 100 cases reported. The bubbles in Fig. 7a are color coded according to their relative percent error. As can be observed, a majority of the forecasts fell below 15% error. The highest relative error for November 13th, 2020 was 19.8% which resulted from an absolute error of 196 cases. The mean relative percent error, produced by averaging across all locations, is 1.8% with a standard deviation of 3.36% for November 13th, 2020. Overall, the number of confirmed cases are predicted accurately and since the forecasts were available between one to three days ahead of time, local authorities could very well utilize our forecasts to focus testing and prevention measures in hot-spot areas that will experience the highest growth.A video demonstrating the worldwide forecasts for March 25, 2020–November 29, 2020 is provided in the Supplementary Information online (Fig. 7a is a snapshot from that video). Lastly, it is well known that the ability to test people for the virus increased throughout the development of the pandemic and thus resulted in changes in the dynamics of reported cases. Although it is impossible for a data-driven algorithm to account for changes due to external factors, such as increased testing capabilities, it is important that the algorithm be able to adjust and relearn the new dynamics. For this reason, we encourage the reader to reference the video and note that although periods of inaccuracy due to black swan events occur, the algorithm is always able to stabilize and recover. In contrast, since this is at times a rapidly (exponentially) growing set of data, methods like naive persistence forecast do poorly.In Fig. 7b, c we show the performance of the prediction for the cumulative data for the US in March-April 2020. It is of interest to note that the global curve is obtained as a sum of local predictions shown in Fig. 7a, rather than as a separate algorithm on the global data. Again, the performance of the algorithm on this nonstationary data is good.Figure 7Prediction of confirmed COVID-19 cases utilizing the publicly available COVID-19 data repository provided by Johns Hopkins. The true data ranges between March 22nd, 2020 and November 29th, 2020. We utilize the last three days of data to forecast the following three days of data. (a) Predicted conditions and prediction error worldwide on November 13. The widths of the bubbles represent the number of cases in a region; only regions with more that 100 cases are used and the bubbles are colored according to their relative percent error. (b) Comparison of true and forecast data for cumulative confirmed cases in the US for April to December 2020. The cumulative forecasts shown here were obtained by summing the forecasts of the individual locations, indicating that the region specific forecasts were sufficiently accurate for tracking the cumulative dynamics of the virus in the US. (c) Percent error for the forecasts of the cumulative confirmed cases in the US. On average the percent error is less than 5 percent and although spikes occur, which could be due to changes in testing availability, the algorithm adjusts and the error stabilizes within a short amount of time. Furthermore, Johns Hopkins provided data for around 1787 locations around the United States and we produced forecasts for each of those locations.Full size imageDiscussionIn this work, we have presented a new paradigm for prediction in which the central tenet is understanding of the confidence with which the algorithm is capable of predicting the future realizations of a non-stationary stochastic process. Our methodology is based on Koopman operator theory6. Operator-theoretic methods have been used for detection of change in complex dynamics in the past, based on both Koopman18,28 and Perron–Frobenius operators29. Other methods include variational finite element techniques combined with information theoretic measure (Akaike’s information criterion) and maximum entropy principle30.Our approach to the problem of prediction of nonstationary processes has several key ingredients. First, the Koopman operator on the space of the observables is used as a global linearization tool, whose eigenfunctions provide a coordinate system suitable for representation of the observables. Second, in a numerical computation, we lift the available snapshots to a higher dimensional Hankel–Takens structure, which in particular in the case of abundance of data, allows for better numerical (finite dimensional) Rayleigh–Ritz approximation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the associated Koopman operator, as well as the KMD. Third, using our recent implementation of the DMD, we select the Koopman modes that have smallest residuals, and thus highest confidence, which is the key for the prediction capabilities of the KMD. In the absence of enough modes with reasonably small residuals, i.e. low confidence, we switch to local prediction, with narrower learning windows and shorter lead time. By monitoring the prediction error, the algorithm may return back to global prediction.Our methodology is entirely consistent with the typical trainingest dataset validation techniques in machine learning. Namely, the globally learned model on the training data is applied to test data for the next time interval. The novelty in our approach is that we constantly check for how well the learned model generalizes, and if it does not generalize well, we restart the learning. One can say that we implemented a feedback loop, within which the machine learning algorithm’s generalizability from training to test dataset is constantly checked, and the system adapts to new conditions. Evidence for effectiveness of this procedure is presented for the COVID-19 prediction example, where we show how the generalization error diminishes over time.We emphasize that this a general method that is model-free and completely data-driven. It adapts organically to changes in the underlying system. Contrast this in the context of epidemiology where SIR-type models are used. For a changing driving dynamics, the SIR modeling approach would need to be coupled with a data-assimilation approach to offer the same adaptability as our method.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu has resulted in 9-45 million illnesses, and 12,000-61,000 deaths annually in the U.S. since 2010. The total economic cost of influenza is estimated to be $11.2 billion per year in the country alone. With effective vaccination coverage, communities can achieve immunity goal and protect the most vulnerable populations. Continued innovation and growth across the influenza vaccines market is crucial to improve protection against this high-risk respiratory virus. Annually, the World Health Organization (WHO) meticulously selects the influenza virus strains for upcoming season's vaccines based on extensive global surveillance data. This process aims to provide optimal protection against circulating influenza viruses by adjusting the strains included to match the predicted prevalent and threatening viruses. The recommended strains typically consist of two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. By recommending specific combinations, the WHO ensures broad protection against potential culprits of seasonal influenza, potentially lessening illness, hospitalization, and mortality rates. New Trends and Innovation The influenza vaccines industry, which is expected to surpass US$13 billion in value by 2032, has seen several new trends and innovations in recent years, aimed at improving the effectiveness and accessibility of flu vaccines. Some key trends include: High-Dose Vaccines High-dose flu vaccines contain four times the amount of antigen as standard flu shots, aiming to provide better immunity for patients who may have a weaker immune response. Studies have found high-dose vaccines can reduce risk of flu infection in seniors compared to standard-dose shots. With support from organizations such as the WHO, global awareness and demand for high-dose flu shots is expected to grow steadily, while drug manufacturers working to bolster vaccine support and production. According to study released by Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2023, high-dose influenza vaccines could lower infections by nearly 15% as compared to standard-dose vaccines. Researchers immunized over 1.6 million patients aged 18 to 64 with high-dose quadrivalent flu vaccine or standard-dose vaccines in 2018-19 and 2019-20. In the 50 to 64 age group, 2.0 cases per 1,000 people were diagnosed with flu in the high-dose recombinant group, while 2.3 cases per 1,000 were diagnosed in the standard-dose group, resulting in a relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9% to 23.8%). During April 2023, pharma giant Sanofi and U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority confirmed the groundbreaking for a 2-storey facility in Pennsylvania, for making flu vaccines. The aim of the contract is to enhance readiness by utilizing the innovative recombinant, protein-based technology for distributing a pandemic vaccine. Sanofi produces Fluzone High-Dose, a quadrivalent vaccine designed to target four strains of influenza. Adjuvanted Vaccines Adjuvanted influenza vaccines have emerged as a promising trend in the field of flu vaccination, particularly for older adults who may have a weaker immune response to traditional vaccines. Adjuvants are ingredients added to some vaccines to boost the immune response and create longer-lasting immunity to influenza viruses. Adjuvanted flu vaccines are designed to work well in older adults or those with weaker immune systems. According to a report on influenza vaccines market by Global Market Insights Inc., the share from adult segment will expand at approx. 7.3% CAGR up to 2032, indicating the significant and prospective demand for adjuvanted vaccines. Researchers at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University published a study last year on a protein nanoparticle vaccine with an adjuvant that improves the immune response against influenza. The study describes a promising vaccine candidate that utilizes adjuvants to enhance effectiveness against viral infections. The researchers hope that these adjuvanted protein nanoparticles could be used as mucosal vaccines, either alone or in combination with other vaccines to enhance mucosal immunity and protection. Recent research on the Fluad quadrivalent vaccine, specifically designed to enhance immune responses and overcome immunosenescence in older adults, was published in 2023. Employing a static compartmental model aligned with CDC guidelines, the research project calculated the incremental reduction in influenza-related outcomes achieved by administering adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) versus generic quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) among individuals aged 65 and above across three influenza seasons. The findings indicated that aIIV3 exhibited superior efficacy in mitigating influenza infections. Cell-Based Influenza Vaccines Most flu vaccines are produced by growing viruses in chicken eggs. Cell-based vaccines are produced by growing viruses in animal cells, viewed as a faster and more reliable production method. Cell-based vaccines may induce a stronger immune response. One major driver is the increasing demand for more efficient and reliable influenza vaccines, particularly in the face of seasonal outbreaks and pandemic threats. Also, concerns about egg allergies and limitations in egg supply have prompted a shift towards cell-based production methods. In early 2024, investigators from Taiwan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology revealed a report on a predictive model developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent flu vaccines produced via cell-based technology, versus those manufactured using egg-based methods. In comparison to egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccines, the analysis demonstrated that using cell-based vaccines would prevent approx. 15,665 flu cases, 2,244 complicated cases, and nearly 260 hospitalizations every year. Although the total cost of vaccination was estimated to be around US$4.5 million higher with cell-based vaccines, the cost of treating flu infections among pediatric patients would reduce by roughly US$990,000 annually. As evident, by opting for cell-based quadrivalent flu vaccines, we can save on treatment costs while reducing the cases of flu and its associated complications. Universal Flu Vaccine Research Universal flu vaccine research has been gaining momentum in recent years, with notable progress being made towards developing a vaccine that can provide broad protection against multiple strains of the influenza virus. Recent advancements include promising preclinical and clinical trials demonstrating the potential efficacy of novel vaccine candidates. For example, researchers have developed vaccines that target the stalk region of the influenza virus's hemagglutinin protein, which is highly conserved across different influenza strains. Clinical trials evaluating these vaccines have shown encouraging results, with some candidates eliciting broad and durable immune responses in human subjects. A significant development in the field of universal influenza vaccine research is the ongoing work of the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs) program, which was created in 2019 to support the development of broadly protective and longer-lasting flu vaccines. The program aimed to improve our understanding of the immune response to influenza viruses and develop innovative approaches to vaccine design. An example of a more recent progress is a clinical trial of an mRNA universal influenza vaccine candidate developed by researchers at NIAID Vaccine Research Center, which began in May 2023. This vaccine aims to target six flu strains and could serve as an important line of defense against future flu pandemics. Continued investment and support for universal flu vaccine research are essential to address the evolving nature of influenza viruses and protect global populations from the ongoing threat of the virus. Flu Vaccination Coverage Rates in the U.S. Influenza vaccination coverage tends to be lower among healthy adults under 65 compared to older adults and those with certain medical conditions, as per the CDC. Coverage among children and healthcare workers is higher on average. There are also disparities in flu vaccination coverage based on factors like race, ethnicity, education level, and access to healthcare. Work still needs to be done to improve vaccination rates and reduce gaps between populations. Widespread flu vaccination coverage each year as an important public health goal will augment the influenza vaccines industry scope. Barriers to Vaccination Despite the demonstrated benefits of flu vaccination, vaccination rates remain low in the United States and globally. There are several key barriers that continue to impede higher vaccination rates: Misconceptions about safety and efficacy- Common misconceptions about the flu vaccine include that it causes the flu, it is not effective, or that it has dangerous side effects. A 2023 survey conducted by NFID on Influenza, COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and Pneumococcal Disease from 1,000 responses affirmed that among the people who did not want to take flu vaccinations or were unsure, 31% did not trust the vaccines while 27% expressed concerns regarding vaccine-induced illness. Lack of awareness - Many people take lightly the risks of influenza, the need for vaccines, or recommendations around who should get vaccinated. Increased public education and awareness campaigns from public health organizations could help address this. Lack of access- Vaccine access issues disproportionately affect minority groups, low-income populations, and developing regions globally. Barriers like high costs, lack of transportation, inability to take time off work, or simply lack of availability in certain areas reduce vaccination coverage. Efforts to increase access through free vaccination programs, expanded clinic hours, mobile vaccination drives, and low-cost or publicly funded vaccine doses could improve coverage among affected demographics, strengthening the regional influenza vaccines market. For instance, the CDC’s “Wild to Mild” campaign launched in September last year was initiated to spread critical information regarding the importance of influenza vaccine and how it can lower the risk of serious outcomes from the virus. Flu Vaccination among Nursing Home Residents In the United States, there are more than 26,000 nursing home facilities. Nursing homes house a significant portion of age group more vulnerable to influenza virus, making them a crucial focus for flu prevention efforts. While flu vaccination is strongly recommended by the CDC for all adults 65 and older, including those in nursing homes, the reality paints a less optimistic picture. According to a 2023 CDC report, the 2022-23 flu season saw a vaccination rate of only 42.2% among nursing home residents in the country, suggesting a key challenge to overcome for the U.S. influenza vaccines industry. There can be several factors that contribute to low influenza vaccination rates in nursing homes, such as: Misconceptions about the flu vaccine's effectiveness and safety. Difficulty vaccinating cognitively impaired residents who cannot consent. Lack of vaccination requirements for healthcare workers in long-term care facilities. Failure to stock adequate flu vaccine supplies. The consequences of low vaccination rates can be dire, as nursing home residents are at increased risk of severe complications from flu, including pneumonia, hospitalization, and even death. A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that unvaccinated residents were over five times more likely to be hospitalized due to flu compared to vaccinated individuals. By understanding the current state of flu vaccination rates in nursing homes, acknowledging the contributing factors, and exploring potential solutions, we can work towards better protecting our vulnerable elders. Through targeted education, open communication, and streamlined processes, we can empower residents, families, and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and prioritize flu protection. Influenza is a serious public health threat that causes severe illness, hospitalization, and death every year. The influenza vaccines available today are safe and effective. Getting an annual flu shot protects you and the whole community. Targeted education in the industry will involve delivering easily understandable and culturally relevant information to residents, families, and healthcare staff to underscore the significance and advantages of vaccination. Streamlining logistics by working closely with healthcare providers and facilities to simplify vaccination procedures, such as organizing on-site clinics and resolving transportation obstacles, will bolster the North America influenza market outlook.

National Institute of Health (NIH) scientists have discovered antibodies targeting the underside of the neuraminidase (NA) globular head domain. The (NA) protein is common among many influenza viruses, including H3N2 subtype viruses. Millions of people globally become sick from influenza. Although vaccination reduces the burden of the disease, updated vaccines are required each season to provide protection against multiple strains and subtypes of the evolving virus. Producing a vaccine that protects against a broad range of influenza viruses could stop outbreaks of new viruses without the need for yearly vaccine reformulation. One method to improve influenza vaccines is to find novel targets on the virus’ surface proteins in conserved regions. Influenza NA is a surface protein containing a globular head portion and a narrow stalk portion. The underside of the NA head has a highly conserved region with epitopes that make it vulnerable to antibody binding and inhibition to the virus. It also is not impacted by mutations common in drug-resistant strains. The team isolated human antibodies, that target the underside of the NA head, from the blood of two people who had recovered from influenza type A subtype H3N2. In lab tests, the antibodies inhibited propagation of viruses from subtype H2N2, and H3N2 viruses from humans, swine, and birds. Also, they protected mice from lethal infection by a subtype H3N2 virus when administered either one day before or two days after infection, demonstrating that the antibody could treat and prevent influenza in this model. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, the researchers analysed the structure of two of the antibodies while bound to NA. Each antibody targeted different, nonoverlapping regions of the NA head underside, showing that this region has multiple areas that may be useful to explore for countermeasure development. The study’s results indicate that antibodies targeting the NA head underside could be useful in combination with antivirals or other types of antibodies to combat influenza, as they are effective against influenza viruses with drug-resistant mutations. Also, NA head underside targets could be included in the next generation of broadly protective vaccines against influenza. This study was published in Immunity.

Save & AcceptBird flu is spreading from pole to pole. Here’s why it matters. Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuPremiumANIMALSBird flu is spreading from pole to pole. Here’s why it matters.A highly virulent strain of H5N1 has wiped out entire colonies of seabirds and seals from Alaska to Antarctica. Experts say the risk to people is low—for now.A particularly aggressive strain of H5N1 has killed thousands of northern gannets (pictured, a rookery in Ireland) in 40 out of 41 monitored colonies across Europe.Photograph By Jasper Doest, Nat Geo image collectionByJason BittelMarch 7, 2024In Alaska, a polar bear recently tested positive for a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza for the first time ever in the species. Recently, several predatory seabirds died from the virus, known as H5N1, near Argentina’s research station on Antarctica—another first, this time as a novel record of bird flu on the icy mainland. Now at both ends of the globe, bird flu has flared up once more, infecting dozens of bird and mammal species, from Africa to Asia to Europe. In late March, a farm in the U.S. state of Minnesota reported the pathogen in a baby goat. Evidence now points to the latest strain being “extremely deadly” and “increasingly infectious,” according to an article published in Nature. In 2023, a polar bear in Alaska died from bird flu—the first recorded case in the species. The predators, including this family in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, already face many threats, particularly shrinking sea ice.Photograph By FLORIAN SCHULZ, Nat Geo Image CollectionScientists first identified avian influenza on a commercial goose farm in Guangdong, China, in 1996, and periodic outbreaks have occurred since around the world. The potentially fatal virus, which is contracted through contaminated bodily fluids, spreads from wild birds, its primary vector, into poultry operations. These facilities then kill large quantities of their birds in an attempt to control the spread.Since the first case was detected in the U.S. on February 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has recorded avian influenza in either wild or captive birds in every state except Hawaii. As of March 6, 2024, the virus has affected more than 82 million birds in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While 20 countries have reported 882 cases of avian influenza leaping into humans since 2003—more than half of which were fatal—the CDC classifies the current risk to people as low. On April 1, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported a person contracted bird flu from an infected dairy cow, the second known U.S. human case in the latest outbreak. The person experienced minor symptoms. On April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported the virus has been detected in raw milk from U.S. dairy cows, but that the commercial milk supply is still safe.But other experts caution the recent developments as a stern wake-up call for the pathogen’s potential for becoming a pandemic. (Read about a bird flu outbreak in Israel in 2022.)“Avian influenza is a wild card,” says Andrew Derocher, a biologist who’s been studying polar bears for 40 years at the University of Alberta in Canada.For instance, while Derocher says it’s possible that the polar bear incident is a “one-off," it could also be “a huge mess” for the species, which are already vulnerable to extinction. As the Arctic warms and sea ice breaks up earlier, more polar bears will be forced onto land, where they may scavenge birds that died from the virus.“Disease in polar bears is an issue that smolders in my brain,” he says.And it’s not only polar bears—H5N1 could have grave consequences for wildlife already suffering from a wide variety of human-caused stressors, such as pollution, climate change, habitat loss, and invasive species.“Wildlife are definitely vectors,” says Jude Lane, a conservation scientist at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the U.K. “But they’re also victims.”“The sky was empty”Most years, setting foot on Bass Rock in Scotland is an assault on the senses, says Lane.This is because so many northern gannets nest on the rock each year that the crag, which rises out of the North Sea, literally turns white from the densely packed birds and their excrement. But in 2022, when scientists arrived to do their annual surveys of the seabirds, they stumbled upon a bizarre scene.Scientists identified bird flu in gentoo penguins on the Falkland Islands in January 2024. Above, gentoos in Neko Harbor, part of the Antarctic Peninsula, incubate their eggs inside rocky nests.Photograph By THOMAS PESCHAK, Nat Geo Image Collection“Bass Rock was the biggest colony in the world. It was just alive. The whole rock was alive,” says Lane. “But when that virus hit, it was just immediately quiet.”Over the course of several weeks and return visits, the scientists watched as what once used to be a living quilt of birds turned into a patchwork.“I mean, there were birds dying at our feet,” says Lane. “And the sky was empty.”In the aftermath, scientists estimate that a particularly aggressive strain of H5N1 killed thousands of birds in 40 out of 41 monitored northern gannet colonies across Europe—colonies that represent 75 percent of global northern gannet nesting sites. At Bass Rock, occupied nest sites plummeted by 71 percent.A handful of GPS trackers also revealed a strange new behavior: As the virus raged, a few gannets flew off to visit neighboring rookeries—something the birds don’t usually do. If the birds had avian influenza, they could have carried the virus to new populations—an avian super spreader event."They don't drown"A year later and half a world away, a similar scene played out in Península Valdés, Argentina—this time, with southern elephant seals.As the only continental colony for the species, these beaches typically look like a mosh pit with gigantic, 20-foot-long males bludgeoning each other over harems of squawking females and pups. But in 2023, the same beaches looked more like the aftermath of a shipwreck.In 2023, bird flu led to a catastrophic die-off among southern elephant seals in Argentina (pictured, animals in the Falkland Islands).Photograph By SERGIO PITAMITZ, Nat Geo image collection“We found silence and massive numbers of carcasses,” says Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of California Davis who has worked in Argentinian Patagonia for about 35 years. “All ages, new and old, just piled up on the beach where there should have been living, happy animals.”You May Also LikeSCIENCEShould you be concerned about bird flu in your milk?ANIMALSPizzlies, grolars, and narlugas: Why we may soon see more Arctic hybridsANIMALSAmerica’s most beloved bear is dead. Here’s why Grizzly 399 mattered.Many of the animals still gripping to life were pups—clearly ill, and apparently alone.“When the tide came in, as we were leaving the beach, some of those pups were actually in the water, unable to get out, and drowning,” says Uhart. “And these are elephant seals. They don't drown.”Back at the lab, samples confirmed the outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. Uhart and her team estimate the virus killed 17,400 pups, or approximately 96 percent of all young born in 2023. As with people, such severe cases of the virus can cause systemic organ failure and neurological issues.The virus proliferated in seabirds that scavenged on the carcasses. At one point, she says, there were so many dead terns lying around that seagulls began using their corpses as nesting material.Uhart was also an author on a report that found shocking numbers of wildlife deaths due to bird flu in South America. Between October 2022 and November 2023, the virus has killed nearly 600,000 birds of at least 82 species and more than 50,000 mammals of at least 10 species, mostly in Peru and Chile.“We have never seen anything like this before in South America or Antarctica,” says Uhart.Bird flu in poultryWhile the virus has spilled over into wild mammals in North America, from bobcats and bottlenose dolphins to gray seals, coyotes, and skunks, and myriad birds, from bald eagles to mallards and great horned owls, there haven’t been any equally gruesome mass casualty events on that continent—yet.The U.S. Department of Agriculture keeps running tabs on positive tests. For instance, between February 5 and 26 of this year, scientists detected avian influenza in wildlife in 15 states, from California to Florida to Maine.At the same time, more than a dozen states have also confirmed infections in poultry flocks, both backyard and commercial, affecting more than 90,000 birds. That’s still a small number compared with the more than 9.5 billion broiler chickens and 208 million turkeys processed each year in the U.S., says Shilo Weir, a spokesperson for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.“It is also important to note that we saw fewer cases of [bird flu] in 2023 than we did in 2022,” Weir says in an email.This decrease may be due to tighter biosecurity measures, which prevent spread from farm to farm, she says. Fewer detections may also mean that “there’s less virus in the environment,” says Weir.Lack of solutionsAs for what can be done to stop bird flu, so far, the answer appears to be: not much.While experts have experimented with vaccinating wild and critically endangered California condors against the virus, the logistics of vaccinating other populations, wild or domestic, have yet to be worked out.“It’s not off the table,” says Lane, “but trying to vaccinate a colony of gannets would just blow my mind.” (Read why birds matter, and are worth protecting.)Uhart says vaccines could protect some wild animals, but that controversies have thwarted those products’ development.“At this point, I find it increasingly unacceptable that we're willing to kill billions of chickens around the world to control a disease that we could manage differently,” she says.Meanwhile, the virus will continue to spread, adapt, and evolve into new forms—some of which may be more targeted at mammals, including us, says Uhart.“This is a number one zoonotic disease,” she says, “and a virus that has every single trait that makes it perfect for pandemic spread.”This story was updated on March 25, 2024, April 1, 2024, and April 25, 2024.Related TopicsANIMAL DISEASESINFLUENZABIRDSDISEASESELEPHANT SEALSPOLAR BEARYou May Also LikeANIMALSA mysterious new respiratory illness is spreading in dogs.

CDC/Jim Gathany The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) in an announcement following the meeting noted that the Yamagata influenza B lineage hasn't been detected since March 2020, and evidence suggests it no longer poses a public health threat. Move is part of broader push for return to trivalent formulations Yesterday's vote on a return to trivalent (three-strain) vaccines follows its discussions in October 2023 about whether quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccines were still needed. In September 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) flu vaccine advisers recommended a switch back to trivalent flu vaccines. The FDA said it has been working with manufacturers to move to trivalent formulations for the upcoming flu season. "FDA anticipates that there will be an adequate and diverse supply of approved trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines for the United States in the coming season," it said. FDA anticipates that there will be an adequate and diverse supply of approved trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines. However, it also acknowledged that not all countries can revert to trivalent vaccines as fast as the United States is moving and that companies that have existing FDA-approved flu vaccines and want to export them can include the Yamagata influenza B strain. VRBPAC also approved the strains to include in the 2024-25 trivalent vaccines, which align with the ones recommended for the upcoming Northern Hemisphere season by the World Health Organization for both egg- and cell-based vaccines. New support for cervical cancer elimination expands HPV vaccine access News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Human Papillomavirus (HPV) The World Health Organization (WHO), nongovernmental organizations, and country representatives meeting in Colombia yesterday announced major efforts to eliminate cervical cancer. The efforts hinge on the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and leverage a recent one-dose policy recommendation designed to facilitate greater use of the vaccine, especially in lower-income countries, and include better screening and treatment. PAHO / Flickr cc The announcements were also backed by $600 million in new funding, the WHO said in a statement. Much of the funding came from the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and UNICEF. The WHO notes that cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and disproportionately affects women in families in low- and middle-income countries. In 2022, the WHO recommended a one-dose HPV vaccine schedule to reduce vaccination barriers, which was also adopted by WHO regional offices in the Americas and Africa. So far, 37 countries have switched or plan to switch to a one-dose HPV vaccine regimen. Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said the HPV vaccine is one of the world's most impactful vaccines and has already helped save thousands of lives. "More girls urgently deserve the same protection, which is why in partnership with countries, Gavi has set an ambitious goal to help vaccinate 86 million adolescent girls by 2025. With bold commitment and decisive action, we can look forward to a future where cervical cancer has been eliminated for good." COVID-19 pandemic changed all-cause mortality among US Latinos News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 A new analysis of all-cause mortality of Hispanic and Latino adults published in Annals of Internal Medicine shows Mexicans and Central Americans were most affected by the pandemic. The study was based on trends seen among 15,568 adults aged 18 to 74 years who participated in the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos). Baseline mortality trends from 2008 through 2011 were compared to trends seen in 2020 and 2021. Participants were recruited from the Bronx, New York City; Chicago; Miami; and San Diego and were of Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and South American backgrounds. Socioeconomic factors at play during pandemic Prior to the pandemic, cumulative mortality risks were higher in the Puerto Rican and Cuban groups (6.3% and 5.9%, respectively) and lowest in the South American group (2.3%). Mortality was higher among those born in the United States and lower among immigrants, and the increased mortality risk among Puerto Ricans and Cubans was most often associated with lifestyle factors, including diet. "During the pandemic, marginal 2-year cumulative mortality risks adjusted for age ranged from 1.1% (South American) to 2.0% (Central American), and CIs [confidence intervals] overlapped across all groups," the authors wrote. "Our findings (based on 2 years of follow-up) suggest that mortality risks varied during the pandemic after adjustment for lifestyle and clinical factors—that is, risks were somewhat higher for persons of Central American and Mexican backgrounds than for those of Puerto Rican and Cuban backgrounds." Risks were somewhat higher for persons of Central American and Mexican backgrounds than for those of Puerto Rican and Cuban backgrounds Lifestyle factors were second to socioeconomic factors in contributing to mortality, the authors wrote, as the pandemic emphasized discrepancies among Latino groups. For example, according to the 2020 census, 20.3% of Mexican Latinos had no insurance, compared with 8% of Puerto Rican Latinos. In an editorial on the study, authors write the HCHS/SOL, "holds great promise for the further development of theoretical models and frameworks on Latino mortality and health," an area of study missing in US public health research. CDC limits ordering of tetanus-diphtheria vaccine as it braces for shortage News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Diphtheria Pertussis Resilient Drug Supply CDC The tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine is expected to be in short supply throughout the year after one of the two suppliers to the United States discontinued production, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns. The nonprofit organization MassBiologics recently stopped production of its TdVax vaccine, leaving only Sanofi's Tenivac on the market. Grifols USA, which distributes TdVax, told the CDC that supplies are expected to last only until June, and Sanofi has said that it's working to augment US supplies of Tenivac to try to offset the gap. To conserve available supplies of Tenivac, the CDC has implemented temporary ordering limits. While supplies of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines (Sanofi's Adacel and GSK's Boostrix) aren't limited, they are more expensive, and a very small fraction of patients can develop encephalopathy (brain damage) from the pertussis component. Tdap vaccine can be substituted in most people The CDC recommends that healthcare providers use Tdap vaccine rather than Td vaccine in patients without a pertussis vaccine contraindication. It said that Tdap can also be substituted when a tetanus booster is needed for wound management. Td and Tdap vaccines are given during childhood and then every 10 years or when needed for tetanus prevention after severe or contaminated wounds or burns. While supplies of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines aren't limited, they are more expensive, and a very small fraction of patients can develop encephalopathy (brain damage) from the pertussis component. Also known as lockjaw, tetanus is a very rare infection caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which releases a toxin that causes painful muscle spasms. Diphtheria, caused by the toxin-releasing bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, can cause shortness of breath, abnormal heart rhythms, and death. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract caused by Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis bacteria. The Td vaccine shortage comes on the heels of a recent and ongoing US shortage of the new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody injection for infants, Beyfortus.

And some of the asthmatics are staring to flare too, because allergies trigger the asthma. I’m also seeing more cases of Flu B now. It’s still not as much as Flu A, but it’s creeping up. Symptoms are the same. Typically we’ll have a peak of Flu A, and then we’ll have a peak of Flu B as Flu A is coming down. It’s the same as far as who is at risk of getting really sick. I’m not seeing RSV, and I’m still seeing some COVID.”Dr. Jaime Hope -- Medical director, Emergency Center, Beaumont Outpatient Campus – Livonia, a part of Corewell Health“We are still seeing lots of COVID, flu and RSV. We are also seeing injuries, but not the typical slip and fall on ice and shoveling related injuries that often come in this time of year, but yard work related injuries that we usually see later in the season! It is great for people to get active and get outside in the sunshine, but it is important to remember using protective gear such as goggles. And use caution and the buddy system when climbing ladders!”Oakland County – Influenza, monoDr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“Influenza is still very present as we have diagnosed multiple patients who have upper respiratory sick symptoms with Influenza A. Remember flu season goes until the end of May and vaccinations are still available.”Dr. David Donaldson -- Emergency Chief, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital Troy“We are still seeing a lot of influenza, but the number of COVID and RSV cases are down. We are also seeing quite a bit of mono in both children and adults.”Washtenaw County– COVID, allergiesDr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Still seeing a fair amount of COVID, moderate influence and assorted URIs. Much less GI illness than previous weeks. Seasonal allergies have arrived early for some with the warmer weather as well.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Digestive issues, influenzaProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“We are seeing patients coming in with vomiting and diarrhea, as well as influenza, RSV, strep and sinus infections.”Macomb County – Influenza, asthma, allergiesDr. William Halacoglu -- Emergency Physician at McLaren Macomb“Confirmed cases of both influenza A and B are still be diagnosed in the ER, mainly presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, and body aches, with some pediatric patients experiencing gastro distress. Weather-related asthma and allergies have led to breathing complications — wheezy and shallow breathing — in some. While some patients are still testing positive for COVID-19, there are signs that the prevalence has begun to taper off. The calmer weather and increase in activities have led to a noticeable increase in orthopedic and other various injuries to the trauma center.”Dr. Maria Samuel -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Sterling Heights“We are seeing influenza, COVID-19 and viral upper respiratory infections going around.”Livingston County -- did not reportCopyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Photo courtesy of Althea Dotzour, UW–Madison Scientists studying viruses at the University of Wisconsin-Madison recently opened their lab door for a tour, looking to shine a light on their work after being targeted by a Republican bill. The legislation would have prohibited some of the research that has been done in the past in Madison. Researchers defended the science targeted by the bill as safe and valuable for understanding the emergence of pandemic viruses. Representatives of the UW’s Influenza Research Institute said the tours are given annually when the lab is closed for maintenance and a thorough decontamination. While the timing of the event was not tied to the proposed legislation, researchers said the tours offer politicians the chance to see their facility firsthand. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. The controversy surrounding the lab involves so-called “gain-of-function” research, which has been used to make pathogens more virulent or transmissible. The lab has not done any of that research since 2014 when the National Institutes of Health halted funding on such projects. While the government allowed that type of research to resume in 2019, it has not been conducted at the Wisconsin lab in the last 10 years. For decades, the world’s leading scientists have debated the merits of such experiments. But Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, the virologist who runs the lab, is one of its leading proponents. “The goal of my research is to improve global health,” Kawaoka said in a brief presentation. He said he has been studying influenza viruses for 40 years. The lab has developed reverse genetics technology for influenza viruses, which has been used to make the nasal spray flu vaccine Flumist and bird flu vaccines. Kawaoka has also studied the Ebola virus and completed a human clinical trial with an Ebola vaccine. Peter Halfmann is an associate research professor in the lab. He accompanied Kawaoka to study Ebola in Sierra Leone. “We look at why respiratory viruses cause disease and what makes one virus be very pathogenic or highly transmissible,” Halfmann said. Halfmann said gain-of-function research can include experiments to change the way a virus transmits — say, from being bloodborne to transmitting by aerosol droplets. Or a virus could be manipulated to be resistant to a certain vaccine or antiviral therapy. An equipment-exchange airlock door is seen during a tour of the Influenza Research Institute (IRI) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Feb. 28, 2017. Photo courtesy of Jeff Miller, UW-Madison The research occurs in a high-security facility behind airlocked doors. Anyone entering must stand in a vestibule between two such doors, the latter of which will only open once the first has been sealed entirely. Everyone who works there must pass a high level security clearance. While there are no undergraduate employees, there is currently one graduate student and seven postdoctoral trainees working there. Researchers enter with two pairs of scrubs, a towel and a set of special shoes. Outside clothes and shoes are kept in a locker. Everyone must shower in order to exit the lab – even to use the restroom. “Takes about 20 minutes to get out,” Halfmann said, so he reminds people to use the restroom before entering. “We hate for someone to get in and then get out right away,” he said. There are redundancies and alarms for every system, and continuous remote computer monitoring, Halfmann said. The lab’s air is HEPA filtered, wastewater is decontaminated, and the building has a backup generator that can turn on in seconds if they ever lose power from the city. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a professor of pathobiological sciences in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, talks with a group of media representatives during a tour of the Influenza Research Institute on Feb. 13, 2013. Photo courtesy of Bryce Richter, UW-Madison ‘Gain-of-function’ was used to transmit bird flu between ferrets In 2011, Kawaoka submitted research to the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity and the journal Nature that showed he had adapted the H5N1 bird flu so that it could infect a mammal. He said he used ferrets because they show flu-like symptoms similarly to humans. On the tour, Halfmann showed side-by-side “isolator units” where the ferrets were kept. HEPA filters are sealed on each side of the cages. “So when (Kawaoka) was talking about airborne transmission, we had the infected ferret here,” Halfmann said, pointing to one cage. “And then it can transmit virus, potentially, to the contact here.” While this sort of pathogen research has long been controversial, the COVID-19 pandemic only worsened the political atmosphere, Halfmann said. Skeptics link the virus to gain-of-function research conducted at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. A report declassified last year said U.S. intelligence agencies found no direct evidence the virus came from a lab, but could not rule out either laboratory or wild origins. The bill in the state legislature this year would have ended all gain-of-function research at higher education institutions in the state, and cut funding from any university that continued such experiments. The state Assembly did not vote on the proposal before adjourning last month. But there are ongoing efforts in other states, and at the federal level, to curtail the research. The bill received hearings in the state Assembly and Senate. It defined a “potentially pandemic pathogen” to mean a virus, bacteria, fungus or eukaryotic parasite, or any strain or variant of a virus, bacteria, fungus or eukaryotic parasite. Written testimony from UW-Madison and the Medical College of Wisconsin said the bill could have interfered with research on the common cold viruses, RSV and pneumonia. Studies looking at how HPV and COVID-19 drive dementia and Alzheimer’s disease could have also been impacted, according to the letter. Even experts who supported the bill said the definitions were too broad. Bryce Nickels, a professor of genetics at Rutgers University, testified in favor of the bill on behalf of Biosafety Now. The group seeks to regulate pathogen research and increase the public’s role in oversight. Nickels said he would have changed the definitions of “gain-of-function” and “potentially pandemic pathogen” to target only the research that has been done in the past at the UW-Madison lab. Given the concerns about the lab, Halfmann said annual tours are offered to reporters, university communications personnel, state health officials, emergency responders and elected officials. But the critics don’t accept the offers for a tour, Halfmann said. “We don’t get the politicians to come and visit our lab. Which is unfortunate because they really don’t know what is going on in the lab,” he said. Halfmann said the lab is waiting in part on expected guidelines from the federal government on gain-of-function research. “The type of studies that we propose are going on on a much larger level in nature too,” he said, when viruses jump between species and become more dangerous.” “And it would be unfortunate if something would happen and we would be unprepared because researchers have been afraid or nervous to do this kind of research in their labs,” he said. At the Assembly hearing on the bill, Nickels disagreed. “Sometimes you can learn an enormous amount about how these viruses work, and about how they might spill over into the human populations without actually making a virus that will do that,” he said. Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify that scientists defended the research targeted by recent proposed legislation. They called the research safe and valuable for understanding the emergence of pandemic viruses.

Here's how to protect yourselfChad Murphy Akron Beacon JournalJust in time for spring break comes some news that could put a damper on vacation plans — Ohio is among the worst states in the nation for the flu, according to the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control.The CDC has Ohio as one of five states ranked "very high" for current influenza cases for the week ending Feb. 24, the most recent data available. Ohio is joined by Michigan, Arkansas, Nebraska and New Mexico at the top of that chart.According to the Ohio Department of Health, the state recorded 726 influenza hospitalizations for the same week, and is trending upward in four out of five categories.Hospitalizations are up 14.87% from the previous week; emergency department visits are up 1.49%; ER visits for fever or influenza-like illnesses are up 1.55%; and outpatient visits are up 6.39%. Only thermometer sales dropped, by 3.51%How to protect yourself from influenzaDr. Mysheika Roberts, Columbus Public Health commissioner, said it's important to stay home if you're sick, to protect yourself and others. Also, wash your hands and cover your coughs and sneezes. And it's never too late to get vaccinated, Roberts said, against both the flu and COVID-19.Dr. Joe Gastaldo, an infectious disease specialist and vice president of clinical affairs at OhioHealth’s Dublin Methodist Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital, encouraged people to get vaccinated against the flu and get updated vaccines for COVID-19, as well as for RSV, a virus that causes inflammation of the small airways in the lungs and can lead to pneumonia, if eligible.Gastaldo stressed the importance of getting vaccines to protect from communicable diseases.“The reason to get them is that they defang the virus, meaning that if you do get an infection, you’re very likely to only have mild symptoms, and you’re significantly less likely to die or be hospitalized for these viruses,” he said.Flu season: Here's where to get a flu shot in Greater CincinnatiWhat are the symptoms of the flu?The flu can cause a cough, sore throat, fatigue, headaches and body aches and fever, according to the CDC. It can also spur more serious complications, such as pneumonia. During the 2021 to 2022 flu season, an estimated 5,000 Americans died from it."The flu is a serious thing," Dr. Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious disease specialist at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center, warned in October.

It’s disappeared due to COVID LOG IN SIGN UP SEARCH View More Results SEARCH LOG IN Space Tech Nature Earth History People Health Core Sciences Newsletters Subscribe Now Body and Mind COVID Medicine Nutrition Body and Mind COVID Medicine Nutrition Cosmos » Medicine COVID has killed off a flu virus, US scraps it from vaccines Credit: Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images March 8, 2024 Matthew Ward Agius Matthew Agius is a science writer for Cosmos Magazine. By Matthew Ward Agius A line of the flu virus has been effectively wiped out, ironically thanks to COVID-19. The ‘Yamagata’ lineage is one of two varieties of Influenza B, which along with Influenza A subtypes, causes seasonal flu. But no evidence of the Yamagata lineage has been detected globally since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – and the United States Food and Drug Administration has agreed with recommendations from the World Health Organization that it no longer be included in seasonal flu vaccines. Yamagata was already in decline pre-pandemic, but none of its strains have been isolated since March 2020. It’s believed containment measures introduced to prevent the spread of COVID-19 – such as face masking and physical isolation – may have helped to drive Yamagata to undetectable levels. Last year, the WHO recommended only one Yamagata lineage be included in quadrivalent southern hemisphere seasonal flu vaccines. Its recent update for the 2024-25 northern hemisphere flu season said the inclusion of Yamagata-like viruses in trivalent jabs was “no longer warranted”. Now, a meeting by the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on Tuesday (local time) has ratified that recommendation. In a statement, the FDA said: “In the interest of public health, FDA strongly recommended to influenza vaccine manufacturers the removal of the B/Yamagata lineage virus from seasonal influenza vaccines in the U.S. for the 2024-2025 influenza season. FDA and the manufacturers have been working together so that the move from quadrivalent to trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines occurs for the upcoming influenza season.” Read More Medicine Has the COVID pandemic driven a flu strain extinct? The United States’ next batch of flu vaccines will include components of two Influenza A viruses and one ‘Victoria’ lineage Influenza B virus. Before the WHO and FDA announced their new directions, the August meeting of Australia’s Advisory Committee on Vaccines discussed the potential for removing the Yamagata lineage from future inoculations. Options to make a stronger vax Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead, tells Cosmos Yamagata was highly unlikely to return, but that its disappearance merely emphasises the competition between respiratory viruses in the environment. “The high likelihood is that Yamagata is gone,” Booy says. “The four years of non-appearance has only year-on-year reinforced the understanding that there are a lot of other viruses out there competing for the biological niche in humans and this one has lost its way.” While he agrees with the decision by the WHO, FDA, and likely Australia’s TGA, to adopt a ‘three-pronged’ flu vaccine for the future, he says there could be an opportunity to stick with a four-antigen jab that gives greater protection against the most potent ‘A’ subtypes. “Influenza H3N2, which first appeared more than 50 years ago from the Hong Kong pandemic in 1962, is the most predominant cause of influenza and it continues to mutate and evolve and change so that our vaccines, even though they’re decided upon in the 6-12 months before they’re introduced, still only provide 50-70% protection,” Booy says. “Some people therefore think that if we go for two different variants of H3, we could prevent the most damaging and most virulent cause of influenza each winter.” Originally published by Cosmos as COVID has killed off a flu virus, US scraps it from vaccines You Might Like Birds $95 million injection to fight the threat of avian influenza Birds How avian influenza has spread to Antarctic islands Birds How does bird flu cross species barrier to infect mammals?

The latest update from the agriculture ministry puts the number of commercial ducks that have received their first dose of H5N1 HPAI vaccine at more than 21.6 million (as of March 4). This is three million more than it reported on February 12. All mainland regions of France have now begun vaccination of commercial ducks, according to the national policy. Carrying out the most vaccinations so far have been the western and southwestern regions of Pays de Loire, Nouvelle Aquitaine, and Occitanie. Following several waves of HPAI in recent years that have devastated the nation’s duck sector in particular, France decided to begin vaccination of commercial ducks in October of last year. Target number of ducks was 64 million, covering the main species, in flocks of medium and large size, and producing products that were not intended for export. Despite the latter pledge and the progress made, France has suffered a backlash from international markets over its decision to carry out the vaccination program.Between November of last year and mid-January, 10 HPAI outbreaks in French poultry flocks were confirmed by the ministry. All were linked to the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype. Just three of the outbreaks involved ducks, while the other affected six flocks of turkeys, and one of laying hens. In late February, the authorities officially declared the outbreak “resolved” to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).HPAI outbreak total in European poultry flocks rises againAmong the region’s commercial birds, total outbreaks have reached 130 for the year so far. This is according to the latest update of the Animal Disease Information System from the European Commission (EC; as of March 1). It monitors the animal disease situation in European Union (EU) member states and neighboring countries.The system has recorded one or more outbreaks so far in 2024 in 15 states — a number unchanged from the previous edition dated February 23.With the highest total so far this year is Moldova with 55, followed by Poland (24). Since the earlier update, these totals have increased by 20 and four, respectively. Furthermore, one more outbreak in Slovakia has raised its total to five. Further detail on some of these developments are provided in notifications from the national animal health agencies to WOAH.Poland’s two latest outbreaks occurred in the first days of March in two meat turkey flocks, according to the WOAH report. With around 8,000 and 44,700 birds, the farms were located in the same district in the northeastern province of Warmia-Masuria. They bring to 25 the number of confirmed outbreaks on Polish poultry farms so far in 2024, directly impacting 565,000 birds.In Bulgaria, the number of outbreaks this year has risen by one to eight. The latest to test positive for HPAI was a flock of almost 40,000 poultry in Haskovo. These were the first cases in the current outbreak series in this southern province, and they bring the total birds affected to more than 120,700.A second poultry unit at a previously infected premises in the Czech Republic (Czechia) has been depopulated due to HPAI. According to the WOAH report, the original outbreak involved around 11,700 parent stock birds, which showed clinical signs of disease, tested positive for HPAI, and were culled. Separately managed and located at a distance of 100 meters were 13,400 grandparent birds. Initially they displayed no symptoms, but subsequent tests showed they too were infected, and they have also been culled. Cases in captive birds in 4 states Covered by this category under the EC System are HPAI outbreaks in non-commercial poultry, zoos, and similar premises.As of March 1, total outbreaks in captive birds stands at 45. With a total of 22, the Czech Republic has registered the most outbreaks in this category since the start of 2024, followed by Germany (eight), and Ukraine (seven). Compared with the previous edition dated February 23, the Czech total has increased by two, and by one for each of Germany and Poland. Furthermore, the Romanian authority has notified WOAH of a further outbreak in a backyard flock in the northeast of the country.According to WOAH reports, presence of the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype has been detected in all these outbreaks — in both poultry and captive birds. 11 countries register new HPAI cases in wild birdsAs of March 1, 24 European countries have reported HPAI cases in their respective wild bird populations with the EC. While the number of nations is unchanged from the previous update dated February 23, the outbreak total has increased by 25 to 314. Of the latest total, 104 outbreaks were confirmed in Germany, 59 in Denmark, and 19 in Sweden. Totals for each of these states increased since the previous EC update, along with those of Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine. Furthermore, the authorities in Romania and Slovenia have each notified WOAH over the past week about one additional wild bird that had tested positive for HPAI. With the exception of Northern Ireland, the animal disease situation in the United Kingdom (U.K.) is not monitored by the EC. However, the U.K. authorities have notified WOAH about two more wild birds that have tested positive for HPAI, and that this was identified as belonging to the H5N5 serotype. They bring to five the nation’s total number of infected birds testing positive for this variant since September of last year. In northern Germany, two wild birds have tested positive for the same HPAI virus serotype. One was a first detection in more than three years in the state of Lower Saxony.The great majority of other cases among European wild birds have been linked to the H5N1 variant.

Why?Yearly influenza vaccination is recommended for all Australians aged six months and over. Source: Getty / Marco VDMAs flu season approaches, Australians will be vaccinated against an influenza strain that hasn't been detected in years.Influenza vaccines are given - and generally updated - each year to protect against the most common strains of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee (AIVC) have recommended that one strain not seen for several years - called the B/Yamagata lineage - is no longer needed.READ MOREAn early flu season is looming. When's the best time to get vaccinated?But the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has outlined in advice published earlier this month that it "supports the use" of vaccines continuing to include B/Yamagata in 2024. An expert who works with the WHO said "it is still in the vaccine" this year - but stressed this will not affect vaccine safety. What are the main types of influenza, and what is circulating?Influenza (also called flu) is a contagious infection of the airways that affects people of all ages - especially babies, young children, pregnant women and people with underlying medical conditions. There are two main types: influenza A and B, which are then categorised into different strains (or lineages), Professor Paul Griffin, an infectious diseases physician and clinical microbiologist from the University of Queensland told SBS News."When we look at the A's, we look at the proteins on the surface to further categorise those ... then we can give those numbers depending on where they're from," he said. "We often name the B's after where they're found." Professor Ian Barr, deputy director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute, said there are two types of influenza A viruses currently circulating in the human population: AH1N1 and AH3N2.READ MOREThe flu nearly disappeared during the pandemic. Now, cases are soaringWhen it comes to influenza B viruses, he said the story is changing. "For the last 20 years, we've had two different strains circulating in the human population [Victoria and Yamagata] which are slightly different."Since March 2020, one of those B components has disappeared or become extinct ... Now, it looks like there are only three viruses that are currently circulating in the human population: the two A's and the B/Victoria lineage."Yamagata and COVID: A test of "survival of the fittest"Barr said this change happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. "2020 was going along like a normal [flu] season and once COVID hit and all the restrictions came in, influenza circulation stopped dead in its tracks. That continued through 2021, and really only got going again when we opened the borders in 2022."He said this made it difficult for influenza to survive. "Normally, it [works as] a cycle between the northern and southern hemisphere ... bringing in new viruses and setting up epidemics every year. Unlike some of the other viruses, they don't generally circulate around in the community all year round - they need to be refreshed," he said. "It was like a survival of the fittest - what we call a 'bottleneck' occurred. Only some viruses got through that bottleneck. The one that fell off was probably the least fit and in low circulation - they were the B/Yamagata viruses."Influenza circulation dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit: AAPWhat do we know about this year's flu vaccines?Influenza vaccines come as a single shot covering several strains. A quadrivalent vaccine is designed to protect against four different strains: two influenza A and two influenza B viruses.Last September, the WHO's vaccine composition advisory committee recommended that the inclusion of B/Yamagata as a component of influenza vaccines "is no longer warranted" and that "every effort should be made to exclude it as soon as possible". In advice published on 1 March, ATAGI said this was also recommended by the Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee (AIVC) "as this lineage has not been seen for several years". "However, the quadrivalent vaccines available in Australia continue to include the B Yamagata component, and ATAGI supports the use of these vaccines in 2024," ATAGI said. Barr said this means we're now looking to remove B/Yamagata from flu vaccines "because it is no longer circulating". "But all of that takes time... there wasn't sufficient time after the September recommendation to remove that and have adequate supplies in Australia.He said the safety profiles are "exactly the same - with or without it". READ MOREFrom needle-free ‘patches’ to nasal sprays: What’s next for COVID vaccines?Griffin agreed. "The important thing is ... it's thought it's not going to undermine protection against the other elements. But because it's [B/Yamagata] redundant, in the coming years, we probably won't see that included anymore." According to Barr, "It will almost certainly come out of the vaccine" in time for next year. READ MOREShould you get another COVID jab? The booster advice has been updatedWhen should I get the flu vaccine?The federal health department recommends yearly influenza vaccines for everyone aged six months and over. Barr expects new season flu vaccines will be available "within the next few weeks" through the private market. According to the government's website, vaccines under the NIP are expected to be available from April - but timing may differ across local areas. "You should get your annual influenza vaccine anytime from April onwards to be protected for the peak flu season, which is generally June to September," it says.

Trends of the week: COVID-19: Stabilisation of the number of cases and the positivity rate for COVID-19 at a low level. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Stabilisation of the number of RSV cases at a low level. Influenza: Decrease in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 26 February to 3 March 2024 (week 9), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased to 42 cases, compared to 41 cases the previous week (+2%). The positivity rate fell to 2.56% compared to 2.63% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is decreasing. [1] These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has stabilised. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (86.7%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.1%). It should be noted that variant JN.1, a descendant of variant BA.2.86, has predominated since week 47 of 2023. [2] Influenza For the week of 26 February to 3 March 2024 (week 9), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 206 cases from 312 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 34% compared to the previous week. These data largely tally with the LNS sentinel surveillance data, which indicate a drop in the circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 26 February to 3 March 2024 (week 9), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 11 cases, compared with 13 the previous week, presenting an decrease of 15%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

The vaccine is approved by Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for use in adults and children. Cadiflu Tetra Vaccine targets four strains of the Influenza virus subtype–A and B, responsible for seasonal epidemics. Developed using cutting-edge proprietary technology employing nano-sized particles, the vaccine mimics the external structure of the virus without containing intact genetic material. The vaccine carries hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and matrix 1 (M1) proteins from the respective strains aggregated together in a single formulation. The VLP vaccine replicates external structure of the viruses but does not contain any live genetic substance, which can cause viral replication and infection. Therefore, this vaccine is qualitatively superior and has better safety profile. The Cadiflu Tetra Vaccine aims to reduce the incidence of influenza illness, mitigate the severity of the disease in affected individuals, and decrease the transmission of the infection to others. This breakthrough in vaccine development also holds promise for enhancing the protection of pregnant women against influenza, contributing to the overall well-being of both mother and child.

CloseInfluenza epidemic keeps tapering off in Hungary - Portfolio.hu Conference | Market Data EURHUF USDHUF BTCUSD BUX OTP MOL RICHTER MASTERPLAST MTELEKOM OPUS Economy Bruxinfo Business Equity Property Energy Contact Theme Dark Mode Light Mode System Theme Conference Market Data Sign up Theme Dark Mode Light Mode System Theme Economy Bruxinfo Business Equity Property Energy Economy 7 March 2024, 11:44am Influenza epidemic keeps tapering off in Hungary Portfolio Save article Share Hungarian The number of Hungarians seeking medical help with acute respiratory infection (ARI), including influenza-like symptoms has dropped further on the 9th week of 2024. Another good news is that the number of people treated in hospital with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) has dropped from its highest reached on the 8th week. Nearly 28% of those in hospital are treated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and 85% of them are children aged 2 and younger, while now "only" 60% of Covid patients are aged 60 and older versus almost three quarters a week earlier. The flu season generally peaks between the 7th and 10th week of the year, but the highest figures can vary greatly from one year to another. The coronavirus pandemic, for instance, put a serious dent into the spread of the flu (see graph below). The number of people seeking medical help with influenza-like symptoms per 100,000 population (459.7) was higher than currently three times in the past 12 cold seasons (in 2014/15, 2017/18, and 2022/23). For the 52nd week of 2023, the NNK published only a couple of figures, hence the gaps in the graphs. The timeline on the second graph goes up only to the 9th week for a closer look. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CURVE FLATTENED FURTHER FOR THE third CONSECUTIVE WEEK, confirming A TURNAROUND. On the 9th week of 2024, a total of 251,900 people sought medical help with acute respiratory infection (ARI), of whom 44,500 (17.7%) had flu-like symptoms. The former figure marks a 11.9% drop and the latter a 19.2% decline over the 8th week. We can also compare the ARI and flu numbers for 100,000 inhabitants. The epidemic has been more severe in 2023/24 than in 2022/23, apart from nine weeks, and the 9th is one of them. We need to highlight that this year authorities perform more tests than a year ago, even though the number of samples tested remains extremely low (324 in total on a national level last week, down from 398 a week ago). The COVID-19 positivity rate dropped further to 1.2%, and the influenza positivity rate fell sharply to 24.1% from 36.9%. The positivity rate for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also decreased to 9.9% from 11.6%, which comes after three consecutive weeks of growth. If we take a look at the positivity rates on the individual weeks, we find that there was a turnaround on the 2nd week, with the influenza positivity rate (14.0%) higher than the Covid positivity rate (13.6%) for the first time in the current flu season. The gap has widened considerably, reaching 38.8% percentage points on the 6th week and has since then come down to 22.8%. If you're wondering how the weekly positivity rates might turn out, here's how it went down last year, not that it is any guarantee that it will be repeated, but still it can serve as a kind of guidance. As regards all samples tested up to the 9th week, the Covid positivity rate continues to be the highest, but the flu positivity rate is coming up fast and could be higher shortly. The share of coronavirus in all samples tested (orange lines) was a lot smaller a year ago (11.0%) than currently (19.2%), while the percentage of influenza in the samples (green lines) is less than half now (16.4%) than on the ninth week of 2023 (40.1%). As regards the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the samples (blue lines), the situation is much better in the current cold season than in 2022/23, with the share only at 4.1% on the 9th week this year versus 11.2% a year ago. Note that these are the percentages of the select pathogens found in all samples tested up to the 9th week. People tested positive for influenza and RSV had to be hospitalised for the 12th consecutive week in this flu season. The 47th week was the first one when one of the samples showed influenza infection (up at 903 in total by the end of the 9th week). Other pathogens identified between the 40th and 9th week were SARS-CoV-2 (1,060), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 225), adenovirus (6), parainfluenza (6), human metapneumovirus (HMPV, 60, and rhinovirus (45). THERE WERE 284 PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL WITH SARI ON THE 9TH WEEK, VERSUS 357 A WEEK AGO, which was THE HIGHEST FIGURE IN THIS FLU SEASON. 3.5% OF THEM WERE TREATED WITH COVID-19, down FROM 7.6% A WEEK EARLIER, WHILE MORE THAN A FIFTH OF THEM (22.5%) WERE TREATED WITH INFLUENZA, DOWN FROM 23% ON THE 8TH WEEK, WHILE THE SHARE OF RSV PATIENTS remained fairly unchanged at 27.8% (vs. 28%). The graphs below show a comparison with the previous 'flu season'. In 2022/23, there were no reports of people with Covid in hospitals, but that doesn't mean there weren't any (there were 100 on the first week of 2023, so it's a pretty safe bet that not all of them got to that stage overnight). The following chart depicts the number and share of people infected by influenza virus who are currently in hospital. As you can see (orange columns, light blue curve), this 'flu season' was worse in this respect than the previous one up to the 8th week, but - at least in the number of influenza patients hospitalised - we see an improvement on the 9th week. The ratios are largely the same for both years. The chart starts on the 49th week because that was the first week in this season when someone infected with influenza virus had to be hospitalised. We have the same graph for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which shows that this infection was more severe in the previous 'flu season' up to the sixth week, but there was a turnaround on the 7th week. Both the number of people treated with RSV in hospitals and their share as a percentage of all people hospitalised with SARI dropped some on the 9th week of 2024, but the RSV-related hospitalisation is now a lot worse than a year ago. Another important indicator of the severity of an epidemic is how many of those hospitalised end up in the intensive care unit. As mentioned above, there were 284 people with SARI in hospital on the week under review, down from 357 a week earlier. 31 of them were in the ICU, which corresponds to a 10.9% ratio, which figures compare with 42 and 11.8% a week earlier. 46.5% of those hospitalised with SARI were children aged 2 years or younger (up from 43.1% a week ago and the highest in this flu season yet), while 22.5% of them were aged 60 and over (down from 28.6% on the 8th week). For the fourth time in this flu season, both the number and share of children aged 2 years or younger in hospital with SARI came in higher than the corresponding figures for those 60 and over. The COVID-19 vaccination coverage of Hungarians aged 60 and older is dramatically low even by European standards, the latest update by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows. Related articles 2024. 02. 13. Latest EU coronavirus vaccination coverage data show grim situation in Hungary We have no current data on the ongoing administration of flu shots, only figures for the past five flu seasons. These show that demand for vaccination surged during the coronavirus pandemic, and then petered out largely to previously observed levels. (Note that these figures show only the administration of free-of-charge 3FLUART influenza vaccine, i.e. they do not include shots GPs can prescribe at the request of their patients.) We also know that merely 1.3% of the 3-18 age group got these free-of-charge flu shots in the 2022/23 flu season, following 1.7% in 2021/22, 3.9% in 2020/21, 1.4% in 2019/20, and 1.3% in 2018/19. Half of those with ARI are children Finally, we have an age breakdown both for ARI and flu patients. Children up to the age of 14 are on top of the ARI age rankings in terms of numbers, and for the sixth time this season they are also on top in the flu rankings, while the second hardest-hit cluster is the 15-34 age group. The right-hand charts show the share of people with ARI and flu-like symptoms by age group. Looking back on the 2022/23 data we find that the 0-14 age group was the hardest hit throughout the flu season in terms of ARI, while in terms of flu-like symptoms they were the most affected age group between the 3rd and the 15th week of this year, i.e. from mid-January to mid-April. On the 9th week this year, more than 127,000 children sought medical help with ARI, 50.4% of all people that turned to the doctor with some respiratory infection. They also stand out when it comes to flu-like symptoms (more than 42% of all), with their number down at 18,800 from over 22,200 a week ago.

Behind-the-scenes photos of Jisoo filming at an eerie convenience store set have heightened anticipation. Fans of BLACKPINK's Jisoo have been buzzing with excitement lately, and it's not hard to see why. Despite her busy schedule, which includes launching her own company BLISSOO and gracing the prestigious Paris Fashion Week, the talented idol has been hard at work filming for her upcoming K-drama, âInfluenzaâ. Recent photos from the set of âInfluenzaâ have only fueled the anticipation even further.Shared online by an observant fan, these behind-the-scenes glimpses offer a fascinating peek into the filming process. According to the post, the set was abuzz with activity, with both staff and fans alike drawn to the scene. It's said that the filming took place inside a convenience store, with unsuspecting onlookers only realizing something was afoot when they noticed the shop was unusually empty and the streets atypically bustling.In the images captured by the fan, Jisoo was looking every bit the radiant star despite the eerie zombie concept of the drama. She was dressed in a long puffer coat and comfy UGG slippers between takes. Netizens couldn't help but gush over her ethereal visuals in the photos, eagerly awaiting the release of âInfluenzaâ as they spotted intriguing details like blood-stained windows in the background. Adding a touch of humor to the excitement, some fans couldn't help but notice that Jisoo's character seemed to have a penchant for a particular outfit, as she was spotted wearing the same attire each time she was seen filming. Nevertheless, the repetition did little to dampen the enthusiasm, with Jisoo's packed schedule and the teasing glimpses from the set only serving to heighten anticipation for the drama's release.

CoSara's new real-time multiplex PCR test is built on the company's patented Co-Primers technology and designed to simultaneously detect influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9, H1N2, H5N1, H2N2, H9N2, H10N8, H5N6, H7N7, H7N4, H7N2 and H2N1), influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria strains) and to differentiate between H1N1 and H3N2. Co-Primers utilise a unique design architecture to combat common issues with real-time PCR that can lead to inaccurate results, specifically primer dimer propagation, and which are magnified in multiplex reactions. CoSara Director Mohal Sarabhai commented, "This test marks the 15th of CoSara's clinical lab tests to receive IVD clearance by the CDSCO, and adds to our expanding menu of valuable diagnostic tools available to our growing distributor and laboratory customer base." CoSara has previously received CDSCO clearance for RT-PCR tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis B viral load, hepatitis C, hepatitis C viral load, HPV types 16 and 18 and HPV-HR, two COVID-19 assays, chikungunya, dengue, a dengue/chikungunya duplex test, and a Flu A/Flu B/COVID-19 (ABC) multiplex test, all designed using the company's patented Co-Primers technology and cleared to be manufactured and sold to clinical laboratories in the Indian market as IVDs.
