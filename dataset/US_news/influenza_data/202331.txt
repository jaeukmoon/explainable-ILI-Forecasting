The viral constraints and host immune responses that limit and drive the evolution of these viruses are increasingly well understood. However, it remains unclear how most of these advances improve the capacity to reduce the impact of seasonal influenza viruses on human health. In this Review, we synthesize recent progress made in understanding the interplay between the evolution of immunity induced by previous infections or vaccination and the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses driven by the heterogeneous accumulation of antibody-mediated immunity in humans. We discuss the functional constraints that limit the evolution of the viruses, the within-host evolutionary processes that drive the emergence of new virus variants, as well as current and prospective options for influenza virus control, including the viral and immunological barriers that must be overcome to improve the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

Antigenic seniority A concept in immunology in which immune responses of individuals to pathogens experienced earlier in life tend to be stronger and more long lasting than those to pathogens experienced later in life. Backboosting antibody response Antibody response to infection or vaccination based on the recall of previously acquired immune memory response to a partially cross-reactive antigen or epitope. Bottleneck Reduction in population size that results in a contraction in genetic diversity. Deep mutational scanning An experimental method that uses high-throughput sequencing technology to measure the functional capacity of amino acid substitutions across a set of, or all, positions of a protein. Genome reassortment Genomic rearrangement of two or more influenza viruses that infect the same cell by mixing their genetic segments to result in a genetically novel virus. Haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays Experimental assays that characterize the antigenicity of viruses by measuring the ability of host serum to inhibit agglutination of red blood cells by the virus. Immunodominant Describes an antigen or epitope as the preferential target of the immune system. Neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assays Experimental assays that measure the ability of host serum to block the sialidase activity of neuraminidase. Original antigenic sin (OAS). Refers to the immunological imprinting of the first exposure to influenza viruses during childhood. Subsequent infections by antigenically distinct influenza viruses boost the response to epitopes shared between these viruses. Within-host evolution Evolution of viruses that occurs at the level of an individual infected host.

By leveraging the existing influenza surveillance systems to integrate SARS-CoV-2 testing in specimens collected from influenza surveillance sources, countries have been able to maintain influenza surveillance and establish a system for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation in communities. This required the existing systems to undergo a variety of adaptations and adjustments, and countries have employed various strategies. This document is a collection of experiences and lessons learned from countries towards integrated influenza and SARS-CoV-2 sentinel surveillance.

This is an influenza virus that normally spreads in pigs but not people. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services notified CDC of the specimen on July 31. Earlier in July, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services first reported a presumptive positive influenza A(H3) variant virus infection on July 26, 2023, in a different person who attended a different fair that took place on July 7-16, 2023. Every year, there are rare sporadic human infections with flu viruses that usually spread in pigs. People should take additional protective measures if they must come into contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. CDC Update August 4, 2023—CDC this week reported the first two U.S. human infections with flu viruses from pigs in 2023. These human infections were caused by two different types of flu viruses that normally spread among pigs, and they occurred in two people who attended different agricultural fairs in Michigan and had exposure to pigs. CDC recommends people take precautions to prevent the spread of swine influenza viruses to people and has guidance for people exhibiting pigs at fairs, people attending fairs, and fair organizers. Every year, there are rare sporadic human infections with flu viruses that usually spread in pigs. When found in people, these are called "variant flu virus" infections and designated with the letter "v" after the subtype. Variant flu virus infections are usually associated with contact with pigs, often at agricultural fairs. While infections with swine influenza viruses usually cause mild illness, they are concerning because they can cause severe illness, especially in people at higher risk of serious flu complications, and because of their pandemic potential. These infections are fully investigated to be sure that such viruses are not spreading in an efficient and ongoing way in people and to limit further exposure of people to infected animals if infected animals are identified. Presumptive positive influenza A(H3)v virus infection The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services first reported a presumptive positive influenza A(H3) variant virus infection on July 26 in a person who attended a fair that took place July 7-16. A respiratory specimen from that patient was sent to CDC and received on July 27. Diagnostic testing conducted at CDC was inconclusive, likely due to the respiratory specimen not containing enough virus. However, it is likely the patient was infected with an influenza A(H3)v virus given the presumptive positive test results from Michigan, as well as the epidemiologic findings of the local investigation. An investigation into this first infection found that: The patient was exposed to pigs within 10 days prior to illness onset at an agricultural fair where swine influenza A virus was detected among pigs. The patient was treated with flu antivirals. The patient was not hospitalized and has recovered from their illness. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient's close contacts or household contacts. To date, no person-to-person spread of this virus has been identified. Confirmed influenza A(H1N2)v virus infection The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services notified CDC of a specimen that tested positive for influenza A but lacked reactivity with diagnostic tests for contemporary human influenza viruses representing either H1pdm09 or H3 subtypes on July 31. A respiratory specimen from that patient was sent to CDC and received on August 2. This was confirmed at CDC to be an influenza A(H1N2)v virus infection. This occurred in a person who attended a different fair, which took place July 23-29. An investigation into the second infection found that: The patient was exposed to pigs within 10 days prior to illness onset at another agricultural fair. The patient was treated with flu antivirals. The patient was not hospitalized and is recovering from their illness. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient's close contacts or household contacts. To date, no person-to-person spread of this virus has been identified. Agricultural fairs take place across the United States every year, primarily during the summer months and into early fall. Many fairs have swine exhibitions, where pigs from different places come into close contact with each other and with people. These venues can increase the risk that flu viruses will spread among pigs and between pigs and people. Take Precautions While at Settings Where Pigs are Present General precautions that everyone can take to limit the spread of flu viruses between people and pigs include: Not eating or drinking while in pig areas, Avoiding contact with pigs that appear to be sick, and Washing hands often with soap and running water before and after contact with pigs. People at Higher Risk of Serious Illness Like seasonal flu, some groups of people are at higher risk of developing serious complications from infections with swine flu viruses. People at higher risk should avoid pigs and swine barns. If they cannot avoid exposure to pigs, they should wear a well-fitting face mask that covers the nose and mouth to reduce their risk of exposure to flu viruses. They should also wash their hands with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs or a swine barn. If soap and water are not available, they should use an alcohol-based hand rub. People should take additional protective measures if they must come into contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact time with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves, and well-fitted masks that cover the mouth and nose when contact is required. Note that human seasonal flu vaccines are not designed to protect against variant flu viruses, but the same flu antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant flu virus infection in children and adults. More information is available at Take Action to Prevent the Spread of Flu Between Pigs and People. How Variant Flu Virus Infections Happen Flu viruses can spread from pigs to people and from people to pigs. Infected pigs can cough or sneeze, and droplets with virus in them can spread through the air. If these droplets land in your nose or mouth, or are inhaled, you can be infected. These infections have most commonly been reported after close proximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits housing pigs at fairs. Flu Viruses from Pigs Change Constantly Like flu viruses in humans and other animals, flu viruses found in pigs change constantly. Pigs can be infected by avian flu and human flu viruses as well as their own flu viruses. When flu viruses from different species infect pigs, the viruses can reassort (i.e., swap genes) and very rarely new viruses can emerge that can infect and spread from person-to-person. This is thought to have happened in 2009 when a new swine-origin H1N1 virus with genes of avian, swine and human origin emerged to cause a flu pandemic. Background In 2005, human infection with a novel flu A virus flu became nationally notifiable in the United States. Novel flu A viruses are different from currently circulating human flu H1 and H3 viruses and include variant flu viruses and avian (bird) flu viruses. Since that time, a total of 512 variant flu virus infections (of different flu A virus subtypes) have been identified in the United States and reported to CDC ranging from a high of 321 variant flu virus infections during the 2011-2012 flu season to a low of one during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons. The 321 infections reported during the 2011-2012 seasons included 315 A(H3N2)v, four A(H1N2)v, and two A(H1N1)v viruses. More than 90% of those infections were associated with pig exposure and/or attendance at agricultural fairs.

Download PDF Copy By Pooja Toshniwal PahariaReviewed by Lily Ramsey, LLMAug 2 2023 In a recent study posted to the SSRN* preprint server, researchers performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of influenza vaccination on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, hospitalization, and associated mortality. Study: Effect of Vaccination Against Influenza Viruses on Infection, Hospitalization, and Death from Respiratory COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Image Credit: InsideCreativeHouse/Shutterstock.com*Important notice: SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly strained health and society, notably concerning cardiovascular tissues. Social distancing and isolation measures have been enforced to curtail SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Anti-flu vaccinations are strongly advised to prevent co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses and lower the chance of increased severity. Although influenza rates were very low after the initial COVID-19 waves, sporadic studies indicate that anti-influenza vaccination may have influenced the onset and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. About the study In the present meta-analysis, researchers investigated whether influenza vaccines protect against COVID-19 incidence and its severity outcomes, such as hospitalization and death. The meta-analysis included retrospective and prospective, case-control and cohort studies published in English, reporting COVID-19, associated hospitalization, ICU admission, and deaths among anti-Flu vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Data were searched independently by three researchers in databases such as Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase from inception through 31 January 2023, and discrepancies were sought by discussion. Related StoriesSARS-CoV-2 hijacks host proteins to escape immune clearanceDe novo antibody protein sequencing reveals novel functional and neutralizing antibodies post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinationObesity increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 34%In addition, studies were searched manually through the references cited in reviews. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of vaccination among healthcare providers, the general public, the elderly, pregnant women, and diseased individuals; to evaluate the impact of different vaccines; and to assess the distance of vaccination against influenza to the outcome of interest. The team excluded editorials, descriptive studies, reviews, case reports, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and studies with missing effect sizes or risk ratios. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to determine the quality of evidence. Random-effects modeling was performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and compare the study endpoints (COVID-19 development, hospital admission, ICU admission, and death) among vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Covariates for data adjustment included the number of enrolled individuals, participant age, study type, diagnostic method, vaccine type, and evidence quality. Results and discussion In total, 33 research papers were analyzed, including 33, 14, 11, and 19 records for COVID-19 development, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality, respectively. The studies included 61,029,936 individuals, among whom 15,950,169 had received influenza vaccines. The team found significant effects of anti-Flu vaccinations on the frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 and related ICU admissions but not on SARS-CoV-2-associated hospital admissions and deaths. The findings were significant among healthcare providers, the general public, the elderly, and sick individuals. The immune protection against SARS-CoV-3 infections among tetravalent anti-Flu vaccinees was statistically significant in all studies, among healthcare providers and the general public. The inverse associations between the distance from influenza vaccination with the tetravalent Flu vaccines and COVID-19 showed synergistic effects. Anti-influenza vaccines reduced COVID-19 and related ICU admission frequencies; however, the effect size of protection against COVID-19 severity was small, despite being significant for pregnant females, the general public, and hospitalized individuals aged below 50.0 years. NOS scores were high for most studies, indicating good quality of evidence; however, the included studies had high heterogeneity. The COVID-19-causing virus and influenza viruses are distinct pathogens but share transmission routes and pulmonary symptoms. Anti-Flu vaccines may be protective due to trained immunity, which potentiates innate immunological responses by neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages through memory-like feature induction. The memory-led response increases protection on encounters with similar or unrelated microbes. Vaccines influence adaptive immunity, affecting humoral and cell-mediated lymphocytes. Anti-Flu vaccines potentiate the action of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes, innate immunological lymphocytes that swiftly respond to infection and shape adaptive responses regulated by T lymphocytes. Activated NK lymphocytes are a crucial source of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which instructs cytotoxic cluster of differentiation 8-positive (CD8+) T lymphocyte contraction and expansion as adaptive immunological responses to various pathogens, such as viruses. IFNs may be vital in affecting the interactions between anti-influenza vaccinations and COVID-19. Different forms of IFNs are generated in the pulmonary tissues of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, and the transitory activation of IFNs following influenza A virus (IAV) or viral subtype contacts may impair the host's ability to regulate SARS-CoV-2 infections. Anti-influenza vaccines stimulate IFNs to varying degrees, implying that the wide range of IFNs generated as a response to anti-flu vaccines "interfere" with viral propagation and reproduction and may confer cross-protection to recently vaccinated individuals. Conclusion Overall, the study findings highlighted the protective effects of anti-influenza vaccines against COVID-19; however, the results were small in magnitude and faded over time. *Important notice: SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

The test, which has been available in the United States since February through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from FDA, uses a single nasal swab or a single nasopharyngeal swab sample to determine if a patient has COVID-19 or the flu or RSV. The BD RVP test helps eliminate the need for multiple individual tests or doctor visits and can help clinicians implement the right treatment plan quickly. The co-testing approach also helps increase testing capacity during the busy flu season and speed up the time for diagnosis. "Last year, we experienced a threat of a 'tripledemic' with COVID, flu and RSV circulating simultaneously, and that threat remains for the coming respiratory season," said Nikos Pavlidis, vice president and general manager for Diagnostics at BD. "As patient symptoms and clinical presentation can be nearly identical, a combined testing panel is key to enabling clinicians to quickly and efficiently diagnose, differentiate and treat patients, and help manage the spread of the infections. The advanced robotic architecture of the BD MAX™ System automates manual, time-intensive processes, which has never been more important than in today's environment of staffing shortages and laboratory scientist burnout." The BD MAX™ System, a molecular diagnostic platform, is already in use at thousands of hospitals and medium-throughput laboratories worldwide, and each unit is capable of analyzing hundreds of samples over a 24-hour period. The BD MAX™ RVP test is an RT-PCR assay that detects and differentiates the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B and RSV in approximately two hours, with the simple and automated "walkaway workflow" of the BD MAX™ System that requires minimal human interaction. The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System was CE marked under the IVD directive 98/79/EC in May of 2022, and now with the 510(k) clearance, BD will discontinue the BD RVP EUA version and replace it with the 510(k) version, with no gaps in availability of the test. The respiratory viral panel is an important addition to the extensive number of assays available on the BD MAX™ System across respiratory infections, sexually transmitted infections, gastrointestinal infections, women's health and health care associated infections. The BD MAX™ open system also allows customers to leverage research use only (RUO) assays and user-defined protocols (UDP) to address emerging needs quickly. Development of this combination test has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under contract number 75A50121C00025.

Understanding the Incubation Period and Asymptomatic Transmission By Kristina Herndon, RN Updated on July 30, 2023 Medically reviewed by Chris Vincent, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Before Symptoms After Symptoms How Flu Spreads If You're Sick Prevention Next in Flu Guide Influenza Treatments: How to Get Better at Home or With Medication Close The period of time between exposure to the influenza (flu) virus and the appearance of symptoms—called the incubation period—is around two days. Even so, you can pass the virus to others 24 hours before symptoms begin and for five to seven days after symptoms develop. This is why it is important to stay home from work or school if you have the flu and to take standard precautions (like washing your hands and covering your mouth while coughing or sneezing) to avoid infecting others. This article explains how long the flu is contagious, the ways in which it is spread, and what to do if you've been exposed. It also explains how to protect others from influenza if you have it. Verywell / Joshua Seong Contagiousness Before Flu Symptoms The incubation period for the flu is between one and four days, with an average of two days according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This means that if you are exposed to the virus and infected, you will start to experience symptoms (such as fever and body aches) anywhere from 24 hours to four days after exposure. Once infected, you can be contagious for up to 24 hours prior to the appearance of symptoms. During this asymptomatic (symptom-free) period, you can infect others directly or indirectly without even knowing it. Risk of Asymptomatic Transmission In 2021, researchers in South Africa aimed to establish the rate of asymptomatic flu transmission among 1,116 participants in 225 urban and rural households.The study found that individuals with asymptomatic flu transmitted infection to 29 (6%) of 509 household contacts—meaning that roughly one of every 16 infections was passed from someone with no flu symptoms. Contagiousness After Flu Symptoms Once flu symptoms start, adults can pass the virus to others for around seven days. According to the CDC, the virus is most contagious on the third or fourth day. After that, the contagiousness rapidly declines as the immune system gains control over the virus. In children, the flu can sometimes be contagious for more than seven days. This is because children have less mature immune systems and can take longer to control the virus. The same may apply to older adults and people with compromised immune systems. As a general rule, the presence of symptoms is a good way to tell if you are still contagious. Until symptoms clear, it is best to consider yourself contagious and take steps to avoid infecting others. How Does the Flu Spread? Influenza is a respiratory infection that is mainly spread through respiratory droplets. These are tiny secretions from the mouth or nose that get airborne whenever you cough, sneeze, laugh, or even talk. Once airborne, the virus-filled droplets can travel as far as 6 feet and enter the mouth or nose of someone else. You can also get influenza through fomite transmission. This happens when respiratory secretions land on surfaces or objects that are later touched by someone else. The virus can then be passed when the person brings their hand to their nose or mouth. How Long Does Flu Live Outside the Body? Research suggests that flu viruses can remain infectious outside of the body for several hours, They tend to survive longer on hard surfaces like stainless steel or plastic than on soft, porous surfaces like fabric. During the cold winter months, the flu spreads rapidly. Contrary to popular belief, it is not due to cold weather. Cold temperatures simply allow the virus to survive longer. Winter winds can also transport the droplets far longer than six feet. What to Do if You're Sick With Flu If you have the flu, you should stay home at least 24 hours after your fever has gone without the use of fever-reducing medicines like Tylenol (acetaminophen). If you don't have a fever but still have symptoms, wait until your symptoms improve and it has been at least four to five days since the start of your illness. You get over the flu faster with the following steps: Get plenty of rest: Doing too much will not only wear you out but also impair your already-weakened immune system. Drink plenty of fluids: These include water, warm tea, fruit juices, sports drinks, and broths. Treat body aches and fever: This not only includes Tylenol but also nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Advil (ibuprofen). Ease your cough: An over-the-counter (OTC) expectorant can break up phlegm so you can cough it up easier. Sucking on a cough lozenge or taking a cough suppressant can also help. Take a flu antiviral: When started within one to day days of symptoms, flu antivirals like Tamiflu (oseltamivir), Relenza (zanamivir), Rapivab (Peravir), and Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) can lessen symptoms and shorten the time you are sick by one or two days. Warning to Parents Never give aspirin to children or teens with fever as it can cause a potentially deadly reaction called Reye's syndrome. Children under 4 years should not be given cough or cold medicines as they can cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Preventing Flu in Others Flu is something that most people get at one time or another. If it happens, you need to take care of yourself while reducing the risk of infection in others. The CDC recommends the following: Avoid close contact with others: Isolate yourself from others in your household. If you have to go out, wear a face mask. Cover your mouth and nose: Use tissues when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of them immediately rather than letting them pile up on a counter. Wash your hands frequently: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes: If you do, you can contaminate surfaces or objects that other people touch. Flu Vaccination The best way to avoid passing the flu is to avoid getting it in the first place. The annual flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months of age, ideally in September or October, to ensure better protection throughout the flu season. How Effective Is the Flu Vaccine? Summary Once exposed to the influenza virus, it can take anywhere from one to four days for symptoms to appear and five to seven days more for symptoms to clear. You can be contagious up to 24 hours before symptoms stop and continue to be contagious until your symptoms improve and you no longer have a fever. Peak contagiousness occurs on day three or four of your illness. A Word From Verywell A person with the flu may not show symptoms but still be capable of spreading the virus for up to 24 hours prior to the appearance of symptoms, with peak transmissibility on the third or fourth day of the illness. You can protect others from the illness by avoiding close contact with others and by washing your hands frequently. Treating yourself well, taking over-the-counter cough expectorants or suppressants, and receiving an antiviral medication are ways to recover faster. — STEFFINI STALOS, DO, MEDICAL EXPERT BOARD 10 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Nurse assisting patient with the flu A nurse assists a patient at the Walter Reed Hospital flu ward during the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919. 1918 A flu (influenza) pandemic occurs. The flu pandemic is caused by a new H1N1 flu strain. In New York, people with the flu are required to be isolated at home. In Chicago, movie theaters and theaters close and public gatherings are not allowed. In San Francisco, people who work for the public must wear masks and others are encouraged to wear masks as well. The American Public Health Association suggests that people avoid public transportation. In southeastern Minnesota, near Mayo Clinic, many public spaces such as theaters, churches, meeting places and some schools are closed. The flu pandemic lasts from 1918 to 1920. From spring of 1918 to spring of 1919, the flu causes more than 550,000 deaths in the U.S. and more than 20 million deaths worldwide. In the fall of 1918 at Mayo Clinic, people with the flu and other contagious illnesses are cared for in the isolation hospital. Keeping patients with these illnesses isolated and keeping high standards of cleanliness likely prevented infections and saved lives. The isolation hospital of 40 beds is soon filled. The hospital is short of medical staff, and everyone on staff must help where needed. For example, nurses sometimes help in the kitchen and the laundry. Mayo Clinic’s Dr. Edward C. Rosenow invents a flu serum that is made up of a mixed vaccine that includes bacteria that cause pneumonia. Dr. Rosenow gives the serum to Rochester residents for free. While Dr. Rosenow doesn’t state that the serum works in protecting against the flu, he notes that the serum doesn’t cause harm and might help provide some protection. Mayo Clinic receives many requests for the serum, which is sent to people across Minnesota and the Midwest. In the end, the serum doesn’t work as a vaccine to protect against the flu. But it might have helped protect people against pneumonia after having the flu. Army men wearing masks Army men stand in a line wearing masks at a U.S. Army hospital during the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919. 1930s and 1940s Researchers study flu viruses and develop flu vaccines. At first, mainly military members can get flu vaccines. 1945 The first flu vaccines are approved for use for people who aren’t in the U.S. military. 1957-1958 A new H2N2 flu strain causes another flu pandemic. About 116,000 people die in the U.S. and about 1.1. million die worldwide. 1960 In response to the flu pandemic that happened from 1957 to 1958, the U.S. Public Health Service recommends flu vaccines for people in the U.S. who are at high risk of flu complications. 1968 A new H3N2 flu strain causes another flu pandemic. This flu pandemic causes about 100,000 deaths in the U.S. and about 1 million deaths throughout the world. Researchers develop flu vaccines for the specific flu strains causing the pandemic. 1970s At Fort Dix, a flu outbreak caused by the H1N1 flu strain leads to the development of a flu vaccination program aimed at preventing flu pandemics. 1997 Bird flu (avian influenza) caused by the H5N1 flu strain infects people. This leads to the development of pandemic flu response plans in the U.S. and throughout the world. 2002 ACIP recommends that children ages 6 to 23 months old get an annual flu vaccine. 2007 The FDA approves a flu vaccine for avian influenza A caused by the H5N1 flu strain. 2008 ACIP recommends that people ages 6 months to 18 years old get an annual flu vaccine. 2009 A new H1N1 flu strain causes a flu pandemic. During 2009, the flu causes about 61 million illnesses, 274,0000 hospital stays and 12,400 deaths. Later in 2009, an H1N1 flu vaccine becomes available. During the H1N1 flu pandemic, Mayo Clinic staff are trained in infection control and prevention. A disaster preparedness team meets regularly to discuss flu planning with clinical areas. Mayo Clinic gives recommendations about H1N1 precautions and provides education about how H1N1 spreads to employees and the community. 2010 ACIP recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine. Gregory Poland, M.D., head of the Vaccine Research Group at Mayo Clinic, introduces and makes this recommendation. Dr. Poland will also recommend that health care providers be required to get vaccinated against the flu in 2016. 2019-2020 Flu vaccines prevent about 7.5 million illnesses, 3.7 million doctor visits, 105,000 hospital stays and 6,300 deaths.

Understanding the clinical characteristics and symptomatology of different respiratory viral infections can help address the challenges related to the identification of cases and the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variants' evolutionary patterns. Flu Watch (2006–2011) and Virus Watch (2020–2022) are household community cohort studies monitoring the epidemiology of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, in England and Wales. This study describes and compares the proportion of symptoms reported during illnesses infected by common respiratory viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 symptom profile increasingly resembles that of other respiratory viruses as new strains emerge. Increased cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing are associated with the emergence of the Omicron strains. As SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, monitoring the evolution of its symptomatology associated with new variants will be critical for clinical surveillance.

Most countries took a similar stance soon after. With the ending of all mandatory non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and subsequent increases in mixing patterns, respiratory viruses that were suppressed during previous lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic have recently started to co-circulate with SARS-CoV-22,3. The US Centre for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of 9 December 2022, flu related hospitalisations and deaths already surpassed those of the 2021–2022 flu-season4,5. Additionally, the recent wave of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases raised concerns across Europe amid increased hospitalisations and deaths amongst children6. This, combined with decreased availability of free testing, will pose diagnostic challenges, which is important when considering syndromic surveillance and pharmaceutical management of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Yet, there is a lack of community-based studies that have compared the frequency of symptoms between SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses to identify potential differences in their symptomatology. Additionally, the emergence of multiple variants of concern (VOC) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to uncertainties about potential changes in the symptomatology of COVID-19 illnesses. Several community-based studies have compared the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the 1st wave of the pandemic7,8,9 and during the first 2 Omicron waves (Omicron BA1 and BA2)10. We provide more recent estimates by including Omicron BA5 illnesses up to September 2022.This paper describes the symptoms of a range of respiratory infections experienced by confirmed cases from the Flu Watch Community Cohort (2006–2011) and the Virus Watch Cohort (2020–2022). We assessed how SARS-CoV-2 symptoms have changed with waves of different variants. We also assessed the applicability of World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) for the identification of different respiratory viruses amongst people with symptomatic disease.MethodsFlu Watch (2006–2011) and Virus Watch (2020–2022) are household community cohort studies investigating the epidemiology, clinical features, risk factors for transmission and immunity to influenza and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. Both cohorts recruited all members of participating households and followed them up with weekly surveys commencing on symptom occurrence.Flu WatchFlu Watch was a household community cohort study following up entire households across England during six influenza seasons including three periods of seasonal influenza (winters 2006–2007, 2007–2008 and 2008–2009) and the first three waves of the 2009 influenza pandemic (summer 2009, autumn‐winter 2009/2010 and winter 2010/2011). 5 484 participants were followed up for 118 158 person‐weeks11. Participants were asked to submit nasal swabs on day two of any illness that was a “cough, cold, sore throat, or flu-like illness”. These were examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All samples were analysed for influenza infection. At different times in the study, rhinovirus, RSV and seasonal coronavirus were also tested for using PCR. Only respiratory and constitutional symptoms were considered for this analysis (i.e. sore throat, cough, runny nose, sneezing, fever, headache, fatigue). Full details of the Flu Watch methodology have been previously published12.Virus WatchVirus Watch is a household community cohort study following up entire households in England and Wales since mid-June 2020. By February 2022, 58 566 individuals in 28 495 households had registered to take part in the study. Participants submitted weekly online surveys reporting the date of any respiratory, constitutional, gastrointestinal, ocular, or skin symptoms experienced and the dates and results of any testing for SARS-CoV-2 by lateral flow test (LFT) or PCR. Symptoms included for the analysis were: cough, dry cough, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, sneezing, sinus pain, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, loss of smell and loss of taste. The Virus Watch study protocol is available online13.Data processingFor both studies, symptom data were extracted and grouped into illness episodes. Tests with no symptoms reported were excluded in both studies. The start date of an illness episode was defined as the first day any symptoms were reported, and the end date was the final day of reported symptoms. A seven-day washout period in which no symptoms were reported was used to identify separate illness episodes.In Virus Watch, swab results were matched to illnesses that were within seven days of the illness start date. In addition to self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test results, test results from the UK Second-Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) dataset were linked to the Virus Watch dataset. Participant data were linked over time and between databases using the unique personal identifier recorded at all interactions with the English National Health Service (NHS), full name, date of birth and home address. SGSS contains SARS-CoV-2 test results during Pillar 1 (testing patients in secondary care) and Pillar 2 (community testing).SARS-CoV-2 variant designationTesting (by LFT or PCR) detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 but, unlike RNA sequencing, does not identify the variant. Therefore, using national surveillance data14, we designated a variant to a case if that variant was making up at least 75% of all regional sequenced genomes at the time of the case’s symptom onset. Illnesses in regions and weeks that did not have a dominant variant reaching at least 75% of all sequenced genomes were excluded. Variants are defined as per the UK Health Secretary Agency (UKHSA) definition and wild-type refers to all SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating before the Alpha variant14.AnalysisWe present symptom profiles of individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n = 10 986), seasonal coronavirus (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) (n = 191), influenza (n = 222), RSV (n = 84) and rhinovirus (n = 283) and compare the proportion of symptoms experienced during illnesses.We also compare the compatibility of the WHO case definition for ARI (sudden onset of symptoms with cough and/or sore throat and/or runny nose) and WHO case definition for ILI (fever > = 38 °C and cough).As a sensitivity analysis to account for the fact that Flu Watch samples were submitted from anyone with cough, sore throat, cold or flu-like illness, whereas the national COVID-19 testing program encouraged submission of samples from all those with persistent cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste, we restricted SARS-CoV-2 cases to those submitted from participants who met the definition for ARI (Appendix 1).We ran multiple multivariate logistic regressions to describe the odds of experiencing different respiratory and constitutional symptoms by SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Our primary exposure was SARS-CoV-2 variant strain (wild-type, Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA1, Omicron BA2) with Omicron BA5 as variant of reference. We controlled for known confounders reported in the literature including sex, age, clinal vulnerability and natural or vaccine induced immunity15,16,17. Clinical vulnerability status was derived from self-reported data on immunosuppressive therapy, cancer diagnoses, and chronic disease status. Participants were considered to have past exposure (and therefore some degree of immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 if they reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive illness or vaccination between 90- and 14- days prior symptom onset. This time window was based on the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) reports on SARS-CoV-2 immune response and immunity15,17.EthicsThe Virus Watch study was approved by the Hampstead NHS Health Research Authority Ethics Committee. Ethics approval number—20/HRA/2320. All members of participating households provided informed consent for themselves and, where relevant, for children that they were responsible for. This was electronically collected during registration. All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.ResultsFlu Watch vs. Virus WatchThe frequency of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and for other respiratory viruses are shown in Table 1 (for every SARS-CoV-2 VOC) and illustrated in the radar plot in Fig. 1 (aggregated across all SARS-CoV-2 VOC).Table 1 Frequency of symptoms reported during illness by virus type [95% confidence interval].Full size tableFigure 1Symptom profile of common respiratory viruses: frequency of symptoms reported during illness by virus type (points represent the mean estimates, shaded areas represent the 95% confidence intervals (CI)). SARS-CoV-2 includes the wild-type, Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA1, Omicron BA2 and Omicron BA5 variants.Full size imageCough was most common amongst influenza, rhinovirus, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA5 illnesses with 91, 87, 83, 81 percent of illnesses reporting cough respectively. Cough was significantly less common in Alpha, Omicron BA1 and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variants with respective frequencies of 60, 61 and 65% (Table 1).Fever was significantly more common amongst influenza illnesses (74%, 95% CI: 68–79) compared to other respiratory viruses. On average, only 17% (16–18) of COVID-19 illnesses reported fever (Fig. 1). However, this proportion varied across SARS-CoV-2 variants, with the Omicron BA1 (14%, 12–15) and BA2 (14%, 13–15) strains having significantly lower proportions compared to other variants.The frequency of illnesses meeting the ARI and ILI case definitions by viruses are displayed in Fig. 2. Nearly all influenza, RSV, rhinovirus and seasonal coronavirus illnesses met the ARI definition. Fewer SARS-CoV-2 illnesses met the ARI definition, with proportions ranging from 75.7% (71.5–79.5) for Alpha and 90.1% (88.8–91.3) for Omicron BA5. However, we observed a significant increase (+ 10 percentage points) in the proportion of Omicron BA2 and BA5 illnesses meeting the ARI case definition with respect to the previously circulating strains. The performance of ILI case definition was low with only 48.6% (42.2–55.2) of influenza illnesses meeting the case definition. Only 14.4% (11.5–18.2) of illnesses contracted from other respiratory viruses met the ILI case definition.Figure 2Proportions of illnesses meeting the WHO case definitions by virus type.

Since the Alpha variant became dominant in December 2020, COVID-19 illnesses have on average reported an increase in runny nose, sneezing and sore throat of six percentage points compared to previous strains. The increase in reported upper respiratory symptoms was particularly high when transitioning to Delta and Omicron BA2. The rise of the Delta variant, dominant in the UK from June 2021, was associated with a 11.7 percentage points increase in reported upper respiratory tract symptoms compared to Alpha illnesses. Finally, Omicron BA2 was associated with an average increase of 11.3 percentage points compared to illnesses infected with the BA1 strain. Overall, the percentage of illnesses reporting runny nose, sneezing and sore throat went from 35, 36, 40% respectively when wild-type was dominant to 71, 60, 62% under Omicron BA2 dominance. 65% of Omicron BA5 illnesses reported sore throat, 63% experienced runny nose and 55% experienced sneezing. Since the emergence of the Omicron strain, there has been a significant decrease in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases reporting symptoms of loss of sense of smell or taste (40% for wild-type to 20% for Omicron BA5) (Fig. 3).Multivariate logistic regressions were used to describe the odds of experiencing respiratory and constitutional symptoms by SARS-CoV-2 VOC with Omicron BA5 as the reference variant, controlling for known confounders (Fig. 4). Compared to Omicron BA5, all previously circulating strains were generally associated with decreased odds of cough and sore throat, controlling for all other variables in the model. Infections with any pre-Omicron strain (Delta, Alpha, wild-type) decreased the odds of experiencing sore throat by over 60% (Odds Ratios (OR) 0.38, 95%CI: 0.30–0.46). Infections with Omicron BA 1 and Omicron BA 2 decreased the odds of experiencing sore throat by 45 and 11 percent respectively (0.55, 0.48–0.64; 0.89, 0.80–0.99). Omicron BA2 was associated with increased odds of sneezing (1.26, 1.13–1.40). Pre-Omicron strains were all associated with increased odds of loss of smell and loss of taste, with Delta showing the largest effect with odds ratios of 2.86 (2.45–3.33) and 1.91 (1.64–2.21) respectively. Compared to Omicron BA 5, all previously circulating strains at the exception of wild-type were associated with lower odds of experiencing fatigue with Omicron BA 1 showing the lowest odds ratios of 0.53 (0.45–0.60).Figure 4Odds ratios from multivariate logistic regressions with SARS-CoV-2 variant as primary exposure and Omicron BA5 as the variant of reference. Confounders including sex, age, clinal vulnerability and natural or vaccine induced immunity were controlled for.Full size imageDiscussionWe describe the symptom profile for multiple respiratory viruses that are now co-circulating with SARS-CoV-2. Over time, the symptom profile of SARS-CoV-2 illnesses gradually became more similar to other respiratory viruses through increased frequency of cough, sneezing, runny nose and sore throat. Furthermore, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 illnesses meeting the WHO ARI case definition has significantly increased with the Omicron BA2 and BA5 variants. Fever remains more common in influenza than other respiratory viruses studied. The growing similarity between symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory illnesses will make syndromic surveillance less effective, emphasising the importance of multi-pathogen virological surveillance. Continued use of diagnostic tests to distinguish between influenza and SARS-CoV-2 will be important for high-risk patients in whom antiviral medication is being considered.Several factors could explain the observed changes in the SARS-CoV-2 symptomatology. The increase in cough and sneezing associated with the Omicron strains could contribute to their increased transmissibility compared to previous variants18, as these two symptoms are important pathways for expelling viral particles. This is in line with studies comparing the association of SARS-CoV-2 symptom presence, variants, and viral load10,19,20. Changing levels of immunity in the population during the pandemic through natural infections, vaccination and natural/vaccine induced immunity waning may also affect the symptomatology. Despite widespread vaccination and natural infections in our cohort (Appendices 2 and 3), the presence of respiratory symptoms has significantly increased at the same time as the Omicron strains spread. However, it is not clear whether observed change in symptomatology is due to the evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants or due to changing levels in immunity across the population.Several community-based studies have compared the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the 1st wave of the pandemic7,8,9 and the first two Omicron waves10. Our results are in line with previous findings but provide additional information about Omicron BA5. A few studies21,22,23 published early in the pandemic qualitatively compared the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses but provided no quantitative insight about the symptom profiles of infected individuals. To our knowledge, no other study compared the frequency of symptoms experienced during influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 VOC infections. Strengths of the study include the large number of participants in both Flu Watch and Virus Watch, the weekly reporting of symptoms and swab test results over multiple years, allowing to compare seasonal and endemic viral illnesses. Limitations of our analysis include the reliance on self-taken samples for Flu Watch and self-reported results for Virus Watch meaning that we would miss illnesses that did not test. However, most reported illness episodes in Virus Watch (56.3%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 across the study period, with weekly proportions ranging from 4 to 91% (Appendix 4). Given that variants emerged at different times, time confounding variables such as “allergy seasons” could affect our results. However, our study spans over multiple years allowing us to compare variants that emerged during the same seasons (e.g. Alpha vs. Omicron BA1 and BA2, wild-type vs. Omicron BA5). We compared symptom frequencies of common respiratory viruses with SARS-CoV-2 based on two different time periods. It is important to note that the characteristics of respiratory infections for the same virus can vary across seasons and regions due to the prevalence of different types and subtypes24. We aggregated the FluWatch illnesses across multiple seasons in which different types and subtypes could have had different effects on symptomatology. The currently circulating strain of influenza (or RSV, rhinovirus, or seasonal coronavirus) in the UK might have different characteristics compared to the ones analysed from our 2006–2011 data. However, to our knowledge, there is no clear evidence of a significant change in influenza symptomatology in the year 2022 in the UK24. We do not assess the duration and severity of illness, which can substantially differ between the studied pathogens.As SARS-CoV-2 VOC emerged, the SARS-CoV-2 symptomatology gradually resembled that of other respiratory symptoms. The more contagious Omicron strains were significantly associated with an increase in cough and sneezing. Untangling the potential relationships between symptomatology, immune mechanisms and viral genetic evolution could help us better understand the transmission advantages associated with the more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Virus strikes more wild birds and poultry on 3 continents China's agriculture ministry reported that highly pathogenic H5N1 struck wild birds in Nagqu City in northeastern Tibet, according to a July 28 government statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD) an infectious disease news blog. At least 5,100 birds were affected, including brown-headed gulls. Officials disposed of the sick and dead birds, sanitized the area, and imposed movement restrictions into the area. In Russia, fresh H5N1 outbreaks struck both poultry and a wild bird in newly affected areas, according to separate notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). Health officials said the virus struck a large poultry operation in Vologda oblast in northwestern Russia. The event began on July 21, killing 27,084 of 490,644 susceptible birds. Meanwhile, H5N1 was detected for the first time in a gull found dead near a body of water on June 28 near the city of Kurgalskij in Leningrad oblast, located in northwest Russia around the Gulf of Finland and south of two freshwater lakes. In South America, Ecuador reported a new outbreak at a commercial farm located on Cotopaxi province in the central part of the country, the first in more than 100 days, according to a media report, which cited government agriculture officials. The detection prompted officials to extend poultry vaccination to Cotopaxi and to two neighboring provinces. Mammal detections in South Korea and Northern Ireland Following H5N1 detections in two cats from the same shelter in Seoul, South Korean health officials said yesterday that tests detected H5N1 in a cat from a second animal shelter in Seoul, according to a statement translated and posted by AFD. In an update today, officials said 3 of 10 cats at the second shelter have tested positive for H5N1, raising the country's total to five. Government officials in a statement today, translated and posted by AFD, announced quarantine measures for animal facilities in the areas, surveillance and inspection at the locations, and epidemiological investigations. They said no human infections among the animal contacts have been reported so far and that environmental officials will survey wild birds, especially near the cat outbreak areas. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland has reported its first H5N1 detection in a mammal, which involves two fox cubs in Portrush, according to the BBC, which said Irish seabird colonies have been hit hard by H5N1.

It brings together Member States, industry, other stakeholders and WHO to implement a global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The Framework includes a benefit-sharing mechanism called the Partnership Contribution (PC). The PC is collected as an annual cash contribution from influenza vaccine, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical manufacturers that use the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Funds are allocated for: (a) pandemic preparedness capacity building; (b) response activities during the time of an influenza pandemic; and (c) PIP Secretariat for the management and implementation of the Framework. This report presents overall success metrics and infographics to illustrate progress in PIP Framework implementation. A progress report is published four times a biennium, and covers technical and financial implementation for the PIP PC High-Level Implementation Plan II (HLIP II), as well as the PIP Secretariat.

Also available this fall: updated COVID-19 vaccines and a new RSV vaccine. To head off another “tripledemic” winter, enough people will need to get vaccinated at the right time. In this Q&A, adapted from the July 31 episode of Public Health On Call, virologist Andrew Pekosz, PhD, a professor in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, explains when flu, COVID, and RSV vaccines will roll out, who will benefit from them, and how effective they’re expected to be. What do we know about the new COVID-19 vaccine? The FDA voted to update the COVID vaccine to represent one of the variants that are collectively called XBB. There are a couple of different versions of XBB, but they are similar enough that antibodies to one recognize the other. The XBB-based vaccine for the fall will no longer be what we call a “bivalent booster,” which had two viruses in it; this will only have one (monovalent). What’s not yet clear is what the CDC guidance and recommendations will be around how the vaccine should be used. Most likely it will be what we've seen before: recommended for people over the age of 60 for whom it’s been longer than four to six months since their last COVID vaccine. It will be available for other people, but it probably won’t be recommended for younger age groups. When I as a virologist look at the data, if you haven't received a COVID vaccine in six months or a year, this is a good vaccine to take because it's very different from the variants that you’ve been immunized against before. What about for people who have never gotten a COVID vaccine? If you’ve never been vaccinated, the recommendation will still be to get the standard two doses, but it will be of the XBB vaccine, not the original ones. Then you'll have to get a third dose at some point later on to be considered fully vaccinated. For children, however, the vaccine schedule is a little bit different. Your pediatrician will have all of the specific information on how to get the youngest children into the COVID-19 vaccination pool. With surveillance of cases not as good as it once was, do we know which variants are currently circulating? COVID-19 is still circulating, but case numbers have really gone down over the past six months, as have the corresponding deaths and hospitalizations. But we're still monitoring case numbers and sequencing cases to get a sense of what’s happening in the U.S. So we have a sense of what's going on, but it certainly isn't nearly as in-depth or as rapid as it was a year ago. When will flu shots be available, and what are we going to see? The flu vaccine should roll out at the end of August. The vaccine formulation was decided about six months ago, and the recommendations will be the same as they usually are: Everybody over the age of 6 months is recommended to get a flu vaccine. For younger kids, it's a two-shot schedule. For adults over the age of 12, it's one shot. We're just starting to see data from the Southern Hemisphere, where it’s currently the middle of winter, and there seems to be a good amount of influenza activity there. All the different components of the vaccine are active in different countries. In the next month or so, we'll get a sense of how similar those viruses are to our vaccine and what we might expect for this coming flu season. Last year’s flu season started pretty early. When should people get their flu vaccine this year? September is a great time to get the flu vaccine. That September-October window is early enough so that if flu starts to emerge early—like it did last year at the end of October and into November—you still have a couple of weeks after your vaccine to build your immunity. And if flu emerges in December, January, or February, your vaccine immunity from September or October will still be helping you. Do we know whether the flu virus strains in the vaccine seem to be lining up with illness? Yes, all of the strains in the Northern Hemisphere vaccine are currently circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. More than likely, one or two of those strains will make it up to the Northern Hemisphere and start circulating here. Do we have any defenses against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)? RSV is a common pathogen that's seen in very young children. It also causes a lot of severe disease in individuals over the age of 60. Last year, we had a really large RSV outbreak that spanned the young and very old, and we didn't have any kind of treatments or vaccines for it. This year, we have an FDA-approved vaccine for RSV for people over the age of 60. The clinical trials look great in terms of its efficacy, and that will be rolling out this fall. For kids up to 2 years old, there will be a new antibody treatment for RSV. That'll be available for lots of newborns, particularly ones in high-risk groups. It's an improved antibody treatment over the ones that were available in previous years. It will have a much longer half-life, and you'll only need one injection to protect children for about six months. So at both ends of the age spectrum, we'll have much better tools to fight off RSV this year than we have in the past. Why are we only now seeing a vaccine for RSV? The RSV vaccine was in development even before the pandemic. In fact, the vaccines for COVID-19 were developed using that same technology as the RSV vaccines, which were really showing a lot of promise in clinical trials in 2019. The RSV vaccine got put on the backburner when COVID happened, and now, a few years later, they’ve finally approved the RSV vaccine that formed the basis for those successful COVID-19 vaccines. Since RSV doesn’t mutate as much as COVID or flu, is this a one-time shot? We hope that will be the case. What we haven't seen yet, though, is the effect of vaccine-induced immunity on how the virus will evolve. In the fall, we’ll be looking to see whether RSV infections are happening in vaccinated people or unvaccinated people, and whether the virus is changing if it does infect a vaccinated person. RSV doesn't change nearly as much as the flu or COVID-19, so there probably won’t be a need to update the RSV vaccine on a regular basis. But if there were, that's not very challenging for manufacturers to do these days. It has always been difficult to convince people to get the flu vaccine. How many people are actually getting their flu shot? We're happy when we hit 50% of the population. But oftentimes, we don’t reach that. There's been some reluctance to get COVID vaccines as well, and especially to get repeated vaccines. Are there concerns that people might ignore this new one? Yes, and this is where we need to focus on the communication issue. As a scientist, I can point to the data that show these vaccines work, that they’re safe, and that, if used at a certain level, they can greatly benefit individuals' health and reduce stress on our health care system. But the last couple of years of the pandemic have shown us that it's not enough to just have the data; you have to get that information to people in ways they can understand, and feel comfortable with. Just putting a message on the CDC website that says “get your vaccine because it works” doesn’t communicate effectively to a large swath of the population. We should be using social media in positive ways to get these messages across. These vaccines will make a really big difference this year—particularly the RSV vaccine—and we have to find effective ways to get people to understand that message clearly. For a lot of vaccines, there's a mandated schedule for children and adolescents, but not for adults. So they’re seen as optional, and many people opt out. Is there any push to make these vaccines not so optional? That's a tricky thing to balance. As public health investigators, we see the benefit of having that kind of mandated large-scale vaccination, but mandates make people a little more hesitant. It's about finding that sweet spot of making sure that the benefits are communicated clearly without making people feel like they're being forced to do something they don’t agree with.

More suspected cases of cats with avian influenza reported in Seoul By Kim So-hyun Published : July 30, 2023 - 14:13 Link copied (123rf) Four days after two cats were confirmed to have been infected with avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, at an animal shelter in Seoul, three more suspected bird flu cases in cats were reported in the city on Saturday.The three suspected cases of H5N1 virus infections were found at a cat shelter in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said, adding that it will take two or three days to find out if the infections were highly pathogenic, resulting in severe morbidity and mortality.Earlier last week, two cats at a shelter in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, were confirmed to have been infected with a highly pathogenic bird flu strain, marking the first infections of the virus in mammals in seven years in South Korea.The shelter had reported a mysterious case of en masse cat deaths, with 38 of the cats under its care dead since late last month.As the ministry immediately shared the situation with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, local governments and related agencies, the shelter has been disinfected and kept off limits.The disease control agency and the local administration are looking into those who had contact with the cats and may have bird flu.So far, no person who has been in contact with the cats has shown symptoms, the authorities said.As in the confirmed cases in Yongsan-gu last week, those categorized as “high-risk,” who have been exposed to suspected cases of bird flu in cats, will be closely monitored for 10 days from the last day of contact.Only one such person is currently being monitored and has not shown any symptoms yet.Bird flu has spread throughout Europe in recent years, leading to a cull in May and June of millions of birds on French farms alone and affecting the supply of poultry meat and eggs, according to Reuters.“There is a recent paradigm change in the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza which has heightened global concern as the disease spread to new geographical regions and caused unusual wild bird die-offs, and an alarming rise in mammalian cases,” said Dr. Gregorio Torres, head of the Science Department at the World Organization for Animal Health.In Poland last month, more than two dozen cats were infected with bird flu, although no people appeared to have gotten sick with the virus, according to the World Health Organization.Four human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) were also confirmed in Cambodia, China and Chile, the WHO said.

Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email The test will be designed to detect and differentiate between the four viruses and deliver results in approximately 25 minutes Cue Health has been awarded a new approximately $28 million contract by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to develop a Flu A/B, RSV, and COVID-19 molecular multiplex test for both over-the-counter (OTC) and point-of-care (POC) use. Cue’s test would detect and differentiate between influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 simultaneously, with results delivered in approximately 25 minutes to connected smart devices. The company has also applied with the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its Cue Flu + COVID-19 Molecular Test for at-home and point-of-care (POC) use. Cue also requested De Novo classification from the FDA for the Cue RSV Molecular Test for at-home and point-of-care use. In March, the company received an EUA from the FDA for the Cue Mpox (Monkeypox) Molecular Test, which can be performed at the point-of-care at any CLIA-waived facility. Influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 are common respiratory viruses that can be serious, especially for older adults, those with weakened immune systems, and infants. Combined, these viruses are responsible for hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations each year. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization among children less than one year of age in the U.S. The flu alone caused between 27 million and 54 million illnesses last respiratory season (2022-2023), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And approximately 7,000 people are still admitted to the hospital per week due to COVID-19 in the U.S, per CDC data as of July 15, 2023. By expanding our successful partnership with BARDA, we’re able to meet a critical health need by utilizing Cue’s diagnostic platform to detect and differentiate between some of the most common respiratory viruses that have similar symptoms but distinct treatment options. We expect this test will arm individuals and their providers with actionable information that can reduce community spread, increase the efficacy of treatment, and help lead to better health outcomes. We’re honored to be called upon once again to partner with BARDA to strengthen the nation’s emergency preparedness, and in doing so, empower more people to live their healthiest lives. Ayub Khattak, Chairman and CEO of Cue Health Cue was awarded a contract by BARDA in 2020 to accelerate the development, validation, and FDA clearance of its COVID-19 test, which was the first molecular test to receive FDA Emergency Use Authorization for at-home and over-the-counter use without a prescription. Cue also recently received De Novo authorization from the FDA for the same COVID-19 test (Cue COVID-19 Molecular Test), which was the first De Novo granted for any home use respiratory test available without a prescription. Cue’s work with BARDA began in 2018 when the company received base funding to accelerate the development and regulatory validation of over-the-counter and professional use flu test cartridges, the Cue Health Monitoring System, and cartridge manufacturing technology. The Cue molecular tests all run on the Cue Health Monitoring System (Reader), which has an installed base of more than a quarter million. Cue’s molecular tests are manufactured at its San Diego headquarters, where production and assembly lines have the built-in capability to pivot between manufacturing different Cue diagnostic tests in near real-time. This project is being funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration of Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under contract number 75A50123C00036.

Study: Symptom profiles of community cases infected by influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Image Credit: KitjaKitja/Shutterstock.com Introduction The study also evaluated how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms have changed with the advent of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and whether World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) could help identify the causal respiratory virus in people with symptomatic disease. WHO defines ARI as the sudden onset of symptoms with cough, sore throat, runny nose, and ILI as fever ≥38 °C and cough. Background Respiratory viruses suppressed during the COVID-19-induced pandemic have started re-circulating globally with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, with the suspension of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The United States of America (USA) Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that flu-related hospitalizations and deaths surpassed those of the past year. Previous studies qualitatively compared the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses but did not quantitatively assess the symptom profiles of infected individuals. About the study In the present study, researchers restricted SARS-CoV-2 cases to those submitted by participants who met the WHO definition for ARI and presented symptom profiles of 10986 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likewise, they gathered data on 191 seasonal CoV, 222 influenza, 84 RSV, and 283 rhinovirus cases from Flu Watch Community and the Virus Watch cohort studies to compare the proportion of symptoms experienced during both illnesses. Related StoriesDrug-free nasal spray demonstrates effectiveness in blocking viral and bacterial infectionsNovel nasal spray shows promise in preventing respiratory infectionsPreclinical blood test could predict severe respiratory conditionsThe Flu Watch study was conducted in entire households across England between 2006 and 2011, where the researchers analyzed the collected nasal swab samples for influenza infection, and to a lesser extent and at different times, for rhinovirus, RSV, and seasonal CoVs. Another household community cohort study, Virus Watch, was conducted in England between 2020 and 2022 to analyze respiratory, constitutional, gastrointestinal, ocular, or skin symptoms self-reported by its participants through online surveys. The team ran multiple multivariate logistic regression models to describe the odds of experiencing different respiratory and constitutional symptoms by SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. However, primary exposure was by SARS-CoV-2 wt strain or VOCs with Omicron BA5 as the reference variant. They controlled for all known confounders, such as gender, age, clinal vulnerability status, and natural- or vaccine-induced immunity. Results With the advent of new SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, the SARS-CoV-2 symptomatology began to resemble other respiratory viruses. Thus, respiratory symptoms due to more contagious Omicron strains included increased coughing and sneezing. It could contribute to their increased transmissibility compared to previous variants, as coughing and sneezing are modes for expelling viral particles. With Omicron BA2/BA5 variants emerging, SARS-CoV-2 illnesses meeting the WHO ARI case definition increased by +10 percentage points. This growing resemblance between SARS-CoV-2 symptoms with other respiratory illnesses, e.g., influenza infections, could make syndromic surveillance less effective, thus raising the need for multi-pathogen virological surveillance. In addition, there will be a need for more accurate diagnostic tests to delineate influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially among high-risk patients considered for antiviral therapy. Several previous studies have compared the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron subvariants. The current study findings, however, provide additional information about Omicron BA5 symptomatology. The authors noted that respiratory symptoms significantly increased with the spread of the Omicron VOCs. However, it remains unclear whether the observed change in symptomatology was due to the variant or changing immunity levels across the population. Before the emergence of Omicron, widespread COVID-19 vaccination and natural infections induced immunity in the general population; perhaps, it affected the symptomatology of respiratory viral infections. Conclusions The current study spans multiple years to facilitate the comparison of all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that emerged during the same seasons and compare their symptomology with other common respiratory viruses. It is important considering that the characteristics of respiratory virus infections vary significantly across seasons and regions due to their different variants, and that typically has varying effects on symptomatology. For example, strains of influenza or any other respiratory virus currently circulating in the UK might have different characteristics than the ones predominant during 2006–2011. Even though no data suggested a significant change in influenza symptom profiles over these years in the UK, untangling the complex connections between symptomatology, immune mechanisms, and viral evolution could help elucidate the transmission advantages associated with more recent variants of all respiratory viruses.

The subsequent circulation in swine has resulted in the evolution of a variety of pdm09 variants that spilled back from swine to humans. Focus of the studyInfluenza A is known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans, swine, birds, and other mammals. In 2009, a pandemic caused by the pdm09 strain led to thousands of human deaths around the globe. Since then, this strain has been repeatedly passed from humans to swine, leading to evolutionary changes that make it more likely to cross back and infect humans.To clarify the risks emerging from this widespread circulation of the virus, the researchers analyzed pdm09 transmission data between 2009 and 2021, and investigated how these interspecies transmission events have affected the genetic diversity of the virus and the risks of further human infections.What the researchers learned The analysis revealed that, since 2009, this strain has passed from humans to swine approximately 370 different times, with most of these events occurring when the pdm09 burden was the highest among humans. Although during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, circulation among humans dropped, pdm09’s circulation in swine persisted due to about 150 human-to-swine transmission events from 2018 to 2020.Most human-to-swine transmission events were isolated, but some of them led to sustained circulation of various pdm09 genetic lineages among swine in the United States. Implications of the study Since these variants were shown to be genetically poor matches for human seasonal vaccines, even widespread vaccination would have provided little protection against them. This is particularly worrisome since persistent circulation of this strain among swine was linked to at least five instances of swine-to-human transmission.These findings suggest that managing infections in people who work with swine on a regular basis could help prevent transmission to pigs, and thus reduce the risks associated with the virus passing back to humans.“Controlling influenza A virus infection in humans can minimize spillover of viruses into pigs and reduce the diversity of viruses circulating in swine populations. Limiting virus diversity in pigs can minimize the emergence of novel viruses and the potential for swine-to-human transmission of influenza A virus,” the authors concluded.Swine flu pandemic The swine flu pandemic of 2009 was caused by a new strain of H1N1 influenza virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic on June 11, 2009, as the virus had spread to over 70 countries.Originating in Mexico in April 2009, it quickly spread globally due to the high transmissibility of the virus. The pandemic affected all age groups with higher illness and hospitalization rates among children and young adults. Older adults were somewhat protected due to likely exposure to similar virus strains in their past.By August 2010, when the WHO declared the pandemic over, it had spread to 214 countries, with over 18,000 confirmed deaths. However, some estimates place the actual number much higher, as many deaths likely went unreported or unrecognized. The majority of deaths were in younger people, a departure from seasonal influenza, which typically affects the very young and very old most severely.The 2009 pandemic highlighted the importance of rapid global health communication, flexible public health infrastructures, and comprehensive pandemic planning, including vaccination development and distribution strategies.More about swine fluThe term “swine flu” was first used to describe a flu pandemic in 2009, which was caused by a novel strain of H1N1 that had not been previously seen in humans or animals. This was a unique combination of influenza viruses typically found in pigs, birds, and humans.Swine flu symptoms are similar to those of other influenza strains: fever, cough, body aches, fatigue, chills, and in some cases, severe illness and complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure can occur.Swine flu is contagious and spreads in the same way as the seasonal flu. When people who have it cough or sneeze, they spray tiny droplets of the virus into the air. If you come in contact with these particles, touch a surface (like a doorknob or sink) where they’ve landed, or touch something an infected person has recently touched, you can catch H1N1 swine flu.Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Antiviral drugs are also available that can help treat the flu, including swine flu. These work by preventing the flu virus from reproducing in your body. They are most effective when taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.—–By Andrei Ionescu, Earth.com Staff WriterCheck us out on EarthSnap, a free app brought to you by Eric Ralls and Earth.com.RELATED NEWS11-11-2024Deer mice shed light on adaptive evolution11-11-2024DNA evidence reveals new clues about Pompeii's eruption victims11-11-2024How did the COVID pandemic influence the seasonal flu?11-11-2024Elephant seal colony lost 95% of its pups to bird flu11-11-2024Frogs exposed to radiation show no signs of accelerated aging11-11-2024Proba-3: A mission to see the Sun like we've never seen it before11-11-2024Plants have sophisticated strategies to balance defense and growth11-11-2024Coaches who show compassion help athletes perform better11-11-2024Oil profits could save the planet if governments tax them now11-11-2024Social media is helping save wild animals like caracals11-11-2024Why do Australian finches have bright red and yellow bills?11-10-2024Memory is stored in cells throughout the body, not just the brainhomenewsnews-category/scienceNews coming your wayThe biggest news about our planet delivered to you each daySUBSCRIBEAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceSite MapStaffEARTH.COMNewsVideosImagesEarthpediaTake actionEARTHPEDIAArticlesAnimals EncyclopediaEndangered AnimalsPlants EncyclopediaEndangered PlantsEARTH NEWSBreaking NewsEnvironmentLifesyleVoicesAnimalsPlantsEarthsnapGet the appPrivacy PolicyTerms of serviceGET IN TOUCHContact Us© 2024 Earth.comAll rights reservedLocal nonprofits call for donations as bird flu threatens endangered California condors Search Query Show Search KCBX News Schedules & Playlists On-Air Playlist On-Air Schedules Weekly Program Highlights On-Air Playlist On-Air Schedules Weekly Program Highlights Programs On Demand All Programs News and Talk Programs Music Programs Entertainment Programs Podcasts Streaming Help Subscribe to Podcasts & RSS Feeds Weekly Newsletter On Demand All Programs News and Talk Programs Music Programs Entertainment Programs Podcasts Streaming Help Subscribe to Podcasts & RSS Feeds Weekly Newsletter Support KCBX Donate Now Vehicle Donations Change Your Sustaining Payment Other Ways to Give Capacitors Club Endowment Fund Sponsors & Foundation Support Leave a testimonial Donate Now Vehicle Donations Change Your Sustaining Payment Other Ways to Give Capacitors Club Endowment Fund Sponsors & Foundation Support Leave a testimonial About Contact Us People at KCBX Governance Live Oak Music Festival Employment Opportunities Volunteer Listener Survey Contact Us People at KCBX Governance Live Oak Music Festival Employment Opportunities Volunteer Listener Survey Community Calendar LIVE OAK MUSIC FESTIVAL © 2024 KCBX | KCBX is a registered non-profit, 501(c)(3).

The California condor was successfully saved through species recovery efforts after near extinction in the 1980s. Now, the species faces a new threat from a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).Twenty-one California condors died this spring from avian influenza, also called bird flu.“Unfortunately, what we learned in March of this year was that this particular strain is lethal to California condors and we lost a number of birds,” said Ashleigh Blackford from the US Fish and Wildlife Service.California condors are a critically-endangered species. In the 1980s, there were as few as 22 birds remaining, but with breeding programs and government protections, the population has rebounded — growing to 561. Condors live throughout the western United States and Baja, Mexico. Some live in the wild and others in captivity.Blackford said the condor deaths were all in Arizona, and as of now, the population in California has not been affected, though the virus has been found in other bird species in the state.“There's an urgent need across the species range to take steps to minimize the threat from avian influenza,” she said.In addition to closely monitoring flocks for signs of illness, Blackford said an existing vaccine was recently approved for use with California condors. In a trial earlier this month, vaccines were given to a few birds in a captive setting. Screenshot — Ventana Wildlife Society At the October 2022 Condor Zoom-chat, Ventana Wildlife Society staff presented their new condor rookie cohort. “So, we know that our first dose on the first three birds was safe. All of those birds showed no reaction at the injection site and all continue to be in good health,” Blackford said. She said if results from the trial continue to go well, they’ll consider vaccinating the larger population.Local nonprofits are working to raise awareness about the threatened species. Friends of California Condors Wild & Free and The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History issued a joint appeal for donations to the Condor Recovery Program’s Avian Influenza Response. Helen Johnson is with Friends of California Condors.“Capturing birds and vaccinating can be a real challenge. You’re talking about approximately 90 birds in the Southern California flock,” Johnson said.Condor sites throughout the state include Bitter Creek and Hopper Mountain, Pinnacles National Park, Big Sur, and Redwood National Park. Johnson said donations to the emergency fund will support response efforts for the California condor population wherever needed.Avian influenza is just one of the threats facing California condors, a major cause of death is lead poisoning from ammunition left behind by hunters.For more information you can visit the websites of Friends of California Condors Wild & Free, Ventana Wildlife Society, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, or US Fish and Wildlife Services.

LIKE SAVE PRINT FONT SIZE ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG SEOUL, Aug. 4 (Yonhap) -- South Korea has confirmed a highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) virus in cat food used at a Seoul animal shelter that earlier reported flu cases among cats, the agriculture ministry said Friday. Earlier this week, the H5 AI strain was found in two kinds of cat food -- Balanced Duck and Balanced Chicken manufactured by Nature's Raw -- used at the shelter in Seoul's Gwanak district, and follow-up tests found that they were contaminated with the highly pathogenic H5N1 AI strain, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. At least one cat there died after being infected with the H5N1 AI strain. The two contaminated items were found to have been produced without adequate sterilization since May 25 due to a facility breakdown, and the government is checking for any further affected cases as a total of 268 customers had bought the items. Upon detection of the virus, the government ordered the manufacturer to recall and destroy the products, and launched an inspection into all manufacturers of animal food using chicken, duck and other meats. Concerns have grown over the spread of avian influenza among cats and other animals, as the country reported AI cases in two cats at a shelter in Seoul's Yongsan Ward last week, marking the first infections of the virus in mammals since 2016. Officials said several more AI cases have been confirmed in the two shelters. People who have had contact with the cats in the Gwanak and Yongsan shelters have not shown any symptoms, and there has not been a human AI infection through cats or other mammals. But the health authorities are closely monitoring them, as the incubation period for human AI cases is known to be 10 days. This photo taken Aug. 1, 2023, shows a vet taking a sample from a cat at an animal shelter in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, after South Korea reported highly pathogenic avian influenza cases in cats.

[Image courtesy of BD]BD (NYSE: BDX) + announced today that the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for its respiratory viral panel (RVP). Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based BD designed the RVP for its BD Max system as a single molecular diagnostic that identifies a number of viruses. It distinguishes SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in approximately two hours. The FDA granted the test emergency use authorization (EUA) in February. It uses a single nasal swab or single nasopharyngeal swab sample to determine if a patient has COVID-19, the flu or RSV. BD says its RVP test helps to eliminate the need for multiple individual tests or doctor visits. It can also help clinicians implement the right treatment plan in a fast and efficient manner. Co-testing also helps to increase testing capacity during the busy flu season and speed up diagnosis time, BD added. “Last year, we experienced a threat of a ‘tripledemic’ with COVID, flu and RSV circulating simultaneously, and that threat remains for the coming respiratory season,” said Nikos Pavlidis, VP and GM for diagnostics at BD. “As patient symptoms and clinical presentation can be nearly identical, a combined testing panel is key to enabling clinicians to quickly and efficiently diagnose, differentiate and treat patients, and help manage the spread of the infections. BD Max, a molecular diagnostic platform, can analyze hundreds of samples over a 24-hour period. The RVP detects and differentiates the RNA of the viruses in approximately two hours with the BD Max. It also enables the automated “walkway workflow” that requires minimal human interaction. “The advanced robotic architecture of the BD MAX system automates manual, time-intensive processes, which has never been more important than in today’s environment of staffing shortages and laboratory scientist burnout,” Pavlidis added. Another milestone for BD’s diagnostics business The past year or so has been a positive one for the diagnostics arm of BD. Dave Hickey, EVP and president of the Life Sciences segment at BD, spoke to MassDevice about how the business is driving greater access to care earlier this year. In addition to the EUA and now 510(k) clearance for the RVP, the company accomplished a variety of milestones with various diagnostics. BD received FDA 510(k) clearance for its Vaginal Panel diagnostic on the COR system in March. The comprehensive diagnostic test directly detects the three most common infectious causes of vaginitis. Pavlidis spoke with MassDevice to explain BD’s effort to increase education on sexually transmitted infections and women’s health. In May, the FDA cleared the company’s new Kiestra imaging application that uses AI. The methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) imaging application uses AI to interpret bacterial growth. It releases negative specimens with minimal human interaction.

LIKE SAVE PRINT FONT SIZE ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG SEOUL, July 31 (Yonhap) -- South Korea on Monday confirmed another avian influenza (AI) case from a cat at an animal shelter in Seoul, the agriculture ministry said. The cat living at the shelter in Seoul's Gwanak district died after showing respiratory symptoms and receiving treatment, and an in-depth test found it was infected with a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The latest case came after two AI cases were reported from two cats at another shelter in Seoul last week, marking the first infections of the virus in mammals since 2016. Upon the report, the authorities cordoned off the facility and have implemented quarantine measures. People who have had contact with the cats have not shown any symptoms, and there has not been a human AI infection through cats or other mammals. But the health authorities are closely monitoring them, as the incubation period for human AI cases is known to be 10 days, the ministry said. This undated file photo shows street cats.

Early symptoms of viral infections and allergies can be similar, though allergies can cause itchy eyes, which is less common in viral infections. Also, fevers tend to signify infections.Image source: Adobe Stock/WavebreakMediaMicro Interview • Symptoms and their causes Sneezing and sniffing: Is it allergies, a common cold, the flu, or Covid-19? A family physician at Tufts University School of Medicine offers advice for how to treat allergies and how to tell if symptoms are due to allergies, the common cold, the flu, or Covid-19. Spring and summer have a lot to offer—warmer weather, pretty flowers, and relaxing vacations. For some people, however, they also bring on the dreaded seasonal allergies and the sneezing and sniffling that go with them. According to Deborah Erlich, M.D., vice chair for education and associate professor of family medicine at Tufts, this allergy season is longer as well as more intense than in previous years. “A recent report posited that climate change is a factor,” she says. “The warm spring weather has been starting a few weeks sooner than in past years, and fewer days of frost give plants and flowers the chance to develop more pollen.” Since allergies share common symptoms with other upper respiratory conditions, including colds, flu, and Covid-19, it’s not always easy to identify which of these is making you feel miserable. “Seasonal allergies are not life-threatening, but they are bothersome and can last weeks or months,” says Erlich. “On the other hand, viral respiratory infections are short-lived, but usually more symptomatic. Worse, they carry a risk of a secondary infection like pneumonia.” Tufts Now asked Erlich how to know if you have allergies or something else. Why might it be hard to tell if you have allergies or a viral infection?Deborah Erlich: "Seasonal allergies reflect the release of histamine in response to an allergen. That histamine release causes similar symptoms—such as runny nose, sneezing and congestion—as the common cold, influenza, Covid-19, or other viral infections. Since there is overlap in symptoms, it can sometimes be hard to distinguish between seasonal allergies and other conditions." What are some of the clues that you might have allergies versus a cold or something else?When in doubt, take a Covid-19 test. Many people have falsely attributed their symptoms to allergies when they really had Covid and ended up transmitting the virus to othersDeborah Erlich"Early symptoms can be similar, though allergies can cause itchy eyes, which is less common in viral infections. Also, fevers tend to signify infections. Allergies tend not to produce fevers. Allergies are likely to have more sudden onset after the trigger. For example, someone allergic to pollen might notice symptoms after just a few minutes outdoors. Someone allergic to cats will start to feel symptoms after exposure to cats. Seasonal allergies will last throughout the season and usually return year after year, while colds and flu happen intermittently after exposure to a virus. When in doubt, take a Covid-19 test. It’s easy to do. Many people have falsely attributed their symptoms to allergies when they really had Covid and ended up transmitting the virus to others." What is your advice on how to treat seasonal allergies?"Start by avoiding the triggers. Mitigate pollen allergies by keeping windows closed, using air purifiers at home, running the air conditioner, and staying indoors when possible. Consider taking shoes off at the entrance to your home so that you do not track grass or pollen through the house. There are also several very effective over-the-counter medications. Oral antihistamines are best. Some cause more drowsiness than others. Avoid using oral decongestants for a long period of time. Decongestants work by constricting blood vessels, providing temporary relief of a congested nose, but can be dangerous for people with high blood pressure, heart disease, or glaucoma. Patients with those conditions should avoid decongestants altogether. In addition, anyone taking medications for a chronic condition should check with their doctor before using any medication containing a decongestant. For otherwise healthy people, taking oral decongestants for more than 3 to 5 days can cause rebound congestion. Patients who experience wheezing with their allergies may suffer from allergy-induced asthma or year-round asthmaDeborah ErlichOver-the-counter nasal steroids are safe and work well for runny nose and congestion. Some patients also like to use nasal saline to keep the nasal passages lubricated. Itchy or watery eyes tend to respond best to antihistamine eye drops, also available over the counter. Patients who experience wheezing with their allergies may suffer from allergy-induced asthma or year-round asthma. Either way, a prescription inhaler may help open the airways, even if it is only used during allergy season. A second line treatment I often prescribe for patients with allergies, especially with concomitant asthma, is montelukast, a leukotriene inhibitor. This is usually along with another prescription inhaler from a different family." When would someone want to consider immunotherapy for seasonal allergies?"Immunotherapy is reasonable when none of the other medications is helpful and the patient is still suffering. Tiny amounts of allergen are injected to trigger a mini immune response in order to desensitize the body. Over time, the dose is increased so that eventually the body can handle a full dose of allergen (e.g., pollen) without reacting." What kinds of symptoms warrant a call to your doctor?"Symptoms that continue regardless of treatment warrant a call. It is also reasonable to call if there are symptoms that do not fit the typical picture of allergies, such as fever. Always call if there is difficulty breathing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Finally, it's quite unpleasant to suffer from allergies at the same time as a viral respiratory infection. So those who are prone to allergies should be vigilant about handwashing, avoiding touching their face and eyes, keeping distant from others who are visibly ill with respiratory infections, and getting an influenza vaccine for protection every year."

LIKE SAVE PRINT FONT SIZE ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG ABCDEFG (ATTN: ADDS more info on latest cases, contact tracing throughout) SEOUL, Aug. 2 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's agriculture ministry said Wednesday it has detected an H5 avian influenza (AI) strain in cat food, and ordered its manufacturer to recall and destroy the affected products. Last month, a cat living at a shelter in Seoul's Gwanak district died after showing respiratory symptoms, and it was found Monday to have been infected with a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Follow-up tests on the facility showed that the H5 virus was detected in cat food used there, and its manufacturer, Nature's Raw, in the city of Gimpo, west of Seoul, had failed to abide by due sterilization procedures, the ministry said. Whether the virus from the cat food is highly pathogenic will be determined in about two days. "The company had not fully followed necessary sterilization steps over the course of manufacturing products since May 25. The government ordered the company to stop producing and selling the items, and to recall and destroy them," the ministry said in a release. The company skipped the sterilization process due to the breakdown of its equipment, a ministry official said. In the wake of the case, the ministry decided to launch an inspection into all manufacturers of animal food using chicken, duck and other meats. This photo taken Aug. 1, 2023, shows a vet taking a sample from a cat at an animal shelter in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, after South Korea reported highly pathogenic avian influenza cases in cats. (Yonhap) Concerns have grown over the spread of avian influenza among cats and other animals, as the country reported AI cases in two cats at a shelter in Seoul's Yongsan Ward last week, marking the first infections of the virus in mammals since 2016. Officials said four additional cases have been confirmed among cats in the two shelters, bringing the total caseload among cats to seven. People who have had contact with the cats in the Gwanak and Yongsan shelters have not shown any symptoms, and there has not been a human AI infection through cats or other mammals. But the health authorities are closely monitoring them, as the incubation period for human AI cases is known to be 10 days. Contact tracing is under way, and the authorities are conducting virus tests on street cats in Seoul. Chances seem low for the cats to be infected with the virus through poultry animals, as extensive tests, involving more than 40,000 samples from poultry farms and wild habitats and conducted in May and June, found no suspected or confirmed cases. The authorities are also grappling with how to deal with infected cats. In accordance with related regulations, animals infected with the avian influenza are supposed to be culled, but it is not easy to force cat owners to administer mercy killing. "We are reviewing an option of setting up facilities to isolate infected pets and treat them," the official said. According to government data, South Koreans raised 2.54 million cats as pets in 2022. graceoh@yna.co.kr(END) Keywords #cat virus #avian influenza Issue Keywords Most Liked BLACKPINK's Rose holds strong at No. 3 on British Official Singles chart with 'APT.'

The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock's agency said in a statement that the detection came after 100 days of not registering the presence of the disease in the South American country. The “quarantine and containment of the detected farm” was ordered, in addition to the ”epidemiological surveillance of technicians in the focal and perifocal (surrounding) area to prevent the spread of the virus to other sites,“ Agrocalidad's communiqué went on. Special teams have also been placed under round-the-clock alert in case of other notifications while a vaccination plan against the disease was extended in Cotopaxi and in the neighboring provinces of Tungurahua and Chimborazo. Farms owners who have vaccinated their birds with a single dose were urged to apply the second dose as a biosecurity measure, it was also reported. ”The commitment to control the disease is a joint effort between the poultry sector, the national government, and the public,” the statement also read. On November 30, Ecuador declared a nationwide animal health emergency for 90 days, after the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was detected in several farms, mostly in the Andean region. Under this measure, the movement of poultry, and by-products such as eggs, hens, and chickens from farms affected by the outbreak was prohibited. At least 1.2 million birds died or were culled because of the virus. On Jan. 10, the first human case of avian influenza infection was confirmed in a nine-year-old girl in the central province of Bolivar.

Ibrahim AlfarwiHealthy roseate terns have been monitored although survival rates for chicks has not been goodWardens have been unable to live on the island since bird flu was confirmed. Instead they have been monitoring by visits.Mr Westerberg, who took up his post mid June, said: "Had I taken on this job without bird flu it would have been unbelievably fantastic doing all the seabird monitoring."But, because of bird flu, it's frustrating dealing with it, for good reasons, as it's restricting what we're trying to do with monitoring, as it wouldn't be safe for the birds and it wouldn't be safe for us."He is hopeful funding can be secured for environmental monitoring at Coquet, with research carried out into whether the virus remains in the ground.A Defra group spokesperson said it was concerned about the impact of avian influenza on seabirds and would work closely with partners on "any action needed".The spokesperson said: "We have invested £1.5m in research to understand how this disease is behaving in wild birds, while Natural England is working closely with the RSPB on developing new strategies to support the recovery of our seabird colonies impacted by bird flu."RSPBSome common tern chicks have fledged indicating a possible immunity to bird fluFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Co-circulating with H3N2 is an interesting ally, Influenza B's sublineage Victoria, which has been contributing to a small portion of cases nationwide. 123 MUMBAI: In the battleground of viruses, a clear dominator this monsoon has been the influenza A subtype H3N2 that has successfully surpassed two recent viruses-H1N1 (swine flu) and the pandemic-causing SARS-CoV2-to claim the upper hand. Co-circulating with H3N2 is an interesting ally, Influenza B's sublineage Victoria, which has been contributing to a small portion of cases nationwide.Data collated from labs and hospitals shows H3N2 to be the common type among most hospitalised patients in the state.As on Saturday, nearly 100 patients were admitted with flu in government hospitals of Maharashtra. While reported deaths haven't been exceptionally high-six so far-cases are on the rise, say doctors. The positivity rate for flu in Maharashtra touched 19% in July, up from 6% in April and May respectively. As per the public health department, there have been 1,540 lab-confirmed cases of influenza since January, of which nearly 900 were H3N2.Higher H3N2 prevalence linked to population immunity profile: DocsWith H3N2 influenza cases hitting 19% positivity in the state, Dr Varsha Potdar, head of the influenza group at the National Institute of Virology, Pune said, âIt is undeniably the dominant virus type this season.â NIV is part of the countryâs 32-lab network that tracks and studies influenza viruses. According to her, the higher prevalence of H3N2 could be linked to the populationâs immunity profile. She pointed out that a significant proportion of individuals have already been exposed to Covid-19 and are vaccinated against it, while H1N1 was circulating last year. Influenza viruses can be distinguished in types A (H1N1, H3N2), B (sublineages Yamagata, Victoria), C, and D. While both Influenza A and B are responsible for outbreaks and seasonal epidemics, influenza A viruses are only ones with pandemic potential. Dr Potdar said both H1N1 and H3N2 can cause mild to severe diseases. âTherefore, maintaining continuous surveillance and ensuring widespread vaccination is crucial,â she said. After start of Covid pandemic in 2020, there have been changes in circulation of influenza viruses around the world, experts say. Dr Potdar mentioned a notable one was possible elimination of influenza B Yamagata lineage, which has not been detected since April 2020 globally. Instead, labs are increasingly coming across influenza B sublineage Victoria. At Mumbaiâs KEM Hospital, where the microbiology department has been testing influenza samples, up to 95% have been positive for H3N2 and 5% for Victoria. Dr Priyanka Prasad from the department of microbiology said that detections of H3N2 began last November, whereas Victoria subtype was detected from February this year. Interestingly, Covid-19 positive samples have been relatively scarce, with fewer H1N1 cases as well, she said. In light of these findings, the department has proposed a study to delve into the correlation between different virus types and the clinical symptoms they manifest. Part of H3N2âs significance stems from its historical background. It was the culprit behind the 1968 pandemic that claimed a million lives worldwide before evolving into a seasonal flu. Notably, H3N2 has a tendency to undergo rapid changes than the relatively stable influenza B viruses. Doctors say although the H3N2 may have overpowered other viruses, it has not managed to cause major devastation. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, an infectious disease expert, said that the majority of patients recover, barring a few with comorbidities who may suffer complications. âWith the knowledge that H3N2 is primarily circulating, doctors shouldnât hesitate in initiating early oseltamivir if symptoms align,â he said. A senior microbiologist said viruses are cyclic and as immunity levels drop in population, one of the backbenchers rises to the top. âThe only effective way to stay ahead is vaccination,â she said.

Read our privacy notice HOPES have been dashed that this summer’s wave of Avian Influenza might be less severe than in 2022, say researchers from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). The disease is once again having a devastating impact, with seabirds washing up on beaches across the UK. Experts are calling for the public to report all dead birds to BirdTrack and Defra in Great Britain and DAERA in Northern Ireland to help them understand more about the spread of the disease.Also in the news10,000 trees being planted in Devon with help of new tree funding Sick leave on track to hit highest for five years at Mid Devon District Council Dramatic image of flooding near Stoke Canon Somerset Bus Partnership takes anti-cuts protests to Wiveliscombe and DulvertonBirds are dying from suspected cases of the Avian Influenza the length and breadth of the UK. Recent weeks have seen hundreds of dead Guillemots washed up on beaches in Wales and thousands of terns and gulls – including Kittiwakes, which were already on the UK Birds on Conservation Concern Red List because of population declines before avian influenza hit, dead at colonies in eastern Scotland and England. Black-headed Gulls remain the worst affected birds in Northern Ireland. NatureScot has recorded 1,443 Guillemots, 1,570 Kittiwakes and 236 Herring Gulls suspected to have died from Avian Influenza, but the true scale of the losses will not be clear for some time.Earlier in the season, major outbreaks of Avian Influenza were mostly restricted to inland colonies of Black-headed Gulls, though the disease quickly spread to the coast and into colonies of Common Terns. Many thousands of each species are now known to have died.Reports suggest that as many as 20,000 Black-headed Gulls (adults and young) may have died at one Lancashire site alone. More than 10 per cent of the total UK breeding population may have been lost.This unprecedented UK outbreak of Avian Influenza began in 2021. Estimates of the total number of birds killed vary but more than 70 species are known to have been affected. Many colonies are being hit this year for the first time; others, sadly, are experiencing a second summer of disease.Alongside the annual surveillance of some seabird colonies through the BTO/JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme, there is additional work underway this year to assess the situation of species, such as Great Skua and Gannet, that were worst hit last year but are not usually monitored annually.All dead and sick birds of any species should be reported to BirdTrack and to Defra/DAERA. BirdTrack allows researchers to follow the geographical spread of Avian Influenza and rapidly assess its potential impact. Defra/DAERA will decide whether to collect the dead birds and test them for the disease. Members of the public are reminded not to touch dead or sick birds and to keep dogs on leads to prevent the further spread of disease. BTO Head of Surveys, Dawn Balmer, said: “As our beaches get busier over the summer holidays, do look out for dead birds, report them and keep your dogs on leads and away from carcasses.It’s devastating to see the impact of Avian Influenza again this year. “You can help us monitor the situation by continuing to report dead birds to Defra (GB) and DAERA (NI), and also to BirdTrack.”RSPB Senior Policy Officer for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, Claire Smith, said: “It’s heart-breaking to see Avian Influenza sweep through seabirds again this year. “The disease is one of several threats impacting the UK’s internationally important seabird populations. “These long-lived and slow-breeding birds cannot simply bounce back. “We need to do all we can to remove other human-induced pressures, such as by reducing bycatch and closing sandeel fisheries. “We must also carefully consider the location of coastal developments and step up measures to tackle climate change.”Natural England Principal Advisor for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, Nik Ward, said: “Avian Influenza has again had a big impact on many of our important seabird colonies in England affecting chicks and adults in different proportions. “Future monitoring will be crucial for assessing the lasting effects of these mortality events.” More About:BirdsPublicOutbreakAdultsSPREAD THE NEWSCommentsThis article has no comments yet.
