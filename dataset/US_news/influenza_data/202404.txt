CDC continues to track the rise of the JN.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Summary What CDC knows Respiratory disease activity in the United States remains high despite recent declines in some indicators. Influenza (flu) is currently the respiratory virus causing the most emergency department visits. The most common influenza viruses this season are type A(H1N1) and type B viruses. JN.1 continues to be the most widely circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the United States and around the world. What CDC is doing CDC is studying the impacts of COVID-19 and flu illness this season, encouraging vaccination and prompt antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and flu, and studying vaccine effectiveness. CDC is still learning more about the JN.1 variant and tracking its spread. CDC tracks spread of influenza viruses While COVID-19 continues to cause more hospitalizations than influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), right now, more people are going to emergency departments to get care and being diagnosed with flu than COVID-19. With seasonal flu activity elevated across the country, CDC is tracking which influenza viruses are most common, where they are occurring, and how this might impact the public's health. Since the fall, emergency department visits have been increasingly driven by flu. While some recent data suggest flu may have peaked, CDC is watching closely for a second wave of flu activity, which happens during many seasons. The mix of influenza viruses circulating varies by region, but the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season are type A(H1N1) and type B viruses. This might mean more severe outcomes among people who are hospitalized with flu this season. A study by CDC found that A(H1N1) and B viruses caused severe illness more frequently among hospitalized patients compared to A(H3N2) viruses. More severe illness could create greater demand for healthcare, potentially increasing strain on hospitals. The fact is that every flu virus has the potential to cause serious illness, regardless of which virus it is. Vaccination can help prevent the most serious effects of flu, but as of January 6, 2024, it is estimated that 46.8% of the adult population was vaccinated in the United States for the 2023-2024 season. As a reminder, there are effective vaccines and treatments, as well as other preventive actions that can reduce your risk of getting sick and take your illness from "wild to mild" if you are vaccinated but still get sick. This season's flu and COVID-19 vaccines are well-matched to the viruses that are most common and should offer good protection from severe illness. JN.1 is still the most prevalent variant CDC continues to track the rise in prevalence of the JN.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. JN.1 remains the most widely circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and globally. As of January 19, 2024, JN.1 is estimated to account for approximately 83% to 88% of all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, an increase from the estimated prevalence of 55% to 68% two weeks ago. JN.1 remains at high prevalence among variants in international travelers and wastewater viral levels, as well as in most regions around the globe. COVID-19 activity is currently high, most prominently in the eastern half of the country. COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have remained elevated in recent weeks. JN.1 is contributing to the spread of COVID-19 this winter. CDC continues to learn more about JN.1, but currently there is no evidence that it causes more severe disease. Current COVID-19 vaccines are expected to increase protection against JN.1, as they do against other variants, by helping prevent severe illness.

This study compared circulating influenza A and B in hospitalized patients in Israel with the influenza strains in the vaccine following the 2021–2022 winter season which was dominated by the omicron variant. Methods: Nasopharyngeal samples of 16,325 patients were examined for the detection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B. Phylogenetic trees of hemagglutinin were then prepared using sanger sequencing. Vaccine immunogenicity was also performed using the hemagglutination inhibition test. Results: Of the 16,325 nasopharyngeal samples collected from hospitalized patients between September 2021 (Week 40) and April 2023 (Week 15), 7.5% were found to be positive for influenza. Phylogenetic analyses show that in the 2021–2022 winter season, the leading virus subtype was influenza A(H3N2), belonging to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. However, the following winter season was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which belongs to clade 6B.aA.5a.2. The circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain showed a shift from the vaccine strain, while the co-circulating influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B strains were similar to those of the vaccine. Antigenic analysis coincided with the sequence analysis. Discussion: Influenza prevalence during 2022–2023 returned to typical levels as seen prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, which may suggest a gradual viral adaptation to SARS-CoV-2 variants. Domination of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed uniquely in Israel compared to Europe and USA and phylogenetic and antigenic analysis showed lower recognition of the vaccine with the circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Israel compared to the vaccine. Introduction In temperate and continental climates, influenza outbreaks occur every year, most commonly in the winter when humidity and temperature levels are low. In tropical and sub-tropical climates, it can occur year-round (Uyeki et al., 2022). Influenza infection is associated with respiratory and non-respiratory complications such as pneumonia, bacterial co-infection, and cardiac complications that can lead to hospitalization and morbidity. An estimated 300,000 influenza-related deaths occur annually worldwide (Petrova and Russell, 2018). Annual vaccination is considered the most effective approach to preventing influenza (Uyeki et al., 2022). The composition of the annual vaccine is determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on worldwide surveillance data (WHO, 2023a). However, studies show low vaccine effectiveness (VE), especially in vaccines containing the influenza A(H3N2) strain, which drifts and adapts new mutations (Huddleston et al., 2020). Vaccine preparation also poses significant challenges. Generally, influenza vaccines are produced using an egg-based manufacturing process. However, the virus can acquire mutations and drift during egg adaptation, which further contributes to low VE. Hence, the vaccine composition is evaluated every year and updated according to the current circulating strains (WHO, 2023a,b). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza seasons in temperate areas were generally dominated by a single strain, with other influenza strains circulating at lower levels. As SARS-CoV-2 cases decreased in Israel in September 2021, influenza cases increased and were dominated by influenza A(H3N2), with no other strains circulating, while in the United States and Europe, other influenza strains were circulating [Grohskopf et al., 2016; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2023; Europe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), 2023; Price et al., 2023]. In this study, we characterized the influenza seasons 2021–2022 and 2022–2023, during which SARS-CoV-2 circulation transitioned from the pandemic to the post-pandemic phase, and examined the compatibility of the influenza vaccine with circulating strains in Israel as compared to the United States and Europe. Methods Patients and samples Nasopharyngeal samples of patients hospitalized at Sheba Medical Center (SMC), the largest tertiary medical center in Israel (1,619 hospital beds), were received at the Central Virology Laboratory of the Ministry of Health located on the premises of SMC. In total, 16,325 samples were tested for the influenza virus between week 40 of 2021 (which started October 2, 2021) and week 15 of 2023 (which started April 9, 2023). The distribution of samples by patients’ age, sex, and critical hospitalization is presented in the Supplementary Tables S1, S2. Viral RNA extraction and real-time PCR Viral RNA was extracted using the STARMag Viral DNA/RNA 200C universal kit (Seegene Inc., Korea). Reverse transcription and RT-PCR assays were performed using the AllplexTM RV essential assay (Seegene Inc., Korea) in a CFX real-time PCR system (BIO-RAD, United States; Folgueira et al., 2019). Influenza typing for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) was performed as previously described (Meningher et al., 2014; Pando et al., 2021). Briefly, the master mix was prepared with the SensiFAST kit (Meridian Bioscience, United Kingdom) using specific primers for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1pdm) that are listed in Supplementary Table S3 (Pando et al., 2021). The lineage of influenza B was determined by RT-PCR The qRT-PCR assay was performed on a CFX real-time PCR system (BIO-RAD, United States). The influenza B lineage was determined by Sanger sequencing of the hemagglutinin, as described below. Sequencing and genomic analysis Hemagglutinins (HA) from 77 laboratory-confirmed influenza viruses were randomly selected for sequencing. Sequencing was performed using the Sanger method and analyzed using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation, United States). In brief, qRT-PCR was performed on positive influenza samples using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany), separated on a 2% agarose gel, and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers that were used for the sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S4. PCR products were purified with the EPPiC Fast enzyme (A&A Biotechnology, Poland). The DNA templates were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 kit on an ABI Prism 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, United States). Phylogenetic analysis of each influenza strain was performed by Geneious software (Dotmatics) using the neighbor-joining method. All ID numbers of sequences that were retrieved for phylogenetic analysis are listed in Supplementary Index 2. Vaccine immunogenicity To analyze how well the vaccine recognized currently circulating viruses, a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed. The HI test was performed by the WHO Collaborating Center, London, according to the standard WHO procedure using ferret post-infection antisera raised against the vaccine strains (WHO, 1997). Protein illustration The HA protein structure was visualized using PyMOL software (Schrodinger, United States). Influenza sequences were retrieved from the EpiFluTM database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (GISAID, 2023). International comparisons The predominant influenza virus types and subtypes detected among SMC hospitalized patients were compared to those of other regions in the Northern Hemisphere (WHO, 2023c). SARS-CoV-2 analysis The data on new SARS-CoV-2 cases in Israel are published daily by the Israel Ministry of Health (IMoH) and follow the rate of COVID-19 since February 2020 (WHO, 2023d). The data on SARS-CoV-2 variants are attributed to the World Consortium of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which updates the variants of concern daily (Nextstrain, 2023). Results Influenza virus presence among SMC hospitalized patients During the 2021–2022 winter season, an increased percentage of influenza viruses was detected in November 2021 among samples from hospitalized patients that were abruptly interrupted by the arrival of the omicron variants. As shown in Figure 1A, only the influenza A(H3N2) subtype was detected in the winter season of 2021–2022. However, in the 2022–2023 winter season, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases emerged with a lower percentage of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineages. The predominant strain in the 2022–2023 winter season was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. At the end of the influenza season (March–April 2023), the percentage of influenza A cases decreased, while the percentage of influenza B-positives remained stable. Figure 1B represents the percentage of influenza rate alongside SARS-CoV-2 variants from September 2021 to March–April 2023. With the introduction of the omicron BA.1 variant, the influenza rate decreased immediately in January 2022. However, BA.2, BA.4, BA.5, BQ, and XBB variants that were present in Israel during 2022 and 2023 were not accompanied by a decrease in the influenza rate. Additionally, a cross-checking analysis of double infection by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza was also performed and showed only five cases of double infection (0.08%). The comparison of critical cases between patients with positive influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vs. influenza A(H3N2) showed no significant difference (Supplementary Table S2). Figure 1 Figure 1. Circulation of influenza subtypes (A) and SARS-CoV2 (B) from 2021 to April 2023 in Israel. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B (Victoria), and influenza A untyped were collected and analyzed in the period of 2021 to April 2023 in SMC hospitalized patients (A). Number of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Israel from 2021 to 2023 along with the percentage of influenza rate in SMC hospitalized patients (B). International comparisons During the 2021–2022 season, influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant influenza virus in Central Asia, Europe, and North America in addition to Israel (Table 1). In the 2022–2023 season, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was predominant in Central Asia and Eastern Europe in addition to Israel. Influenza A(H3N2) was predominant in Southern Asia, Southwest Europe, and North America. Influenza B(Victoria) was predominant in Eastern Asia during both seasons. Table 1 Table 1. Predominant influenza strains in Asia, Israel, Europe, and North America. Comparison of the influenza vaccine HA to influenza virus HA detected among SMC hospitalized patients Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detected during the 2022–2023 season were of the 6B.1A.5a.2a and 6B.1A.5a.2a.1 clades (Figure 2A). The vaccine strains (A/Wisconsin/588/2019 and A/Victoria/2570/2019) belong to 6B.1A.5a.2, which are located in a different branch from the samples detected in Israel, as shown in Figure 2A. Antigenic analysis is also shown in Figure 2A, in the right corner. The samples that were analyzed are indicated in the phylogenetic tree with an asterisk. Of the six samples, three (A/Israel/R12781/2022, A/Israel/R663/2023, and A/Israel/R11323/2022) were located in the upper branches and showed high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer (>1,280), while the samples A/Israel/R13228/2022, A/Israel/R463/2023, and A/Israel/R10810/2022 show low HI titer (<640) and were located in a different branch. Figure 2 Figure 2. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B. Phylogenetic trees of patients’ samples positive for influenza in SMC hospitalized patients in the 2022–2023 season of (H1N1)pdm09 (A), influenza (H3N2) (B), and influenza B/Victoria (C). Antigenic analysis of each strain is presented in the right corner of each figure. The samples that were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) are indicated with an asterisk. The HA of influenza A(H3N2) samples from both seasons (2021–2022 and 2022–2023) were found to belong to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2 clade, adjacent to the vaccine clade (A/Drawin/9/2021) (Figure 2B). The antigenic analysis of six more samples shown in the right corner of Figure 2B had a low HI titer compared to the vaccine. The influenza B/Victoria sequences were of the V1a.3a.2 lineage, similar to the vaccine clade (B/Austria/1359417/2021), and the antigenic analysis showed a similar HI titer compared to the vaccine (Figure 2C). A comparison of the structure models of the vaccine homo-trimer (A/Wisconsin/588/2019) HA of influenza can be seen in Figure 2C. The main mutations that were detected in Israel are highlighted by different colors (Figure 3A). The mutations found for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were K54Q, S88P, D94N, V132I, A186T, Q189E, T216A, E224A, R259N H273Q, K308R, and F330X. A list of all the amino acid substitutions is presented in Supplementary Index 3. The HA modeling of influenza A(H3N2) in Figure 3B emphasizes the mutations detected in the positive samples of influenza A(H3N2) in the 2022–2023 season. The mutations found in Israel were E50K, F79V, I140K, S156H, N186D, and G225D. The influenza B mutations identified in Israel were E183K, A209E, D249E, and S260P (Figure 3C). Figure 3 Figure 3. Overview of the hemagglutinin amino acid substitutions of the influenza isolated from hospitalized patients compared to the vaccine. Modeling of hemagglutinin (HA) and its amino acid substitutions compared to the vaccine. The samples were compared to the vaccines for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (compared with sample A/Israel/R13228/2022) (A), influenza (H3N2) (compared with sample A/Israel/R8215/2022) (B), and influenza B/Victoria (compared with sample B/Israel/R13022/2022) (C). Mutations found in the 2022–2023 season are colored differently. Discussion Analysis of influenza incidence prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic identified a significantly lower number of cases alongside the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 alpha and delta variants, as seen in other reports (Olsen et al., 2021; Lauring et al., 2022). As with other SARS-CoV-2 variants, the emergence of the omicron variant in December 2021 was followed by a dramatic reduction in influenza cases among hospitalized patients in Israel (Figure 1). The results shown in this study (Figure 1) demonstrate that during the 2022–2023 season, influenza activity among hospitalized patients and the epidemic curve were similar to those of the pre-pandemic seasons. This “typical” influenza pattern among hospitalized patients occurred, while the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 variants was low throughout the season (WHO, 2023c,d). The possibility of dual infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza was also examined in this study, as dual infection may lead to severe cases and increased mortality (Bai et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2022). However, a very low percentage of such cases were found (0.08%), presumably as a result of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at that time. In the 2021–2022 season, the influenza virus detected among hospitalized patients belonged to influenza A(H3N2), clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. This clade was the predominant influenza virus throughout the world in the 2021–2022 season (WHO, 2023a). Subsequently, in 2022–2023, clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 was still circulating in the world; however, influenza A(H3N2) was less frequent in hospitalized patients in Israel. The predominant virus in the 2022–2023 season was influenza (H1N1)pdm09, which was not detected in 2021–2022, while in Southern Asia, most of Europe, and North America, influenza A(H3N2) predominated [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2023; Europe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), 2023]. Influenza B/Victoria was also detected but less frequently in hospitalized patients, and its positive rate remained stable at the end of the 2022–2023 season, while influenza A decreased, corresponding with its typical end-of-the-season upticks (Uyeki et al., 2022). Influenza B/Yamagata was not detected among hospitalized patients in Israel, similar to global findings during the COVID-19 pandemic (Koel et al., 2013). The phylogenetic analysis of the 2022–2023 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain found a lack of compatibility between the vaccine and the circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses among hospitalized patients in Israel. While the vaccine virus belongs to 6B.1A.5a.1, the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detected in patients evolved into two clades, 6B.1A.5a.2a and 6B.1A.5a.2a.1, similar to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses detected in Europe. This result coincides with the immunogenicity experiments, which showed a low HI titer that indicates a lack of compatibility between the circulating strain and the vaccine. Reduced compatibility between the vaccine and the circulating influenza viruses is attributed to the amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin positions K54Q, A186T, Q189E, E224A, R259K, and K308R detected in hospitalized patients in Israel (Supplementary Index 3). Mutations in positions 186 and 189 have been found to belong to the patches responsible for major antigenic change (Koel et al., 2013; Kratsch et al., 2016). Influenza A(H3N2) also evolved into smaller clades from the 3C.2a1b.2a.2 clade, but reports from the WHO showed that compatibility with the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine remained (WHO, 2023a). Despite the match between the vaccine and the circulating influenza A(H3N2), the United States was still burdened by more influenza A(H3N2) infections, possibly due to the low vaccine coverage in the population (Uyeki et al., 2022). In Israel in 2022–2023, vaccination rates were relatively low (17.9%). Nevertheless, the influenza A(H3N2) infection rate was lower in Israel compared with the United States and Europe, which may have been due to immunity gained in the 2021–2022 winter season when influenza A(H3N2) circulated. In contrast, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 last circulated in Israel in the winter season of 2019–2020, which may explain its dominance in Israel in 2022–2023 (Fratty et al., 2022; Omer et al., 2022; Malosh et al., 2023). Overall, the prevalence of influenza A strains tends to shift each year between influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2), as seen prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Israel [Europe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), 2023]. For each coming winter season, a composition for the influenza vaccine is recommended by the WHO after examining the recent circulating subtypes (WHO, 2023a). Since the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 included in the vaccine was incompatible in 2022–2023, the WHO recommended the inclusion of influenza with stronger clade-specific recognition (WHO, 2023a,b). Hence, we suggest removing the B/Yamagata component from the vaccine, using a higher antigen content in targeted populations (such as older adults), and using cell culture for propagation, a procedure that introduces fewer molecular changes (Uyeki et al., 2022). Alternatively, other technologies, such as mRNA technology, which was proven to be a game-changer during the COVID-19 pandemic, can be used. In conclusion, higher rates of influenza activity were measured in the 2022–2023 season as compared with the 2021–2022 season. The influenza strain that dominated the 2022–2023 season was unique in Israel compared to Europe and the United States. The majority of influenza samples in hospitalized patients in Israel in 2022–2023 belonged to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, but influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria were also detected. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of two out of the three influenza types detected in Israel showed a resemblance to the vaccine recommended by the WHO, with the exception of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Plants are a good source of bioactive compounds to be used as preventive measures for both inhibiting the virus binding and enhancing mucosal innate immunity. Curcumin has been shown to possess antiviral activity and modulate innate immunity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop an oro-nasal film spray containing curcumin and determine its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection, as well as its effects on mucosal innate immunity and inflammatory cytokines in vitro.MethodsThe antiviral activity of the film spray against SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B was assessed in vitro by plaque reduction assay. Cytotoxicity of the film spray to oral keratinocytes and nasal epithelial cells was assessed by MTT assay, and cytotoxicity to Vero and MDCK cells was assessed by an MTS-based cytotoxicity assay. Oral and nasal innate immune markers in response to the film spray were determined by ELISA and by a commercial Milliplex Map Kit, respectively.ResultsOur data show that the film spray containing curcumin can inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections while maintaining cell viability. Results obtained among 4 viruses revealed that curcumin film spray demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 with the lowest EC50 of 3.15 µg/ml and the highest SI value of 4.62, followed by influenza B (EC50 = 6.32 µg/ml, SI = 2.04), influenza A/H1N1 (EC50 = 7.24 µg/ml, SI = 1.78), and influenza A/H3N2 (EC50 > 12.5 µg/ml, SI < 1.03), respectively. Antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and HD-5, IL-6 and TNF-α produced by oral keratinocytes were significantly induced by the film spray, while hBD2 was significantly reduced.ConclusionFilm spray containing curcumin possesses multiple actions against SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting ACE-2 binding in target cells and enhancing mucosal innate immunity. The film spray can also inhibit influenza virus infection. Therefore, the curcumin film spray may be effective in preventing the viral infection of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world since 2019 [1]. It is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped RNA virus with a genome encoding the spike (S) protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, nucleoprotein, and various non-structural proteins. The illness commonly known as “flu” or “the flu” is a seasonal respiratory infection caused by influenza virus types A, B, and C; however, type A is the most virulent [2]. Both COVID-19 and flu can affect all age groups and are associated with high mortality, especially in elderly patients and patients with immunocompromised conditions [2]. Although efforts have been made towards preventive measures, infections by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, especially type A (IVA), are still providing challenges for medical and public health systems.The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and IVA infection may involve several stages, including the suppression of host antiviral and innate immune responses [3, 4]. The viral replication-induced infected cell secretes various chemokines or cytokines, such as interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12), interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and colony-stimulating factors, causing acute inflammation described as the “cytokine storm symptom” [5, 6]. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus are potent stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production which correlates with lung injury. Thus, a major goal in the treatment of these infectious diseases should be to reduce the inflammatory effects of the viruses.Currently, treatment for COVID-19 and flu are based on signs and symptoms and may include antiviral agents and steroids [7], which can cause adverse side effects [8]. Although co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and IVA is rare, they share similar signs and symptoms and individuals with both infections may be at higher risk of poor health outcomes [9, 10]. Because presently there is no conclusive information on the effectiveness of approved drugs for COVID-19 and flu, efforts should be made to identify natural compounds with potent antiviral activity against both viruses.Plants are the major source for new drug discoveries to combat infectious disease [11]. Among these, curcumin is a promising candidate as it shows antiviral activity against both SARS-CoV-2 and IVA [12, 13]. A recent study reported that curcumin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain by pre-infection treatment of Vero E6 cells [12]. This effect has also been observed with other enveloped viruses including IVA [13, 14]. Previous studies have reported that curcumin prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry by direct interaction with cell factors or viral proteins [15, 16]. Therefore, it is encouraging to investigate curcumin as a potential drug candidate to suppress the virus and its application in preventing COVID-19 and flu.Mucosal innate immunity plays a crucial role in the development of infections. Antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelial cells lining oro-nasal cavity, including human cathelicidin LL-37 and alpha- and beta-defensins, are part of the mucosal innate immunity system. These antimicrobial peptides have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and participate in mucosal innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and IVA [17,18,19]. Because human-to-human transmission through droplets is the main mode of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus transmissions, the oral and nasal cavities represent the major routes and reservoirs for the viruses [20]. Thus, inhibiting viral infection at the port of entry and enhancing oral and nasal innate immunity may be a novel strategy for prevention of COVID-19 and flu infections.Recently, blocking viral entry with phytochemical compounds to prevent infection has been intensively studied. Curcumin has been documented to possess antiviral activity and modulate innate immunity [1]. Therefore, it may be used as a preventive measure for both inhibiting the virus binding and enhancing mucosal innate immunity. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel oro-nasal film spray containing curcumin and determine its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection, as well as its effects on mucosal innate immunity and inflammatory cytokines in vitro.Materials and methodsPreparation of curcuminCurcumin was a pure compound purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The curcumin powder was dissolved in ethanol to form a stock solution of 500 µg/ml, and the final dilution was used as 10 µg/ml or dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a stock solution of 20 mg/ml for the pseudotyped virus entry assay.Preparation of a film spray containing curcuminFormulation of a film spray containing the active ingredient curcumin (10 µg/ml) was prepared by modifying the method used in a previously published paper [21]. Briefly, ethanol (15% w/v), polyethylene glycol (20% w/v) and tween 80 (2% w/v) were mixed. Then, xylitol (10% w/v) and menthol (0.3% w/v) were added to the mixture. Polyvinylpyrrolidone, EDTA, and sodium benzoate were separately hydrated and added to the previous mixture to produce concentrations of 5, 0.1 and 0.1% w/v of the formulation, respectively. Afterwards, curcumin (0.001% w/v) was added to the mixture. Deionized water was used for final volume adjustment. The physical properties of the formulation were recorded before and after the stability study (Freeze-thaw 5 cycles).Cell lines and pseudotyped virusHuman embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T/17 cells) stably expressing human ACE2 (HEK293-hACE2) were generated by lentivirus transduction, following the methods previously described [22, 23]. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/High glucose (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The pseudotyped virus harboring Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus) was generated as mentioned in a previous study [23, 24].SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virusesTo determine the antiviral activity of curcumin film spray against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 Variant 20I (Alpha, V1) or B.1.1.7 was isolated from a clinical sample from a COVID-19 patient in Thailand and propagated in Vero cells maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with L-glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic, and 2% FBS. In contrast, three strains of influenza viruses including influenza A/H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, ATCC VR-95), influenza A/H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/1968 H3N2, ATCC VR-547), and influenza B (B/TH/MUMT-1/2015) were propagated in MDCK cells and maintained in EMEM supplemented with L-glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic, and 2 µg/ml trypsin-tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (Trypsin-TCPK) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louise, MO, USA).All tested viruses were cultured under humidified (37 °C, with 5% CO2) conditions in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory (for SARS-CoV-2) and in a BSL-2 laboratory (for influenza viruses). The aliquots of the stock viruses were stored at below − 70 °C until used in the assays.SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus infection assayThe effects of the curcumin compound and the film spray formulation containing the compound with spike-ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated using the surrogate assay system with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus and HEK293-hACE2 cells expressing human transmembrane protease serine-2 (TMPRSS-2), as previously described [23, 24]. Briefly, the virus was pre-incubated with each sample in an opaque 96-well white microplate (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h and then introduced into the host cells. The virus treated with DMSO was used as a control to represent 100% viral infectivity. After 48 h, viral infectivity was determined by measuring the activity of the viral reporter, luciferase, using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).Plaque reduction assayPlaque reduction assay is the current standard phenotypic method for in vitro antiviral susceptibility testing. For the antiviral activity screening, curcumin film spray was included in the reaction throughout the steps of virus replication including pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-treatment. Briefly, confluent cell monolayers were prepared in 12 well plates. Cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of the film spray samples at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. After that, the test virus at a concentration of 50 PFU/well was added into each well and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Then, the mixture was removed, and infected cells were overlaid with 1.2% Avicel in the presence of the samples as post-treatment and further incubated for 72 h. After fixing and staining with 1% crystal violet, the viral plaques were counted and percentages of inhibition at each sample concentration were calculated as compared with the untreated virus controls. Virus control (without the samples) and cell control (without samples and virus) were run in parallel. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of the film spray was determined from the dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism 10.0 Software. The concentration of film spray samples that reduces the number of viral plaques by 50% in comparison to untreated virus control is EC50. The selectivity index (SI), the ratio between cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the test sample, was calculated as the CC50/EC50 ratio.Cell culture conditionsVero cells and MDCK cellsThe Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CCL-81) and MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells (from ATCC,CCL-34) were grown in EMEM (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, NY, USA), 5% sodium bicarbonate, L-glutamine (Hyclone, South Logan, UT, USA), penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, NY, USA), and amphotericin B (Gibco, NY, USA) in humidified conditions (37 °C, with 5% CO2).Oral keratinocyte cell lineThe oral keratinocyte (OKC) cell line was provided by the Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. The cells were cultured as previously described [25]. Briefly, the cell line was grown in Defined Keratinocyte Serum Free Media (Gibco, NY, USA), supplemented with Keratinocyte Growth factors (Gibco, NY, USA) and 100 U/ml antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, NY, USA). The cells were incubated at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until reaching 80% confluence, trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, NY, USA) and the enzyme activity was inactivated with 10% FBS (Gibco, NY, USA) in 1x PBS. Cell viability was examined using 0.4% trypan blue (Gibco, NY, USA) staining with a light microscope.Human nasal septum epithelial cell lineThe human nasal septum epithelial cell line (RPMI 2650, ATCC: CCL-30, MD, USA) was cultured in EMEM (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, NY, USA), and 100 U/ml of penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, NY, USA). Cells were incubated at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 incubator and the media was changed every 2 days. They were harvested by gentle rocking, followed by the addition of fresh culture medium to create a new single cell suspension for further incubation.Cytotoxicity assayThe HEK293-hACE2 cells used in the pseudotyped virus entry assay were tested for cytotoxicity of the curcumin film spray samples. Briefly, the cells were seeded (4 × 105 cells/ml) in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37ºC in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells were treated with samples at different concentrations for 48 h. Cells without a sample (DMSO-treated) served as a negative control (100% cell viability). Viability of the treated cells was measured by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent (Dojindo, Rockville, MD, USA) using Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).Both Vero and MDCK cells were tested for cytotoxicity of the curcumin film spray samples with an MTS-based cytotoxicity assay using CellTiter 96®AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, WI, USA). Briefly, monolayer cells in 96-well plates were treated with serial 2-fold dilutions of the film spray starting from 100 to 0.1 µg/ml in quadruplicate wells. Cells without treatment served as mock control. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 72 h, then MTS solution was added into each well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 h. Cell viability after treatment was determined by measuring the optical density (OD) of the formazan product in each reaction well at a wavelength of 490 nm. The percentage of viable cells from each concentration of drug treatment was calculated by comparing it with the untreated control cells and determined for the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) from the dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism 10.0 Software.Oral and nasal keratinocytes (1 × 105 cells/well) were tested for cytotoxicity of the curcumin film spray samples. The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37ºC in 5% CO2 for 24 h. After incubation, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 µg/ml of the film spray were added into the culture plates of the cells. Cells without sample served as a negative control. After 24 h incubation, methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay was performed to evaluate cell activity, as previously described (Promsong et al., 2015). In brief, the cells were treated with 80 µl of fresh media along with 20 µl of MTT solution and incubated at 37ºC under 5% CO2 for 4 h. Afterwards, media containing MTT were removed and 100 µl of DMSO were added. The absorbance was determined by a microplate reader (Biohit 830, Helsinki, Finland) at a wavelength of 570 nm. The percentage of cell proliferation was calculated and compared to a negative control.Assessment of antimicrobial peptidesEffects of the film spray containing curcumin on mucosal innate immunity were determined by measuring levels of antimicrobial peptides, including LL-37, HD-5, and human β defensin 2 (hBD-2) in supernatant of the oral and nasal keratinocyte cell culture by ELISA kits (MyBioSource, CA, USA). Experiments were performed in duplicate, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These kits are an antibody sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Each 96-well microplate was pre-coated with an antibody specific to the target peptide. Standards or samples were added to the plate wells and combined with a biotin-conjugated specific antibody. Then avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added to each plate well and incubated. After free components were washed away, substrate solution was added to each well. Enzyme-substrate reaction presented blue color development, which was terminated by addition of stop solution. After which, the color turned yellow. Finally, the color intensity was measured at 450 nm for test wavelength and 630 nm for reference wavelength (CLARIOstarPlus, BMG LABTECH GmbH, Germany). The quantity of target analyte in the sample was positively correlated by comparison with the standard curve.Determination of the effects of the film spray on inflammatory cytokinesCytokine levels were determined using a multiplexed bead immunoassay. The cell supernatant sample was analyzed for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ using a commercially available high-sensitivity human cytokine panel (Milliplex Map Kit; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) within a Luminex analyzer. Briefly, 25 µl of standards, quality controls and samples are added to the plate in duplicate. This was followed by 25 µl of magnetic beads. The plate was sealed, covered with foil, and incubated overnight on a plate shaker at 4 °C. The plate was washed three times and 25 µl of detection antibody was added to each well. After incubating the plate at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, 25 µl of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) was added, per well. The plate was resealed and incubated for an additional 30 min at RT. The plate underwent a final series of washes before 150 µl of drive fluid was added. The concentrations of markers were measured on a Luminex® MAGPIX® instrument with Belysa® Immunoassay Curve Fitting Software (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Quality control values for each marker were consistently within the range indicated by the manufacturer.Statistical analysisThe results from SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus infection assay and ELISA of antimicrobial peptides were recorded as mean ± SD of singlicate or duplicate cultures. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism Software 9.5.0 (GraphPad Software, California, USA) and t-test to compare between the groups, respectively.ResultsPhysical properties of the formulationThe most common delivery method for treating oral and nasal infection is via oromucosalasal film spray delivery. As curcumin has very poor water solubility, the ethanol and polyethylene glycol were used as cosolvents in the formulation system, and polyvinylpyrrolidone was used as mucoadhesive agent. EDTA was the chelating agent and sodium benzoate was used as a preservative. The flavoring agents were xylitol and menthol. The curcumin film spray was translucent yellow solution. There were no changes of formulation before and after freeze thaw, indicating that the formulation is stable (Table 1). The pH was 6.38, mildly acidic, and did not change significantly after freeze thaw to pH 6.20. The droplet sizes of the spray were 190–210 μm before and after freeze thawing and were suitable for spray droplets, either in the oral or the nasal cavities. The osmolarity was observed at 295–302 mOs/L, which is close to isotonic solution (300 Os/L) indicating that is unlikely to irritate oral or nasal epithelium. The viscosity is 50 cP at shear rate 50 s− 1. It is a shear-thinning system. Overall, there were no properties changes after freeze thawing, indicating that the formulation is stable.Table 1 Physical properties of curcumin film spray (mean ± SD, n = 3)Full size tableEffects of curcumin compound on cell viability and viral infectivityThe cytotoxicity of the curcumin compound on HEK293-hACE2 cells was determined by the CCK-8 assay. The effect of the compound on spike-ACE2 mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated using the surrogate assay system with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus and HEK293-hACE-2 cells expressing human TMPRSS-2. The results showed that curcumin at 6.25 µg/ml can inhibit the pseudovirus while maintaining cell viability (Fig. 1a). Additionally, the compound inhibited the pseudovirus with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of 9.18 µg/ml and a half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value of 11.25 µg/ml, resulting in a selectivity index of 1.23 (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1Infectivity and cytotoxicity of the curcumin compound at various concentrations. (a) The SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus was treated with the compound at 37 °C for 1 h and infected into HEK293-hACE2 cells expressing TMPRSS-2. The virus treated with DMSO served as the control. After 48 h of incubation, viral infectivity was determined by measuring the activity of the luciferase reporter using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System. The cytotoxicity of the compound was determined by the viability of treated cells without infection using the CCK-8 assay. The relative mean values ± SD (%DMSO) from 3–4 independent experiments (each performed in duplicate) are shown. (b) Data from (a) were fitted into dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism software, and the estimated CC50, EC50, and selectivity index are shownFull size imageEffects of curcumin film spray on cell viability and viral infectivityThe effect of the film spray formulation on spike-ACE2 mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated using the surrogate assay system with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus and HEK293-hACE-2 cells expressing human TMPRSS-2, as mentioned earlier. The results showed that the spray, at a concentration of 10 µg/ml, can inhibit the pseudovirus while maintaining cell viability (Fig. 2). The estimated EC50 and CC50 values of the spray were 7.74 µg/ml and 12.97 µg/ml, respectively, resulting in a selectivity index of 1.68.Fig. 2Infectivity and cytotoxicity of the curcumin film spray. (a) The SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus was treated with the sample at 37 °C for 1 h and infected into HEK293-hACE2 cells expressing TMPRSS-2. The virus treated with the solvent (base) served as the control. After 48 h of incubation, viral infectivity was determined by measuring the activity of the luciferase reporter using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System. The cytotoxicity of the sample was determined by the viability of treated cells without infection using the CCK-8 assay. The relative mean values ± SD (%DMSO) from 2 independent experiments (each performed in duplicate) are shown. (b) Data from (a) were fitted into dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism software, and the estimated CC50, EC50, and selectivity index are shownFull size imageCytotoxicity of the film spray on MDCK and Vero cells was also assessed using an MTS-based cytotoxicity assay. After 72 h of incubation, the percentage of viable cells from each concentration of drug treatment was determined for the CC50 of the curcumin film spray. Percentages of Vero and MDCK cell viability after treatment with the samples are shown in Fig. 3. The CC50 of the film spray at 14.56 and 12.88 µg/ml were found toward Vero and MDCK cells, respectively. Cell viability > 50% was detected at film spray concentrations < 12.5 µg/ml for both cell types. Therefore, the concentration of the film spray at 12.5 µg/ml was used as the maximum concentration for determining the antiviral activity.Fig. 3Cytotoxicity of curcumin film spray to Vero and MDCK cells. Vero cells (a) or MDCK cells (b) were treated with varying concentrations of the curcumin film spray for 72 h. Subsequently, cytotoxicity was determined by measuring viability of the treated cells using the CellTiter 96AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kitFull size imageAntiviral activity of the curcumin film spray by plaque reduction assayThe antiviral activity of the film spray against SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B was assessed in vitro by plaque reduction assay, and EC50 values for each virus were examined. Dose-response curves for the antiviral activities of the film spray samples against all 4 viruses are shown in Fig. 4. The EC50 and SI values for each virus are shown in Table 2. Results obtained among the 4 viruses revealed that curcumin film spray demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2; with the lowest EC50 of 3.15 µg/ml (Fig. 4), and highest SI value of 4.62, followed by influenza B (EC50 = 6.32 µg/ml, SI = 2.04), and influenza A/H1N1 (EC50 = 7.24 µg/ml, SI = 1.78), respectively. On the other hand, it exhibited a slight antiviral effect against influenza A/H3N2 with the EC50 > 12.5 µg/ml, SI < 1.03 (Table 1).Fig. 4Antiviral effect of curcumin film spray against SARS-CoV-2 examined by plaque reduction assay.

The results showed that the film spray is safe at the concentration of up to 1.56 µg/ml in oral keratinocytes and 12.5 µg/ml in nasal epithelial cells, respectively (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Cytotoxicity of the curcumin film spray on oral keratinocytes (a), and nasal epithelial cells (b) by MTT assay. The film spray is safe at concentrations of up to 1.56 µg/ml in oral keratinocytes and 12.5 µg/ml in nasal epithelial cells, respectivelyFull size imageEffects of the film spray on mucosal innate immunityOral and nasal innate immune markers, in response to the film spray containing curcumin, were determined by ELISA. The results showed that while the secretion of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and HD-5 by oral keratinocytes was significantly induced at both 24 and 48 h exposures, no upregulation of LL-37 by nasal epithelial cells was detected at those time points (Fig. 6a–d). The secretion of hBD-2 protein by oral keratinocytes was significantly decreased at both time points, but no changes were detected in nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 6e, f).Fig. 6Effects of the curcumin film spray formulation on oral and nasal mucosal innate immunity measured by the level of LL-37 (a, b), HD-5 (c, d), and hBD-2 (e, f) proteins produced by oral keratinocytes and nasal epithelial cells. The spray enhanced the production of LL-37 and HD-5 by oral keratinocytes greater than that of the controls, whereas such effects were not found in nasal epithelial cells. P-value was presented as *<0.05 versus untreated controlFull size imageEffects of the film spray on inflammatory cytokinesEffects of the film spray on inflammatory cytokines were determined by a multiplexed bead immunoassay. The results showed that the film spray containing curcumin upregulated the production of IL-6 and TNF-α by oral keratinocytes, but not nasal epithelial cells. No extraordinary effects on IL-1β, IL10, and IFN-γ were detected (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Amount of various cytokines produced by oral keratinocyte and nasal epithelial cells in response to oro-nasal film spray containing curcumin measured by a commercial Milliplex Map Kit; IL-1β (a, b), IL-6 (c, d), IL-10 (e, f), TNF-α (g, h), IFN-γ (i, j). The spray enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α produced by oral keratinocytes greater than that of the controls, whereas such effects were not found in nasal epithelial cells. No significant changes in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed. P-value was presented as *<0.05 versus untreated controlFull size imageDiscussionThis study demonstrated that curcumin has versatile pharmacological properties including antiviral, immunomodulating, and anti-inflammatory activities. Formulation of the oro-nasal film spray containing curcumin showed potent antiviral activity against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection, without cytotoxicity at therapeutic doses. The film spray also modulated mucosal innate immunity by upregulating the production of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and HD-5, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 produced by oral keratinocytes. Effects of the curcumin film spray are summarized in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Various actions of the curcumin film spray. Formulation of curcumin film spray shows various actions on prevention of COVID-19; First, it can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting ACE-2 binding. Second, the film spray upregulates the production of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and HD-5 produced by oral epithelial cells, which have been previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in silico. Third, the film spray induced the production of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α produced by oral epithelial cells. In addition, the film spray inhibits influenza virus infection.The infographic was designed by BioRender.com (https://app.biorender.com)Full size imageThis study showed that curcumin compound can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in vitro. The film spray containing curcumin can prevent viral infection at the entry step of virus replication with EC50 of 7.74 µg/ml. Moreover, antiviral activity from the plaque reduction assay in which curcumin presented throughout steps of viral replication demonstrated that the curcumin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication at the EC50 of 3.15 µg/ml. According to the inhibition at the entry step by SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus infection assay, EC50 value was two-fold higher than the plaque reduction assay. These might indicate that curcumin film spray can also inhibit the other steps of in vitro replication. In addition to inhibiting COVID-19, the film spray containing curcumin can inhibit both influenza A and B viruses with similar EC50 values of 7.24 and 6.32 µg/ml for A/H1N1 and B viruses, respectively. This study demonstrated that curcumin film spray had stronger antivirus activity against SARS-CoV-2 than influenza viruses. The film spray showed low potential antiviral effect on influenza A/H3N2 virus with an EC50 of > 12.5 µg/ml.The findings of this study revealed that curcumin has pharmacological potential in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and flu. However, curcumin’s therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action against the virus have not been clearly established. Previous studies reported that curcumin inhibits the progression of inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19, through different mechanisms [26, 27]. Another study reported that curcumin inhibits influenza infection by interfering with multiple cellular signaling pathways [28]. A study by Dai et al. [29] showed that curcumin can inhibit eight strains of IVA by direct inhibition of viral replication in the adsorption stage. It has been shown that curcumin could suppress adsorption and replication of the virus through Nrf2 pathway to suppress the NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines [29]. Due to its broad pharmacological properties, curcumin has been proposed to replace current influenza therapies [30].It is recognized that antimicrobial peptides possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities along with other biological functions. In humans, there are two kinds of antimicrobial peptides: defensin and cathelicidin family peptides. Defensin family peptide has many members, including HD-5 and hBD2 [31]. Defensins and LL-37 disrupt microbial membranes, leading to pore formation and lysis [17].LL-37 plays an essential role in protecting humans against infectious diseases by modulating immune cells and regulating the secretion of inflammatory effector molecules [17]. LL-37 has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry via a dual mechanism [19]. A recent study demonstrated that LL-37 can be used along with inactivating HSV-1 as a therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 [32]. Another study found that LL-37 attaches to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [33]. LL-37 also shows protective effects during IVA infection [34]. Previous studies demonstrated that LL-37 plays a crucial role in host defense against IVA infection through direct antiviral effects and modulating inflammatory responses to infection [34, 35]. Besides its direct antimicrobial activities against the virus, LL-37 also has important immunomodulatory effects on neutrophil H2O2 responses to influenza virus [34]. The upregulation of LL-37 by the curcumin film spray may further enhance its action against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection.HD-5, an α-defensin released from Paneth cells in the small intestine, has been reported to block SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions from entering enterocytes [18]. These may represent innate protection of intestinal cells against viral infection. In the present study, the upregulation of HD-5 by the oral keratinocytes, in response to the film spray, was demonstrated. These properties may further enhance the antiviral activity of the spray against the virus infection.Human β-defensins (hBDs), produced by epithelial cells either constitutively or in response to inflammatory stimuli, have been shown to inhibit IVA [36,37,38]. In addition, a study by Zhang et al. [39] demonstrated that hBD-2 inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into ACE-2-expressing HEK 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 2.8 µM. However, in our study, while no changes were observed in the nasal epithelial cell culture, reduced production of hBD-2 by the oral keratinocyte cell culture was noted in response to the film spray. This may indicate that different sites of epithelial cells lining the mucosa differentially express innate immunity.In the present study, the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α produced by oral epithelial cells in response to the film spray was detected, while no changes were found in nasal epithelial cells. It has been noted that IL-6, as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, plays a vital role in viral infection of the respiratory tract [40]. It has been reported that LL-37 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during influenza virus infection in vivo [34]. These multi-actions of the film spray make it a promising topical agent in preventing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection.Although curcumin has long been used in traditional Asian medicine for its anti-inflammatory and healing properties, its immunomodulatory role remains poorly understood. It has been shown that dietary supplementation with curcumin reduces pro-inflammatory biomarkers while increasing anti-inflammatory mediators [41]. Curcumin has been shown to mediate attenuation of pro-inflammatory IFN-γ, suggesting its role as an immunosuppressant [42]. Our study revealed that the film spray containing curcumin upregulated the production of IL-6 and TNF-α by oral keratinocytes, but not by nasal epithelial cells. No profound effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-10 and IFN-γ were detected. Thus, it is possible that curcumin may act as a double-edged sword on anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines [43]. Alternatively, it is possible that the effects of the film spray may depend on concentration of curcumin, time of exposure and types of the cells.The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is highly complex, and the mechanisms for how SARS-CoV-2 modulates different systems in the host remain unknown. This heterogenicity may require a compound that has several action potentials. In this regard, a natural compound like curcumin seems to be a promising candidate in the adjuvant treatment of COVID-19, due to its various mechanisms of actions. Resistance to drugs currently used in treatment of influenza virus infection has caused great concern. Consequently, developing new antiviral treatment for this virus is needed. In general, deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 and IVA infection result from acute lung injury, systemic inflammation, or bacterial superinfection. Searching for compounds with antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammation effects would be beneficial. Because of this need, curcumin is a candidate with enormous potential for the treatment of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that curcumin oro-nasal film spray possesses antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. In addition to antiviral activity, the film spray enhanced the production of LL-37 and HD-5, the two antimicrobial peptides previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and IVA infection in silico [19, 34, 35]. These findings indicate that the film spray has potential for preventing both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections. Furthermore, the film spray modulated the expression of inflammatory cytokine. The infection by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses can induce severe systemic illness through the inflammation induced by the viruses. Thus, the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines by the film spray emphasizes that it can serve not only as an antiviral but can also dampen inflammatory injury induced by the viruses. These mechanisms of actions by the film spray may be powerful enough to inhibit the viral entry into the host cell, prevent lung injury, and reduce the severity of the disease.The limitation of this study is that it was performed only in vitro. Further studies should be carried out in an animal model and in clinical trials to confirm the findings. Future studies should also focus on mechanisms involved in inhibition of viral infection by the film spray. Antiviral tests against intact viruses, investigation of mucosal innate immunity, and anti-inflammatory activity in the infected/film spray treated cells should be performed to better understand efficacy of the firm spray. Other antimicrobial peptides produced by oral keratinocytes and nasal epithelial cells in response to the film spray should be further determined. These may lead to finding powerful therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection.

NIAID/Flickr cc Activity increased in Europe and Central Asia, along with sharp rises in hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions. Flu activity also rose in parts of North Africa, except in Egypt. Central America and the Caribbean also reported further rises in flu detections. Illness activity remained elevated in North America, mainly due to the 2009 H1N1 strain. Though flu activity remained elevated in East Asia, activity showed an overall decline owing to decreased detections in China and South Korea. Hong Kong and Mongolia, however, reported increasing trends. Southeast Asia's flu activity is still elevated, mainly due to the H3N2 strain. Flu activity declined on the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in South Asia. Elsewhere, detections declined in South America's tropical regions, except for Colombia and French Guiana. Little flu activity was reported in South America's temperate countries, except for Chile. Of respiratory samples that tested positive for flu at national flu labs during the reporting period, 84.2% were influenza A. And of subtyped influenza A viruses, 73% were H3N2. CDC alerts healthcare providers about measles cases News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today urged healthcare providers to be alert for patients who have fever and rashes and have traveled abroad, following reports of 23 measles cases since December 1, 2023. Dave Haygarth / Flickr cc "The increased number of measles importations seen in recent weeks is reflective of a rise in global measles cases and a growing global threat from the disease," the CDC said in an email. Clusters in Philadelphia, Washington state Of the 23 cases, 7 were imported cases in international travelers. Also, there have been two outbreaks of more than 5 cases each. One is an outbreak in Philadelphia that led to infections at a hospital and a daycare facility. The other appears to be a family cluster of six cases in Washington's Clark and Wahkiakum counties in the southwestern part of the state. In other recent developments, Virginia officials warned of measles exposures at two international airports, New Jersey confirmed a case in Camden County, and Georgia reported a case in Cobb County involving an unvaccinated resident of the metro Atlanta area who had recently traveled outside the country. In its email alert to clinicians, the CDC said most of the cases involve young children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine, even though they were eligible. Antibiotics and reflux drugs, when combined, linked to increased C diff risk News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile CDC / Jennifer Oosthuizen A population-based study in Sweden found that recent use of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)—drugs often used to relieve acid reflux—was associated with increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), particularly when used in combination, researchers reported yesterday in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. While the use of antibiotics and PPIs have each been independently associated with increased risk of CDI in several studies, few studies have investigated the potential effects on CDI risk when used in combination. To do so, a team led by researchers at Sweden's Karolinska Institutet compared all 43,152 CDI patients diagnosed in Sweden from 2006 through 2019 with 355,172 matched population controls without CDI, assessing the impact of recent (0 to 30 days) and preceding (31 to 180 days) use of antibiotics and PPI on CDI and recurrent CDI risk. Higher risk for recent use Overall, 63% and 39% of patients with CDI were at some point exposed to antibiotics and PPIs before infection, respectively, compared with 16% and 14% of controls. When recently exposed to both, the odds for CDI were 17.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.48 to 17.53) higher than among those not exposed, while the odds ratio [OR] was 15.37 (95% CI, 14.83 to 15.93) for antibiotics alone and 2.65 (95% CI, 2.54 to 276) for PPI alone. The effect of preceding use was less pronounced, with an OR of 9.13 (95% CI, 8.71 to 9.57) for combined use, 5.42 (95% CI, 5.26 to 5.57) for antibiotics alone, and 2.08 (95% CI, 2.01 to 2.15) for PPI alone. While recent antibiotic use resulted in slightly higher odds of recurrent CDI (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.38), recent PPI use was not associated with CDI recurrence (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.12), and the combined effect was no different than the effect of antibiotics alone. Recent macrolides/lincosamides/streptogramins, other antibacterials including nitroimidazole derivates, non-penicillin beta lactams, and quinolones showed the strongest association with CDI risk and recurrence, particularly for recent use. "Our findings stress the need to reconsider the risk-benefit of both antibiotics and PPIs, which are both still over-prescribed," the study authors wrote. Childhood obesity rates soared in UK during COVID-19 News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Xavier Donat / Flickr cc Yesterday in PLOS One researchers from the University of Southampton showed that obesity rates for British preschoolers in 2020 and 2021 skyrocketed more than 45% compared to 2019 and 2020. The authors said this is the largest single-year increase in overweight and obesity prevalence in recent UK history, and will result in an additional £800 million ($1 billion US) in healthcare costs for now-overweight children who will likely suffer chronic diseases. The study was based on publicly available annual body mass index (BMI) data from 2006 through 2022. Two age-groups were studied, kids ages 4 to 6 years old and 10 to 11. Obesity prevalence among children ages 4 to 5 years increased by 45% during the first year of the pandemic; from 9.9% in 2019 to 2020 to 14.4% in 2020 to 2021. The prevalence then decreased to 10.1% in 2021 and 2022, returning to the pre-pandemic trend, the authors said. Lower-income kids more likely to be obese While weight for children ages 4 and 5 rebounded to healthy BMIs by 2022, obesity in children ages 10 to 11 persisted and was 4 percentage points higher than expected, representing almost 56,000 additional children who were now clinically overweight. Children in both age-groups who were from low-income homes were more likely to have higher BMI. There was no difference, however, among BMI rates across different ethnic groups. "The sharp increase in childhood obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the profound impacts on children’s development," said Keith Godfrey, PhD, a co-author of the study, in a PLOS press release. "Alongside the escalating costs of the ongoing epidemic of childhood obesity, it is clear that more radical new policy measures are required to reduce obesity and secure wellbeing and prosperity for the country as a whole Closing toilet lid before flushing doesn't keep viral spray inside, study suggests News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 Heather Durdil / Flickr cc Contrary to previous study findings, closing the toilet lid before flushing doesn't stop aerosolized viruses from contaminating bathroom surfaces, scientists from the University of Arizona and Reckitt Benckiser LLC, the company that makes the disinfectant used in the study, report in the American Journal of Infection Control. The researchers added a bacteriophage (virus that targets and kills bacteria) to household and public toilet bowls as a proxy for human intestinal viruses. After they flushed the toilets (with the lid open or closed in case of the household toilets), they measured viral contamination of the toilet and bathroom floor and walls. "Research has demonstrated that people with COVID-19, even those who are asymptomatic, excrete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal matter and other excretions," the researchers wrote. "Viruses contaminating urine and feces can be aerosolized in building restrooms during toilet flushing." The resulting toilet aerosol plumes, they said, can land on surfaces more than 5 feet away. Bowl disinfection slashed contamination The amount of virus collected from surfaces on the household toilet or floor wasn't significantly different whether the lid was open or closed. The toilet seat had the most contamination, while walls had little. Comparable contamination patterns were noted with the public toilet. With results showing that closing toilet lids has no meaningful impact on preventing the spread of viral particles, our study highlights the importance of regular disinfection of toilets to reduce contamination and prevent the spread of viruses. Brushing the toilet bowl with Lysol Power Toilet Bowl Cleaner reduced contamination of bowl water (vs no disinfectant) by over 99%. Contamination of the bowl brush was 98% lower when Lysol was used. Adding Lysol to the bowl before flushing or using disinfectant dispensers in the tank helped lessen flushing-related contamination. In a news release from the Association for Professionals in Infection Control, publisher of the journal, senior author Charles Gerba, PhD, of the University of Arizona, said the results are important for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings. "With results showing that closing toilet lids has no meaningful impact on preventing the spread of viral particles, our study highlights the importance of regular disinfection of toilets to reduce contamination and prevent the spread of viruses," he said. The study was funded by a grant to the University of Arizona from Reckitt Benckiser. Quick takes: Genomic surveillance partnership, infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship, more avian flu in US News brief Lisa SchnirringChris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Healthcare-Associated Infections Pandemic Influenza The United Kingdom–based Wellcome Sanger Institute Genomic Surveillance Unit (GSU) and South Africa's Stellenbosch University Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI) today announced a new partnership to coordinate global genomic surveillance of infectious diseases. In a statement, Tulio de Oliveira, PhD, who founded and leads CERI and led the group's work that identified the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant, will also join GSU as its deputy director. "Between our two teams, we can share complementary facilities and work together on many diseases: from those carried by mosquitoes or floodwaters, to respiratory viruses with pandemic potential," he said. de Oliveira praised the two groups' staff and their ability to attract support from funders and governments. "We are in a good position now to respond effectively to epidemics in our own regions, and support genomic surveillance across the world." The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) announced today that it will award $1.29 million to 17 public health departments in 11 states to boost healthcare infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship efforts. The selected local health departments will use the funding to conduct infection control assessments, strengthen antimicrobial stewardship programs, and build strategic approaches to reducing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)—including those caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 31 patients are infected with at least one HAI during a hospital stay, and several of the leading antibiotic-resistant threats are associated with healthcare settings. Four states—California, Kansas, South Carolina, and South Dakota—have reported more avian flu outbreaks in poultry flocks over the past few days, three of them reporting the virus on commercial farms, according to the latest updates from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). California's outbreak involves a layer pullet farm in Merced County that houses more than 285,000 birds. Kansas reported an event at a gamebird producer in Mitchell County that has 5,800 birds. The virus also struck a gamebird producer in South Dakota, a facility in Mitchell County that has 21,000 birds. In South Carolina, outbreaks involving backyard birds were reported in Horry and Orangeburg counties. The pace of outbreaks appears to have slowed, compared to rapid increases that occurred October through December.

Home / What to Do If You Think You’ve Got the FluWest Tennessee Medical GroupWhat to Do If You Think You’ve Got the Flu January 22, 2024If you’ve ever had the flu, you’re all too familiar with its icky symptoms…body aches, chills, and the general feeling of being under the weather. What should you do when those symptoms strike?Each year, millions of Americans are diagnosed with the flu–a viral infection caused by influenza. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the flu resulted in between 9.4 million and 41 million illnesses each year between 2010 and 2022.While you may not think of the flu as being a serious illness, it definitely can be, particularly for older adults and those with diminished immune systems. In that same period between 2010 and 2022, as many as 710,000 hospitalizations occurred and as many as 52,000 deaths were caused by the flu.Because the flu can cause mild to severe illness, it’s important to pay careful attention to your symptoms and seek medical attention if they begin to worsen. “In many cases, the flu can be treated with basic at-home care,” says Fred Sesti, ANP with West Tennessee Medical Group. “But if you’re older, feeling particularly sick or at a higher risk of complications, check in with your provider, who may prescribe an antiviral to lessen the duration and intensity of your infection.”Defining “the Flu” The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. Each year, different strains of influenza are prevalent, and you can be infected by any of the strains.The influenza virus spreads from person to person, primarily through viral droplets. When someone who is infected with the flu coughs, sneezes, or even speaks, you can be infected if you breathe in those droplets or touch them and then touch your face. Influenza can also spread if you touch a surface or object that’s been recently touched by someone who is infected.The tricky part is that someone who has the flu is contagious one day before symptoms develop and up to seven days after symptoms develop. That means it’s easy to pass it on without realizing you’re doing so.Deciphering Flu Symptoms Symptoms related to the flu often pop up quite quickly. If you have the flu, you may experience:Body achesCoughFatigueFeverHeadacheRunny or stuffy noseSore throatChildren who have the flu may also experience vomiting and diarrhea, but those symptoms are less common among adults.While the symptoms above have long been considered tell-tale signs of the flu, the onset of COVID-19 in 2020 made it much more difficult to know if you actually have the flu. Symptoms of COVID-19, particularly recent variants, often mirror those of the flu.The only way to definitively know if you have the flu is to be tested. A rapid influenza test can confirm whether you are infected and what strain of the flu you have.What to Do Next If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms above and your symptoms are mild, you can choose to stay home and treat those symptoms. In the past, that was the most common recommendation for treating the flu, since you can’t treat this viral infection with an antibiotic.If you’re at a high risk of complications or even simply don’t want to feel sick, you can check in with your medical provider. If it’s confirmed that you have the flu, your provider may prescribe an antiviral, which can help lessen the duration of the flu and intensity of your symptoms.Certain symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, dehydration, or a high fever, are a sign that medical care is needed. You should also see a medical provider if your symptoms begin to worsen or linger for longer than a few days. If you choose to ride out the flu and treat your symptoms at home, get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and use over-the-counter medications to alleviate individual symptoms. A decongestant or antihistamine, for example, may be helpful in relieving congestion, while an anti-inflammatory can ease fever and aches.The CDC recommends staying at home and away from others for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone without the use of fever-reducing medications. Once you’re feeling well again, take an extra step to protect yourself from getting sick again with a different strain of the flu—if you didn’t get your flu shot already this season, go ahead and do that now.The flu shot is always your best defense against the flu, so keep yours on your annual to-do list.Think you might have the flu? A quick and easy rapid test can provide a diagnosis in minutes. Schedule an appointment today with a West Tennessee Medical Group primary care provider.Questions?

As the season is hitting or near its peak, the general public will once again need to be aware of the viruses and will want to find strategies to avoid them.Anecdotally, people are saying the current COVID-19 variant is not as significant or severe as previous strains. However, there is great variability in what the experience of being sick is depending on people’s ages, existing comorbidities, and overall health profile. So, COVID-19 can look different to different people. Whereas, a young person who is in good health may see symptoms that mirror a cold; but a middle-aged person or a senior might see more severe symptoms that feel like influenza.Still, this does not downplay the need for preventative care for everyone, especially in the form of vaccines, explained Robert H. Hopkins Jr, MD, medical director, NFID; professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics and chief, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.“For those who still haven't gotten their COVID-19 [vaccine], their influenza vaccine, and those eligible to get RSV vaccination, please do that. It is not too late,” Hopkins said. “It does take a little time for you to develop vaccine protection. But, I would encourage people to get that done because we don't have a good way of predicting, even if you've had COVID-19 or flu earlier in the season, that you're not going to get it again.”Additionally, Hopkins discusses hygiene and risk mitigation as nonspecific interventions for prevention. These are things we may be aware of in some capacity but serve as good reminders.“Washing your hands is important. Second, if you're going to be out in in crowded situations, I would encourage people to wear a mask...a mask is not perfect, but if you're wearing a mask over your nose and mouth, you're reducing the number of particulates,” stated Hopkins.He also reminds people to cough and sneeze into the sleeves of their shirts as opposed to their hands. This can prevent transmission of germs. And lastly, Hopkins talks about going out into crowds.“If you have an opportunity to get out in a crowded setting, think a little bit about what your risk tolerance is for that setting. If you're somebody that's immune compromised, if you have significant health conditions, maybe this is not the time to be going to a concert, or to a basketball game, or to a crowded event where we may be more likely to catch one of these illnesses.For those who might be vaccine averse, and do not like the idea of getting 2 vaccines at the start of every seasonal virus year, there are influenza/COVID-19 combination vaccines in development. Moderna has previously stated it was targeting a potential regulatory approval for their combination vaccine in 2025.Contagion spoke to Hopkins who offered some insights on this year’s COVID and influenza seasons, combination vaccines, and isolation considerations for those who have the flu or COVID-19.Recent VideosRelated Content What We Know But Still Have to Learn About Long COVIDSophia Abene;Isabella Ciccone, MPH;Ravindra Ganesh, MD, MBBS, FACP, Dip ABOM;Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, MD;Svetlana Blitshteyn, MD, FAANNovember 8th 2024ArticleACIP Preferentially Recommends Fluzone High-Dose Influenza Vaccine for SeniorsNina CosdonJune 23rd 2022PodcastAddressing the Diagnostic Gap in Long COVID CareSophia Abene;Isabella Ciccone, MPH;Ravindra Ganesh, MD, MBBS, FACP, Dip ABOM;Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, MD;Svetlana Blitshteyn, MD, FAANNovember 1st 2024ArticleVaccine Equality vs Equity with Dr. Jacinda Abdul-MutakabbirJohn ParkinsonFebruary 11th 2022PodcastInvivyd Reports 76% Risk Reduction in Symptomatic COVID-19 from CANOPY Trial of PemgardaSophia AbeneOctober 29th 2024ArticleAntiviral Prevents Symptomatic COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylactic StudyContagion Editorial TeamOctober 29th 2024ArticleRelated Content What We Know But Still Have to Learn About Long COVIDSophia Abene;Isabella Ciccone, MPH;Ravindra Ganesh, MD, MBBS, FACP, Dip ABOM;Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, MD;Svetlana Blitshteyn, MD, FAANNovember 8th 2024ArticleACIP Preferentially Recommends Fluzone High-Dose Influenza Vaccine for SeniorsNina CosdonJune 23rd 2022PodcastAddressing the Diagnostic Gap in Long COVID CareSophia Abene;Isabella Ciccone, MPH;Ravindra Ganesh, MD, MBBS, FACP, Dip ABOM;Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, MD;Svetlana Blitshteyn, MD, FAANNovember 1st 2024ArticleVaccine Equality vs Equity with Dr. Jacinda Abdul-MutakabbirJohn ParkinsonFebruary 11th 2022PodcastInvivyd Reports 76% Risk Reduction in Symptomatic COVID-19 from CANOPY Trial of PemgardaSophia AbeneOctober 29th 2024ArticleAntiviral Prevents Symptomatic COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylactic StudyContagion Editorial TeamOctober 29th 2024Article Latest IssueContagion, Fall 2024 Digital EditionAbout UsAdvertiseEditorialContact UsDo Not Sell My InformationPrivacyTerms & ConditionsContact Info2 Commerce Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2024 MJH Life Sciences All rights reserved.Avian flu is devastating poultry farms, egg production in California | AP News Menu Menu World U.S. Election 2024 Politics Sports Entertainment Business Science Fact Check Oddities Be Well Newsletters Photography AP Investigations Climate Health Tech Lifestyle Religion Español AP Buyline Personal Finance AP Buyline Shopping Press Releases My Account ...

(AP) — Last month, Mike Weber got the news every poultry farmer fears: His chickens tested positive for avian flu.Following government rules, Weber’s company, Sunrise Farms, had to slaughter its entire flock of egg-laying hens — 550,000 birds — to prevent the disease from infecting other farms in Sonoma County north of San Francisco.“It’s a trauma. We’re all going through grief as a result of it,” said Weber, standing in an empty hen house. “Petaluma is known as the Egg Basket of the World. It’s devastating to see that egg basket go up in flames.”A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of outbreaks that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest.

During the past two months, nearly a dozen commercial farms have had to destroy more than 1 million birds to control the outbreak, dealing an economic blow to farmers, workers and their customers. Merced County in Central California also has been hit hard, with outbreaks at several large commercial egg-producing farms in recent weeks.Experts say bird flu is spread by ducks, geese and other migratory birds. The waterfowl can carry the virus without getting sick and easily spread it through their droppings to chicken and turkey farms and backyard flocks through droppings and nasal discharges. California poultry farms are implementing strict biosecurity measures to curb the spread of the disease. State Veterinarian Annette Jones urged farmers to keep their flocks indoors until June, including organic chickens that are required to have outdoor access.

(AP Photo/Terry Chea) “We still have migration going for another couple of months. So we’ve got to be as vigilant as possible to protect our birds,” said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation. The loss of local hens led to a spike in egg prices in the San Francisco Bay Area over the holidays before supermarkets and restaurants found suppliers from outside the region.While bird flu has been around for decades, the current outbreak of the virus that began in early 2022 has prompted officials to slaughter nearly 82 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens, in 47 U.S. states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever the disease is found the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the spread of the virus. The price of a dozen eggs more than doubled to $4.82 at its peak in January 2023. Egg prices returned to their normal range as egg producers built up their flocks and outbreaks were controlled. Turkey and chicken prices also spiked, partly due to the virus.

(AP Photo/Terry Chea) “I think this is an existential issue for the commercial poultry industry. The virus is on every continent, except for Australia at this point,” said Maurice Pitesky, a poultry expert at the University of California, Davis.Climate change is increasing the risk of outbreaks as changing weather patterns disrupt the migratory patterns of wild birds, Pitesky said. For example, exceptional rainfall last year created new waterfowl habitat throughout California, including areas close to poultry farms. In California, the outbreak has impacted more than 7 million chickens in about 40 commercial flocks and 24 backyard flocks, with most of the outbreaks occurring over the past two months on the North Coast and Central Valley, according to the USDA.Industry officials are worried about the growing number of backyard chickens that could become infected and spread avian flu to commercial farms.

And if you expose your birds to these wild birds, they might get infected and ill,” said Rodrigo Gallardo, a UC Davis researcher who studies avian influenza.Gallardo advises the owners of backyard chickens to wear clean clothes and shoes to protect their flocks from getting infected. If an unusual number of chickens die, they should be tested for avian flu. Ettamarie Peterson, a retired teacher in Petaluma, has a flock of about 50 chickens that produce eggs she sells from her backyard barn for 50 cents each.“I’m very concerned because this avian flu is transmitted by wild birds, and there’s no way I can stop the wild birds from coming through and leaving the disease behind,” Peterson said. “If your flock has any cases of it, you have to destroy the whole flock.” A grocery store employee stocks cartons of eggs for display at a Petaluma Market in Sonoma County, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, where avian flu infections shut down a cluster of egg farms in recent months. (AP Photo/Terry Chea) Sunrise Farms, which was started by Weber’s great-grandparents more than a century ago, was infected despite putting in place strict biosecurity measures to protect the flock.“The virus got to the birds so bad and so quickly you walked in and the birds were just dead,” Weber said. “Heartbreaking doesn’t describe how you feel when you walk in and perfectly healthy young birds have been just laid out.” After euthanizing more than half a million chickens at Sunrise Farms, Weber and his employees spent the Christmas holiday discarding the carcasses. Since then, they’ve been cleaning out and disinfecting the hen houses.Weber hopes the farm will get approval from federal regulators to bring chicks back to the farm this spring. Then it would take another five months before the hens are mature enough to lay eggs.He feels lucky that two farms his company co-owns have not been infected and are still producing eggs for his customers. But recovering from the outbreak won’t be easy.“We have a long road ahead,” Weber said. “We’re going to make another run of it and try to keep this family of employees together because they’ve worked so hard to build this into the company that it is.” The Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

The flu typically spreads from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes and emits respiratory droplets. You catch the flu if you inhale those droplets, usually if you are standing within six feet of the infected person. A droplet may hang around in the air but typically not long enough to spread and infect you. It's important to note that a stomach virus, commonly known as the "stomach flu," spreads differently than the flu. Flu viruses do not actually cause the stomach flu. A stomach virus, in contrast, can be airborne and land on surfaces where an infected person vomits. The flu is very common, infecting millions of people per year. Read on to learn if the flu is airborne, how you can catch it, and ways to prevent spreading the virus. Getty Images How Is the Flu Spread? Flu viruses primarily spread through large respiratory droplets emitted when a person sneezes or coughs. Research has also found infectious flu viral particles in "fine-aerosol samples" from exhaled breath and spontaneous coughs. More research, however, is needed to know whether airborne transmission is likely. Person to Person People typically spread respiratory viruses, including the flu, through droplets from coughing and sneezing. Simply singing, talking, or even breathing can infect someone within six feet of an infected person. Surface to Person The larger a respiratory droplet is, the quicker it's going to fall to a surface. A person has to touch the infected surface and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes to become infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that the flu is less likely to spread from surface to person than person to person. Can the Flu Be Spread Through the Air? The flu can be airborne since respiratory droplets spread through the air, but they do not fit certain definitions of airborne. Some experts do not consider the flu airborne, for example, since the viruses cannot necessarily hang in the air for hours. The smaller a droplet is, the longer it can linger in the air and infect people that way. Small droplets do not quite make it to the ground as fast and can evaporate more quickly than larger ones. As a result, the respiratory secretions' droplet nuclei (smaller particles reduced by evaporation) become exposed. The droplet nuclei can "remain suspended in the air for several hours and are carried by air currents for a distance greater than six feet," Sherif Mossad, MD, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, told Health. Some evidence suggests the flu can spread in larger-scale superspreader events, similar to COVID-19. Viruses "act more airborne," and "smaller droplets [that] linger longer, travel further," in those cases, Jennifer Lighter, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue, told Health. How Talking Spreads COVID-19 When Are People With Flu Contagious? People with the flu are contagious one day before symptoms appear, meaning you can spread the virus before you know you have it. You'll likely be contagious until five to seven days after your symptoms begin. People are most contagious during the first three to four days of their illness. It's essential to stay away from others during that time. Prevention Recommendations The flu mostly spreads through respiratory droplets. Infected people spread those droplets when they cough or sneeze near someone. You can reduce the spread of those droplets and prevent the flu by: Avoiding touching your eyes, mouth, and nose with unwashed hands Covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or the crook of your elbow when you cough and sneeze Getting an annual flu shot Not sharing personal items (e.g., cups and utensils) with others Staying home and away from others if you have flu symptoms (e.g., a fever, cough, headache, and sore throat) Washing your hands with soap and water or using hand sanitizer Wearing a high-quality mask around others A Quick Review The flu is not as likely to spread through the air as it is from person to person. Respiratory droplets spread and infect you if an infected person coughs or sneezes within six feet of you. Those droplets are typically not large enough to hang around in the air for long enough to spread. You are contagious and can spread the flu one day before your symptoms begin. It's essential to cover your coughs and sneezes, get an annual flu shot, and wash your hands regularly to avoid spreading the virus. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

The study is published in the Virology Journal. Study: A novel film spray containing curcumin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection and enhances mucosal immunity. Image Credit: alicja neumiler / Shutterstock Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is an enveloped RNA virus that primarily causes mild to severe respiratory infections. Influenza virus types A, B, and C are also RNA viruses that cause seasonal respiratory infections commonly known as flu. Infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are associated with high mortality rates. Although both viruses can affect people from all age groups, more deadly infections occur in older people and immunocompromised patients. Bioactive compounds derived from plants have gained immense attention in the medical community because of their potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. Curcumin is a promising plant-derived compound that shows potential antiviral and immunomodulatory activities against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. In this study, scientists have developed an oro-nasal film spray containing curcumin and tested its antiviral and mucosal innate immunity-boosting activities against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Various actions of the curcumin film spray. Formulation of curcumin film spray shows various actions on prevention of COVID-19; First, it can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting ACE-2 binding. Second, the film spray upregulates the production of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and HD-5 produced by oral epithelial cells, which have been previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in silico. Third, the film spray induced the production of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α produced by oral epithelial cells. In addition, the film spray inhibits influenza virus infection.The infographic was designed by BioRender.com (https://app.biorender.com) Study design The antiviral activity of oro-nasal film spray containing 10 µg/ml of curcumin was tested against SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B by plaque reduction assay. Different cytotoxicity assays were conducted to determine the viability of oral keratinocytes, nasal epithelial cells, and other tested cell lines in response to the film spray. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to determine the levels of oral and nasal innate immune markers (LL-37, HD-5, and human β defensin 2) in response to the film spray. Moreover, the levels of pro-inflammatory markers (interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon) were also determined.

Each concentration of the film spray was performed in triplicate wells Important observations The fundamental physical properties of the curcumin formulation, including color, pH, droplet size, osmolarity, and viscosity, were tested in the study. The findings showed no alteration in properties after freeze-thawing, indicating the stability of the formulation. Regarding the cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of curcumin, the study found that the compound is capable of inhibiting viral infection at 6.25 µg/ml concentration by blocking the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human cell membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At the tested concentration, no cytotoxic effect of curcumin compound was observed. Similar to the curcumin compound, curcumin-containing film spray showed significant efficacy in inhibiting viral infection at 10 µg/ml concentration without affecting cell viability. The selectivity index of curcumin compound and curcumin-containing film spray was estimated to be 1.23 and 1.68, respectively. The selectivity index defines the window between cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. The higher the index value, the more effective and safer a drug would be during an in vivo treatment for a given viral infection. Regarding antiviral activities against all tested viruses, the study found that curcumin film spray has the highest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, followed by influenza B virus and influenza A/H1N1 virus. However, the spray showed only a slight inhibitory activity against influenza A/H3N2 virus. Effect of curcumin film spray on mucosal innate immunity The estimation of oral and nasal innate immunity markers revealed that curcumin film spray could significantly induce the secretion of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and HD-5 and reduce the secretion of hBD-2 protein by oral keratinocytes. However, no upregulated secretion of antimicrobial peptides from nasal epithelial cells was detected in response to the curcumin spray. Regarding inflammatory cytokines, oral keratinocytes produced an upregulated amount of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to curcumin film spray. However, nasal epithelial cells did not experience such an effect. Study significance The study describes the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of a novel curcumin-containing oro-nasal film spray. The spray exhibits significant inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses without inducing cytotoxicity at therapeutic doses. The spray is also capable of inducing the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and anti-inflammatory mediators by oral keratinocytes. Overall, the study indicates that this curcumin film spray may be effectively used to block viral entry into host cells, prevent lung injury, and reduce disease severity.

Alastair Ward January 22, 2024 5:57 pm A polar bear rests in a field on Barter Island in 2016. Polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea population are spending more time on land as sea ice diminishes, and studies indicate that they are becoming more exposed to terrestrial disease pathogens. A newly published USGS-led study calculates exposure of polar bears and other animals on the Arctic coastline to the bacterium that causes tularemia, a tick-borne disease more commonly found in Interior Alaska. (Photo by Cordell Johnson/U.S. Geological Survey) Climate change is a threat to polar bear’s survival. Now they have a new deadly challenge facing them: bird flu. It was recently confirmed that a polar bear from northern Alaska has died from the disease. The current strain of H5N1 influenza has affected a far wider range of species than any previously recorded strain. This has included several mammal species, such as foxes, otters, mink, sea lions and seals (including, for the first time, seals in Antarctica). Cases have been detected in humans, too. However, while some cases in mammals have been associated with large numbers of animal deaths, the few cases in humans have, so far, shown only mild symptoms or have been asymptomatic. So, why are there such differences between species, and what are the implications of this polar bear’s death for the wider polar bear population, as well as other large mammals and humans? Influenza viruses are highly adaptable. Their relatively simple genetic code not only changes at random via mutation in the same way as truly living organisms, but also via reassortment. This is where closely related viruses that infect the same host cell exchange genetic material to produce novel genomes. This can lead to greater adaptation for invasion, survival and replication within that host species. This is probably how the current H5N1 strain has come to affect such a variety of bird species, with devastating effects for some populations. Normally, large numbers of deaths associated with a disease are considered to be caused by the spread of a disease between individuals within the population. However, very specific genetic changes are needed for avian influenza viruses to become adapted to mammalian hosts. These changes have not yet been detected in the current strain of H5N1. Although individual-to-individual transmission cannot be ruled out for some mammalian species that have been affected by H5N1, neither can vertical transmission – the transfer of the virus via consumption. If we look at the list of mammals that have been infected by the current H5N1 strain, we see carnivores – and particularly those that are known to scavenge. Very large numbers of some seabird species have died rapidly with H5N1. The likelihood of a seal or a polar bear finding and eating at least one infected bird carcass at an arctic colony suffering an outbreak seems quite high. It is easy to imagine a pod of seals finding a colony of seabirds suffering an outbreak of H5N1 and gorging on carcasses. Under these circumstances, each seal would probably ingest and inhale massive viral loads. Those massive viral loads may have overrun the seals’ immune systems, leading to rapid infection and death without infection being passed between seals. Whether the polar bear encountered large numbers of dead seabirds, one or more seals that had become infected after eating dead seabirds or some other source of virus remains unknown. The answer may be uncovered via testing of the virus and comparison with viruses found in species that occupy the same landscape. This approach is being used to track the spread of H5N1 between wild animals and poultry in the UK. More to find out Much of this remains hypothetical – for now. The consequences of the polar bear’s death for the species’ populations and for other large mammals cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty. But if genetic testing reveals that the polar bear’s H5N1 remains poorly adapted to mammalian hosts, we might expect few other cases in polar bears. Any further cases might also be closely associated with outbreaks of H5N1 in a nearby seabird colony. It also seems likely that the list of affected mammals and their geographical distribution should continue to grow, but relatively slowly. This list is likely to continue to include only carnivores – and scavengers in particular. On the other hand, because influenza viruses are highly adaptable, ongoing surveillance of the H5N1 strain remains critically important. This will prepare us in case a new variant emerges that is adapted to mammalian hosts, potentially including humans. The consequences of H5N1 for populations of some seabirds have been devastating. The consequences of failure to respond appropriately to a mammal-adapted H5N1 could be severe for polar bears – and for us.

Its long-term effects are unclear Avian influenza has killed millions of birds and other animals By Erin Garcia de Jesús Staff Writer January 25, 2024 at 9:10 am North Seymour island’s blue-footed boobies (shown) are popular with visitors to the Galápagos Islands. Monogamous pairs lay their eggs in open, poop-covered nests on the ground. Erin Garcia de Jesús Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint As I step among poop-covered rocks toward the plateau of a small island in the Galápagos, a part of me rejoices. Not only am I about to see the archipelago’s famed blue-footed boobies for the first time, but the sight of guano everywhere, and birds to make fresh batches, serves as a reminder: The ongoing avian influenza outbreak has not yet ravaged this picturesque place. Ghostly, leafless Palo Santo trees and saltbushes sprinkle the island, surrounded by boulders in varying shades of red-tinged black and brown. White splotches of guano splattered on rocks are hard to miss against this arid landscape on North Seymour Island in November, the tail end of the dry season. The poop’s sources are similarly difficult to overlook. The island is known for hosting a large colony of magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens), some of which hang suspended in the air above tourists’ heads as we disembark from a dinghy and scramble up the rocky path. As I admire the birds’ fabulous red throat sacs — which males inflate like balloons to attract females — I hope that none deposit excrement on my head. Male magnificent frigatebirds (center) have inflatable red pouches that expand to attract females (black birds to the male’s left). Juveniles have white heads.Erin Garcia de Jesús A short walk along a dusty trail brings us to, in my opinion, the stars of the show, blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii). The dopey looking birds show no sign of fear even as we cluster around their nests eagerly snapping photos. That I had the chance to visit these birds on North Seymour at all — amid all their poop — was a relief after traveling more than 5,000 kilometers for a vacation in Galápagos National Park. Just two months before, at the end of September, news broke that deadly avian influenza had reached the archipelago. Tell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now The virus’ presence posed a grave threat. The islands are home to birds like the Galápagos penguin that are found nowhere else in the world. National park and government officials closed some islands to tourists to protect endemic seabirds — an understandable tactic that left me selfishly thinking about the possibility of not getting to see iconic birds up close. To track the virus, “we have eyes watching the whole archipelago,” wildlife veterinarian Gustavo Jiménez-Uzcátegui of the Charles Darwin Foundation told Science in September. The concern is warranted. Outside the Galápagos, the global bird flu panzootic has been destructive. (Panzootics are the animal equivalent of human pandemics.) It’s unclear why the archipelago has so far escaped the worst of avian influenza, Jiménez-Uzcátegui told me when we met in the island town of Puerto Ayora. Also unknown are the effects the outbreak could permanently imprint on bird populations and the ecosystems that they’re a part of around the globe. “Most people have no idea that we are in the middle of a wildlife emergency, an animal pandemic, and that this may be the nail in the coffin for some species,” says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, who studies avian influenza. “It’s very concerning.” Bird flu has killed millions of animals While the viral variant behind the outbreak emerged in Europe in 2020, the outbreak itself didn’t take off until late 2021. Since then, avian flu has likely killed millions of wild birds (SN: 3/6/23). In Peru, hundreds of thousands of wild birds have died. Places like Russia and Canada have documented tens of thousands of deaths. In the United States, roughly 9,000 wild birds have tested positive for avian flu, some of which were reported after being killed by hunters. In October, bird flu arrived in the Antarctic region for the first time when unexplained mortality of brown skuas on Bird Island was pinned on the virus. But birds aren’t the only animals in the flu’s crosshairs. “If you can imagine thousands of dead birds, you can imagine how this is an ‘all day buffet’ for scavengers,” Wille says. Avian predators all over the world, including bears and foxes, have tested positive. Marine mammals such as seals and sea lions that swim with or eat infected birds have experienced mass die-offs. In the Arctic, a polar bear died in October after contracting the virus. And on January 11, researchers confirmed that elephant and fur seals in South Georgia, a sub-Antarctic island, had been infected. By the time of my trip in mid-November, fears of birds dying en masse in the Galápagos hadn’t yet come to fruition. To date, there have been just 34 confirmed flu infections in red- and blue-footed boobies, Nazca boobies, frigatebirds and tropicbirds. Researchers with the Galápagos National Park test a juvenile frigatebird for avian influenza. Thirty-four birds have tested positive since the virus was first detected in September.Galápagos National Park Directorate That the global outbreak is happening at all is a chapter in a predictable story, says Nichola Hill, a disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. And the virus’s incursion into some mammals is “absolutely on track with being the worst-case scenario you could have imagined for this.” The flu’s long-term effects remain unclear Sponsor Message Researchers have long understood that avian influenza viruses — which normally cause mild disease in waterfowl like ducks — can turn deadly after spreading and evolving on poultry farms (SN: 9/2/05). Close relatives of the virus responsible for the ongoing panzootic have been “simmering away” in Eurasia for more than a decade, Hill says. “And now in the last three years, it’s had major consequences for wildlife.” For now, researchers are focused on documenting the sheer scale of avian and mammalian deaths. “We will probably not know the true extent of this for years to come,” Wille says. The ripple effects on ecosystems will likewise take years to unravel. Death rates vary among bird species. Waterfowl such as ducks are key spreaders of bird flu and have at least some built-in protection from the virus. Because their immune systems have coevolved with influenza viruses, the animals have a “head-start on immunity” compared to other animals, Hill says. Meanwhile, birds like bald eagles and red-tailed hawks that don’t have such a long history with influenza are “just getting hit really hard.” That disparity has Hill wondering how long it might take for infections to become less deadly, as wild birds develop immunity against the virus. Her lab aims to explore how birds’ immune systems have coevolved with avian flu, including which parts of the immune response are crucial for preventing the virus from running rampant and causing death in some species. As of now, Wille says, there are no signs that the panzootic is slowing down. But there are glimmers of hope. In October, researchers announced some early results from a bird flu vaccine trial in California condors. After 10 birds had received two doses of the vaccine, six of them had antibody levels high enough to provide at least partial protection against death. “If it works, it demonstrates that we may be able to limit the impact on highly endangered species,” Wille says. Climate may be protecting the Galápagos Why avian flu has been less “aggressive” in the Galápagos compared with most everywhere else — and whether it will stay that way — remains a big question, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says. But he has one intriguing hypothesis. “The unique difference from the other parts [of South America], like Peru, Ecuador,” he says, “is the habitat.” November is the tail end of the dry season in the Galápagos, so landscapes lack lush greenery. But cacti and crystal clear blue waters, shown here around Santa Fé Island, add color to the otherwise ghostly landscape.Erin Garcia de Jesús Flu in both people and birds tends to largely be a cold-season disease (SN: 1/11/23). Last year, El Niño arrived in the Galápagos, bringing warmer than average waters to the islands’ part of the Pacific Ocean. Normally, the climate pattern reduces the marine food supply, affecting many of the animals that swim in the waters around the islands. The more moderate temperatures may have also made it harder for avian flu to spread, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says. Piecing together the relationship between the local climate and influenza infections could help determine if Jiménez-Uzcátegui’s hunch is correct. He and his team also hope to examine the immune systems and genetics of birds that call the archipelago home. For now, though, researchers and officials continue to keep an eye out for influenza on the islands. On the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s easy to center humans in worries about infectious diseases, especially because influenza outbreaks can be devastating (SN: 10/27/21). But my visit to Galápagos National Park — a truly special place for nature lovers — underscored that wild birds around the globe are enduring the worst flu outbreak yet. And despite small signs of hope in these iconic islands, the virus’s impacts could reverberate for years to come. Questions or comments on this article?

(Image credit: Maxi Jonas) Over 17,000 southern elephant seal pups — accounting for 95% of the pups born last year — have died from a highly virulent strain of H5N1, known as bird flu, in a mass death event on the Valdés Peninsula in Argentina.The bird flu outbreak was officially confirmed by the Argentine Government Animal Health Service (SENASA), raising concerns among conservationists and scientists that the virus had mutated to be transmissible from mammal-to-mammal."I started to work with these animals in the '70s, and I have never seen something like this. Nobody has seen something like this," Claudio Campagna, a conservation researcher at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Argentina and lead author of a new study on the mass die off, told Live Science. In the paper, published Dec. 25 in the journal Marine Mammal Science, the researchers report a "catastrophic" mortality of southern elephant seal pups (Mirounga leonina) in November 2023. These pups are usually born from September to November and stay with their mother for around three weeks.Related: 'This is unlikely to be an isolated event': 1st polar bear death from bird flu spells trouble for speciesField data was taken from three areas along Valdés Peninsula, which consists of about 310 miles (500 kilometers) of coastline. "We found that 96% of pups in sample areas had died, and we know that in 2022, about 18,000 were born so virtually all production was lost," Campagna said.Scientists believe virus was transmitted between the seal pups, rather than through contact with infected dead birds or their fecal matter. (Image credit: Maxi Jonas)The researchers don't yet know how adult elephant seal populations have been impacted by the virus, but the paper recorded 46 adult deaths in a high-density beach, where a single death during a typical year would be rare.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Infected animals showed neurological and respiratory symptoms, such as head tremors, nasal discharge and a lack of coordination.The researchers are now considering that transmissions are occurring between mammals. Scientists had previously assumed that mammals were being infected from contact with birds through fecal matter or their dead carcasses. But Campagna pointed out that pups mainly nurse from their mothers, and therefore would not be consuming infected birds. Mammal-to-mammal transmission "is how you can explain such a large number of dead pups," he said.The same virus is responsible for other mass mortality events in South America, including thousands of sea lion deaths in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. RELATED STORIES—World's rarest seals have a secret breeding cave in Cyprus—Mystery mass death of seals on remote, uninhabited Siberian island under investigation—1st-known 'highly pathogenic' bird flu cases in Antarctic could threaten penguinsCampagna said it is also possible that the virus made the mammal-to-mammal jump when it was passed from sea lion colonies to elephant seals.The mass death of seal pups could impact the population for years to come. Southern elephant seals take an average of three to six years to sexually mature, meaning colonies may face drastically reduced numbers in 2026 to 2027, when fewer juvenile seals can be recruited into the breeding population.The WCS plans to count the entire population in September. "Then, we will have an accurate number of females that are left," Campagna said. "Perhaps it will be good news and the mortality is not going to be that high."

While other surrounding states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas report as "very high" or "high," Tennessee is the state with the highest level of “very high” illness activity.The latest report is from Week 2, which ended Jan. 13 and was updated on Jan. 19.Nationwide there have been a total of seven influenza-associated, pediatric deaths for the season (Dec. 2- Jan. 6), bringing the total to 47 said the CDC. The CDC also estimates that there have been at least 16 million illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations, and 11,000 deaths from flu so far this season.The CDC recommends that everyone six months and older get an annual flu vaccine as long as influenza viruses are spreading. Vaccination can still provide benefits this season, they said. Additionally, there are also prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness which should be started as early as possible and are especially important for higher risk patients.Read ahead for a closer look at Tennessee's influenza report.Tennessee hospitals: COVID-19, flu and RSV cases are filling up Tennessee clinics and hospital ERsWhat are the highest flu rates in Tennessee?According to the Tennessee Department of Health, there was one reported outbreak of influenza-illness during the week of Dec. 31, 2023, the latest the data is available for, and five since Oct. 31, 2023.

Terrill / APby Abraham Gutman Published Jan. 23, 2024, 9:59 a.m. ETThree in four workers at Jefferson Health’s Abington Memorial Hospital received their COVID-19 vaccines.At Trinity Health Mid-Atlantic hospitals in the region — Mercy Fitzgerald, Nazareth, and St. Mary — only 40% of staff got their flu shot.AdvertisementAs the number of people sick with respiratory illnesses increases, and hospitals in the region are again asking all visitors to wear masks, The Inquirer analyzed the latest data on vaccination rates for local hospital workers. The percent of workers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 is higher than those who are vaccinated against the flu. But both rates vary across hospitals in the region — and even within hospitals.At Temple University Hospital, 100% of employees were vaccinated against COVID-19 but only 60% were vaccinated against the flu.That’s according to the latest federal data on hospital workers’ vaccine rates from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The agency required worker at hospitals that participate in Medicare to be vaccinated against COVID until last summer. CMS still tracks how many medical workers received the first series of COVID shots that rolled out in December 2020, but not later boosters. Hospitals had to report the COVID-19 vaccination status of employees for the period between Oct. 1, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2022, and flu for the period between Oct. 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023.Differences reported between hospitals, however, may be due to a wide range of factors.Other vaccination requirements for workers in health care settings varied among counties, states, and employers during that time period. Philadelphia continues to require COVID-19 vaccination for health-care workers, while other counties do not.Temple said it is working to increase its flu vaccine rate. Trinity said its low reported flu rates were due to data tracking issues. Jefferson declined to comment without independently evaluating the data.Here’s a look at the COVID-19 and flu vaccination rate for hospitals in the Philadelphia region:AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAbout UsAbout The InquirerDiversity & InclusionAdvertiseContact UsLicensing & PermissionsPhoto ReprintsNewspapers in EducationJobs & InternshipsInquirer EventsAcel Moore WorkshopsNewsroom StaffHelp and FeedbackNews & InfoNewsSportsEntertainmentBusinessHealthFoodLifeOpinionPhilly FirstArchivesSpecial ReportsSite MapMarketplaceSubscribeInquirer StoreJob ListingsAll ClassifiedsDeath NoticesLegal NoticesGift Subscriptionse-EditionsThe InquirerThe Daily NewsSubscriber ServicesMobile AppsApple iOSGoogle AndroidXFacebookInstagram© 2024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLCTerms of Use/Privacy Policy/Cancellation Policy/California Notice/California residents do not sell my data requestExperts warn of a dangerous flu season for childrenIE 11 is not supported.

Caused by Bird Flu Outbreak Raises Concerns for Potential Cross-Species Transmission, Including to Humans by UC Davis News and Media Relations January 22, 2024 Blogs Dead elephant seals line a beach in Argentina in fall 2023. Avian influenza has caused the catastrophic die-off of thousands of elephant seals in Argentina, raising concerns for wildlife and human cross-species transmission. (Ralph Vanstreels, UC Davis) Researchers in Argentina recently reported the first outbreak of high pathogenicity H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in elephant seals. The outbreak killed 70% of elephant seal pups born in the 2023 breeding season, according to research co-led by the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and published in Marine Mammal Science. The mortality rate reached at least 96% by early November 2023 in the surveyed areas at Península Valdés in Argentina. “This outbreak is the greatest calamity to affect wildlife, particularly marine mammals, in South America in recent history,” said co-author Marcela Uhart, a veterinarian with the UC Davis Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center and its Latin America Program The outbreak has also caused the death of thousands of South American sea lions and fewer fur seals along the Argentine Patagonia coastline and now extends into Uruguay and southern Brazil. The virus has also been found in seabirds, particularly several species of terns. “There is not much we can do once HPAI reaches wildlife populations,” Uhart said. “We need to acknowledge and work to minimize these impacts, including controlling what we can, such as poultry farm biosecurity, to reduce the chance of a continuing cycle of disease spread.” Avian Influenza Media Experts UC Davis experts on poultry medicine, virology, biosecurity and more. This investigation was done in collaboration with scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society including Claudio Campagna, Valeria Falabella, Julieta Campagna, and Victoria Zavattieri. Funding was provided by the Wildlife Conservation Society. This blog post was adapted from an article by Tom Hinds of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Read the full report.

The latest data released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention shows that influenza B cases accounted for 56.4 percent of all influenza-like samples from Jan 8 to 14, surpassing influenza A cases for the first time this winter. The overall positivity rate for influenza across the nation fell compared to the previous seven-day period, but remained higher than the same time in the past three years, said the China CDC. In Beijing, local health authorities said on Wednesday that the positivity rate for influenza in the past week stood at 49.9 percent, down by 10 percentage points from the peak recorded in early December. "Influenza A infections dominated the initial phase of this round of epidemic, but for the past week, the ratio of influenza B infections rose to 88.5 percent," said the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control. "The flu epidemic remains at a high level but is beginning to trend downward." The city is seeing a low prevalence of COVID-19 infections, but the proportion of cases with JN.1 — an emerging variant that is spreading fast globally — has been rising, along with the number of total infections. Li Tongzeng, a chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You-An Hospital, said on Jan 15 that each day he receives about less than three patients diagnosed with influenza A and dozens of cases with influenza B. "There are many influenza B infections but the number is not rising, so the peak has likely occurred," he said in a post on microblogging platform Sina Weibo. Li added that symptoms of and therapeutics for influenza A and B infections are similar, and most people can recover within a week without special interventions. "Vulnerable groups should be put on antiviral drugs promptly to reduce the risk of developing into severe cases," he said. "Many people who were confirmed as having contracted the virus continued going to school or work, prolonging the length of the epidemic." Li added that with the Spring Festival holiday approaching and more people traveling domestically or making cross-border trips, the number of JN.1 infections will increase and become the dominant strain. "The majority of people in China were infected before and now harbor immunity. So even if the COVID-19 epidemic rebounds domestically, medical systems won't feel as much pressure as in previous outbreaks," he said, adding that early diagnosis and treatment remain essential for vulnerable groups. Authorities in Beijing said that fever clinics at its 300-plus medical facilities are open to meet the demands of patients and all community healthcare service centers are equipped with COVID-19 drugs and medications for influenza.

(elnavegante/Getty Images) Almost 96 percent of Southern elephant seal pups across Argentina born in 2023 have met a tragic end as a highly contagious strain of avian influenza continues to wreak havoc on wildlife. The scale of mortality sparks concerns that the H5N1 strain is now capable of mammal-to-mammal infection. "The sight of elephant seals found dead or dying along the breeding beaches can only be described as apocalyptic," says Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) health director Chris Walzer. The three beaches where the species breeds were littered with over 17,000 bodies of baby Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). "This 2023 die-off contrasts starkly with the 18,000 pups born and successfully weaned in 2022," explains Walzer. This amounts to the loss of nearly an entire generation of elephant seals in the region. As these animals take at least three years to reach maturity, the impact on their population may not be felt until 2027 when there are fewer available breeding adults to produce subsequent generations.Most animals found at the breeding sites, including adults, were recorded dead. (Ralph Vanstreels/Campagnaet et al., Marine Mammal Science, 2024)While H5N1 has been around since 1996, it was mostly circulating among domesticated birds for years, leading to the culling of hundreds of millions of animals. Moving into wild bird populations, it has now reached Antarctica, possibly exacerbated by changes in migration schedules thanks to climate change. Just last week a polar bear was confirmed to have been killed by avian influenza in a world first, adding to a fast growing list of mammal victims that include endangered Caspian seals, grizzly bears, dolphins, otters, mink, and foxes. All up the virus has infected about 345 bird and mammals species. The majority of mammals impacted so far are predators, prompting some experts to suggest they likely caught the virus directly from their prey rather than from each other. So the virus may not yet be capable of spreading between mammals. But elephant seal pups, who drink their mothers milk, don't tend to come in contact with bird fluids. "Nursing pups remain close to their mothers and opportunities for interaction with birds (mainly gulls) are basically restricted to the context of birds eating placentas during diurnal births," WCS ecologist Claudio Campagna and colleagues explain in a report. "This is all highly suggestive of some sort of transmission between mammals," wildlife veterinarian Marcela Uhart from University of California, Davis, told Luke Taylor at New Scientist.Vets immunizing a pelican against the H5N1 virus, French zoo of Mulhouse, 03 May 2006. ( Federick Florin/AFP/Getty Images)While mammal-to-mammal transmission is not yet confirmed, it is a very real possibility. As we've all experienced first hand with the COVID pandemic, viruses are frighteningly good at adapting. Influenzas are particularly notorious for their ability to change things up, and researchers have already identified shifts in H5N1 receptor binding proteins that would make them better at infecting human hosts. Influenza viruses tend to be extremely contagious and H5N1 is no exception. A virulence measure known as R naught has a value of up to 100 for H5N1 in birds. That means each infected individual has the potential to infect up to 100 others. For comparison, the R naught for early COVID-19 variants ranged from 1.5 to 7. As far as we know, humans have so far only caught bird flu from other animals on rare occasions. Last year there were a total of 248 reported cases, with 139 fatalities. This means Avian influenza has a staggering fatality rate of 56 percent in humans so far. In light of these events, the World Health Organization is urging health officials to prepare for continued spillover into human populations as the virus continues to rage through livestock and wildlife. They advise us all to avoid contact with sick or dead animals and to report all such cases to animal health authorities. If we can swiftly prevent spread in outbreak areas through vaccination then the virus will have less opportunity to develop a way to sustainably spread between people."The cost of inaction is already causing major devastation to wildlife," warns Walzer. "As we work to help affected populations recover, we must remain vigilant against the spread of this deadly pathogen to people before it's too late."

Cold & FluNewsCOVID-19, Flu, RSV Rates Are on the Decline, CDC Says in Latest BriefingStill, experts warn that respiratory illnesses remain at high levels, especially in certain parts of the country.ByDon RaufFact CheckedPublished on January 26, 2024It’s a good idea to cough into your sleeve or a tissue — but you still need to wash your hands afterward.iStockYou can expect more runny noses, coughs, and fevers ahead as levels of flu, COVID-19, and RSV continue to be elevated across the country.The latest weekly update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on January 26 shows that the number of people seeking healthcare for fever plus cough or sore throat is elevated but decreasing in most areas. In some locales, such as Toledo, Ohio, and Milwaukee, news outlets are reporting that respiratory illness is going strong, with indicators climbing in the past week.Although respiratory illnesses may be persisting, their spread overall appears to be waning. This week, 22 jurisdictions experienced high or very high activity, compared with 37 jurisdictions two weeks ago.Although public health officials have been on the alert for a second period of increasing influenza activity that often occurs after the winter holidays, the federal flu surveillance report for January 26 shows positive tests holding steady but hospitalizations and deaths dipping downward. That said, an additional 10 pediatric deaths related to flu were recorded this past week, bringing that total to 57 for the season.Nationwide, COVID-19 and RSV test positivity decreased compared with the previous week, and a downward trend in virus activity levels in wastewater is being seen this week in all parts of the country. The highest regional levels are in the South, notes the CDC.While elevated, emergency room visits for all the viruses have inched downward in many areas, and hospital bed occupancy for all patients, including within intensive care units, remains stable nationally.Rohan S. Mankikar, MD, a clinical instructor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a pulmonologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City, has been noticing a definite downward trend in the number of patients coming in for COVID, flu, and RSV.“From Christmas through New Year's, we started seeing a peak that lasted about two weeks after that,” he says. “But I definitely see a decline this week.”Why Are Some People Still Getting Severely Sick?Despite some promising signs, many people are still dying of respiratory illnesses every week. The percentage of viral respiratory deaths for the week ending January 13 increased from 5.2 to 5.4 percent. The percentage of COVID-19 deaths climbed from 3.8 to 4.1 percent, although the portion of influenza deaths dipped slightly from 1.3 to 1.2 percent, and the rate of RSV deaths remained stable at 0.1 percent.The National Center for Health Statistics found that at least 2,670 individuals in the United States died of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 during the week ending January 20.Dr. Mankikar notes that he’s seen several cases of post-flu pneumonia. “Patients have flu for about a week. The symptoms present, they get better, and then a week or two later, they start having a fever again and end up having bacterial pneumonia,” he says. “Although they’ve recovered from flu, they’re still immunocompromised and a bacterial infection sets in.”Nationally, the total number of deaths due to COVID-19, influenza, or RSV is highest among those age 65 and older, according to the CDC. Infants and young children are also among those most vulnerable to severe illness. People with obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or who are immunocompromised can also be at increased risk, as well as pregnant people and smokers.Vaccinations Make a DifferenceA major factor that raises the likelihood of severe illness is being unvaccinated.“I’m definitely seeing more severe symptoms in patients who are not vaccinated,” says Mankikar.He adds that those who have not been vaccinated may also have symptoms that linger on longer, especially when it comes to the flu.“Most patients who get the virus will recover in a week,” says Mankikar. “But there are a lot of patients — even without underlying lung conditions — who take a longer time to recover, especially if they're not vaccinated. In some cases, it can take four to six weeks.”National vaccination rates for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, however, have been low. Mankikar stresses that it’s not too late to get vaccinated, and there are still many weeks of respiratory virus season ahead.Additional Tips for Protection Against Seasonal VirusesIn addition to vaccination, Robert H. Hopkins Jr., MD, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), offers these tips to stop the spread of respiratory viruses and avoid catching one yourself.Stay home if you are sick, and contact a healthcare professional for additional recommendations. If you have trouble breathing or cannot keep fluids down, seek emergency care.Wear a mask if you are going to be in a crowded indoor setting.Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently.If you have to cough or sneeze, do it into your sleeve or a tissue (not your hands), then wash your hands.Think about whether your planned activity is worth the risk of getting sick before you go, and if you decide to go, use the other approaches outlined here.Improve indoor air quality by using air filters or open doors and windows to bring outdoor air inside.Editorial Sources and Fact-CheckingEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

(Emily Fitzpatrick/CBC)Social SharingAlberta is on track for what could be its lowest influenza vaccination rate in at least a decade.Less than one-quarter of Albertans — 24.1 per cent — have received their annual flu shot so far this respiratory virus season, according to provincial data.It's a dramatic drop from the high of 37 per cent in 2020-21.The last time the province recorded an overall immunization rate this low was at the end of the 2012-13 season, when uptake was 24 per cent."It's difficult to imagine we're going to see a significant uptick in the last few weeks of the flu season. So this will either be the lowest in a decade or among the lowest in a decade," said Craig Jenne, a professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Calgary."This is really suggesting that the vaccine campaign this fall had far less success than what we have seen in recent years." Premier responds to Globe and Mail report that province directed AHS to remove COVID, flu references in ads Jenne said Alberta's vaccine uptake traditionally tends to be lower than the national average for a number of preventable illnesses."I think it will be critical that as we emerge from this respiratory virus season that we have a hard look at what went well and what didn't go well so that we can better prepare and perhaps better advocate for better vaccine uptake in the next flu season."Dr. Jia Hu, a Calgary-based public health physician, is also concerned about the downward trend."It's a very disappointing number," said Hu, an adjunct professor at the University of Calgary."I think its sort of emblematic of the sort of wide scale vaccine fatigue that we're seeing for influenza vaccines, COVID vaccines and to a lesser extent other vaccines."This has a direct impact on Alberta's hospitals, which are already overcrowded and under intense strain, he said."The fewer people that are immunized, the more people that will show up in hospital. We know the vaccine is good at preventing hospitalizations. We know it's good at preventing even more serious outcomes like ICU admissions," he said. Low uptake among seniorsProvincial data shows 61 per cent of seniors have had their flu shot so far this season — far lower than survey data from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), which shows vaccination rates among Canadians 65 and older ranged between 70 and 74 per cent during the last four flu seasons.The goal, according to PHAC, is to have 80 per cent of high risk groups, including seniors and adults with chronic medical conditions, immunized against influenza. Makeshift dividers, hallway medicine are signs of a system in crisis, say Alberta front-line staff "To hear that [Alberta] is only sitting at 61 per cent, that really concerns me because it means that there's a lot of vulnerable, older Albertans out there who are at high risk," said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Toronto-based Sinai Health and the University Health Network, adding it's not too late in the season to get vaccinated."And it's mostly older people, who are some of the 3,500 people who die every year from the flu in Canada."Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, says he's concerned about the low flu vaccination rate for Alberta seniors. (Yanjun Li/CBC)Sinha also believes poor public health messaging is to blame."In Alberta there's been a lot of controversy under this government about vaccine messaging," he said."It's not that Albertans don't want to be vaccinated or older Albertans don't believe in vaccines, it's just that when you don't actually get the messaging out there, when you don't make vaccines accessible, then what you see is low rates like this. And then we wonder why our hospitals are overwhelmed?"The Alberta government came under fire late last year after a report emerged that it had directed Alberta Health Services to remove mention of COVID-19 and influenza from advertisements for this season's immunization campaign.CBC News asked the Alberta government for a response to the concerns about low vaccine uptake, and what steps are being taken to address it, but did not hear back before publication time.As of Wednesday afternoon, Alberta's respiratory dashboard showed 1,364 Albertans 60 and up had been hospitalized for influenza since the start of the season. There had been 98 intensive care unit admissions and 78 deaths among people in the same age range.Meanwhile, Hu said the decline in flu vaccine uptake appears to be mirroring a drop in interest in the COVID-19 immunization.Just 16.4 per cent of Albertans have received the latest COVID shot."What we really need to do is do a bit of a reset on how we even go about promoting these vaccines. I think we need to do more education. We need to do more marketing," he said."I think health-care workers — while they're burned out, too — need to have more conversations with their patients about these because what we're seeing is a bad trend downward," said Hu.ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations working to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks. The addition of the Serum Institute of India (SII) to the CEPI manufacturing network will be a significant boost to vaccine production efforts in Global South regions and will mean the world is better prepared to achieve the 100 Days Mission to develop new vaccines against known or novel infectious diseases within three months of a pandemic threat being recognized. To prepare for such a scenario, CEPI is investing up to $30 million to build upon the SII’s proven track record of rapid response to outbreaks of infectious disease, expanding the company’s existing ability to swiftly supply investigational vaccines in the face of epidemic and pandemic threats. This would then enable CEPI-backed vaccine developers to quickly transfer their technology to SII within days or weeks of an outbreak to begin rapid production and equitable distribution of affordable vaccines to affected populations. “As a leading vaccine manufacturer, we’re committed to utilizing our well-established manufacturing and rapid response capabilities to strengthen epidemic preparedness and increase access to life-saving vaccines for those who need them most at an affordable price. This collaboration will enable us to respond more rapidly and equitably to public health disease outbreaks, particularly in Global South countries where access to life-saving vaccines can be limited.” Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India READ ALSO WHO Prequalifies a Second Malaria Vaccine, a Significant Milestone in Prevention of the Disease WHO has added the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine to its list of prequalified vaccines. The R21 vaccine is the second malaria vaccine prequalified by WHO, following the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine which obtained prequalification status in July 2022. Both vaccines are shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, for preventing malaria in children. The prequalification of the world’s second malaria vaccine, developed by Oxford University and manufactured by Serum Institute of India, is poised to expand access to malaria prevention through vaccination. Demand for malaria vaccines is high but the supply has thus far been limited. World Health Organization (Dec 2023) Serum Institute to Soon Start Phase I & II Trials of Dengue Vaccine in India After a successful Phase-I trial of the dengue vaccine in Australia, the Serum Institute of India (SII) will soon begin Phase I and Phase II trials for its Dengusiil vaccine in India, bringing India one step closer to generating its first indigenous dengue vaccine. Hindustan Times (Nov 2023) Mylab & Serum Institute Launch India’s First Nasal Influenza Vaccine Nasovac S4 Mylab and Serum Institute of India (SII) have launched Nasovac S4, India’s first needle-free nasal influenza vaccine. The live quadrivalent influenza vaccine will be available through a network of healthcare providers and clinics across India. The vaccine includes two influenza Type A virus and two influenza Type B strains (Victoria and Yamagata lineage) and is indicated for ages 2 and older. Times of India (Oct 2023) Serum Institute of India, Mylab Launch TB Kit for Latent Infections A point-of-care skin test for detecting latent tuberculosis infections, developed by Serum Institute of India and Mylab Discovery Solutions, was launched at a cost the companies claimed to be 50-70 per cent lower than comparable tests available now. As India targets eliminating tuberculosis by 2025, testing for latent tuberculosis becomes critical before it turns active. India has 27 per cent of global tuberculosis patients.

Terrill) Four flu-related deaths were reported in Arkansas over the past week, raising this season's death toll to 24, the state Department of Health reported Thursday.The state remains at a "high" level of flu activity, based on visits to the doctor by people with a fever and cough or sore throat, according to the department's weekly report.One person who died within the past week was between the ages of 45 and 64, and the other three were 65 or older.Of the others who have died of the flu so far this season, three were age 25-44, five were age 45-64 and 12 were 65 or older.During the week ending Saturday, 43 people were admitted to hospitals with the flu, down from 44 the previous week, the department reported.Meanwhile, 93 people were newly hospitalized with covid-19, up from 23 the previous week.From Oct. 1 through the week ending Jan. 20, Arkansas reported 6,221 confirmed flu cases, up from 5,369 cases as of a week earlier.Cases usually peak between December and February, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Since many people who catch the flu aren't tested, the reported cases make up only a portion of the total cases in the state.The flu season is generally from October to May. Around this time last year, Arkansas had already reported 129 influenza-related deaths, including one child death.Nine influenza outbreaks have been reported from nursing homes or other congregate setting institutions this flu season. Around this time last year, the Health Department reported a total of 20 outbreaks.Nationally, the CDC estimates 11,000 deaths from flu so far this season, according to the Health Department report.During last year's flu season, more than 22,500 positive influenza tests were reported to the state Health Department by the spring.The Health Department also noted 77 covid-related deaths reported over the past week, raising the total since Jan. 1, 2023, to 698.My Ly is a Report for America Corps Member.

BySumit JhaPublished Jan 25, 2024 | 8:00 AM ⚊ Updated Jan 25, 2024 | 8:00 AM Aedes mosquitoes, responsible for dengue transmission, are known for their aggressive day-biting behaviour and the ability to survive indoors for an extended period. (Shutterstock) With the decline of Covid cases in India, the year 2023 bore witness to a surge in cases of seasonal flu. Tamil Nadu experienced a notable increase in seasonal influenza, while Kerala recorded a higher incidence of related fatalities. Among the southern states, Karnataka and Kerala reported a substantial rise in dengue cases, with Kerala witnessing the highest number of deaths attributed to the dengue virus. Experts posit that the populace venturing outdoors and an extended rainy season, owing to a delayed onset of winter and early summer, contributed to the elevated viral infections across the country. Seasonal influenza cases According to the Central Surveillance Unit of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), there has been a significant rise in both cases and fatalities linked to seasonal influenza A (H1N1) in the southern states of India in 2023. Comparing the data from 2022 to 2023, Kerala and Tamil Nadu exhibited substantial increases. Kerala’s cases surged from 90 to 1,025, with deaths rising from 7 to 57. In Tamil Nadu, cases increased from 2,827 to 3,544, the highest in the country, while deaths decreased from 25 to 19. On the contrary, Andhra Pradesh reported 103 cases with no fatalities in 2023, whereas there were only 22 cases in 2022. Karnataka witnessed a decrease in cases, reporting 118 cases in 2023 compared to 517 in 2022, with no deaths reported in 2023. Telangana also observed a decline in both cases and deaths during the same period, with 116 cases in 2023 compared to 343 cases in 2022. Both years, the state did not report any deaths. “The increased number of people opting for testing is a big factor contributing to the elevated case count in the states. The fluctuating temperatures and inadequate drainage systems create an environment conducive to the spread of diseases. Patients with such illnesses often exhibit symptoms like high fever, altered mental states, breathing difficulties, and gastrointestinal issues — all stemming from viral infections,” Dr Karthik Vedula, Consultant Infectious Disease Physician at Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad told South First. He added that furthermore, the rapid shift in weather from cold to warmer temperatures leads to an increase in other seasonal infections. “As winter transitions to summer, there is a notable surge in patients reporting viral fever, cold and cough, and severe throat infections. The significant impact of weather on overall health is evident throughout this transition,” said Dr Vedula.

In 2018, the country reported 15,266 cases and 1,128 deaths, in 2019 there were 28,798 cases and 1,218 deaths, in 2020 there were 2,752 cases and 44 deaths, in 2021 there were 778 cases and 12 deaths, and in 2022 there were 13,202 cases and 410 deaths. In 2023, the country reported 8,097 cases and 129 deaths. Click to enlarge. This data highlights a variable pattern in H1N1 prevalence over the years, with a noticeable decrease in both cases and deaths in 2023 compared to the preceding year. Authorities continue to utilise this information to shape public health strategies and interventions. A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) stated that the upswing in cases was attributed to diminished immunity among individuals and a reduction in flu vaccination rates. “Influenza virus infections declined globally during the Covid-19 pandemic. Loss of natural immunity from lower rates of influenza infection and documented antigenic changes in circulating viruses may have resulted in increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection during the 2021-2022 influenza season,” the report stated. The influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses occurred in a number of nations, as per WHO. In India, the annual influenza vaccines, commonly known as flu shots, have not gained widespread popularity, despite the recommended practice of taking them every year.

Kerala reported the highest number of deaths due to dengue in South India in 2023, followed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. In 2023, Karnataka reported 14,227 cases and 9 deaths, Kerala reported 14,189 cases and 51 deaths, while Tamil Nadu reported 7,133 cases and 10 deaths, Andhra Pradesh reported 5,936 cases and zero deaths, and Telangana reported 7,894 cases and one death due to dengue. Comparing the figures from 2022, there is a noticeable escalation in dengue cases across the South Indian states. In 2022, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu reported lower numbers, with Karnataka recording 9,889 cases, Kerala 4,432 cases, and Tamil Nadu 6,039 cases. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, a member of the Public Health Advisory Panel at the Indian Medical Association, said that the surge in cases is influenced by geographical and climatic factors. “Kerala, with its abundant water bodies and low-lying wetlands, provides suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The copious rainfall, especially in the latter part of 2023, creates ideal conditions for Aedes mosquitoes, which lay eggs in freshwater, to thrive. The high population density in the region facilitates the easier spread of the virus by mosquitoes,” he told South First. Aedes mosquitoes, responsible for dengue transmission, are known for their aggressive day-biting behaviour and the ability to survive indoors for an extended period. These mosquitoes can transmit the disease among individuals sharing the same space, whether it’s a residence or workplace. “Given Kerala’s relatively high population density, there is an increased risk of mosquito-borne virus transmission. Poorly planned urban development can further contribute to a rise in the mosquito population. Individuals residing or working in densely populated areas are more susceptible to infection. The mortality rate is directly proportional to the number of reported cases. Generally, dengue itself is not fatal, but fatalities may occur during a second infection with a different serotype or among individuals with pre-existing health conditions,” explained Dr Jayadevan. Speaking about cases in Karnataka, Dr Jayadevan said that unusually, the winter season is not typically conducive to mosquito breeding. However, the occurrence of intermittent rains in November, coupled with a delay in the onset of winter conditions, may have contributed to an uptick in dengue cases in 2023. The total number of dengue cases in India reached 2,34,427, with 274 reported deaths in 2023. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation and implementing necessary measures to address the growing concern.

Losses of poultry from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) approaching 12.3 million over the course of less than a year have been devastating for South Africa — not the poultry sector, but also for its people coping with a cost-of-living crisis. Previous outbreak waves have been ongoing sporadically since 2017.Targeted vaccination of poultry — as initiated in a government scheme in France since October last — may help to prevent a recurrence of the disease in South Africa. However, there is much work to be done before this becomes realistic option there. This is according to the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) in its latest publication Poultry Bulletin.Following the government’s decision in principle to allow vaccination against HPAI in September, SAPA has carried out an assessment of this option. It found that protection against the H5N1 HPAI virus could be achieved successfully as this strain is currently circulating widely across the world. Furthermore, a number of effective vaccines are already available for H5 protection. However, the simultaneous circulation of a second virus serotype — H7N6 — in South Africa represents a bigger challenge, according to SAPA. This strain is unlike any other currently circulating in the rest of the world, and current vaccines may not be effective against it. Locally produced vaccines are in development, according to SAPA, but protocols for testing under field conditions are still to be finalized before testing can begin. Availability of an effective, authorized and commercially available vaccine against the H7N6 HPAI virus in South Africa appears to be a distant prospect for the time being. Further HPAI outbreaks reported in South AfricaBased on official notifications, the HPAI situation in South African poultry flocks appears to be easing.Since the start of the year, just four further outbreaks in commercial birds have been reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).At two farms, presence of an HPAI virus of the H5N1 serotype was detected. One of the outbreaks began in a small flock of 113 birds at a farm in Gauteng at the end of November. This was the first premises in the province in this outbreak series. The other was retrospectively reported after 42 individuals out of a flock of 4,250 commercial ostriches in Western Cape tested positive for the virus in July of last year.First detected in South Africa in May of 2023, the H7N6 HPAI virus was detected in October in a flock of more than 900 commercial ostriches in Western Cape. In December, the same serotype was identified in a flock of around 5,000 poultry at a premises in Limpopo after 500 of the birds died. These latest outbreaks bring to 111 the total outbreaks linked to the H7N6 virus variant recorded in South Africa so far. Directly impacted have been almost 10.5 million commercial poultry.In addition, just over 1.79 million farmed birds at 25 locations have been involved in outbreaks linked to the H5N1 serotype in the country since April of last year.Furthermore, another backyard poultry flock was hit by this virus strain at the end of November, according to a separate notification to WOAH. Located in KwaZulu-Natal, it comprised seven birds other than poultry.Outbreaks widespread Infections linked to both HPAI virus variants have occurred widely across South Africa. Majority of the H5N1 outbreaks have occurred in Western Cape, while most of the H7N6 cases have been in Gauteng. However, one or more cases of each strain have been detected in seven or eight provinces.During the current HPAI “season” in South Africa, which started in October, 80 HPAI outbreaks have occurred in domestic poultry, according to the latest update from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization [http://www.fao.org/] (FAO; dated January 11). Over this period, the only other African nation to have reported HPAI to the FAO is Mozambique. One outbreak occurred in this East African state at the end of September.

Department of Health to create more appointment slots.Vaccines will be provided to General Practitioners free of charge to supply their patients.Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr Shaun Ramroop, praised the operational efficiency of the Hamilton Health Clinic during his recent visit. “The clinic vaccinated over 200 individuals by 1 pm, exceeding the number of scheduled appointments. I must commend the team for their outstanding performance.” The COVID-19 vaccine is available free of charge and priority is being given to residents at an increased risk of severe illness. The influenza vaccine is free for individuals aged 65 and older, while those aged 12 to 64 may incur a $20 fee.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Decrease in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: increase in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 15 to 21 January 2024 (week 3), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 150 cases, compared to 196 cases the previous week (-23%). The positivity rate fell to 7% compared to 10% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is decreasing [1]. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased. The latest sequencing data available for weeks 52/2023-02/2024 show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (85.1%) (95% CI 78.3-91.8%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.2%) (95% CI: 5.9-18.8%). [2]. It should be noted that the JN.1 variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant with an additional mutation on its spike protein. Influenza For the week of 15 to 21 January 2024 (week 3), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 703 cases compared to 441 cases in the previous week, presenting an increase of 59%. These data largely overlap with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus, followed by rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 15 to 21 January 2024 (week 3), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 15 cases, compared with 29 the previous week, presenting an decrease of 48%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

The Public Health Agency (PHA) is urging everyone in this category, and those in other eligible groups including all health and social care workers, to come forward now and take the opportunity to get vaccinated to help protect themselves and those around them. The call comes as flu activity continues to increase. Getting vaccinated will help protect more people from flu and help to relieve possible further pressure on the health service over the coming weeks. Vaccination is available through GP surgeries, community pharmacies and local HSC Trust clinics, with further information on this available at www.nidirect.gov.uk/wintervaccines. Dr Louise Herron, Deputy Director of Public Health at the PHA, said: “Although overall influenza levels remain low at present, we are seeing increased activity so it is essential that we don’t become complacent. The flu virus hasn’t gone away, and we must all continue to take steps to prevent catching and spreading it. “This season’s flu vaccination programme is now being extended to include everyone aged between 50 and 64 years old, and we are also encouraging all health and social care workers to come forward for their flu vaccine. While the flu vaccine won’t protect you from COVID-19, it may stop you from getting both illnesses together which can increase the risk of severe illness and could put additional strain on health and social care services.” Those aged 50-64 years old and health and social care workers can receive the flu vaccine via their GP, community pharmacy or local HSC Trust clinics. People who are eligible for vaccination should make themselves aware of their own GP surgery’s, community pharmacist’s or trust’s vaccination arrangements. This year’s vaccine is also still available to older age groups and those eligible for health reasons, as previously advised. The flu vaccine does not give you the flu. It is offered as the best protection. It is free, quick and it could make a big difference to your health and the health of those close to you. The influenza virus spreads through droplets when people cough and sneeze. Dr Herron continued: “We should all continue to take common sense steps to reduce the spread of flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses by exercising good respiratory and hand hygiene and staying away from others if we have symptoms.” Top tips Wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water. When sneezing, blowing your nose or coughing – catch it, by using a tissue; bin it, by throwing the tissue in the bin; and kill it, by washing your hands afterwards to kill the germs. If you have symptoms of a cold, flu or COVID-19, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people until your symptoms have resolved fully. If eligible, receiving the seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to help protect yourself and others from getting the virus. If you have questions about the vaccine, talk to your healthcare provider and make an informed decision. So, if you are eligible for either the flu vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine or both, take up the offer to help protect yourself and those around you this winter.

According to the Health Bureau, the male patient approached the staff of the hotel where he was staying on 19 January for assistance after feeling unwell. He was subsequently transferred to the emergency ward of Hospital Centre S. Januario for medical care. Upon arrival, he was found to have started losing consciousness. A later test confirmed that he was suffering from influenza A, a subtype of the influenza virus that can cause seasonal flu outbreaks and occasional pandemics. The man is currently receiving treatment in the intensive care unit and is dependent on a ventilator.

According to the doctors, patients are approaching them with complaints of discomfort in the chest, trouble breathing, fever, and other symptoms. Some patients need oxygen support and ventilators and are from all age group. Doctors say that caution should be exercised by the people to break the chain of infection. Swine Flu is a highly contagious human respiratory infection caused by an influenza strain —H1N1— that started in pigs.Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, chills, weakness, and body aches. Children may experience shortness of breath, dehydration, and irritability in advanced cases. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are at risk of severe infection. Typical treatment includes rest, pain relievers, and fluids. In some cases, antiviral medication and IV fluids may be required.“There are more cases of swine flu infection than influenza. Fever is the classic symptom. However, if the fever is accompanied by severe cough, cold, headache, and body ache, then do not take it lightly. If any member of the household has a fever, cough, or cold, the person should get isolated for five days. So that other members of the family do not get infected,” a government doctor at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said. Dr Akshay Budhraja, a specialist in pulmonary medicine at Aakash Super Specialty Hospital, said the majority of the cases are turning positive for H1N1 while very few cases are from H3N2 and Covid-19. “We have seen patients landing up in the hospital’s emergency and all of them required non-invasive ventilation. When investigated, their chest x-ray revealed pneumonia patches so it is utmost important that symptoms should not be ignored and early medical intervention should be sought. The patients include all age group. However, all of them are recovering fast,” he said.Disease symptomsSwine Flu is a highly contagious human respiratory infection caused by an influenza strain —H1N1— that started in pigs.

Coronavirus remains the key pathogen among respiratory infections even on the third week of this year, with half of hospitalised patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and more than three quarters of them aged 60 and over. Almost half of those seeking medical help with severe acute respiratory infections were in the 0-14 year age group, which translates into nearly 91,000 children. A word about the gap in the charts The National Public Health Centre (NNK) first skipped the report for the 51st week of 2023 between Christmas and New Year. Then it published data only for the 51st week, but nothing for the 52nd week. Last week, it published its epidemiological report not only for the 52nd week of 2023 but also for the 1st week of 2024. However, the report for the 52nd week was extremely concise, missing a host of key figures, including on the actual number of Hungarians turning to the doctor with severe acute respiratory infection, including flu-like symptoms, an age breakdown of those seeking medical help, incidence per 100,000 population, and hospital data altogether. This has caused unwanted breaks in our time series and graphs. We have asked the NNK if we could have more than just two paragraphs for the 52nd week but its press department did not dignify us with an answer. Hence the gaps remain. Data worsen further The flu season generally peaks between the 7th and 10th week of the year, but the highest figures can vary greatly from one year to another. The coronavirus pandemic, for instance, put a serious dent into the spread of the flu (see graph below). A dip for the holiday season was anticipated, and - as discussed above - further moderation on the first week was not a shocker, either. Employees generally take their leave at the end of the year, there's the winter break in schools, and a heightened reluctance to go to the doctor "with a simple cold". The number of people seeking medical help with influenza-like symptoms per 100,000 population was higher than currently only twice in the past 12 cold seasons (in 2016/17 and in 2018/19). Here's a blow-up of the period in question: On the 3rd week of 2024, a total of 197,200 people sought medical help with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), of whom 28,600 (14.5%) had flu-like symptoms. The former figure marks a 11.8% increase and the latter a 15.3% growth over the 2nd week. Columns are missing for the NNK did not publish these figures for the 52nd week. The graph below allows a comparison with weeks 40 to 3 of 2022/23, showing higher figures for this cold season both for the number of people that visited GPs with flu-like symptoms and of SARI "patients". We can also compare the SARI and flu numbers for 100,000 inhabitants. Despite the relief observed between the 51st week of 2023 and the 1st week of 2024, chances are that the epidemic will be more severe in 2023/24 than in 2022/23. We need to highlight that this year authorities perform way more tests than a year ago, even though the number of samples tested remains extremely low (309 in total on a national level last week, up from 221 a week ago but down from this season's high of 327 on the 50th week). The number of samples tested on the 3rd week was higher than on the 2nd week, with the COVID-19 positivity rate all over the place - it is currently up at 16.8%, after hitting its lowest in this season on the 2nd week. Testing is almost non-existent and we may draw only extremely cautious conclusions from these findings as regards the bigger picture on the current epidemiological situation. This is basically the only set of Covid data authorities provide besides weekly wastewater sampling results. Looking at the numbers, however, it's a pretty safe bet that SARS-CoV-2 remains the key pathogen for the time being. As regards all samples tested up to the 3rd week, the Covid positivity rate continues to stand out. Covid infections trump flu infections SARS-CoV-2 was the main pathogen found in samples early in the flu season last year too. Actually, the first time the share of flu viruses in samples was higher than the share of coronavirus occurred only at the start of this year in the 2022/23 flu season (after the green and orange lines crossed, see graph). At the same time, we cannot even estimate when this turnaround will take place this year. In fact, it would be a surprise it if occurred at all. Why? Well, take a look at the two graph below! The share of coronavirus in all samples tested (orange lines) was about half than currently a year ago (14.3% vs. 29.2% currently), while the percentage of influenza in the samples (green lines) is way lower now than in the third week of 2023 (4.9% vs. 17.1%). As regards the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the samples (blue lines), the situation is much better in the current cold season than in 2022/23, with the share only at 1.1% on the third week this year versus 8.0% a year ago. For the seventh consecutive week in this flu season (or should we say Covid season?), however, people who tested positive for influenza virus and RSV also had to be hospitalised. The 47th week was the first one in this cold season when one of the samples showed influenza infection (up at 163 in total by the end of the 3rd week). Other pathogens identified between the 40th and 2nd week were SARS-CoV-2 (976), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 38), adenovirus (2), parainfluenza (4), human metapneumovirus (HMPV, 15, and rhinovirus (35). There were 201 people in hospital with SARI on the 3rd week, versus 166 a week ago. 50% of them were treated with COVID-19, up from 47% a week earlier. 78 (77.2%) of the 101 COVID-19 patients were aged 60 and over, which compares with 62 (79.5%) a week earlier. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus infection jumped 30% from 78 a week ago. 14.4% of those hospitalised with SARI were children aged 2 years or younger (down from 24.1% a week ago), while nearly 63% of them were aged 60 and over (up from 55% on the 2nd week). Another important indicator of the severity of an epidemic is how many of those hospitalised end up in the intensive care unit (or in the morgue for that matter). The NNK does not reveal mortality stats, though. As mentioned above, there were 201 people with SARI in hospital on the week under review, up own from 166 a week earlier. 25 of them were in the ICU, which corresponds to a 12.4% ratio, which compare with 19 (11.4%) a week earlier. Finally, we have an age breakdown both for SARI and flu patients. Children up to the age of 14 are on top of the SARI age rankings in terms of numbers, and for the first time this season they are also on top in the flu rankings, while the second hardest-hit cluster is the 15-34 age group. The right-hand charts show the share of people with SARI and flu-like symptoms by age group. Looking back on the 2022/23 data we find that the 0-14 age group was the hardest hit throughout the flu season in terms of SARI, while in terms of flu-like symptoms they were the most affected age group between the 3rd and the 15th week of this year, i.e. from mid-January to mid-April.
