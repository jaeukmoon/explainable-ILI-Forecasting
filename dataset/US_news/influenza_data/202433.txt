Through our ongoing wild bird surveillance program, APHIS collects and tests large numbers of samples from wild birds in the North American flyways. It is not uncommon to detect avian influenza in wild birds, as avian influenza viruses circulate freely in those populations without the birds appearing sick. In addition to monitoring for avian influenza in wild bird populations, APHIS monitors for the virus in commercial and backyard birds.With the recent detections of the Eurasian H5 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds and domestic poultry in the United States, bird owners should review their biosecurity practices and stay vigilant to protect poultry and pet birds from this disease. APHIS is working closely with State partners on surveillance, reporting, and control efforts.

Monitoring the performance of flu vaccines is important for understanding and improving the benefits of flu vaccination. Overview Over the past few years, CDC has conducted VE studies using multiple networks, including the U.S. Flu VE Network, Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network, the National Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN), and the VISION VE Network. The Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) was previously used to estimate VE among hospitalized adults but it ended enrollment on July 31, 2021, and is no longer being used. CDC continues to collect information on adults hospitalized with flu through IVY and VISION. Additional studies evaluating VE include the Respiratory Virus Transmission Network (RVTN) and the Randomized Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Efficacy Network (RAIVEN). Some flu vaccine effectiveness networks are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of other vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. FLU VE NETWORK‎ Started in 2004-2005 and collects vaccine effectiveness data on outpatient illness with laboratory-confirmed flu IVY‎ Started in 2019 to collect data on how well flu vaccines work at preventing severe flu among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In 2021, IVY expanded to also enroll all patients hospitalized with flu or COVID-19, and in 2022, IVY expanded again to enroll patients hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). NVSN‎ Started in 2015-2016 and collects vaccine effectiveness data on pediatric hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed flu in children 18 years and younger. VISION‎ Started in 2019 and collects data to evaluate how well seasonal flu vaccines protect people against flu and how well different COVID-19 vaccines protect against COVID-19. Additional Studies Evaluating Vaccine Effectiveness Respiratory Virus Transmission Network‎ Started in 2021 and prospectively collects data on people with laboratory-confirmed flu or COVID-19 and assesses rates of transmission to household members. The data are used to compare household transmission among vaccinated people to household transmission among unvaccinated people. Randomized Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Efficacy Network (RAIVEN)‎ A research collaboration between CDC, Westat, and multiple sites in the United States to conduct randomized trials to evaluate how well different flu vaccines protect people 18-64 years old against flu. Previous Vaccine Effectiveness Networks HAIVEN‎ HAIVEN ended enrollment July 31, 2021, and is no longer being used.

Two types of SIV are available for children in Hong Kong and other locations: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), administered through intramuscular injection, and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), administered via nasal spray. We aimed to understand how vaccine hesitancy shaped parental preference for LAIV versus IIV, particularly amidst important public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the massive rollout of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.MethodsWe employed a concurrent mixed-methods design. The quantitative part involves longitudinal surveys spanning three years, from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic periods, tracking parental vaccine hesitancy and preference for SIV types. The qualitative part involves 48 in-depth interviews, providing insights into parental preference for SIV types, underlying reasons, and related values.ResultsOur quantitative analyses show an overall increase in parental vaccine hesitancy and preference for LAIV over IIV after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and especially after the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Further logistic regression modelling based on the cohort data shows that higher vaccine hesitancy, coupled with the COVID-19 vaccination campaign rollout, predicts a greater preference for LAIV over IIV. The qualitative analysis complements these results, highlighting that LAIV’s non-invasive nature aligns with parental values of prioritizing natural immunity and concerns about overmedication, leading to a more acceptable attitude towards LAIV.ConclusionsLeveraging the higher acceptability of LAIV compared to IIV among parents with high vaccine hesitancy could promote childhood vaccination uptake.Plain language summary We examined how parents’ concerns about vaccines and major public health events affected their preference for different types of seasonal influenza vaccines for children. Currently, children can receive either an injected vaccine or a nasal-spray vaccine. We tracked parental vaccine hesitancy and their preferences for different types of vaccines over three years covering a period before the COVID-19 pandemic and a period during the pandemic. Parents became more hesitant about seasonal influenza vaccines for children after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Higher vaccine hesitancy and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines predicted a greater preference for nasal-spray vaccines for children among parents. Parents preferred the non-invasive nature of the nasal-spray vaccines and were concerned about overmedication, particularly vaccines that were administered via injection. We suggest that the nasal-spray vaccines could be one option offered to address high parental vaccine hesitancy.

According to findings from a multi-country meta-analysis study spanning 25 years, the overall pooled influenza-associated hospitalization rate was 40.5 per 100,000 persons, with young children aged 0–4 years having a significantly higher rate at 224.0 per 100,000 persons2. Another study conducted in Hong Kong found that in the early phase of the 2018/19 winter influenza season, 21.2% of children aged 6–17 admitted to hospitals with febrile acute respiratory illness tested positive for influenza A or B3. Robust evidence supports the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) in reducing influenza-related illnesses among children of all ages and reducing influenza transmission within the community4. Specifically, SIV uptake greatly lowers the risk of influenza-related hospitalization by 53.7–64.3% compared to unvaccinated children aged 3 to 5 years. For children aged 6–17 years, the reduction in hospitalization risk ranged from 36.6% to 51.3% compared to their unvaccinated counterparts4. Recognizing the high vaccine effectiveness, important initiatives, such as providing free SIV through school outreach vaccination programs, have been implemented in Hong Kong5. Due to these endeavours, the estimated vaccine coverage rates reached 48.5% for children under 5 years old and 69.3% for primary school children in 2020. Nevertheless, the persistent parental vaccine hesitancy due to episodic events and vaccine-resistant values and beliefs can challenge the continuous success of existing influenza vaccination programs for children6,7.Two types of SIV are widely available: the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), administered through intramuscular injection, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), administered through nasal spray and has been approved for use in children aged over 2 years8. While previous research has extensively explored the multifaceted factors contributing to parental vaccine hesitancy regarding the influenza vaccine for their children9,10, most of these studies have predominantly focused on IIV, often overlooking the distinct characteristics of LAIV. Many contributing factors, including concerns about the general safety and efficacy of vaccines11,12, perceptions of an excessive number of childhood vaccines13, preference for natural immunity14, vaccine-specific issues such as administrative barriers (e.g., time constraints and access issues), and contextual factors such as trust in the healthcare system15,16, have commonly been examined. However, it remains unknown how the unique features associated with LAIV can help parents overcome these concerns and barriers to children’s vaccination uptake. Given that LAIV offers a different mode of administration that is notably more convenient17,18 and less painful19,20, it may elicit more favorable attitudes toward vaccination, especially in existing hesitant groups. For example, one previous study revealed a direct association between hesitant attitudes and a preference for nasal administration19. However, this study was based on a cross-sectional design, and the causal relationship between vaccine hesitancy and the preference for LAIV warrants further investigation. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that LAIV has comparable efficacy to IIV in children21,22,23,24. However, there may be challenges in expanding the use of LAIV due to logistical issues such as cold chain requirements, vaccine production complexity, and specific storage conditions, as well as potential differences in cost25. Nonetheless, the potential of LAIV in addressing parental vaccine hesitancy is a crucial factor that should not be overlooked. Therefore, it underscores the urgent need for further investigation into the relationship between parental vaccine hesitancy and preference for different vaccine types. This could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of vaccine hesitancy and provide valuable insights into how to effectively address parental vaccine hesitancy by considering their preferences for vaccine types.Furthermore, amidst the global prevalence of COVID-19, research has shown that parental attitudes towards influenza vaccination may be largely influenced by the pandemic, the pandemic control measures, and vaccine-related policies especially the introduction of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. For instance, a study conducted in the USA during the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 influenza seasons identified a consistent decline in influenza vaccine uptake among children, regardless of their COVID-19 vaccine status26. This suggests that factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination, such as safety concerns and mistrust in COVID-19 vaccines or the government27, have had a spill-over effect on SIV uptake in children. Meanwhile, the introduction of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in Hong Kong may add additional pressure and concerns for parents who have already perceived an overabundance of childhood immunization schedules. Consequently, the interplay of these factors holds the potential to shape parents’ preferences regarding SIV between different vaccine types.To our knowledge, no studies have systematically examined the dynamic relationships between parental vaccine hesitancy and major public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the vaccination program, in shaping parental preferences for influenza vaccine types and the underlying reasons for these choices. To bridge this critical research gap, our study implemented a concurrent mixed-methods design, encompassing both quantitative (longitudinal surveys) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) components, which were conducted in parallel. The school-based seasonal influenza vaccination program (SIVP) in Hong Kong had reached over 80% of primary schools and 70% of kindergartens by 20215. Carried out from September 2019 to December 2021, the study spanned two key events: the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the massive rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in March 2021, which was expanded to include children later in early 2022 in stages with children as young as three years old being able to receive vaccination starting from 15 February 202228. This allowed us to examine the impact of these two public health events on parental vaccine hesitancy and their preference for LAIV or IIV. To enhance clarity and reference, we designated three distinct periods: Pre-pandemic, marking the timeframe before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; Pandemic Pre-vaccine, denoting the period between the pandemic onset and the initiation of the vaccination rollout; and Pandemic Post-vaccine, indicating the timeframe following the widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines.This study has two main objectives. Objective 1 was to explore the temporal evolution of parental vaccine hesitancy and parental preference for different types of SIV over three years and examine their relationship. For this objective, we utilized the longitudinal data to investigate whether parental vaccine hesitancy and major public health events including the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines could predict parental preferences for specific SIV types (LAIV vs. IIV) for their young children by testing several hypotheses. First, that parental vaccine hesitancy shows an increase from the Pandemic Pre-vaccine period to the Pandemic Post-vaccine period within the pandemic context. Second, that the proportion of parents preferring LAIV increases from the Pre-pandemic period to the pandemic period, and from the Pandemic Pre-vaccine period to the Pandemic Post-vaccine period within the pandemic context. Third, that parents with higher vaccine hesitancy are more likely to prefer LAIV over IIV to those with lower vaccine hesitancy. Fourth, that parents’ preference for LAIV increases more from the Pandemic Pre-vaccine period to the Pandemic Post-vaccine period among those vaccine-hesitant parents. The second objective was to combine the open-ended questions in the questionnaire-based surveys across three years and in-depth qualitative interview data over two years for a more comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind parents’ choices between IIV and LAIV.Our quantitative analyses show an overall increase in parental vaccine hesitancy and preference for LAIV over IIV after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and especially after the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Further logistic regression modelling based on the cohort data shows that higher vaccine hesitancy, couples with the COVID-19 vaccination campaign rollout, predicts a greater preference for LAIV over IIV. The qualitative analysis complements these results, highlighting that LAIV’s non-invasive nature aligns with parental values of prioritizing natural immunity and concerns about overmedication, leading to a more acceptable attitude towards LAIV.MethodsThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong (reference number: UW19-200). The longitudinal survey and in-depth interviews were parts of the project to monitor parents’ acceptability of the school-based SIV in Hong Kong and their preference for LAIV and IIV5. Figure 1 depicts the study timelines and the context of the expansion of the school-based SIVP in Hong Kong.Fig. 1: Overview of the study procedures and the major public health events.“SIVP”: seasonal influenza vaccination program. The icons represent the key events during our study period. The red solid line represents the survey period, while the blue solid line represents the in-depth interview period. The key milestones of SIVP and COVID-19-related events in Hong Kong were labeled in corresponding months.Full size imageParticipants from the longitudinal surveyParticipants were recruited by a local survey company between September and December 2019 using random-digital-dialed household interviews. Eligible participants were required to meet the following criteria: (1) being adult parents with at least one child enrolled in a kindergarten or primary school in Hong Kong; (2) reporting that their school-aged child had no medical contraindication to vaccines, and (3) being capable to understand and communicate in either Cantonese or Mandarin. In each eligible household, only one parent was invited to participate in the baseline survey with responses based on their youngest eligible child. At the end of the baseline survey, participants were asked about their willingness to take part in our follow-up survey in the following year. In September and October 2020, those who agreed to be re-contacted were approached for a follow-up survey. Notably, we experienced a substantial loss of participants in the second year, with a follow-up rate of 56.5%, primarily due to disruptions caused by the pandemic and ineligibility (e.g., the participant’s youngest child entering a secondary school particularly among parents who had only one young child). To obtain an adequate sample size for the third-year survey, we opted to newly recruit more parents from a random online panel using an online survey. All participants who had completed the second-year follow-up survey were queried about their willingness to participate in an additional survey in the third year. In September-October 2021, we re-contacted both those who had completed the second-year follow-up survey and those who had completed the baseline survey but did not respond to the second-year survey. Informed consent was obtained verbally for the telephone survey or electronically for the online survey before the interviews started. A supermarket coupon valued at approximately USD 6 was provided to participants upon completion of each survey. A detailed flow chart outlining our recruitment procedures is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.Measures for longitudinal surveyThe primary outcome was the preferred SIV type selected by parents, with participants being presented with the choice between an intramuscular injection vaccine (IIV), a nasal-spray vaccine (LAIV), or neither type. Notably, considering only a limited number of schools opted to provide LAIV within the school outreach program, we chose not to use the actual SIV type received by children as our primary outcome measure. The primary outcome remained consistent across the three-year surveys with the same question: If you can freely choose between a needle-injected vaccine and a nasal-spray vaccine, which type of flu vaccine will you choose for your child? A four-item scale of parental vaccine-hesitant attitudes (e.g., I dislike giving my child any vaccine except for the compulsory ones) adapted from the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines Short Scale (PACV-5) was used consistently over the three years29. A set of demographic variables were also collected in each survey, including parental age, sex, educational attainment, monthly household income, and number of children entering a primary school or kindergarten. Information concerning the eligible child’s previous SIV uptake experience was collected. In addition, a multiple-choice question was presented in the three-year surveys to gain insights into parents’ perceptions of LAIV compared to IIV. For example, parents were asked: Compared to IIV, children’s acceptance of LAIV is? Response options ranged from 1 (Much lower) to 5 (Much higher). A detailed description of our measurement instruments is provided in Supplementary Table 1.Statistics and reproducibilityFirst, we conducted descriptive analyses to compare participants’ key demographic characteristics, vaccine-hesitant attitudes (VH score, computed as the average score from the four-item Likert-scale questions), preferred SIV types and actual received vaccine types over the three-year period. We extracted records of participants who consistently attended the surveys across all three-time points, forming a distinct cohort for examining the causal relationship between key variables. Specifically, we first checked the normality of the distribution of the vaccine-hesitant attitudes scores by examining kurtosis statistics. Given the kurtosis scores were less than 3, indicative of a non-normally distributed variable for VH scores. To test H1 and H2, the average VH scores were stratified by SIV type preference (LAIV or IIV) and survey period. One-way Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyse differences between groups based on type preferences and time periods, with Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. For testing H3 and H4, the whole sample was categorized into three distinct groups: low vaccine hesitancy (VH scores ranging from 1.0 to 2.0), moderate (VH scores from 2.1 to 3.0), and high (VH scores from 3.1 to 5.0). Binary logistic regression was used to measure the association between SIV type preferences (LAIV vs. IIV) and vaccine hesitancy category as well as study periods. Regression models were adjusted for selected covariates determined a priori based on previously described differences in cohorts and model fits, including age, gender, educational obtainment and family monthly income. To offer stronger evidence on the causal association between vaccine-hesitant attitudes and vaccine type preference, in our subsequent analysis, we leveraged the advantage of our longitudinal design by conducting a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model to provide further support for H3 and H4. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether higher levels of vaccine hesitancy, the launch of a mass injection-based vaccination program, and their potential interactions could predict parents’ preference for an LAIV. The GEE analysis was performed among the cohort with repeated measures for these variables. The Neither option of preference for vaccine type was coded as a missing value (11.9% in the total sample, and 8.8% in the longitudinal cohort) in both our logistic regression and GEE models considering our primary interest was to predict parents’ preference of LAIV over IIV. Lastly, we presented descriptive statistics pertaining to the reasons endorsed by parents for selecting LAIV instead of IIV. Our statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS26.0 and RStudio 2023.6.1, data visualizations were performed using RStudio 2023.6.1 and Tableau Desktop 2021.4.3. Codes and data for replicating all the results are available on the Open Science Framework30.Participants from the in-depth interviewsWe conducted qualitative interviews in both 2020 and 2021 using separate samples. Participants’ characteristics are provided in Supplementary Data 230. In 2020, participants were identified from the 2019 survey (baseline survey), while in 2021, participants were identified from the 2020 survey. We used purposive sampling to select parents with heterogeneous demographics, vaccine-hesitant attitudes, status of their children SIV, and the type of SIV (IIV vs. LAIV) received from the pool to increase variability in parents’ opinions and discussion. The current study focused on the underlying reasons of parental preference for different types of SIV to supplement understanding of the quantitative part. Therefore, we only presented results regarding parental preference for SIV type obtained from the qualitative data. After obtaining verbal consent from each participant, in-depth interview was conducted over the telephone one by one. A total of 48 qualitative interviews were conducted over the two years. Each interview lasted ~50 minutes and was audiotaped. Participants provided consents for publishing their responses anonymously later. We incentivized each participant with a supermarket coupon valued at USD 13 to compensate for their time.Thematic analysis of in-depth interviewsEach interview was transcribed verbatim first, then two researchers (JY & MD) independently coded the interviews. Afterward, the two researchers discussed the codes together and resolved any disagreements by iteratively going back to the data until a seminal codebook was created. A third researcher (QL) reviewed the main categories and codes and finalized the thematic framework. To facilitate interpretation, we organized our qualitative results by parental vaccine-hesitant or refusal status. Specifically, parents were categorized into either SIV acceptor or SIV hesitatorefuser groups based on their self-reported SIV uptake status for their children in the past 12 months. All the data were organized using NVivo 12.0 (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Data of qualitative interviews for this study is not publicly available for privacy reasons but may be made available to qualified researchers on reasonable request from the corresponding author.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsParticipants characteristicsOur quantitative data involved 1302 respondents in the Pre-pandemic period, 958 respondents in the Pandemic Pre-vaccine period, and 566 responses in the Pandemic Post-vaccine period, with response rates of 62.9%, 56.5%, and 47.2%, respectively. Among them, a subset of 376 participants were followed up across all three rounds. Parents aged 35-44 years, females, and those with tertiary or higher educational level were more likely to respond to the survey across the three years. More than 60% of the participants reported having only one child. It’s worth noting that while more than one-third of participants intended to receive the LAIV, the actual receipt of LAIV remained relatively low, with rates below 3% in both 2019 and 2020, though this slightly increased to 8.4% in 2021 (Supplementary Data 1)30. This is mainly due to only a limited number of schools opting to provide LAIV within the school outreach program20.Changes in vaccine hesitancy and preference for LAIV and IIV over timeConsidering that only a limited number of schools opted to provide LAIV within the school outreach program, we chose not to use the actual SIV type received by children as our primary outcome measure. This was aimed to mitigate the impact of school choices on the type of SIV used, thus preventing an underestimation of parental acceptability of LAIV. Alternatively, our study focused on the preferred SIV type selected by parents, with participants given the choices of a needle-injected vaccine (IIV), a nasal-spray vaccine (LAIV), or neither type. The overview of vaccine-hesitant attitudes (VH) score data, stratified by SIV preference group and survey period, is presented in Fig. 2. Overall, the results supported the H1, a significant increase in average VH scores from 2020 [IIV: median (IQR) = 2.50 (1.00); LAIV: median (IQR) = 2.50 (1.25)] to 2021 [IIV: median (IQR) = 2.75 (1.25); LAIV: median (IQR) = 3.00 (1.50)] was observed. We also observed a significant increase in preference for LAIV over IIV from the Pandemic Pre-vaccine period (IIV: 50.3%, LAIV: 34.3%) to the Pandemic Post-vaccine period (IIV: 44.0%, LAIV: 49.3%, p < 0.05, tested using the chi-square test). This indicates a noteworthy dual escalation in vaccine hesitancy and preference for LAIV over time, particularly after a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign rolled out. Remarkably, across the three time periods, parents who had higher levels of VH scores were more likely to report preferring LAIV over IIV compared to those who had lower VH scores.Fig. 2: Overall Vaccine-hesitant attitudes scores stratified by SIV type preferences and the three time periods based on the whole sample (N = 1302).“SIV”: seasonal influenza vaccine; “IIV”: inactivated influenza vaccine; “LAIV”: live attenuated influenza vaccine. The VH score is determined by calculating the mean of the IIV group (Blue) and the LAIV group (Red), stratified by time periods. One-way Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed to test differences between groups for each SIV type preference and time point. The statistical details for the mean, median, and IQR can be found in Supplementary Table 2. P-values have undergone Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons, denoted as follows: * for P < 0.01, ** for P < 0.05, and *** for P < 0.001. Insignificant comparisons (P > 0.05) were not shown.Full size imageDo vaccine hesitancy and public health events predict parental SIV type preferences?To answer this question, we conducted analyses for the whole sample and the cohort data (repeated measures across three years). We first used a multivariable logistic model to examine the associations of parental SIV type preference with vaccine hesitancy levels and periods (indicators of public health events) adjusting for demographic factors, including age, gender, educational attainment, and income for the whole sample (N = 1302). As is shown in Table 1, vaccine hesitancy level is significantly associated with parental SIV type preference. Parents with high vaccine hesitancy were more likely to prefer LAIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.69, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.36-2.10). Parental SIV type preferences in the Pandemic Pre-vaccine period were not significantly different from that in the Pre-pandemic period (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.80-1.17), but significantly different from that in the later Pandemic Post-vaccine period (aOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.23-1.89). Additionally, there were significant differences in the odds of parental SIV type preferences by gender, educational attainment, and monthly household income. Specifically, there was a lower likelihood of preferring LAIV among those who were female (aOR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.65-0.92), but a higher likelihood of preferring LAIV among those with a higher monthly income (aOR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.02-1.57 for a monthly income of 30,000 and 59,999 and aOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.13-1.86 for a monthly income of above 60 000), and those with tertiary or above educational attainment (aOR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.09-1.62). The breakdown of variable details can be found in Supplementary Table 3.Table 1 Multivariable logistic regression of parental SIV type preferences and associated determinants conducted in the whole sample (N = 1302)Full size tableTo offer stronger evidence on the causal relationship of SIV type preferences with vaccine hesitancy levels and time periods, Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model was conducted in the cohort who participated in all three waves of the survey (N = 376). Table 2 shows that, parents having high vaccine hesitancy had 1.9 times higher odds of preferring LAIV than those with low vaccine hesitancy (95%CI: 1.02-3.59, p = 0.042). In addition, parents reporting LAIV as their preferred SIV type had 1.6 times higher odds of reporting such preference type in the later COVID-19 vaccine rollout period, compared to the Pre-pandemic period (95%CI: 1.09-2.42, p = 0.017). Furthermore, female parents showed lower odds of reporting LAIV as their SIV preference type compared to male parents (95%CI: 0.41-0.83, p = 0.003). Parents with a higher household income (ranging between 30,000 and 59,999) also had higher odds of preferring LAIV than those with lower household income (95%CI: 1.07-2.53, p = 0.024). We did not observe a significant interaction effect between vaccine hesitancy and the survey period, which means that H4 is not supported. Overall, the results suggest that parents with higher levels of vaccine hesitancy consistently favored LAIV over IIV throughout the pandemic.Table 2 GEE logistic regression on predicting parental preferred type of SIV (N = 376)Full size tableQualitative Insights Behind Vaccine-hesitant ParentsTo gain a deeper understanding of the reasons for parental preferences for different SIV types, we combined data from a set of multiple-choice questions included in our three-year surveys with qualitative insights obtained through in-depth interviews conducted over a two-year period. In the questionnaire-based survey, parents were asked to compare LAIV with IIV on several attributes, including administration mode-related attributes such as acceptability for children, convenience, discomfort, and vaccination-related fear, and vaccine-specific attributes such as efficacy, safety, and side effects. Parents who reported choosing neither type of SIV for children in the next 12 months were identified and categorized as either vaccine hesitators or refusers. As illustrated in Fig. 3, parents who were vaccine hesitators or refusers perceived that LAIV had more favorable attributes than IIV. Overall, 62.9% of the parents who were vaccine hesitators or refusers believed that LAIV was more acceptable for children compared to IIV. They also had more positive attitudes toward LAIV, except that almost half of the parents (47.4%) believed that LAIV would be less effective compared to IIV. Supplementary Data 3 illustrates the assessment of attributes by parents who had a particular preference for IIV or LAIV30. Results found that parents who favored IIV predominantly believed that IIV was more effective than LAIV. In contrast, parents who preferred LAIV cited several factors, including the perception that LAIV was less invasive and less uncomfortable for children. Moreover, those preferred LAIV perceived that LAIV was more readily accepted by children and more convenient for administration.Fig. 3: Assessment of attributes by parents who chose neither type of SIV types preference across three years (N = 227).“IIV”: inactivated influenza vaccine; “LAIV”: live attenuated influenza vaccine. The data has been filtered to show only those who prefer neither as their preferred vaccine type. The bar chart displays the percentage of responses for each vaccine-specific attribute over three years. The color-coding indicates whether each attribute of LAIV is more (red), the same (pink), or less (blue) than IIV.Full size imageAdditionally, we integrated insights from the 48 qualitative interviews, during which we specifically inquired about parents’ reasons for choosing either LAIV or IIV, or neither. Likewise, we classified parents into either SIV hesitatorefuser or SIV acceptor. SIV hesitatorefuser was identified from the interviewee’s self-reported vaccination status of their children (those who reported that their child didn’t receive any type of SIV in the past year). To ease interpretation, we presented the major themes relating to preference for LAIV or no vaccination among SIV hesitatorsefusers as our primary results, while findings for SIV acceptors are included in Supplementary Data 330. Below we present four major themes related to preferring LAIV or no vaccines among parents who were hesitant or refused to vaccinate their children.Preference for naturalnessOur qualitative interviews consistently found that parents who were vaccine-hesitant or refusal often grounded their reluctance in their preference for naturalness. Specifically, these parents preferred relying on their children’s immune systems to combat viruses rather than opting for a vaccine, especially one involving invasive medical procedures. Preference for naturalness was also intertwined with the concern about excessive medication of giving multiple shots to children which was perceived to potentially compromise children’s natural immunity. Such naturalness value and concern about excessive medication drove their preference for LAIV over IIV.“I believe children themselves already have some immunity. If I can make sure they are (children) eating healthily and exercise regularly, I believe such natural defence could be better. This is my personal belief… If I have to choose, I think LAIV will be more acceptable. You know, children are afraid about pain and needles, but if they (schools) change to (offer) LAIV, maybe they can encourage more parents like me to take a flu vaccine.” (PS06).Fear of needlesWhen asked to choose between LAIV and IIV, SIV hesitatorefuser indicated that LAIV caused less needle fear in children, making it potentially more acceptable for them. Some vaccine-hesitant or refusal parents automatically differentiated nasal-spray vaccines and needle-injection vaccines by claiming that LAIV would not directly go into child’s body as would a needle injection, which appeared linking to their preference for naturalness.“I don’t think they (children) need a vaccine. But if I must (let my child) receive (a vaccine), maybe I will choose the LAIV, because children will have less fear about nasal spray…Also, I think LAIV will not directly go into the body like the needle injection.” (PS16).“I find LAIV should be easier to administer because it causes less pain. I believe LAIV is more acceptable both for me as a parent and for my child.” (PR11).Ignorance to LAIVVery few participants automatically mentioned LAIV. When prompted by the interviewer, three parents from the SIV hesitatorefuser group mentioned that they knew little about the nasal-spray LAIV, or had never heard about it. The ignorance to the alternative vaccine led to choosing no vaccination among these parents.“I never heard about LAIV. I would not read school’s notifications carefully. I will not let my child take the vaccine anyway.” (PS18).Misperceptions about the efficacy of LAIVSince many schools didn’t offer LAIV as an alternative vaccine for children’s influenza vaccination, most parents lacked understanding about and experience with LAIV. Misperceptions about the efficacy of LAIV were consistently identified due to lacking information and experiences. For example, one parent who was hesitant or refused to vaccinate her child with SIV expressed concerns about the low dosage of LAIV which was perceived to be less effective.“I am uncertain about the effectiveness of LAIV for primary school children. I noticed that doctors administered only small doses of the vaccine…” (PS16).Some parents misbelieved that LAIV could not be fully absorbed by children as it was administered through nasal spray, which was perceived to have reduced protective effects.In contrast, if a child had previously been vaccinated with the LAIV, parents seldom had such misperceptions about the efficacy of LAIV. This may be because that an enhanced understanding had gained from the experience or that good understanding about LAIV drove choosing LAIV. For example, one parent with two children attending schools that provided both IIV and LAIV was more positive about LAIV and paid more attention to its greater acceptance in children (more details in Supplementary Data 3)30.DiscussionIn this longitudinal, mixed-methods study, our primary findings revealed an increase in parental vaccine hesitancy and preference for LAIV over IIV after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and especially after the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Further examination of their relationships indicates that high vaccine hesitancy and the massive rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign predict a greater preference for LAIV over IIV. An in-depth exploration into the underlying reasons behind the preference for LAIV by vaccine-hesitant or refusal parents supplemented our interpretation of the quantitative results. The qualitative analyses revealed that the injection-free and less intrusive characteristics of LAIV aligned with parental core values of prioritizing children’s natural immunity and concerns about overmedication. As a result, LAIV was perceived as less invasive and more acceptable for parents who were indecisive of getting SIV for their children or refused to do so.Existing cross-sectional studies have observed a growing parental willingness to get SIV for their children, from before the pandemic to during the pandemic31,32. However, a recent longitudinal study did not find a significant change in overall parental vaccine hesitancy after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic or the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination program33. Instead, they identified changes in parents’ specific vaccine attitudes. Notably, following the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, parents became more concerned about taking multiple vaccinations for their children simultaneously. They also showed an increasing willingness to rely on natural infection for developing children’s immunity rather than vaccination29. Our study observed an increase in parental vaccine hesitancy after the rollout of a citywide COVID-19 vaccination campaign. This suggests that the introduction of a new vaccine could be the primary factor for increasing parental vaccine hesitancy, possibly stemming from concerns about overmedication or excessive reliance on medical interventions for their children29. The widespread misinformation and negative news about COVID-19 vaccines34 and the extensive promotion of a new vaccine especially the introduction of vaccine pass may further intensify parental concerns that multiple vaccines could strain children’s immunity, ultimately leading to an increase in parental vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, regarding demographic factors, our findings indicate that individuals with higher income and educational attainment express a stronger preference for choosing LAIV. Notably, in Hong Kong, the subsidized program for LAIV is exclusive to kindergartens, requiring parents to incur additional costs if they choose LAIV for primary school children. This financial aspect sheds light on the prevalence of primary schools in Hong Kong offering IIV instead of LAIV in their school-based SIVP, as the extra charges could pose additional challenges for the schools’ logistical arrangements35.Our cohort data revealed that parents with higher vaccine hesitancy had a greater preference for choosing LAIV over IIV for their children. In Hong Kong, LAIV was initially available from 2009 to 2013 but was discontinued for use after 2013, possibly due to concerns stemming from its reported low effectiveness during the 2013-2016 seasons in the United States36. It was later recommended for children starting from the 2018/2019 season due to an observed improvement in antibody response compared to previous seasons36. It was suggested that the ease of administration by nasal spray and readily acceptability by children37 made LAIV an ideal choice for rapid deployment with a high coverage rate for annual immunization in the school-based setting23,38. A study in France found that parents preferred LAIV due to various advantages, including the absence of needles, reduced pain, and easier administration18. Additionally, nearly 80% of children indicated a preference for vaccination via nasal spray39. All this existing evidence helps to explain why parents with high vaccine hesitancy tend to prefer LAIV. Needle and injection fear has been identified as one critical attitude root contributing to vaccine hesitancy40,41. This attitude root has been found to explain approximately 10% of cases of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy41. Furthermore, it is twice as prevalent in parents with non-vaccinated children compared to those whose children have already been vaccinated42. A recent systematic review identified needle-related fears and phobias as one of the top three reasons behind anti-vaccination arguments43. All these findings highlight the need to address parental vaccine hesitancy by targeting their needle-related fear and phobia. However, in the context of the pandemic, the introduction of additional injection-based vaccinations has added further challenges in addressing parental vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, the needle-free delivery mode of LAIV, which is perceived as less intrusive19, may help to address parents’ vaccine hesitancy due to worry about multiple injections and the overmedicalization of vaccination.A deeper exploration of the underlying reasons found that parents who are vaccine-hesitant or refusing tended to evaluate LAIV as a safer, more convenient, less uncomfortable, and thereby more acceptable alternative compared to IIV. Our survey found that 85.5% of vaccine-hesitant or refusing parents believed that LAIV was either more or equally safe as IIV. Our qualitative interviews further revealed that their perception of high safety for LAIV was influenced by their preference for natural options, specifically a reliance on children’s natural immunity. In the context of vaccines, this preference may be challenged as vaccines typically contain a weakened form of the virus and vaccines given by injection involve breaking the body’s membrane to stimulate an immune response44. Driven by the naturalness value, parents tended to avoid invasive medical interventions and prefer the more natural methods of health management such as relying on children’s innate immune defences45,46, contributing to heightened vaccine delay or refusal47. In addition, this underlying preference for naturalness was closely linked to parents’ concern that the multiple vaccinations would overwhelm children’s immunity48,49. LAIV emerged as a promising alternative to align with parental underlying naturalness preference. A recent study suggested that in comparison with IIV, LAIV was perceived as more controllable, less threatening, and less invasive to the immune system, making it more appealing especially to the vaccine-hesitant groups19. Building on this, our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of parental preference for LAIV through in-depth qualitative analyses. Some parents believed that LAIV would not directly enter children’s bodies thereby was less invasive. Although this perception was a misinterpretation of LAIV, the nasal spray mode and the perceived less invasiveness of LAIV coincided with the parents’ underlying values of prioritizing naturalness, alleviating their concerns about overmedication and invasiveness. However, despite LAIV being considered a probable option for vaccine-hesitant or refusal parents, most vaccine acceptors still chose IIV over LAIV. In Hong Kong, IIV remained the dominant option in school-based SIV programs. School’s choice strongly influenced parental preference for SIV types. Parents who chose IIV over LAIV often based their evaluation on a hypothetical understanding of LAIV, leading to misperceptions about LAIV, including low efficacy, poor absorption, safety concerns due to novel technology, and discomfort caused by nasal spray. We also found that 47.4% of parents who did not choose any type of SIV believed that LAIV was less effective than IIV due to misperceptions such that vaccines given through nasal spray could not be fully absorbed. This suggests that misunderstanding and a lack of experience regarding LAIV could diminish parental acceptability of LAIV. Notably, parents who had direct experiences with both IIV and LAIV did not have such misperceptions about LAIV. Instead, they tend to favor LAIV more. This suggests that parents are more likely to choose the vaccine type that aligns better with their values by comparing the nature of the two vaccine types once they have obtained relevant experiences.Our findings provide several implications for addressing parental vaccine hesitancy and refusal. First, LAIV can be one promising option for promoting SIV uptake among children, especially among hesitant and refusing parents who are concerned about multiple injections and have a strong purity value41. Some vaccination programs have already leveraged the benefits of nasal spray administration to increase vaccine uptake rates (e.g.50). However, instead of solely introducing LAIV as a nasal spray vaccine in children’s influenza vaccination program, communication to emphasize its painless, injection-free, and easy-to-administer features is equally important as these features strongly resonate with the underlying values of hesitant parents. In our qualitative interviews, we also encountered some vaccine-hesitant or refusing parents who remained reluctant to choose either type of SIV. Additionally, some parents held misconceptions about LAIV due to a lack of knowledge and experience, even though LAIV is actually more effective than IIV in protecting children against influenza, as demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis study24. This underscores the importance of addressing the knowledge deficit regarding LAIV among parents. Specifically, messages should leverage parents’ existing high safety perception of LAIV by emphasizing its easy-to-administer and low intrusiveness characteristics, while also reassuring parents of its high efficacy. Furthermore, IIV remains the predominant option in most schools. This indicates that many schools remain hesitant to introduce LAIV due to a lack of understanding about its characteristics, challenges in effectively communicating its features to parents, and concerns related to additional costs and administrative barriers20. IIV remains the most conventional choice and has been familiar and a more trustworthy one for parents who have gotten used to this vaccine type. However, to enhance parental vaccination willingness, especially among vaccine-hesitant or refusing parents, LAIV can be introduced as an option in school-based SIV programs. It’s equally important to incorporate LAIV into free-of-charge initiatives, reinforcing schools’ confidence in managing both vaccines. This will broaden the choices available to parents at no additional cost, enabling them to align their vaccination decisions with individual preferences and concerns.Our study used a longitudinal design, spanning from the pre-pandemic to the post-pandemic periods, with repeated assessments of parental preferences for different types of SIV. This study design allowed us to track the temporal evolution of parental vaccine hesitancy and preference for SIV types along with the occurrence of important public health events. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses provided robust evidence to examine a longitudinal relationship between vaccine hesitancy and the preference for different vaccine types. In addition, we complemented our study with qualitative analyses to enhance our understanding of parental preferences for SIV types. Despite this, the current study has several limitations. First, a large proportion of participants were lost during the three-year follow-up, primarily due to the disruptions of the pandemic during which people lost interest in other health topics other than COVID-19. Second, although the qualitative data indicated perceived controllability and the preference for naturalness may contribute to higher acceptability for LAIV, the associations cannot be verified in the quantitative data because naturalness preference was not measured in the survey. Third, parental preferences for SIV types could be different from their actual choice. We only examined parental preference regarding specific SIV types because the majority of schools in our study exclusively offered IIV in their SIV programs. Fourth, the lack of differentiation in parental vaccine preference questions for each child restricted our ability to explore the effect of children’s ages or educational levels on parental vaccine preference. Future studies could employ a more nuanced questionnaire design to investigate the potential variations. Fifth, one potential limitation of this study is self-selection bias. Participants were given the choice to opt-in for the follow-up study, which could introduce a bias in the sample composition. To address this concern, we compared the demographic characteristics of participants who completed the follow-up surveys with those who did not. The results showed no significant differences, except that those who completed the follow-up tended to be younger and had lower household income levels (p < 0.05, tested using the chi-square test).ConclusionOur quantitative data revealed that higher parental vaccine hesitancy was associated with a preference for LAIV over IIV for their children’s SIV uptake. A significant increase in parental vaccine hesitancy was observed following the launch of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program. Moreover, heightened levels of vaccine hesitancy, coupled with the pandemic post-vaccine rollout period, emerged as predictive factors for a stronger preference for LAIV over injection-based IIV. Our qualitative data further indicate that the preference for LAIV is rooted in the parental value of prioritizing natural options, which encompasses a preference for relying on natural immunity and a desire to avoid overmedication. Parents who were hesitant or refused to take the SIV were found to be more inclined to opt for LAIV over IIV. This preference for LAIV was attributed to the perception that it was less invasive to children’s immune systems, caused less pain and discomfort, and was more acceptable for children. Future risk communication should leverage the acceptability of LAIV in hesitant parents to increase childhood vaccination uptake.

Transmission between animals continues to occur and, to date, a limited number of human infections have been reported. Although additional human infections associated with exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments are likely to continue to occur, the overall public health impact of such infections at a global level is minor.

Status of HPAIv Understanding the timing and distribution of virus spread is critical for global commercial and wildlife biosecurity management. The current global HPAIv panzootic poses a serious threat to animals and public health, having affected approximately 600 bird and mammal species globally and over 83 million birds across North America as of December 2023. Of particular concern is the transmission of the virus to mammals, including the recent discovery of infections in dairy cattle in the U.S. and the detection of HPAIv in milk, posing a significant human health concern. While previous studies linked bird migrations to avian flu outbreaks at poultry farms, only one earlier study by USGS authors predicted the virus could spread to cattle. It found wild waterfowl moving between natural wetlands and cattle facilities, likely attracted to supplemental water and food sources when natural resources dwindled along the Pacific Flyway. Sources/Usage: Public Domain. View Media Details Predictive Models & Key Findings The study combined extensive, long-term GPS tracking data from 16 species of wild waterfowl across North America with on-ground, county-level HPAIv surveillance data to understand the overlap of waterfowl and HPAIv detections. The researchers were also able to predict future outbreaks in counties and provincial areas through bird movements using a novel empirical SI (Susceptible-Infected) model, similar to the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model used to model COVID disease dynamics, via exposed migratory waterfowl. The SI model projected exposure of up to 100% of birds via ‘outbreak’ exposure in counties with HPAIv occurrence during spring migration, except for Pacific flyway birds, which were predicted to experience widespread arrival of HPAIv via ‘birdbird’ exposure (up to 100%) during fall migration. The SI model accurately predicted HPAIv arrival in all flyways by migratory waterfowl, raptors, and ‘other’ birds but was a lagging indicator for commercial facilities, Pelicans, and resident waterfowl/captive species in the Pacific flyway. Management Implications Accurately predicting the location and timing of animal-borne disease spread, can prevent further outbreaks in animals, including humans, by strategically prioritizing risk management, monitoring and biosecurity in vulnerable areas. Tracking pathways of disease introduction or exposure provides a better opportunity to enhance early detection and rapid response for managing HPAIv and disease risk. Combining animal movement studies and disease surveillance in predictive models may be the most powerful tool to presage disease spread and get ahead of outbreaks Sources/Usage: Public Domain. View Media Details Looking Forward The study suggests that current tracking efforts are not sufficient to effectively predict disease spread, as evidenced by the lack of consistency with the established understanding of HPAIv dynamics, particularly in Pelicans. The development of a proactive, consistent, and taxonomically diverse telemetry-based wildlife monitoring program could enhance surveillance and risk management of zoonotic viruses that threaten wildlife and human health. A system called AIMS for Wildlife has been described by USGS scientists and makes large-scale animal movement data streams combined with environmental and other data available in near real-time to wildlife managers to promote true adaptive management.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation cell death pathway, holds unique implications for the antioxidant defense system, with possible contributions to inflammation. This exploration focuses on the dynamic interplay between ferroptosis and the host defense against viruses, emphasizing the influence of IFV infections on the activation of the ferroptosis pathway. IFV causes different types of cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis. IFV-induced ferroptotic cell death is mediated by alterations in iron homeostasis, intensifying the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and promoting lipid peroxidation. A comprehensive investigation into the mechanism of ferroptosis in viral infections, specifically IFV, has great potential to identify therapeutic strategies. This understanding may pave the way for the development of drugs using ferroptosis inhibitors, presenting an effective approach to suppress viral infections. IntroductionInfluenza virus (IFV), is among the major respiratory viruses that have caused significant mortality and health issues, imposing a significant economic burden on society [1, 2]. The worldwide dissemination of this virus has resulted in numerous outbreaks and pandemics, emphasizing the critical importance of obtaining a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms [3,4,5]. Viruses manipulate diverse cellular metabolic and regulatory pathways to facilitate the progression of the pathogenic process, which can result in different forms of cell death within their target cells [6]. Moreover, cell death is significant in the host reaction to viral infection. Cell death mechanisms have the potential to restrict virus reproduction within the affected host cell and at the same time trigger innate and pro-inflammatory immune reactions against the viral infection [7]. Among different cell death pathways, ferroptosis represents a distinctive form of controlled cell death distinguished by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [8, 9].Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent oxidation-regulated cell death, is characterized by changes in iron balance and overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) as well as irregular lipid peroxidation (LPO) [10, 11]. Storage of harmful plasma membrane lipid peroxides and initiation of cell lysis represent potential risks associated with ferroptosis and may lead to the developments of pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders and cancer [12, 13]. Furthermore, there is compelling evidence to suggest that ferroptosis contributes significantly to inflammation [14]. Ferroptosis is distinguished by unique morphological and chemical attributes. It also exhibits variations in the genes involved and regulatory pathways, which distinguishes it from other programmed cell deaths such as apoptosis and necroptosis [15]. It typically induces morphological alterations in the energy-generating organelle of a cell. This results in the development of smaller mitochondria with heightened membrane density, the decrease or elimination of cristae, and the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, distinguishing it from other forms of cell death [16]. Ferroptosis induces significant biochemical alterations, encompassing iron and ROS accumulation, stimulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, suppression of the Xc-system, decreased glutathione (GSH) levels, increased NOX activity, and secretion of arachidonic acid (AA) mediators [17, 18]. In contrast to the biochemical changes observed in ferroptosis, the biochemical modifications in apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis consist of DNA fragmentation, elevated lysosomal activity, and diminished ATP levels, respectively [16].Consequently, this article aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between ferroptosis and host defense mechanisms against IFV infections. By exploring how IFV infection triggers the ferroptosis pathway and leads to inflammation, this study provides novel insights that could inform the development of new antiviral strategies.Overview of ferroptosisRole of Iron in ferroptotic processesIron metabolism plays a role in essential cellular processes, including DNA synthesis and mitochondrial respiration. Imbalances in iron homeostasis have the potential to induce cellular damage [19]. An increase in cellular iron accumulation plays a role in ferroptotic death [20]. Regulators of iron metabolism, from iron absorption and storage to release, could have an effect on ferroptosis (Fig. 1) [21].Fig. 1Exploring how lipid peroxidation, alterations in iron metabolism, and changes in the antioxidant system contribute to ferroptosis. (A) In antioxidant pathway, cystine enters the cell through the Xc-System and converted to cysteine and then GSH in the cell, which activates GPX-4. Ferroptosis inhibited when GPX-4 reduces P-LOOH to PLOH. (B) The Fenton reaction creates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH⋅) by reacting Fe2 + with H2O2, generating Fe3+. This process drives a cycle of oxidative stress, leading to increased free radicals and lipid peroxidation. (C) Lipid peroxidation (LPO) in cell membranes, crucial for ferroptosis, occurs when antioxidant defenses like GPX-4 and GSH are impaired. Long-chain fatty acids, particularly those activated by ACSL4 such as arachidonic acid (AA), contribute to ferroptosis through the formation of AA-acyl Co-A and AA-PE. AA-PE then oxidized by 15-LOX to produce lipid hydroperoxides, which, in the presence of labile Fe2+, generate radicals that damage cellular membranes. Abbreviations; HMOX1: heme oxygenase 1; Lip: lipid iron pool; FPN: Ferroportin; TF: Transferrin; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acids; ACSL4: acyl-CoA synthetases 4; LPCTA3: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3; ALOX: arachidonate lipoxygenase; GSH: Reduced glutathione; GPX-4: Glutathione peroxidase 4; GSSG: Glutathione disulfideFull size imageThe redox characteristics of iron involve it in reactions that generate ROS, causing oxidative damage to lipids and potentially resulting in the accumulation of lipid ROS or ferroptosis [22]. Fenton reaction contributes to the generation of extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH⋅) by combining ferrous iron (Fe2+) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and producing Fe3+ (Fig. 1B) [23]. The onset of iron-induced oxidative stress triggers a self-perpetuating cycle, resulting in increased iron release and increased production of free radicals. The proximity of ROS production to membrane phospholipids that peroxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), causes the production of lipid hydroperoxides and α,β-unsaturated 4-hydroxyaldehydes [24].Hephaestin is a ferroxidase enzyme, which facilitates the conversion of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), a critical step in the absorption of dietary iron from the small intestine iron exporter (FPN1: Ferroportin 1) and allows the binding of iron to the blood transporter, transferrin (TF) [25, 26]. This process allows the transfer of iron by TF to red blood cell precursors and various tissues [25]. Gao et al., identified transferrin as the active component related to ferroptosis through a four-step fractionation procedure of dialyzed FBS, ultimately purifying a single protein that correlated with lethal activity. Removal of transferrin from FBS reduced cell death, while addition of commercial bovine holotransferrin-induced cell death, confirmed the role of transferrin in ferroptosis [27]. Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) facilitates the uptake of TF that transports ferric iron into endosomes through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The low pH of the endosome causes the release of Fe3+ from transferrin. Prostate epithelial 6-transmembrane antigen 3 (STEAP3) converts released Fe3+ to Fe2+, and divalent metal iron transporter-1 (DMT1) transports ferrous iron to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, Fe2+ can reach cells through ZIP8/ZIP14 (zinc transporters) [28]. In study on the role of TFR2 in ferroptosis, Tong et al. found that elevated TFR2 expression stimulated the production of ROS and LPO. TFR2 also promoted cellular susceptibility to ferroptosis inducers, Erastin and RSL3, while ferrostatin-1 )Fer-1( and DFO (ferroptosis suppressors) effectively mitigated TRF2-mediated LPO, restoring cellular activity [29].An elevation in cellular labile iron pool (LIP), which contains predominantly Fe2+, is the result of increased heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) activity, a reduction in FPN expression, and an increase in TF expression, which potentially leading to ferroptosis (Fig. 1B) [30, 31]. Furthermore, ferritin, which is the cellular iron storage protein, undergoes autophagy-mediated degradation by autolysosomes, elevating intracellular iron. This phenomenon, called ferritinophagy, can cause increased ROS and the onset of ferroptosis [32]. NCOA4 aids in the transport of ferritin to autolysosomes [33]. Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) plays a crucial role in storing excess cellular iron. The mitochondrial electron transport chain depends on the crucial cofactors such as heme and iron-sulfur groups, both of which are iron dependent [34]. Wang et al. found that in brains of iron-increased ischemic mice, the absence of FtMt caused more severe damage and showed molecular indicators of ferroptosis, such as accumulated free iron, increased LPO, and exacerbation of GSH inhibition. Consequently, these findings may underline the critical role of FtMt in protecting against ferroptosis [35].Mechanisms of ferroptosis lipid peroxidation (LPO)The LPO mechanism involves the binding of oxygen to lipids, resulting in the production of lipid hydroperoxides and peroxyl radicals [36]. The increased ROS from lipids, leading to the cell death through oxidative stress, is specifically identified as ferroptosis [37]. Alterations in the shape and curvature of lipid membranes improve the accessibility of oxidants, accelerating membrane degradation and causing the disappearance of ferroptotic cells [38].LPO in cell membranes occurs when the activity of key antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4) and GSH, is altered. Phospholipids associated with PUFAs are essential for lipid peroxidation, a determinant of ferroptosis (Fig. 1C) [39]. The critical sites in lipids that drive ferroptosis are the bis-allylic carbons, which are vulnerable to attack by free radicals and lipoxygenase enzymes as well as oxygen, due to their adjacency to a double-bonded carbon–carbon pair [40]. Long-chain fatty acids activated by acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) like ACSL4 which interact with arachidonic acid (AA), influence cell sensitivity to ferroptosis [39]. ACSL4 facilitates the binding of AA to generate AA-acyl Co-A, which are then converted to phosphatidylethanolamines (AA-PE) by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCTA3). 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) oxidizes AA-PE and produce lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), which serve as key factor of ferroptosis (Fig. 1C) [41]. Lipid hydroperoxides (PL-PUFA-OOH) interact with labile Fe2+ (in Fenton chemistry), producing the PL-PUFA-O⋅ radical, which can trigger peroxidation in neighboring phospholipids, causing membrane damage [42]. GPX-4, as an antioxidants, mitigates ferroptosis by reducing and converting lipid hydroperoxides (PL-PUFA-OOH) to lipid alcohols (PL-PUFA-OH) [42]. Additionally, other antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E interact with peroxyl radicals to produce peroxides. Subsequently, GSH and GPX-4 can detoxify the generated oxidized lipids [36].Regulatory proteins and pathwaysThe initial trigger of ferroptosis is the dysfunction of the system Xc−, a membrane antiporter that plays a role in cellular cystine import and glutamate export [37, 43]. The Xc system is formed by the xCT light chain (SLC7A11), which is connected by a disulfide bond to the heavy chain (4F2hc) [44]. The alteration in the Xc system prevents the uptake of cystine, interrupts the biosynthesis of GSH, causing an increase in of lipid reactive oxygen species, triggering oxidative cellular damage, and inducing ferroptosis (Fig. 1A) [37]. Research indicates that SLC7A11 is crucial for suppressing ferroptosis in acinar cells by maintaining both GSH level and ROS balance [45].A study on regulation of the Xc system revealed that stimulation of sensing stressor, transcription factor 3 (ATF3), can lead to erastin-induced ferroptosis by suppressing the Xc-system and decreasing the level of GSH through direct regulation of the SLC7A11 promoter [46]. Furthermore, silencing BECN1 hinders ferroptosis induced by Xc-system suppressors such as erastin, sulfasalazine, and sorafenib. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a role in BECN1 phosphorylation of at serine, which is vital for the formation of the complex between BECN1 and SLC7A11, as well as lipid peroxidation [47]. Cystine enters the cell through the Xc-System, where it is transformed into cysteine and subsequently contributes to the production of GSH. Within the GPX-4 cycle, P-LOOH (which can be generated by the Fenton reaction) oxidizes GPX-4-SeH to GPX-4-SeOH (Fig. 1A). GSH plays a crucial role in activating GPX-4, thereby preventing its deactivation through the release of GSSG. The reduction of GSSG back to GSH is facilitated by enzymes such as glutathione reductase (GR) and the cofactor NADPH. Ferroptosis is inhibited when P-LOOH is converted to PLOH through the action of GPX-4 [48]. Ferroptosis inhibitors, such as Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) and ubiquinone (CoQ10), work similarly to GSH. The reduction of CoQ10 to ubiquinol by FSP1 transform it into a lipophilic radical scavenger, effectively preventing ferroptosis (Fig. 1A) [49].The regulation of ferroptosis encompasses various signaling pathways. AMPK inhibits ferroptosis by reducing lipogenesis, while glucose promotes ferroptosis by counteracting AMPK. Furthermore, E-cadherin–NF2–Hippo prevents ferroptosis by reducing YAP-mediated transcription. p53 and BAP1 also play a role in suppressing SLC7A11 transcription, which reduces cystine import and leads to ferroptotic cell death [50].Currently, multiple drugs have been identified to stimulate ferroptosis, classified into four categories according to their ability to inhibit the Xc-system and GSH, directly inhibit GPX-4, reduce GPX-4 and CoQ10 protein, and induce lipid peroxidation [51]. Class 1 ferroptosis inducers such as Erastin, piperazine erastin, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE), sulfasalazine and sorafenib as well as glutamate target the Xc− system. RSL3, a class 2 inducer, acts on GPX-4. FIN56 and CIL56, as class 3 inducer, reduce the levels of GPX-4 and coQ10, while FINO2 (class 4) induces lipid peroxidation. In contrast, iron chelators (DFO, cyclipirox, deferiprone), lipophilic antioxidants (e.g., vit E, Fer-1, CoQ10), D-PUFA (e.g., D4-arachidonic acid), and LOX inhibitors are ferroptosis suppressors [40].Mitochondria role in ferroptosisMitochondria are thought to be associated with ferroptotic signaling pathways due to their roles in ATP synthesis, ROS production, iron homeostasis, and maintaining redox balance [34]. Several mitochondrial enzyme systems, such as ACSL4, lysophos-phatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), and acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 (ACSF2), are involved in lipid metabolism and play role in ferroptosis [52]. ACSF2 in mitochondria, controls fatty acid activation and synthesis, crucial for lipid peroxidation and erastin-induced ferroptosis. ACSL4 in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is another key pro-ferroptosis gene involved in lipid metabolism [52]. On the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)-CoQH2 pathway, facilitates the conversion of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate (OA) and concurrently regenerates CoQH2 to neutralize lipid radicals, consequently suppress ferroptosis. Mitochondrial GPX4 (mGPX4) and DHODH-CoQH2 separately but both convert CoQ to CoQH2 [53].Mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated by fission, fusion, and mitophagy, but these processes can become dysregulated. Various mitochondria-regulated molecules, including the fission genes (DRP1 and FIS1), the fusion-related genes (MFN1/2 and OPA1), and the mitophagy-related genes (PINK1 and FUNDC1), play a role in ferroptosis [54]. Inhibiting both ferritinophagy and mitophagy (by double knockdown of NCOA4 and PINK1) nearly prevents O-GlcNAcylation-induced ferroptosis indicating that ferroptosis and mitochondrial dynamics are co-regulated, and any imbalance between them disrupts cellular homeostasis [54]. In interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis, after cerebral ischemiaeperfusion injury, the NOD LRR pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in microglia was activated by mitochondrial dysfunction, which involves mitochondrial ROS, DNA damage, and cardiolipin release. This activation leads to pyroptosis and other cell deaths, such as ferroptosis [55] Research showed that controlled NLRP3 inflammasome activation is vital for homeostasis. ROS regulates this activation, with elevated ROS causing cell damage via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, augmented ROS can facilitate viral spread between cells and heighten susceptibility to respiratory viruses [56].IFV infection reduced total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), GPX, and catalase activities in A549 cells while significantly increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS levels, indicating induced oxidative stress injury [56]. The IAV polymerase basic 2 (PB2), with its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, transports IAV into mitochondria, disrupting their fusion and fission balance, leading to fragmentation and superoxide ion leakage. Additionally, the NS1 protein also trigger mitochondrial fragmentation, boosting ROS generation and enhancing IAV replication and pathogenesis [57].Unveiling links between ferroptosis and host defense mechanisms against virusesFerroptosis promotes inflammation and releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) [58]. Intense oxidative stress, caused by ROS, amplifies LPO, initiating ferroptotic cell death. This process releases DAMPs, which activates inflammation through receptors such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and NF-κB. [59, 60]. Cell stress can induce ATP release, which then activates purinoreceptors and facilitates key survival mechanisms [61]. Researches have highlighted the involvement of extracellular ATP in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by DAMPs [62]. Moreover, macrophages are crucial in efferocytosis by generating nitric oxide (NO) and ROS, removing apoptotic cells, and secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines [63]. Redox Imbalance and elevated LPO induce inflammation, and proinflammatory cytokines worsen oxidative stress. In the process of ferroptosis, activation of NF-κB increases cytokine release, while inhibition of ferroptosis with Trolox can reduce TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 [64]. Furthermore, LPO alters low-density lipoprotein, promoting inflammation through macrophage polarization. GPX-4, mitigates ferroptosis and inflammation by preventing the oxidation of AA and NF-κB, while increasing inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and 12-lipoxygenase. Furthermore, iron participates in the modulation of the immune system by influencing the polarization of M1 macrophage [59, 65]. IL-6 influences ferritin expression in iron metabolism, promoting inflammation. In degenerative chondrocytes, IL-6 induces LPO and iron imbalance, worsening intervertebral disc injuries [66].Ferroptosis is also induced in adaptive immune cells, specifically T cells (CD8+), by ACSL4 and CD36, while SLC7A11 and GPX-4 suppress it. Furthermore, ferroptosis can impair IgM secretion from B lymphocytes and Marginal Zone B (MZB) cells by reducing GPX-4 activity. CD36 also plays a role in ferroptosis by uptaking PUFAs [67]. Signaling pathways associated with inflammation may be related to ferroptosis. Kong et al. revealed that interferon-γ induced a reduction in GSH levels, induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and elevated ROS level and lipid peroxidation leading to ferroptosis. IFNγ by stimulating JAK/STAT cell signaling can negatively regulate the expression of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 of the Xc-system, highlighting its role in promoting ferroptosis [68]. The TNF-α/IL-6-ERK pathway was also upregulated in ischemiaeperfusion following ferroptosis [69]. The complement system, crucial for host defense against viral infections, is often targeted by viruses that develop mechanisms to evade or deregulate it, thereby elevating infectivity and worsening disease symptoms [70]. A study in a murine model indicates that the Coxsackie virus can induce ferroptosis by altering the complement components, C4b and C3. This study demonstrated that the ferroptosis inhibitor, fer-1, successfully mitigated inflammation in viral infection and prohibited ferroptosis in Coxsackie virus-induced myocarditis [71]. Additionally, several viruses interfere with iron absorption and the antioxidant system, so they require iron for optimal replication of their genome. This leads them to compete with the host for iron uptake. Viruses can enhance cellular iron uptake by downregulating hepcidin expression or increasing DMT expression [9, 72].Host cells response to increased ROS/LPO accumulationEnzymes and molecules, both endogenous and exogenous, protect cells from oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals and metabolizing toxic aldehydes from lipid peroxidation. Endogenous enzymes include GPX, SOD, glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase, thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin peroxidase (TRXP), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), and HMOX1. Nonenzymatic antioxidants include GSH, proteins like ferritin, TF, albumin, ceruloplasmin, and molecules such as uric acid, coenzyme Q, and lipoic acid [73, 74].Antioxidant mechanisms are regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2) and membrane repair during ferroptosis involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-III) activation [74]. Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements in gene promoters like GPX4, SLC7A11, HMOX1, and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 to scavenge ROS. It also reduces Fe uptake by downregulating TFR1 and DMT1, and increases GSH synthesis by upregulating glutamate-cysteine ligase [75]. Therefore, activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway has been shown to inhibit ferroptosis. In cell peroxidation, Keap1 expression was inhibited, leading to the dissociation of NRF2-Keap1. This allowed NRF2 to enter the nucleus, increase antioxidant protein expression, and decrease ROS and oxidative stress damage [76]. Moreover, Oxidative stress could induction lipid droplet accumulation [77]. Lipid droplets (LDs) regarded as a lipid storage organelle which have antioxidative activity, reducing ROS levels and preventing PUFA peroxidation by sequestering these lipids in their cores, making them less accessible to ROS [78].Interplay between influenza virus and ferroptosisFerroptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several viral infections including IFV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, enteroviruses [79]. Studies have demonstrated a connection between ferroptosis and the reduction of CD4 cells after HIV infection [80, 81]. When primary CD4 cells are infected with wild-type HIV-1, these HIV-infected cells show increased regulated cell death, including ferroptosis. Xiao and colleagues observed that traditional markers of ferroptosis were evident in the CD4 T cells of HIV immune non-responders [81]. These markers included heightened lipid peroxidation within mitochondria and damage to mitochondrial structure (81). Moreover, it has been found that, the HIV-1 transcriptional activator of transcription (Tat) protein boosts ACSL4 expression via exosomes secreted by infected cells. This overexpression results in lipid accumulation, heightening the risk of ferroptosis [82]. Furthermore, HIV can elevate cellular iron levels by utilizing hepcidin-mediated degradation of ferroportin, which in turn enhances HIV transcription, replication, and release [83, 84]. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, various molecular changes contribute to ferroptosis in the lungs [85]. The infection decreases GPX4 expression in Vero cells, weakening lipid repair mechanisms and increasing vulnerability to lipid peroxidation. The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 also suppress the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, which normally defends against oxidative damage. Elevated serum ferritin levels in severe COVID-19 cases correlate with disease severity, as ferritin provides iron that promotes ferroptosis. Disruptions in iron metabolism are indicated by altered iron homeostasis proteins and higher levels of reactive iron in the lungs. Additionally, lipid peroxidation has been noted in cardiovascular complications related to COVID-19 and in the heart pacemakers of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster models [85, 86]. In addition, an in vitro study has shown that enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A6, can increase ACSL4 expression, thereby triggering ferroptosis [87]. These observations indicate that ferroptosis is closely associated with various viral infections, which could potentially be a therapeutic target in the future. However, our focus here is on the relationship between ferroptosis and IFV infection.IFV is known to induce multiple forms of cell death, including apoptosis and necrosis [88,89,90,91]. Recent studies suggest a potential link between IFV and ferroptosis, marked by elevated iron levels, release of ROS, and lipid peroxidation (Fig. 2A) [92]. This intricate relationship between ferroptosis and IFV opens avenues to explore novel therapeutic interventions.Fig. 2Ferroptosis in viral infections and unravelling the mechanisms underlying ferroptotic cell death induced by influenza virus. (A) Research indicates that the influenza virus can induce ferroptosis in the host by impacting lipid peroxidation, disrupting antioxidant systems like the Xc-, GPX-4, and GSH pathways, and causing mitochondrial dysfunction. (B) During influenza infection, lung epithelial cells and macrophages release IFP35, which drives the cytokine storm. Studies show that IFP35 exacerbates ferroptosis and lung damage, while its knockdown reduces both ferroptosis and lung injury. PGE2 hampers immunity against influenza by suppressing macrophage and T-cell functions. Proanthocyanidins (PAs) reduce lung damage, inflammation, and ferroptosis in influenza-induced acute lung injury (ALI) by lowering IFN-γ levels. Abbreviations; IAV: Influenza A virus; SIV: Swine influenza virus; LPO: lipid peroxidation; Fer-1: Ferrostatin-1; HIF-1-alpha: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1; iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthase; VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; MDA: MalondialdehydeFull size imageAs shown in Table 1, evidence suggests a connection between ferroptosis and the destruction of nasal epithelial cells, which is triggered by inflammation resulting from the influenza virus. IFV H1N1 infection induces alterations in the expression of genes and metabolites associated with ferroptotic cell death in human nasal epithelial progenitor cells (hNEPCs). A notable decrease in the expressions of Nrf2/KEAP1 and GCLC (catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase) is observed, along with impaired glutaminolysis (Fig. 2A) [93]. The KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway serves as a primary mechanism to protect cells against oxidative stress. NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-like-2) is recognized not only for its ability to alleviate inflammation and counteract oxidative damage but also for its antiviral properties, particularly to inhibit IFV replication [94]. Liu et al. reported that IFV H1N1 can trigger ferroptosis in hNECs through the NRF2-KEAP1-GCLC signaling pathway [93]. In another study, by using murine lung epithelial cells, it was revealed that IFV triggers ferroptosis. The discerned indicators of influenza-induced ferroptosis encompassed mitochondrial impairment, increased ROS release, elevated intracellular iron levels, decreased GPX-4 gene expression, and increased LPO by the presence of ACSL4. Enhanced activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), along with the induction of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) within the HIF-1 signaling pathway were other properties of IFV-mediated ferroptosis [95, 96]. ACSL4, as a crucial factor of ferroptosis, is used for IFV replication process [87]. ACSL4, present in the ER, colocalized with dsRNA (viral replication marker) and calnexin (ER marker) during CV-A6 infection, confirming its participation in the viral replication complex. Furthermore, Kung et al. reported that IFV titers decreased in ACSL4-deficient cells, underscoring the role of ACSL4 as a key host component in the virus replication process [87].Table 1 Influenza infection and ferroptosis signature in several studiesFull size tableAs well, key mechanisms driving ROS production after IAV infection are dysfunctional mitochondria, activated NADPH oxidase, and suppressed antioxidant pathways [57]. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the replication of IFV. A study by Liu et al. investigated the function of tripartite motif containing 16 (TRIM16) in relation to oxidative stress triggered by infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus [97]. Their findings revealed that, during H5N1 infection, ROS levels in A549 cells reached their highest point 24 h after infection. Additionally, there was a noted decrease in the expression levels of several antioxidant genes, including NRF2, GCLC, GCLM, SLC7A11, NADPH, GPX2, and HO-1. Moreover, they found that elevated levels of the TRIM16 protein can diminish the titer of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and enhance the expression of antioxidant genes in A549 cells by activating the SQSTM1/NRF2/KEAP1 antioxidant pathway during H5N1 HPAIV infection. Under normal conditions, TRIM16 interacts with NRF2 and facilitates its ubiquitination by promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination. Given that SLC7A11 is closely linked to ferroptosis, TRIM16 might also influence ferroptosis in cells [97]. Oxidative stress intensifies lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but antioxidants such as GSH precursors can effectively mitigate these effects [98]. It has been suggested that the redox state of host cells can affect viral replication [99]. The replication of IFV is influenced by the redox state of host cells, as evidenced by Bcl-2 expression and GSH levels [100]. Cells with higher Bcl-2 and GSH exhibited reduced viral replication, affecting the expression of late viral proteins (HA and M) and the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of viral ribonucleoproteins. Reduced HA expression in cells with elevated GSH levels might be related to reducing environments that disrupted disulfide bond formation, hindering proper folding and maturation of HA, and subsequently affecting its translocation and integration into the membrane [100].Furthermore, it has been observed that ROS generation is necessary to initiate macroautophagy/autophagy in the context of IFV infection. Specifically, the IFV M2 protein triggers the formation of ROS, a crucial step to stimulate macroautophagy/autophagy [101]. Furthermore, IFV H1N1 infection causes oxidative stress and severe lung damage, with ROS generation regulated by superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). The study found that SOD1 is reduced during IFV infection, possibly due to enhanced autophagy, which is activated early in infection and contributes to increased ROS [102]. During an infection, autophagy can lead to the accumulation of ROS, which may trigger ferroptosis [9]. Alternatively, autophagy can facilitate ferroptosis by breaking down ferritin [103]. It was found that autophagy plays a role in ferroptosis by targeting and degrading ferritin in fibroblasts and cancer cells. When the genes Atg5 and Atg7, essential for autophagy, were disrupted, there was a reduction in ferroptosis induced by erastin, evidenced by lower levels of intracellular ferrous iron and decreased lipid peroxidation. Notably, NCOA4 emerged as a key receptor responsible for the selective autophagic degradation of ferritin, known as ferritinophagy, which is crucial for ferroptosis. Inhibition of NCOA4 led to reduced ferritin breakdown and a decrease in ferroptosis, whereas overexpression of NCOA4 enhanced ferritin degradation and intensified ferroptosis [103]. It is crucial to emphasize that autophagy often occurs alongside ferroptosis, and these processes are interconnected in various ways [32, 41, 103].Viruses can use TfR1 as an entry receptor, taking control of iron transport to elevate iron uptake and TfR1 expression. This may contribute to iron accumulation, promoting ferroptosis and intensifying disease severity in later stages of viral infection [8]. Investigations into the entry protein involved in IFV endocytosis showed that lack of TfR1 reduces IFV entry. IFV hemagglutinin exploited TfR1 recycling as a revolving-door process to undergo host endocytosis [104]. IFV H5N1 alters the iron balance of the host cell by degrading the lysosome-associated membrane protein and releasing iron-rich lysosomal contents, which can probably trigger oxidative stress or ferroptosis [105]. During influenza infection, lung epithelial cells and the innate immune system, through macrophages, secrete interferon-induced protein 35 (IFP35), which significantly contributes to the cytokine storm triggered by the IFV infection (Fig. 2B) [106]. Dai et al. found that IFP35 is related to ferroptosis by initiating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Nrf2. In vivo investigations on the involvement of IFP35 in Staphylococcal-induced lung infection demonstrated that IFP35 amplifies ferroptosis, thereby contributing to lung damage. Furthermore, knockdown of IFP35 alleviated both ferroptosis and subsequent lung injury [75]. However, in the case of IFV infection it is unclear that this IFP35 leads to ferroptosis or not and further studies are needed. As well, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which released from ferroptotic cells, may regulate immunity. PGE2 may negatively affect immunity against IFV by suppressing both macrophage antigen presentation and T-cell immune responses (Fig. 2B) [107, 108]. Another research examined the impact of Proanthocyanidins (PAs) on ferroptosis during an IAV infection [109]. In this study, mice were nasally inoculated with IAV to trigger acute lung injury (ALI). The infection notably exacerbated pathological damage and pulmonary edema in the mice. Firstly, the study found that IAV infection led to a reduction in GPX4 and SLC7A11 levels, while simultaneously increasing the mRNA and protein levels of ACSL4. These findings indicate that ferroptosis is heightened in IAV-induced ALI [109]. Secondly, they assess the protective impact of PAs and explore the possible mechanisms against IAV-induced ALI, which will be detailed in the following section.Lysosomes, crucial in iron metabolism, contain a significant amount of redox-active iron [9]. Lysosomes play an active role in ferroptosis by influencing iron levels within the cell, notably through the disruption of transferrin transport and ferritin degradation. Additionally, lysosomal activity generates ROS, including lipid peroxides. Moreover, lysosomal cathepsin B has been identified as a factor in GSH depletion, and STAT3, a cathepsin B activator, may thus participate in the ferroptosis process [9]. Viral infections, such as H5N1 influenza, can damage lysosomes and release redox-active iron. It was reported that H5N1 neuraminidase can degrade lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP), triggering cell death [110]. Degradation of ferritin by released lysosomal enzymes leads to iron accumulation, which can cause lipid peroxidation or trigger ferroptosis [9]. Furthermore, other IFV subtypes, such as H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV), have been shown to trigger ferroptosis [92]. In the study by Cheng et al., it was found that when A549 cells were infected with the SIV, the infection disrupted the Xc−/GPX4 axis, leading to a reduction in GSH levels and an increase in lipid peroxidation products like MDA (Fig. 2A). The SIV infection caused a significant rise in Fe2+ levels and ROS accumulation within the infected cells. The infection also caused a substantial depletion of GSH, compromising the cells’ antioxidant defenses. As a critical coenzyme for GSH reductase, NADPH is essential for maintaining GSH levels, and its decreased levels were observed in response to SIV infection. As well, in SIV infection, there was a reduction in the levels of SLC7A11, SLC3A2L, and GPX4, along with an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 [92]. Additionally, they examined the effectiveness of Fer-1 in preventing ferroptosis, which is detailed in the following section. In a separate study aimed at assessing the antiviral properties of metastable iron sulfides (mFeS), researchers noted that IFV can trigger ferroptosis [111]. They observed that IFV causes a depletion of intracellular GSH, an increase in lipid ROS and lipid peroxidation, a reduction in GPX4 levels, and an elevation of intracellular iron during IFV infection. Furthermore, Liproxastatin-1 was found to effectively block the replication of the influenza virus within cells, suggesting that the virus’s replication process depends on cellular ferroptosis [111]. Additionally, The redox state of host cells has been linked to IAV replication, emphasizing the importance of cellular ferroptosis [100]. In this context, the study introduces the concept of Oxeiptosis, a form of ROS-induced cell death independent of known pathways, suggesting an interplay between ROS-induced cell death pathways and their role in limiting harmful inflammation [112].In conclusion, the studies indicate that IFV significantly relies on ferroptosis to drive inflammation and enhance its replication. IFV infection triggers ferroptosis by causing oxidative stress, which leads to increased levels of reactive oxygen species ROS and intracellular iron. The interplay between ferroptosis and oxidative stress underscores the virus’s strategy to exploit these processes for its benefit. This understanding provides important insights into how IFV exacerbates inflammation and highlights potential avenues for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating ferroptosis to mitigate the severe effects of influenza infections.Obligate intracellular pathogens and ferroptosisEvidence suggests that some pathogens exploit ferroptosis to enhance their replication. For instance, it was reported that intracellular pathogen could modulates host cell ferroptosis to enhance its intracellular replication and release. Brucella trigger ferroptosis in macrophages by suppressing the GPX4-GSH axis late in infection but alleviates it early on by upregulating the GCH1-BH4 axis. Manipulating host cell ferroptosis helps Brucella control its intracellular replication and release [113]. Moreover, a mycobacterial effector, tyrosine phosphatase A secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), could induces ferroptosis to enhance Mtb pathogenicity and spread [114]. Kung et al. demonstrated that ACSL4 is indispensable for the replication of Coxsackieviruses [87]. The study revealed that the virus facilitates the generation of viral replicative compartments and virus assembly by recruiting ACSL4. Moreover, the virus enhances lipid peroxidation through ACSL4, triggering ferroptosis in cells and ultimately facilitating viral release. Their research also revealed that inhibitors targeting ferroptosis, specifically ACSL4, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, resulted in a reduction in the viral load of Coxsackievirus. This suggests that ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis stands out as an attractive target for the treatment of viral infections [87]. Moreover, treating macrophages from mice infected with the murine hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 with a Fer-1 led to reduced viral replication, lower secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased formation of cell syncytia [115]. Furthermore, use of liproxstatin-1 (ferroptosis inhibitor) mitigates lung inflammation and injuries. RNA-seq analysis showed that MHV-A59 infection increases ACSL1 expression, a key ferroptosis gene, independently of TLR4 but dependent on NF-kB [115]. Kan et al. demonstrated that NDV infection leads to the upregulation of p53 expression and concurrent downregulation of SLC7A11 and Gpx4 [116]. This orchestrated regulation during infection induces ferroptosis in Malignant cells, characterized by a notable elevation in the amounts of ROS and lipid peroxides. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms through which NDV influences cellular processes, ultimately promoting ferroptosis in cancerous cells [116].These examples illustrate how various obligate intracellular pathogens exploit ferroptosis pathways to enhance their replication. Understanding these mechanisms provides valuable insights that could be applied to the study of IFV. Further research into how IFV may similarly manipulate ferroptosis could reveal novel therapeutic targets and strategies to combat influenza infections.Antiviral activity of ferroptosis inhibitorsInfluenza remains a significant global health challenge, causing substantial morbidity and mortality each year. Despite advancements in antiviral therapies and vaccines, the continuous evolution of the influenza virus poses persistent threats, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. One such promising avenue lies in targeting cell death pathways, particularly ferroptosis. Ferroptosis inhibitors have emerged as potent therapeutic candidates in this context (Table 2). Here we describe several ferroptosis inhibitors which have a therapeutic effect against IFV.Table 2 Ferroptosis inhibitors in the context of IFV infectionFull size tableJHU-083JHU-083 is a small molecule compound which acts as an antagonist to glutaminase, effectively blocking glutamine metabolism. This compound has been applied in treating cancers and infections, yielding promising outcomes [117,118,119,120]. In the case of IFV infecrion researchers tested it on mice by administering it through intraperitoneal injection. JHU-083 appears to modulate the ferroptosis caused by H1N1 infection in hNECs [93]. After treatment with JHU-083, levels of AKG and NADPH dropped. The activity of nasal mucosal cells, stimulated by the H1N1 virus, increased under JHU-083 treatment, while lipid peroxidation, intracellular ROS, MDA, 4-HNE, and iron content significantly decreased. Additionally, expression levels of NRF2, KEAP1, HO-1, NQO1, SLC7A11, GPX4, GCLC, and GCLM in nasal mucosal tissue of mice exposed to JHU-083 and H1N1 were reduced. Intracellular levels of MDA and 4-HNE also significantly decreased following JHU-083 treatment. Furthermore, inflammation in the nasal mucosa and lungs was notably reduced, and the inflammatory markers IFN-α, CXCL10, and MCP-1 in nasal lavage fluid of the treated mice were significantly lowered. These findings indicate that JHU-083 effectively inhibits the ferroptosis triggered by the H1N1 virus and can also lessen the intensity of the associated inflammation [93].Maxing shigan decoction (MXSGD)Another notable formulation is the Maxing Shigan Decoction (MXSGD), originating from the treatise on Cold-Induced Diseases. This traditional remedy is a prescription for addressing lung ailments and is composed of a blend of various ingredients [121]. In a study led by Huang and colleagues, the effects of MXSGD were initially examined in vitro, to uncover its mechanism of action in ferroptosis triggered by IAV [95]. When cells were exposed to IAV, there was an increase in ROS release and elevated levels of total iron and ferrous ions. However, MXSGD was shown to effectively curb this ROS release and reduce both total iron and ferrous ions. The treatment with MXSGD not only decreased the intracellular viral load but also mitigated ROS levels and iron content, repaired mitochondrial damage, and suppressed cellular ferroptosis as well as the HIF-1 signaling pathway [95]. Furthermore, in the in vivo model revealed that MXSGD significantly improved pulmonary conditions in IAV-infected mice, alleviating congestion, edema, and inflammation, while also inhibiting the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins and the HIF-1 signaling pathway in lung tissues [95].Tripartite motif containing 16 (TRIM16)The tripartite-motif (TRIM) family is a major group of potential single-protein RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, playing crucial roles in various cellular signaling pathways and biological functions. Among its members, TRIM16 stands out for its involvement in a range of processes, including cell differentiation, the innate immune response, and tumor suppressing [122,123,124,125,126]. The impact of TRIM16 on viral infections has not been extensively documented. However, Liu et al. conducted a study to investigate how TRIM16 influences oxidative stress caused by infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus [97]. In this in vitro study, a significant down-regulation of the TRIM16 protein following infection with the H5N1 subtype of the influenza virus was observed. To investigate how TRIM16 overexpression affects H5N1 replication, A549 cells were infected with the virus 24 h after being transfected with a vector expressing TRIM16. The results showed that virus titers were notably lower in the TRIM16-overexpressed cells compared to those transfected with an empty vector at both 24- and 36-hours post-infection. These findings indicate that TRIM16 overexpression can reduce the H5N1 subtype avian influenza virus titers in A549 cells. Additionally, TRIM16 overexpression enhances the expression of several antioxidant genes, including glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), glutamate–cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), HO-1, NADPH, and GPX2. However, this overexpression leads to a significant down-regulation in the mRNA expression level of SLC7A11. These findings suggest that TRIM16 enhances the activity of the SQSTM1/NRF2/KEAP1 pathway. Under normal conditions, TRIM16 modifies NRF2 by increasing its K63-linked poly-ubiquitination.Proanthocyanidins (PAs)Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are emerging as a promising option for treating influenza. They are known for their potent ability to neutralize free radicals and their strong antioxidant properties. Additionally, PAs have demonstrated noteworthy biological effects, including antitumor, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities [127]. In a recent in vivo study using mice, it was observed that PAs have multiple beneficial effects [109]. Initially, PAs notably improved pathological changes and inflammatory responses in lung tissues affected by IAV-induced acute lung injury (ALI). This was evident from reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration, pulmonary interstitial edema, and protein content in BALF. Moreover, PAs lowered the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β1, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the lungs. The expression of IFN-γ and its related chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) was also significantly reduced by PAs, as assessed by both protein and mRNA levels [109] (Fig. 2B). Additionally, PAs appear to protect against lung damage through the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. On a different note, PAs counteract IAV-induced ALI by inhibiting IFN-γ-driven ferroptosis. It was previously reported that IFN-γ treatment exacerbates glutathione depletion, increases lipid peroxidation, and improves sensitivity to ferroptosis [68]. Additionally, IAV significantly reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11, while boosting the mRNA and protein levels of ACSL4. On the other hand, PA substantially counteracted these changes. PAs effectively reduced MDA production and restored GSH levels in the mice [109].Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1)Blocking the ferroptotic pathway with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) is another approach that has been shown to reduce both viral loads and inflammatory responses. According to an in vitro study, Fer-1 enhances cell viability compromised by SIV infection [92]. SIV infection significantly elevated Fe2+ levels in cells, but Fer-1 treatment reduced these elevated Fe2 + levels. Furthermore, SIV infection and erastin treatment led to increased ROS accumulation, whereas Fer-1 treatment mitigated this ROS generation induced by SIV. SIV infection raised MDA levels in A549 cells, but Fer-1 treatment prior to infection significantly lowered these levels. Similarly, the decrease in GSH and NADPH levels in SIV-infected cells was also countered by Fer-1 [92]. Moreover, Fer-1 partially reversed the downregulation of SLC7A11, SLC3A2, and GPX4 expression caused by SIV, indicating that SIV induces ferroptosis by inhibiting the system Xc−/GPX4 axis. Fer-1 also contributed to a reduction in viral titers. SIV-infected cells showed increased mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 at 24 h post-infection, with SIV infection significantly enhancing these cytokine levels. Treatment with Fer-1 substantially reduced the production of these inflammatory cytokines in SIV-infected cells [92].Metastable iron sulfides (mFeS)In a separate investigation, researchers have created a novel multi-antiviral compound, metastable iron sulfides (mFeS), which targets multiple influenza A and B virus subtypes [111]. This research introduces a new concept called viral ferroptosis, which leads to a reduction in viral infectivity and pathogenicity both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3). The mFeS compounds trigger significant lipid peroxidation and generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) within the viral envelope, a process that relies on Fe2+. They discovered that mFeS triggered viral ferroptosis against extracellular influenza viruses [111]. Additionally, mFeS compromised the viral lipid envelope structure, causing leakage of the virion’s internal contents. It also promoted viral lipid peroxidation by elevating MDA levels. MFeS effectively degraded HA and NA proteins in a dose-dependent manner. This mechanism of action against IAV is also observed in iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes). IONzymes effectively inactivate IAV by inducing LPO in the viral envelope, which compromises the integrity of adjacent proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein 1 (M1) [128].Also, decoction of mFeS (Dc(mFeS)) inhibited host cellular ferroptosis and curtailed intracellular influenza virus replication by restoring sulfur metabolism [111]. Experimental evidence demonstrates that mFeS-coated materials, including facemasks and protective suits, effectively inhibit several IFV subtypes even at low concentrations, demonstrating their potential as antiviral personal protective equipment (PPE) (Fig. 3). In vivo studies with mice administered mFeS&Dc showed no significant adverse effects, affirming its safety and potential therapeutic effects against IFV [111]. Atomization of mFeS further demonstrates its applicability in the treatment of respiratory diseases [129]. Similarly, using IONzymes on a facemask enhances its effectiveness in protecting against three significant IFV subtypes likes H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 [128]. Altogether, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of ferroptosis inhibitors in the context of IFV infection, highlighting their potential as a novel therapeutic strategy. Further studies are necessary to validate their safety and efficacy particularly in the human population.Fig. 3Using metastable iron sulfides (mFeS) against IFV infection. This compound offers a novel antiviral approach with broad-spectrum activity against both intracellular and extracellular influenza viruses. By significantly increasing lipid peroxidation and generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH) within the viral envelope—a process reliant on Fe2+—mFeS induces viral ferroptosis. Furthermore, mFeS effectively degrades HA and NA proteins in a dose-dependent manner. In the context of intracellular infection, decoction of mFeS (Dc(mFeS)) inhibits host cellular ferroptosis and curtails intracellular influenza virus replication by restoring sulfur metabolism. Remarkably, personal protective gear infused with mFeS offers substantial antiviral defense. Experimental evidence shows that mFeS-coated materials, including facemasks and protective suits, inhibit several IFV subtypes even at low concentrationsFull size imageHowever, it is essential to acknowledge that IFV relies significantly on the host cell’s metabolic processes, especially lipid metabolism, to complete its replication cycle. Lipids and cellular membranes are essential at various points in the IAV lifecycle, including virus-host receptor interactions, membrane fusion, nuclear transport, virion assembly, and the budding process [130, 131]. For example, the IAV assembles and exits from particular regions of the apical plasma membrane that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. These regions, known as “lipid rafts,” serve as the assembly and budding sites for various enveloped viruses [132]. Moreover, IAV structural proteins engage in specific lipid–protein interactions within infected cells. The HA and NA, are transported to the plasma membrane via vesicles rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin [131]. Also, IAV need cholesterol in their envelopes to efficiently enter host cells [133]. These findings underscore the critical importance of controlled lipid metabolism during the replication process of IAV infection. However, research indicates that IFV can trigger oxidative stress, leading to elevated levels of free radicals or ROS. These ROS can then cause direct damage to lipids through a process known as LPO [134,135,136]. It can be suggested that this alteration in cellular lipids might affect the replication cycle of the IFV, as this virus depends on the host cell’s metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism, to complete its life cycle [130, 137, 138]. However, IFV have developed strategies to circumvent this issue. For example, IFV induces the host cells to produce a substantial number of lipid droplets, which may serve as precursors for the virus’s lipid components [139]. This increase in lipid droplets occurred early after the viral infection [140]. Lipid droplets are organelles encapsulated by a phospholipid monolayer and contain lipids such as triacylglycerols, cholesterol esters [139]. These droplets are produced under various conditions and are essential for the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses [139, 141]. Lipid droplets play crucial roles in processes like viral morphogenesis and the assembly and release of viral particles. Moreover, viruses can utilize the breakdown of these lipid reserves as an alternative energy source. Recent findings underscore the LDs’ influence on regulating the host’s immune response [142]. Alternatively, IFV can modify lipid synthesis pathways to its advantage. For instance, it has been observed that the IFV disrupts host cell lipid metabolism by targeting regulatory proteins like the interferon-induced viperin protein and protectin D1 (PD1). The IFV decreases the levels of both viperin and PD1 [142]. Viperin inactivates the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is crucial for the formation of lipid rafts. The absence of these structures prevents the release of new influenza virions, thereby inhibiting the infection of additional host cells [143]. Suppression of PD1 activates lipoxygenase 12/15, an enzyme integral to the immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, as well as the formation of ROS by macrophages. The activation of this enzyme has been linked to increased lethality and the severity of influenza infections [142]. Thus, by modulating lipid metabolism, including the downregulation of PD1 and viperin, the influenza virus enhances its replication and pathogenicity. As well, it is reported that, IFV infection stimulates autophagy pathways, as shown by increased activity of either mTORC1 or mTORC2, resulting in the degradation of lipid droplets during the infection [142].ConclusionIn conclusion, the intricate relationship between ferroptosis and IFV infection underscores the need for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenic mechanisms. The substantial impact of this virus on both worldwide health systems and economies underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy to address its consequences. Ferroptosis, as a cell death pathway by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, emerges as a crucial player in host defense against viral infections. Influenza virus-induced ferroptosis disrupts iron homeostasis, leading to increased reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, which contribute to cellular damage and inflammation. This link between ferroptosis and IFV pathogenesis highlights the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions. By elucidating the role of ferroptosis in viral infections, particularly IFV, researchers may identify novel strategies to mitigate viral-induced damage.Furthermore, the development of ferroptosis inhibitors presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention against IFV. Targeting ferroptosis may offer a novel approach to suppress viral replication and mitigate inflammation-induced tissue damage. Therefore, leveraging our understanding of ferroptosis in the context of IFV infection has immense potential for the development of effective antiviral therapies. Future research efforts aimed at unraveling the complexities of ferroptosis in viral infections will undoubtedly pave the way for innovative therapeutic interventions that will ultimately improve outcomes for people affected by IFV.

These vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies help regularly assess the value of flu vaccination as a public health intervention. The results of vaccine effectiveness studies can vary based on the study design, the outcome(s) measured, the population studied, and the season studied. U.S. flu vaccine effectiveness networks CDC has been working with researchers at universities and hospitals since the 2003-2004 flu season to estimate how well flu vaccines work through observational studies using laboratory-confirmed flu as the outcome. Over the past few years, CDC has conducted VE studies using multiple vaccine effectiveness networks. More information on CDC's vaccine effectiveness networks and studies is available at CDC's Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Networks. Results from prior flu seasons The overall, adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimates for flu seasons from 2004-2024 are noted in the chart below. (Estimates are typically adjusted for study site, age, sex, underlying medical conditions, and days from illness onset to enrollment.) Effectiveness of Seasonal Flu Vaccines from the 2009-2024 Flu Seasons The vaccine effectiveness estimates included in the chart and tables below are vaccine effectiveness estimates from the U.S. Flu VE Network.

Agoti1,6 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 14, Article number: 18987 (2024) Cite this article 700 Accesses 7 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects EvolutionMolecular evolution AbstractThe role of sub-Saharan Africa in the global spread of influenza viruses remains unclear due to insufficient spatiotemporal sequence data. Here, we analyzed 222 codon-complete sequences of influenza A viruses (IAVs) sampled between 2011 and 2013 from five countries across sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Zambia, Mali, Gambia, and South Africa); these genomes were compared with 1209 contemporaneous global genomes using phylogeographical approaches. The spread of influenza in sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by (i) multiple introductions of IAVs into the region over consecutive influenza seasons, with viral importations originating from multiple global geographical regions, some of which persisted in circulation as intra-subtype reassortants for multiple seasons, (ii) virus transfer between sub-Saharan African countries, and (iii) virus export from sub-Saharan Africa to other geographical regions. Despite sparse data from influenza surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, our findings support the notion that influenza viruses persist as temporally structured migrating metapopulations in which new virus strains can emerge in any geographical region, including in sub-Saharan Africa; these lineages may have been capable of dissemination to other continents through a globally migrating virus population. Further knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within understudied sub-Saharan Africa regions is required to inform vaccination strategies in those regions.

Influenza A viruses (IAV) and novel coronaviruses remain a major public health threat with potential to cause pandemics resulting in economic losses, social lockdowns, and millions of deaths10,11,12,13. Therefore, global surveillance efforts to monitor these pathogens through various initiatives, for example, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)14 remain justified to improve understanding of their global transmission networks and dynamics for appropriate interventions.The global surveillance of influenza through GISRS has resulted in the generation of geographically and temporally extensive virus sequence data, which has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the global spread of influenza viruses15,16,17,18,19,20. Three key hypotheses have been previously proposed to explain how influenza viruses spread globally. First, the “source-sink” model, whereby East and Southeast (E-SE) Asia represent a global source population of novel influenza virus strains, while temperate regions represent ecological sinks15,16,18. Second, influenza viruses occur as temporally migrating metapopulations, whereby new virus strains can emerge in any geographical region, with the location of the source population changing from season-to-season17. Third, the global patterns of spread of seasonal influenza viruses have been shown to vary with the rate of genetic and antigenic evolution of different influenza virus types and subtypes19. However, despite documented high disease burden21,22,23, the role of sub-Saharan African countries in the global spread of influenza viruses remains unclear due to insufficient surveillance and sequence data from these regions22,24.To improve understanding of IAV dispersal pathways in sub-Saharan Africa and the context of locally observed virus diversity, we studied the spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in the region using phylogeographical methods based on codon-complete sequences from samples obtained from a multi-country surveillance involving five sub-Saharan African countries. We then compared these data with sequences that were available from other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and around the globe.Materials and methodsSample sources and molecular screeningThe samples analysed here were collected under three distinct studies: (a) the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, which enrolled children aged between 1 and 59 months admitted to hospital with severe or very severe pneumonia in surveillance sites in Kenya, Zambia, Mali, Gambia, and South Africa25,26,27 from August 2011 through January 2014; (b) a Kenya-wide surveillance of influenza viruses in Kenya among patients of any age hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI)28 from January 2011 through December 2013; and (c) inpatient paediatric (1–59 months) pneumonia surveillance of influenza viruses in Kilifi County and Referral Hospital (KCH)29 from January 2011 through December 2013. Detailed descriptions of the study sites and population, sample collection, transportation, storage, and processing have been described elsewhere; PERCH study25,27,30, the countrywide surveillance study28, and the inpatient paediatric pneumonia surveillance study29. For the PERCH study, a total of 138 IAV positive specimens were analysed from five surveillance sites from five countries (Fig. S1A): Kenya, 27; South Africa, 40; Zambia, 27; The Gambia, 22; and Mali, 22. A further 106 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 16 A(H3N2) virus sequences were available from the countrywide surveillance study and the paediatric KCH study, respectively.RNA extraction and multi-segment real-time PCR (M-RTPCR) for IAVViral RNA extraction and M-RTPCR was undertaken as previously described29. Briefly, we performed viral nucleic acid extraction from IAV positive samples (Cycle threshold (Ct) < 35.0) using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). We reverse transcribed ribonucleic acid (RNA) and amplified the codon-complete region of influenza in a single M-RTPCR using the Uni/Inf primer set31 in 25 μL PCR reactions. We evaluated successful amplification by running the M-RTPCR amplicons on 2% agarose gel and visualized the gels looking for expected bands on a UV transilluminator after staining with RedSafe Nucleic Acid Staining solution (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc.,).IAV codon-complete sequencing and genome assemblyFollowing M-RTPCR, we purified, quantitated and normalized amplicons to 0.2 ng/μL as described previously29. Briefly, the amplicons were purified with 1X AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc.,), quantified with Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen), and normalized to 0.2 ng/μL. Indexed paired end libraries were generated from 2.5 μL of 0.2 ng/μL amplicon pool using Nextera XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Amplified libraries were purified using 0.8X AMPure XP beads, quantitated using Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen), and evaluated for fragment size in the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer System using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were then diluted to 2 nM in preparation for pooling and denaturation for running on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina). Pooled libraries were NaOH denatured, diluted to 12.5 pM and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using 2 × 250 bp paired end reads with the MiSeq v2 500 cycle kit (Illumina). Five percent Phi-X (Illumina) spike-in was added to the libraries to increase library diversity by creating a more diverse set of library clusters. We carried out contiguous nucleotide sequence assembly from the sequence data using the FLU module of the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler (IRMA)32 using IRMA default settings.Collation of contemporaneous global sequence datasetGlobal comparison datasets for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFlu™ database (https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/cfrontend; accessed 20 March 2022). The datasets were prepared to determine the relatedness of the viruses in this report to those circulating around the world thus understand their global context. Only codon-complete full-length genome sequences sampled between January 2010 and December 2013 were included to improve the phylogenetic resolution of the analyses and investigate reassortment patterns. For A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, the final dataset of 460 global sequences sampled from January 2010 to December 2013 was available (numbers in parenthesis indicate number of sequences): Africa (13); Asia (148); Europe (82); North America (170); South America (2); Oceania (39). For A(H3N2) virus, the final dataset of 749 global sequences sampled from January 2010 to December 2013 was available (numbers in parenthesis indicate number of sequences): Africa (7); Asia (196); Europe (38); North America (178); South America (199); Oceania (138). The accession numbers for the global genome sequences are available in the study’s GitHub repository, (https://github.com/DCollinsOwuor/Phylogeography-and-reassortment-patterns-of-human-influenza-A-viruses-in-sub-Saharan-Africa).Phylogenetic analysisWe aligned and translated consensus nucleotide sequences in AliView v1.2633 and concatenated individual gene segments into codon-complete genomes using SequenceMatrix v16.0.134. We constructed codon-complete gene segment and concatenated genome phylogenetic trees of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses with maximum-likelihood (ML) and bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates. We inferred the best-fit nucleotide substitution models using IQ-TREE v1.6.1135,36 and implemented those chosen by the Bayesian Information Criterion for each concatenated virus genome. We visualized and annotated the phylogenetic trees using ggtree R package v2.3.537 and used the full-length HA sequences of all virus sequences generated from the PERCH, countrywide surveillance, and inpatient paediatric pneumonia surveillance study to characterize A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses into clades using PhyCLIP v2.038 and IAV clade representative strains.Reassortment analysisWe used tanglegrams of the time-resolved trees from TreeTime v0.8.539 to visualize the phylogenetic relationships between individual codon-complete gene segments of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses using dendextend R package v1.15.240 and explored the pairwise phylogenetic congruence between IAV gene segments to identify intra-subtype reassortment. Tanglegrams are sets of two trees representing different segments of IAVs, with tips from matching viruses connected by lines. We compared topologies of tanglegram trees that matched the phylogeny of HA segment with that of other segments, coloring tanglegram twines based on observed reassortment patterns. We then estimated the reassortment rates (the number of reassortment events per lineage per year (events/lineage/year)) among the PERCH study and sub-Saharan African IAVs using a coalescent reassortant constant population model (CoalRe)41 in BEAST2 v.2.6.6 (https://www.beast2.org/) with parameters: GTR + I + G4 substitution model, strict clock, prior for reassortment rate = exponential with mean 0.25, chain length of 500 million, and 10 per cent burn-in. We then used the Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder (GiRaF) tool42 to computationally assess reassortment among IAVs. Our GiRaF runs, that computationally assessed reassortments, converged with an average standard deviation of split frequency < 0.01, tree length estimated sample size (ESS) value > 100, tree length potential scale reduction factors (PSRF) of 1.0, and a maximum split frequency PSRF of 1.00–1.002 (Tables 1 and 2). We manually discarded the first 25 percent of trees from each of the two runs (burn-in), then combined and processed the remaining trees. Only reassortment events with a high confidence value (≥ 0.70) and reassortant sets predicted in at least three of twenty-eight gene pairwise comparisons, as recommended by GiRaF developers were reported. We ran two simultaneous runs of MrBayes v3.2.743 on the datasets (A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 200 million generations; A(H3N2) viruses, 100 million generations) under a GTR + I + Γ substitution model and sampled trees at every 200,000th generation.Table 1 MrBayes convergence diagnostics for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.Full size tableTable 2 MrBayes convergence diagnostics for A(H3N2) viruses.Full size tableSpatial dynamics of spread of IAVsWe conducted a phylogeographical analysis to assess the global spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses using methods implemented in BEAST v1.10.4 package44, with an asymmetric discrete trait approach that applied the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) model. To reduce the complexity of the maximum clade credibility (MCC) inference, we categorized location states into geographical regions (“Africa”, “Asia”, “E-SE Asia”, “Europe”, “North America”, “South America”, or “Oceania”) and visualized phylogeographic inferences with the SPREAD3 software v0.9.7.1c package45. Due to the important role of E-SE Asia in the global spread of influenza viruses, we partitioned Asia into E-SE Asia and rest of Asia to elucidate the geographical transition states associated with E-SE. To visualize the geographic spread of the virus over time, we generated a D3 file using SPREAD3 v0.9.7.1c package and used a global geo.json file for visualization. We then used the resulting log files to calculate the estimated virus migration rates between regions and Bayes factor (BF) values for significant migration rates between discrete locations: we deemed ≥ 1,000 as decisive support, 100 ≤ BF < 1000 as very strong support, 10 ≤ BF < 100 as strong support, and 3 ≤ BF < 10 as supported rates.We also used the ML tree topologies for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses from our mugration models to estimate the number of virus transmission events between sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. Using the date and location-annotated tree topologies, we counted the number of transitions within and between sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world and plotted using ggplot2 v3.3.3 R package37.EthicsScientific and ethical clearance for the study was obtained from institutional ethics review boards within each study country in Africa, the UK, and USA26. Additional ethical approval was sought and received from KEMRI Scientific Steering Committee (SSC# 1055 and 1433) and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC# Ethics ID: 60-90). Informed consent was sought and received from the study participants for the study.ResultsIAV sequencing and codon-complete genome assembly of IAV genomesOf the 138 IAV positive samples that were available from the PERCH study, 100 (73%) were successfully sequenced. The recovered genome sequences were classified into A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 31) and A(H3N2) (n = 69). These were combined with the additional sequences from Kenya (106 for A(H1N1)pdm09 and 16 for A(H3N2)). Among A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from the PERCH study, all viruses from 2011 to 2013 fell into six clades namely, clade 3 (n = 5), clade 7 (n = 1), clade 8 (n = 2), clade 6A (n = 1), clade 6B (n = 2), and clade 6C (n = 20) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1B). Among A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from the countrywide Kenya study, all viruses from 2011 to 2013 fell into clade 6 (n = 96) and clade 6C (n = 10) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1B). For A(H3N2) viruses, all PERCH Africa study viruses from 2011 to 2013 fell into five clades namely, clade 3A (n = 6), clade 3B (n = 2), clade 3C.2 (n = 1), clade 3C.3 (n = 39), and clade 7 (n = 21) (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1C). Among A(H3N2) viruses from the KCH paediatric study, all viruses from 2011 to 2013 fell into clade 3B (n = 4) and clade 7 (n = 12) (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1C).Figure 1Phylogenetic trees of the eight individual gene segments of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from sub-Saharan Africa from the 2011–2013 influenza seasons.

PERCH pneumonia etiology research for child health.Full size imagePatterns of reassortment of IAVs from sub-Saharan AfricaWe investigated the reassortment patterns by comparing the position of viruses on the eight segment-specific phylogenies of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses to identify inconsistencies arising from intra-subtype reassortment. For most of the virus strains, those belonging to the same clade, as inferred from HA phylogeny, clustered together on phylogenies generated from the seven remaining gene segments for A(H1N1)pdm09 (Fig. 1) and A(H3N2) viruses (Fig. 2), respectively. However, in 44 (29%) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Fig. 1) and eight (9%) A(H3N2) virus (Fig. 2), intra-subtype reassortants were suspected based on tip locations of viruses in the gene segment phylogenies. Of these reassortants, 31 A(H1N1)pdm09 and four A(H3N2) viruses were identified among our PERCH study samples. GiRaF correctly identified all the 52 intra-subtype reassortant viruses. Interestingly, ten of the 44 A(H1N1)pdm09 and two of the eight A(H3N2) reassortant viruses were recently identified in a continentwide reassortment analysis of IAVs in Africa using GiRaF46.The relatedness of these reassortant viruses were visualized using tanglegrams based on pairwise phylogenetic congruence between codon-complete gene segments for A(H1N1)pdm09 (Fig. 3) and A(H3N2) (Fig. 4) viruses, with tanglegram twines colored by virus clade to highlight reassortant strains. Additionally, for the viruses detected in sub-Saharan Africa, coalescent model analysis estimated a mean reassortment rate of 0.0225 [95% HPD, 0.1272–0.3231] events/lineage/year among A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and a mean reassortment rate of 0.0577 [95% HPD, 0.0146–0.1027] events/lineage/year among A(H3N2) viruses. We further observed that the reassortant A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses persisted in circulation for 1–2 consecutive years in sub-Saharan Africa based on their date-annotated tree topologies.Figure 3Evolutionary relationships of each gene segment of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from sub-Saharan Africa, displaying intra-subtype reassortment with the subtype, highlighting the reassortant strains by clade from the 2011–2013 influenza seasons.Full size imageFigure 4Evolutionary relationships of each gene segment of influenza A(H3N2) viruses from sub-Saharan Africa, displaying intra-subtype reassortment with the subtype, highlighting the reassortant strains by clade from the 2011–2013 influenza seasons.Full size imageViral imports and exports in sub-Saharan AfricaWe assessed how 150 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 94 A(H3N2) virus genomes from sub-Saharan Africa compared to 441 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 749 A(H3N2) contemporaneous virus genomes, sampled globally by inferring their phylogenies. For A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, we inferred 15 importations originating from outside sub-Saharan Africa (seven from North America, six from Asia, and two from Europe), which represent 15 independent introductions into sub-Saharan Africa from geographical locations outside the region (Fig. 5A). We also inferred four virus location transition events among the sub-Saharan African countries. Additionally, we captured six virus export events from sub-Saharan Africa to North America, Asia, and Europe, all occurring from Kenya (Fig. 5A). For A(H3N2) viruses, we inferred 10 importations originating from outside sub-Saharan Africa (three each from North America and Asia and two each from Oceania and South America), which represent 10 independent introductions into sub-Saharan Africa from geographical locations outside the region (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we inferred 13 virus location transition events among the sub-Saharan African countries. Additionally, six virus export events from sub-Saharan Africa to North America and Oceania were inferred (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Number of viral imports and exports from sub-Saharan Africa shown as an alluvium plot using virus sequences from sub-Saharan African countries, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania for (A) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and (B) influenza A(H3N2) viruses.Full size imageGlobal migration dynamics of IAVsFor A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, we observed significant migration pathways from E-SE Asia (0.81–3) into multiple geographical regions including sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. Additionally, we observed significant migration pathways from North America (0.52–0.73) to E-SE Asia, Europe, and Oceania (Table 3). The observed migration pathways corroborate these results (Fig. S2). For A(H3N2) virus, we observed significant migration pathways from E-SE Asia (0.62–3.34) into all other geographical regions including sub-Saharan Africa, and from North America (0.6–1.63) to Europe, Oceania, and South America (Table 4). The global migration pathways for A(H3N2) corroborate these results (Fig. S3).Table 3 Asymmetrical migration rates between global location states inferred using the BSSVS model for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.Full size tableTable 4 Asymmetrical migration rates between global location states inferred using the BSSVS model for influenza A(H3N2) virus.Full size tableDiscussionWe observed that IAV strains from 2011 to 2013 from our study evolved over consecutive influenza seasons and fell into distinct A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus clades, some of which persisted in circulation as intra-subtype reassortants for consecutive influenza seasons. Furthermore, we observed multiple introductions of IAVs into sub-Saharan Africa over consecutive influenza seasons, with viral importations originating from multiple global geographical regions, for example, North America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Additionally, we inferred virus transfer between the sub-Saharan African countries and virus exports from sub-Saharan Africa to other geographical regions, for example, North America, Asia, and Europe. On a global scale, IAVs spread from multiple geographical regions to multiple geographical destinations including sub-Saharan Africa.Co-circulation of different IAV subtypes and clades is common during epidemics of seasonal influenza, which may facilitate intra-subtype reassortment events among circulating viruses47,48,49,50,51. Overall, the reassortment rates among the sub-Saharan African A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (0.1272–0.3231) were comparable to the 0.15–0.8 events/lineage/year estimated among global A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses41. However, sub-Saharan African A(H3N2) viruses reassorted at a lower mean rate of 0.0577 [95% HPD, 0.0146–0.1027] than the global estimate of 0.35–0.65 events/lineage/year41. Although A(H3N2) viruses undergo frequent reassortment events globally, the low reassortment rate among some A(H3N2) viruses might be due to the resulting reassortant viruses being unfit and negatively selected, thus not detected in appreciable frequencies52,53. Circulation of intra-subtype reassortants in our study for 1–2 consecutive years demonstrates that IAVs can persist in the population and spread geographically. A recent continentwide study of the rates and patterns of reassortment of IAVs in Africa revealed that novel reassortant viruses emerged every year, with some reassortant viruses persisting in different countries and regions for 1–5 consecutive years46. Persistence of intra-subtype reassortants has been demonstrated previously52,54, although the factors associated with such persistence patterns at a population level require further investigation. For example, a reassortant A(H3N2) virus subclade, designated 3C.3A2e, emerged in 2016–2017 influenza season and resulted in more hospitalizations and deaths in the 2017–2018 North American influenza season52. Increased whole genome sequencing over consecutive influenza seasons, particularly in understudied sub-Saharan Africa regions, would allow for an improved understanding of the frequency and timing of such intra-subtype reassortments and the contribution to the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza.Globally, we observed significant migration pathways for IAVs. Taken together, these results suggest that the global spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus epidemics are driven by different geographical regions, which also includes sub-Saharan Africa, in which E-SE Asia and North America are major transmission sources17,19,20,55. Our findings support the notion that influenza viruses persist as temporally migrating metapopulations in which new virus strains can emerge in any geographical region, with the location of the source population changing regularly17. This underscores the need for improved influenza surveillance particularly in understudied sub-Saharan Africa regions for complete understanding of the global patterns of spread of influenza.The paucity of sequence data from other African countries limited our analysis of the patterns of spread and persistence of IAVs in the continent, which might have been useful to demonstrate intra-continental spread of influenza viruses in detail, since persistence may be facilitated by climatic variability that generates temporally overlapping epidemics in neighboring countries. Despite this paucity, our study leveraged on existing national surveillance studies, for example, from the countrywide surveillance of influenza viruses in Kenya where A(H1N1)pdm09 virus sequences were included. It is possible that Africa plays a bigger role in the spread of influenza, which we might not have captured. Furthermore, the analysis in this report only involved the coding regions of the A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus gene segments. Although noncoding regions are conserved, mutations that affect viral replication may occur, and this information may not have been captured in this study.In conclusion, despite sparse data from influenza surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, our findings support the notion that influenza viruses persist as temporally structured migrating metapopulations in which new virus strains can emerge in any geographical region, including in sub-Saharan Africa; these lineages may have been capable of dissemination to other continents through a globally migrating virus population. Further knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within understudied sub-Saharan Africa regions is required to inform vaccination strategies in those regions.

Flu vaccine effectiveness may vary based on how similar or different the vaccine virus is to circulating influenza viruses; however, even when the viruses are very different, vaccination can still prevent illness, hospitalization, and death. Flu vaccines protect against influenza viruses but do not protect against infection and illness caused by other viruses that also can cause flu-like symptoms. Overview There are many other viruses besides influenza viruses that can result in flu-like illness* (also known as influenza-like illness or "ILI") that spread during the flu season. These non-influenza viruses include, but are not limited to, the following: SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), rhinovirus (one cause of the "common cold"), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is the most common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children and a major cause of severe respiratory illness in adults 65 years and older. Types and subtypes The amount of protection provided by a flu vaccine may vary by influenza virus type or subtype and by vaccine, even when the viruses used to make flu vaccines are similar to the influenza viruses that are causing illness that season. Since 2009, VE studies looking at how well flu vaccines protect against medically attended illnesses have suggested better protection against influenza B and influenza A(H1N1) viruses than against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. A metanalysis of 76 published VE studies conducted in countries in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres after the 2009-2010 flu pandemic found flu vaccines performed the best against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses followed by influenza B viruses and were least effective against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Across all the studies included in the meta-analysis, the pooled VE estimate against all influenza viruses for the Northern Hemisphere was 37 percent. For influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, the pooled VE estimate for the Northern Hemisphere was 56 percent. For influenza A(H3N2) viruses, the pooled VE estimate for the Northern Hemisphere was 22 percent. And lastly, for influenza B viruses, the pooled VE estimate for studies from the Northern Hemisphere was 42 percent. Overall, VE estimates were lower when the viruses used to make flu vaccines were less similar to the influenza viruses causing illness that season and decreased with older age. A(H3N2) viruses There are several reasons why flu vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2) viruses may be lower compared to other influenza viruses. While all influenza viruses undergo frequent genetic changes over time, the changes that have occurred in influenza A(H3N2) viruses have more frequently resulted in differences between the virus components of the flu vaccine and circulating influenza viruses (i.e., antigenic changes) compared with influenza A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses. That means that between the time when influenza viruses are selected to begin producing vaccines and when flu vaccines are delivered, A(H3N2) viruses are more likely than A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses to have changed in ways that could impact how well the flu vaccines work. Most inactivated seasonal flu vaccines produced by growing viruses in eggs. While all influenza viruses undergo changes when they are grown in eggs, changes in influenza A(H3N2) viruses tend to be more likely to result in antigenic changes compared with changes in other influenza viruses. These so-called "egg-adapted changes" are present in vaccine viruses recommended for use in vaccine production and may reduce their potential effectiveness against circulating influenza viruses. Other types of flu vaccines, such as cell-based and recombinant flu vaccines, are produce without the use of eggs, so the viruses used to make the vaccines do not undergo these changes. CDC is also using advanced molecular detection (AMD) techniques to improve flu vaccines by providing experts with more data to support the selection of candidate vaccine viruses.

Although transmission of this canine virus to humans has not been reported, it is important to evaluate its zoonotic potential because of the high contact opportunities between companion dogs and humans. To gain insight into the interspecies transmissibility of H3N8 CIV, we tested its adaptability to human respiratory A549 cells through successive passages. We found that CIV acquired high growth properties in these cells mainly through mutations in surface glycoproteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Our reverse genetics approach revealed that HA2-K82E, HA2-R163K, and NA-S18L mutations were responsible for the increased growth of CIV in human cells. Molecular analyses revealed that both HA2 mutations altered the optimum pH for HA membrane fusion activity and that the NA mutation changed the HA-NA functional balance. These findings suggest that H3N8 CIV could evolve into a human pathogen with pandemic potential through a small number of mutations, thereby posing a threat to public health in the future.

However, because avian IAVs rarely infect humans, it is widely proposed that human IAVs must have emerged through pigs as an intermediate host susceptible to both avian and human IAVs2,3. In fact, the 2009 pandemic virus (H1N1pdm09) was transmitted from pigs infected with reassortant viruses of avian, swine, and human origins to humans2,4,5,6. Therefore, attention should be paid to the public health concerns of swine-origin IAVs. Notably, there have been an increasing number of cases of IAVs infecting mammals other than pigs7,8,9, suggesting that these animals may play a role as intermediate hosts in the emergence of new human pathogens with pandemic potential. In this context, canine influenza viruses (CIVs) should be considered as candidates because of the close relationship between dogs and humans.CIVs include H3N8 and H3N2 IAVs10,11. Of these, H3N8 CIVs infected 22 racing greyhounds in Florida, USA in 200412. Infected dogs had severe respiratory symptoms, and eight died. The virus subsequently spread nationwide to pets and shelter dogs13. Molecular analysis revealed that CIV was an equine-origin H3N8 IAV that acquired mutations, such as W222L in hemagglutinin, allowing infectivity in dogs14. In this country, serological evidence indicates that a possible H3N8 CIV has been circulating in racing greyhounds since 199915. In 2007, another transmission of H3N8 equine IAV from horses to dogs occurred in Australia, in which 23 dogs were seropositive, and some exhibited respiratory symptoms without lethal outcomes16. The causative viruses were phylogenetically different from H3N8 CIVs circulating in the USA. In addition, it was retrospectively recorded that H3N8 equine IAV was transmitted from a horse to a dog in the United Kingdom in 200217.In 2015, an H3N8 avian-like IAV was isolated from a dog in China18, suggesting that another H3N8 CIV, transmitted by avian IAV of the Eurasian lineage, may have been circulating among the dog population. Notably, H3N8 avian IAV infected a child in China in 202219, being the first reported case of human infection with H3N8 IAV. These observations suggest that H3N8 IAVs possess a high potential for interspecies transmission20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27. In this study, to investigate the potential of the H3N8 CIV in human infections, we investigated its adaptivity to human respiratory cell cultures.ResultsAdaptation of H3N8 CIV to A549 cellsTo test the adaptability of H3N8 CIV to human respiratory cells, we successively passaged the virus in human lung-derived A549 cells. As cytopathic effects and their expansion became apparent after the 15th passage of the virus, the 16th passage virus was collected in three independent experiments and designated P16-1, -2, and -3, respectively. We examined their growth kinetics in A549 cells, which showed much more efficient growth at approximately 10,000-fold higher titers than the wild-type (WT) virus (Fig. 1A). In contrast, they were able to grow to similar levels to wild-type virus in MDCK cells; the maximum titers were recorded as 5.6, 1.0, and 4.0 × 107 PFU/mL for P16-1, -2, and -3, respectively, compared with 2.2 × 107 PFU/mL for wild-type virus. The results indicated that the passaged viruses adapted to A549 cells.Figure 1Growth kinetics of A549 cell-passaged and recombinant viruses. A549 cells were infected with (A) A549 cells-passaged (P16-1, -2, and -3) or wild-type (WT) H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) and (B) with reverse genetics-generated recombinant viruses (rP16-1, -2, and -3) with mutations detected in P16-1, -2, and -3 or recombinant WT (rWT) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 at 37 °C and (C) 33 °C. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points and virus titers were determined using plaque assay in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Data were presented by means ± standard deviation (SD) of the results in three independent experiments. *** denotes P < 0.001, compared with WT or rWT by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).Full size imageSequence analysis of A549-adapted virusTo identify mutations acquired by the P16 viruses, whole genome sequences were compared with that of the WT virus, revealing 11 nonsynonymous mutations detected in PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, and M genes; PB2-K738R, PA-G58S, HA1-G158E, HA1-E218G, HA2-K82E, HA2-R163K, NP-N473D, NA-S18L, and M2-F47L for P16-1; HA1-G158E, HA1-E218G, HA2-R163K, NA-S18L, and M1-R210K for P16-2; and PA-G58S, HA1-E218G, HA2-K82E, HA2-R163K, NP-N473D, NA-S18L, M1-V180A, and M2-F47L for P16-3, respectively (Table 1). There were no synonymous mutations in these segments and no sequence differences in the PB1 and NS segments between the WT and P16 viruses. Among these mutations, HA1-E218G, HA2-R163K, and NA-S18L were detected in all three P16 viruses, whereas PA-G58S, HA1-G158E, HA2-K82E, NP-N473D, and M2-F47L were detected in only two of the three P16 viruses (Table 1). Table 1 Amino acid substitutions in A549-adapted viruses.Full size tableGeneration of recombinant A549-adapted virusThe P16 viruses obtained by successive passages in A549 cells were presumed to be a mixed quasi-species population. To confirm the role of the detected mutations in the adaptation of A549 cells, we generated each P16 virus with all these mutations using reverse genetics, designated rP16-1, -2, and-3. Recombinant WT virus (rWT) was used as a control. We examined their growth in A549 cells and found that all recombinant P16 viruses grew more efficiently than rWT (Fig. 1B), and that their growth rates were equivalent to P16-1, -2, or -3 (Fig. 1A). In addition, they grew well at 33 °C, the body temperature in human upper respiratory environment, to similar levels at 37 °C (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that the mutations detected in the passaged P16 viruses were responsible for the acquisition of high growth properties of the H3N8 CIV in A549 cells.Effects of mutations on virus growth in A549 cellsTo determine which mutations are key to the high growth of A549 cell-adapted viruses, we generated a series of recombinant viruses with a single mutation found in the adapted viruses and compared their growth with that of the rWT (Fig. 2A). In total, all recombinant viruses with a single mutation, except rM1-R210K and rM2-F47L, grew significantly better than the rWT. In particular, recombinant viruses with HA or NA mutations showed more significant increases in growth (P < 0.001) than those with mutations in internal proteins (P < 0.001–0.05), although their growth was much slower than that of rP16 viruses. Therefore, we generated recombinant viruses with multiple mutations and evaluated their growth (Fig. 2B and C). We found that the growth rates of three mutants with multiple HA and NA mutations (rHA2-K82E/R163K + NA-S18L, rHA1-E218G + HA2-R163K + NA-S18L, and rHA1-G158E/E218G + HA2-K82E/R163K) were higher (P < 0.05) than those of the other mutants, including mutations in internal proteins, and exhibited approximately 5000-, 500-, and 100-fold higher peak titers, respectively, than those of the rWT. These data indicate that the HA-NA combined mutations played more important roles in the adaptation of the H3N8 CIV to A549 cells, although those in internal proteins were concomitantly responsible for it.Figure 2Growth kinetics of recombinant mutant viruses. A549 cells were infected with reverse genetics-generated recombinant viruses possessing (A) single or multiple mutations of (B) surface or (C) internal proteins, recombinant adapted (rP16-1, -2, and -3), and rWT viruses at an MOI of 0.01 at 37 °C. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points and virus titers were determined using plaque assay in MDCK cells. Data were presented by means ± SD of the results in three independent experiments. *, **, and *** denotes P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001, compared with rWT, by repeated measures ANOVA, respectively.Full size imageEffect of HA1 mutations on viral receptor-binding propertyThe HA 3D structure model indicated that HA1 positions 158 and 218 were located in the head region, suggesting that HA1-G158E and HA1-E218G may affect the receptor-binding properties of the virus, although both positions were not as close as the receptor-binding site (Fig. 3). We compared the sialic acid-binding property of rHA1-G158E, rHA1-E218G, and rHA1-G158E/E218G with that of the rWT using a solid-phase binding assay with sialylglycopolymers containing α2,3-sialic acid (avian-type sialylglycan analog) and α2,6-sialic acid (human-type sialylglycan analog), respectively (Fig. 4). All mutant viruses, as well as rWT, bound only to avian-type sialylglycan in a dose-dependent manner, reached a plateau at around 1.5 µg/mL of the polymers. These results suggested that HA1-G158E and HA1-E218G did not affect the receptor-binding specificity of the virus.Figure 3Structure of H3-HA protein. The 3D structure of (A) monomeric or (B) trimetric HA of A/canine/Colorado/17864/2006 (H3N8) (PDB: 4UNY) is shown. Mutations acquired in A549 cell-adapted viruses are colored red. Sialic acid analog is colored green.Full size imageFigure 4Receptor binding of HA1 mutant viruses. The binding abilities of rHA1-G158E, -E218G, -G158E/E218G, or rWT to α2,3-linked sialylglycopolymers (3ʹSLN; orange line), α2,6-linked sialylglycopolymers (6ʹSLN, cyan line), and PBS (black line) were evaluated. The binding profiles of H4N5 avian influenza A virus (IAV) and its HA1-Q226L mutant virus35 are shown as a 3ʹSLN- or 6ʹSLN-binding control, respectively. For the test, 32 hemagglutinin units of each virus was reacted with serially diluted of sialylglycopolymers, followed by detection of virus-binding by mouse antiserum and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody with TMB substrate. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and the data were shown at each diluted point by means ± SD in three independent experiments.Full size imageEffect of HA2 mutations on HA fusion activityThe HA 3D structure model indicated that both HA2 positions 82 and 163 were located in the stalk region (Fig. 3), suggesting that HA2-K82E and HA2-R163K may affect HA fusion activity. Fusion between the viral envelope and the cell endosomal membrane, which is essential for the viral entry process, is regulated by low pH-induced conformational changes in HA. We compared the pH thresholds of the plasmid-expressing HAs with those of HA2-K82E, HA2-R163K, and HA2-K82E/R163K with that of WT HA (Fig. 5). Syncytium assay for cell fusion indicated that the fused cells were observed at pH 5.8 or less by HA2-K82E, pH 5.6 by HA2-R163K, pH 6.0 or less by HA2-K82E/R163K, and pH 5.6 by WT HA control. These results suggested that HA2-K82E and HA2-K82E/R163K may adapt HA to the endosomal pH environment in A549 cells, leading to a more efficient fusion step for viral replication in this cell line.Figure 5pH threshold of syncytium formation by HA2 mutations. A549 cells were co-transfected with the plasmid expressing HA2 mutants or WT HA and that expressing a reporter protein (venus). Syncytium formation was induced by treatment with the buffers with pH of 5.6 through 7.2 and observed under fluorescence microscopy. The red line marks the border of pH for syncytium formation. The experiments were repeated three times independently and obtained the same results.Full size imageEffect of NA mutation on HA–NA functional balanceTo assess the NA activity with NA-S18L, we tested the release time of rNA-S18L from erythrocytes and compared it to that of rWT, which indicated a much slower release than rWT (Fig. 6). The receptor-binding properties of HA were identical between these two viruses, therefore, a slow release of rNA-S18L from erythrocytes indicated decreased NA activity due to this mutation. The HA-NA functional balance between sialic acid binding by HA and sialic acid destruction by NA is important for the adaptation of the virus to different host cells28. These data suggest that NA-S18L alters the HA-NA functional balance of H3N8 CIV for adaptation to A549 cells.Figure 6Release of NA mutant virus from erythrocytes. Two-fold dilutions of the rNA-S18L or rWT containing HA titers of 1:256 were incubated with an equal volume of 0.7% turkey erythrocytes in microplate wells at 4 °C for 1 h. The plates were then stored at 37 °C and the decrease in HA titers was recorded at 1 h interval for 12 h.Full size imageEffect of PB2, PA, and NP mutations on viral polymerase activityTo assess the role of mutations in internal proteins in viral adaptation, we tested by a reporter assay whether PB2-K738R, PA-G58S, and NP-N473D affected the viral polymerase activity in A549 cells or HEK293T cells using plasmid-expressing polymerase proteins and NP (Fig. 7). We found that luciferase activities equivalent to the WT composition were measured by any composition with each mutation, as well as two or three mutations, indicating no significant changes in polymerase activity by any mutation in internal proteins.Figure 7Polymerase activity with PB2, PA, and NP mutants. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. (A) A549 or (B) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with four plasmids expressing WT (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) or single/combined mutants of PB2-K738R, PA-G58S, or NP-N473D, together with reporter plasmid inserted firefly luciferase gene between 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-noncoding regions of NP segment of IAV and pRL-null plasmid encoding renilla luciferase as an internal control. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C and harvested after 24 h. The luciferase activity was measured on a microplate luminometer and the data on relative values to WT combination were shown by means ± SD in three independent experiments.Full size imageDiscussionTo understand interspecies transmission of IAVs, it is important to elucidate the mechanism by which the virus adapts to other hosts through mutations and reassortments. In this study, we assessed the potential of the H3N8 CIV to adapt to human respiratory cells and gain insights into the threat of the CIV to public health. Through successive passages of the H3N8 CIV, we were able to generate mutant viruses that replicated efficiently in A549 cells. We found that among the mutations identified in the A549 cell-passaged viruses, those of the surface glycoproteins HA and NA, which are involved in viral entry into cells29 and in viral release from cells30, were responsible for the increased growth of H3N8 CIV in A549 cells. These findings suggest that the H3N8 CIV could possess the potential to mutate into a virus that may infect human respiratory cells.The previous knowledge indicated that acquisition of binding specificity to human-type receptor, which proved to be ɑ2,6-linked sialic acid, should be a key determinant for non-human IAVs to efficiently infect and be transmitted among humans31,32,33. An earlier study showed that although the H3N8 CIV is of mammalian origin, it exhibited avian-type receptor specificity with ɑ2,3-linked sialic acid, which was distributed in canine respiratory organs17,34. Here, we found that A549 cell-adapted viruses possessed two HA1 mutations, HA1-G158E and HA1-E218G, in the HA head region, but they did not alter the avian-type receptor specificity of H3N8 CIV, as measured by a virus binding assay with sialyglycopolymers. In addition, the recombinant viruses with these HA1 mutations did not markedly increase viral growth in A549 cells, further supporting the idea that these mutations did not alter the avian-type receptor specificity of the virus. A549 cells originated from the human respiratory organ and have previously been shown to express both human-type 2,6-sialic acid and avian-type 2,3-sialic acid35,36. However, we have shown that the virus binding assay cannot precisely detect biological changes in receptor specificity of IAVs37. Therefore, it is likely that the more than tenfold increase in the growth rates of the recombinant viruses with HA1 mutations (rHA1-G158E, -E218G, and -G158E/E218G) may be due to the subtle acquisition of binding to human-type receptors distributed in A549 cells. To directly assess mutations for binding activity to human-type receptor, passage experiments of H3N8 CIV using cells specifically expressing ɑ2,6-linked sialic acid would be informative.Our reverse genetics studies with recombinant viruses demonstrated that HA2-K82E and HA2-R163K were responsible for the increased growth of H3N8 CIV in A549 cells, to a similar extent as HA1 mutations. Therefore, an increased pH threshold for HA membrane fusion by these HA2 mutations may be responsible, in part, for the adaptation of H3N8 CIV to A549 cells, similar to the adaptation of H5N1 avian IAV to human-derived cells described in an earlier study38. However, the mutant with both HA2 mutations (rHA2-K82E/R163K) did not increase viral growth dramatically, whereas rHA2-K82E/R163K + NA-S18L did, suggesting that a synergistic effect with NA-S18L was required for efficient viral growth. The virus release assay showed a delayed release of rNA-S18L from erythrocytes, indicating that NA-S18L reduced NA activity and affected viral HA-NA functional balance, which could regulate viral growth, pathogenicity, and host range39,40,41. The NA-S18L in the transmembrane region does not directly affect the NA catalytic structure, therefore, the reason for the reduction in NA activity is unclear. One possible explanation is that NA-S18L may decrease the amount of NA protein in lipid rafts, which are the budding sites of viral particles in the plasma membrane41,42, leading to a reduction in the viral envelope and concomitant NA activity. If so, it is likely that the relative amount of HA on the viral envelope would increase in rHA2-K82E/R163K + NA-S18L compared with that in rHA2-K82E/R163K, resulting in more effective viral growth by a possible synergistic effect between the HA2 and NA mutations. To confirm this idea, the amounts of HA and NA and their ratio on the virions have to be quantified and compared between the wild-type and mutant viruses.Here, we detected mutations in viral internal proteins containing polymerase PB2 (K738R) and PA (G58S) subunits, NP (N473D), and M1 (V180A) in A549 cell-adapted viruses and found that all these mutations were responsible, in part, for the increased growth of H3N8 CIV in A549 cells. The reporter luciferase assay did not detect any change in viral polymerase activity with either mutation, the reason for the higher growth of rPB2-K738R, rPA-G58S, and rNP-N473D compared with rWT is unknown. Mutations in viral polymerases, such as PB2-E627K and D701N, are essentially responsible for the interspecies transmission of avian AIVs to mammals, including humans. Notably, most of the H3N8 CIVs, as well as their progenitor H3N8 equine AIVs of the North American lineage, possess avian-type 627E and mammalian-type 701N PB2, respectively43,44. These data indicate that PB2-701N, which allows viral ribonucleoproteins to efficiently enter mammalian cells through nuclear migration45,46, is sufficient for the efficient replication of the H3N8 virus genome in canine and equine cells. Therefore, the major host-adaptive mutation PB2-E627K, which can robustly activate viral polymerase in human cells, would not be required for H3N8 CIV to adapt to A549 cells. Instead, minor mutations in PB2, PA, and NP were introduced to enhance viral growth in the cells. Among the mutations in the M proteins, only M1-V180A was responsible for H3N8 CIV infection, which significantly enhanced the growth of A549 cells. M1-V180A is located in the C-terminal region of M1, which is involved in its monomer formation47, suggesting that this mutation could affect M1 protein stability, leading to increased viral growth in cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that mutations in internal proteins are not responsible for the adaptation of H3N8 CIV to A549 cells, suggesting that mutations in surface glycoproteins may be responsible for its adaptation to human cells.In this study, we found that H3N8 CIV acquires high growth capacity in human cells by altering membrane fusion activity through mutation of the HA stalk region and HA-NA functional balance through mutation of the NA transmembrane region. The mutated amino acids detected in HA2 and NA of A549 cell-adapted viruses (HA2-82E, -163K, and NA-18L) were not found in any H3N8 human isolates19 or recent seasonal H3N2 viruses in the database. Nonetheless, these findings reveal that the H3N8 CIV has the potential to mutate into a virus infecting human respiratory organs through a few mutations in surface glycoproteins. We previously reported that H7N2 feline IAV could adapt to A549 cells by altering the membrane fusion activity and HA-NA functional balance48 and H3N2 CIV could adapt to feline cells by altering the membrane fusion activity49. These results suggest that interspecies transmission of AIVs between mammals can be achieved more easily by a few mutations in surface glycoproteins, compared with the transmission of avian IAVs to humans, which requires a number of mutations in various genes involved in reassortment with human IAVs. Notably, a recent report showed that H3N2 CIVs, first transmitted from avian to dogs around 2006, have evolved to possess human-type receptor specificity, increased HA stability, and replication ability in human airway epithelial cells, suggesting their potential to become human pathogens50. Therefore, more attention should be paid to canine IAVs, including H3N8 CIVs, in addition to avian IAVs, for risk assessment using the global surveillance system for pandemic preparedness.MethodsCells and virusesMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CCL-34). These cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM, Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) containing 5% newborn calf serum (NCS). We acquired human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells from RIKEN BioResource Research Center (RCB2202), and obtained human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549) cells from JCRB Cell Bank, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health, and Nutrition (JCRB0076); both cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A/canine/NE/52-14/06 (H3N8) (GenBank accession no. LC793501-8) was propagated in MDCK cells.Viral passages in A549 cellsA549 cells in six-well plates were infected with the CIV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, determined via viral titration in MDCK cells, and subsequently maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (DMEM/BSA) and 0.5 µg/mL N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA). After incubation for 72 h, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged to remove the cell debris. Fresh A549 cells were infected with the CIV under similar conditions. This process was repeated 16 times and three independent lines of A549 cell-adapted viruses were obtained (designated P16-1, -2, and -3).Growth kinetics of the virusA549 cells were inoculated with viruses at an MOI of 0.01 and maintained in DMEM/BSA with 0.5 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin. Supernatants were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h post infection and subjected to virus titration in MDCK cells using a plaque assay. For the plaque assay, confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were washed with MEM/BSA, inoculated with the diluted virus, and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed to remove the virus inoculum and then overlaid with MEM/BSA containing 1% agarose and 1 μg/mL of TPCK-trypsin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, viral plaques were visualized by crystal violet staining, and plaque-forming units were determined.Sequence analysisViral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of virus-infected cells using ISOGEN-LS (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The entire viral cDNA was generated with the Uni12 primer using ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and each genome segment was amplified from cDNA using PCR with specific primers51. PCR products were purified using the Fast Gene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (NIPPON Genetics, Tokyo, Japan). A BigDye Terminator (v3.1) sequencing kit and an automated sequencer (Life Technologies, Applied Biosystems 3130xl, Tokyo, Japan) were used to sequence the purified PCR products. Sequences were assembled using the ATGC software (GENETYX, Tokyo, Japan). Thereafter, the assembled sequences were compared with those of the wild-type and P16 viruses.Reverse geneticsPlasmid-based reverse genetic analysis was performed as previously described52. Briefly, eight viral RNA-synthesis pHH21 plasmids, which were constructed from wild-type, adapted, and mutant viruses, respectively, and four protein-expression (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) pCAGGS-based plasmids, which were prepared from A/WSN/33 (H1N1)52, were mixed with the transfection reagent, TransIT-293T (Mirus, Madison, WI), and incubated at 23 °C for 15 min. The mixture was added to HEK293T cells cultured in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies/Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). At 48 h post-transfection, the supernatants were harvested and added to the MDCK cells. The cells were then maintained in MEM/BSA with 1 µg/mL of TPCK-trypsin for virus propagation. The supernatants containing the viruses were harvested as recombinant viruses.Virus binding assayThe solid-phase binding assay was performed as described previously37,53. In brief, 96-well ELISA plates (Maxisorp Nunc-immuno plates; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were incubated with streptavidin (100 μL/well, diluted to 1 μg/100 μL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) at 21 °C for 3 h, washed twice with PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with two-fold dilutions of synthetic biotinylated 3ʹ- and 6ʹ-sialyglycopolymers (3ʹ-SLN-C3-BP or 6ʹ-SLN-C3-BP; GlycoNZ, Auckland, New Zealand), diluted in PBS at 50 μL/well. After blocking with Pierce Protein-Free (TBS) Blocking Buffer (180 μL/well; Thermo Fisher Scientific), at 23 °C for 3 h, the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μL of each virus (32 HA diluted in PBS). The plates were then washed twice with PBS, incubated with mouse anti-H3N8 CIV antibody (1:100) at 50 μL/well at 4 °C for 1 h, washed further, and incubated with anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (#NA9340, GE Healthcare) (1:4000) at 50 μL/well at 4 °C for 1 h. After further five washes, the plates were reacted with 3,3ʹ,5,5ʹ-tetramethylbenzidin (TMB) substrate (100 μL/well; Vector Laboratories) at 21 °C for 12 min and 2% sulfuric acid was added (25 μL/well) to stop the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (iMark; Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan).Syncytium assay for cell fusionThis assay was performed as previously described48,54. A549 cells were co-transfected with either WT or mutant HA-expressing pCAGGS plasmids and a green fluorescent protein (Venus) expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1-Venus) using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). After transfection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, we washed the cells twice with PBS containing Mg2+ and Ca2+ (PBS +). Next, the cells were treated with 5 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. We used PBS+ containing 4% NCS to inactivate the trypsin. To induce cell fusion, we treated the cells with pH-adjusted PBS+ with citric acid for 1 min and incubated them in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence microscopy (Axio Vert.A1; ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to visualize the fused cells.Virus release assayTo assess the HA–NA functional balance of viruses, a virus release assay was performed on erythrocytes48,55. Aliquots of 50 μL, which were prepared from two-fold dilutions of virus containing HA titers of 1:256, were added to 50 μL of 0.7% turkey erythrocytes in a 96-well microplate and subsequently incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The plate was then stored at 37 °C, and the decrease in HA titer was recorded at intervals.Reporter assay for viral polymerase activityThe luciferase reporter assay was performed as previously described56,57. We co-transfected confluent A549 cells or HEK293T cells in 96-well plates with 50 ng each of plasmids expressing WT or mutants of PB2, PB1, PA, and NP, together with 50 ng of reporter plasmid inserted a firefly luciferase gene between 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-noncoding regions of NP segment of IAV and 5 ng of pRL-null plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. A549 cells were incubated at 37 °C and harvested after 24 h. Luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Gro Luciferase Assay System (Promega Japan, Tokyo, Japan) on an ARVO X2 microplate luminometer (PerkinElmer, Kanagawa, Japan).Statistical analysisThe statistical significance of the differences in growth curves between viruses was analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance with a post-hoc Holm’s multiple comparison test.

Flu illness Millions of people get sick with flu each year Seasonal flu is associated with large numbers of illnesses, which can impact school attendance, worker absenteeism, and daily productivity. CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flu-like illness through the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet); a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flu-like illness weekly to CDC. This system allows CDC to track levels of medically attended flu-like illness over the course of the flu season. However, CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick or seek medical care with seasonal flu each year. There are several reasons for this, including that ILINet does not include every health care provider in the United States and that it monitors flu-like illness, not laboratory-confirmed flu cases. Also, seasonal flu illness is not a reportable disease, and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested for flu. To estimate the number of flu illnesses and medically-attended flu illnesses that occur in the United States each year, CDC uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems. CDC estimates that since 2010, except for the 2020-2021 flu season, flu has resulted in between 9 million and 41 million illnesses annually in the United States. Keep Reading: About Estimated Flu BurdenKeep Reading: U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods Flu-related hospitalization Flu can lead to hospitalization Seasonal flu is associated with large numbers of hospitalizations. These estimates of flu-related hospitalizations highlight flu's potential to cause serious illness. Being sick with flu can also make some health conditions worse, such as lung or heart disease, or lead to other complications that require hospitalization. Flu vaccination is the first and best way to prevent flu and its serious complications. Everyone 6 months and older should get vaccinated against flu yearly, particularly people at increased risk for serious complications including young children, adults 65 years and older, and people with certain chronic medical conditions. Hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized with flu every year Using an estimation model, CDC estimates that since 2010, except for the 2020-2021 flu season, flu has resulted in between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations each year. To generate this estimate, CDC conducts surveillance for flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a collaboration between CDC, the Emerging Infections Program, and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states in 14 geographically distributed areas in the United States (the network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the U.S. population). The data collected through FluSurv-NET allow CDC to calculate an overall hospitalization rate, as well as by age group, but this system does not capture every flu hospitalization that occurs annually in the United States. To estimate the actual number of flu hospitalizations, reported FluSurv-NET hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for under-detection and under-reporting. Keep Reading: Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET)Flu burden estimates change as more data become available CDC releases in-season and preliminary flu burden estimates during each flu season and at the conclusion of the season. However, receipt of some of the data used in the burden estimation model are delayed by as many as 2 years. Providing in-season and preliminary estimates allows for the release of timely information about U.S. flu burden, but also means that these in-season and preliminary estimates may change as more data become available. Flu burden estimates are considered preliminary and subject to change until all data contributing to the estimates for that season are complete. Once all data are complete for a particular season, that flu season's estimates are considered final. Flu-related deaths How CDC defines “seasonal flu-related deaths” Seasonal flu-related deaths are deaths that occur in people for whom flu was likely a contributor to the cause of death, but not necessarily the primary cause of death. It is difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting. Some of the challenges in counting flu-related deaths include the following: the large number of deaths to be counted. the lack of testing (not everyone that dies with an influenza-like illness is tested for flu); and deaths are coded differently (flu-related deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems, and this may be difficult to sort out). CDC estimates the number of people who die from seasonal flu each year CDC estimates that, since 2010, except for the 2020-2021 flu season, flu-related deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 to 51,000. CDC does not know exactly how many people die from seasonal flu each year. In order to monitor flu-related deaths in all age groups, CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or flu as the underlying or contributing cause of death. This system provides an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. As it does for the numbers of flu cases, doctor's visits and hospitalizations, CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling. The model used to estimate flu-related deaths uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations in order to estimate the total flu-related deaths during a season. Flu deaths in children are slightly different though because these are nationally notifiable, which means that individual flu deaths should be reported to CDC. However, even deaths in children are under-reported Flu-related deaths in children are underreported Deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed flu in children younger than 18 years old became nationally notifiable in 2004 and are reported to CDC through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System. The number of reported deaths is published each week in FluView. However, the number of reported deaths is likely an underestimate of the total number of flu-related pediatric deaths because not all children are tested for flu or children might be tested later in their illness when seasonal flu can no longer be detected from respiratory samples. CDC estimates the number of flu-related deaths using mathematical models to account for likely under-reporting. The estimates of deaths associated with flu that we report are from one such model. Previously published reports have found that the estimated numbers of flu-related deaths in children from statistical models may be two to three times higher than the number of reported deaths.

HAIVEN ended enrollment on July 31, 2021, and is no longer being used to measure flu vaccine effectiveness. The information provided on this page is for historical background and reference. CDC continues to use its other flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) networks, including the IVY network to that started in 2019 to collect data on how well flu vaccines work at preventing severe flu among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Measuring vaccine effectiveness (VE) against flu hospitalizations in older adults is important because this group has the highest hospitalization rate compared to other age groups. Also, adults who are hospitalized are more likely to have one or more underlying conditions than adults receiving outpatient care. CDC measures VE each year to evaluate the benefits of flu vaccines in different age groups and against different clinical outcomes, like hospitalization. These efforts help communicate the importance and impact of flu vaccination. NOTE:‎ The Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) ended enrollment on July 31, 2021, and is no longer being used to measure flu vaccine effectiveness. The information provided on this page is for historical background and reference. CDC continues to use its other flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) networks, including the Influenza and Other Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) network, to collect information on adults hospitalized with flu. Other HAIVEN Studies In addition to vaccine effectiveness, HAIVEN also described severe flu outcomes in hospitalized adults, such as length of hospital stay, need for intensive care, and use of ventilation. Describing these outcomes helps us better understand the patients impacted by severe flu. HAIVEN also studied respiratory infections in hospitalized older adults, including COVID-19, RSV, and human metapneumovirus. Sites and Study Design Participating sites were located in four states: Michigan Pennsylvania Tennessee Texas HAIVEN used a test-negative observational study design similar to the U.S. Flu VE Network and collected data at participating hospitals.

Therefore, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness point estimates vary among published studies. Background Different outcomes evaluated in vaccine effectiveness studies Vaccine effectiveness is a measure of how well flu vaccines work among different groups of people, in different settings, and in different real-world conditions (as opposed to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or "clinical trials). Public health researchers evaluate the benefits of vaccination against illness of varying severity, from mild-to-moderate illness resulting in a doctor visit to more severe illness resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, and even death. Different studies are used to measure different outcomes, and estimates of vaccine effectiveness may vary based on the outcome measured (as well as other factors, such as the population studied). Virus factors Vaccine effectiveness may vary based on how similar or different the vaccine virus is to circulating flu viruses. The more similar the flu vaccine is to circulating viruses, the more likely it is to offer robust protection against flu illness and complications. However, research has shown that even when the viruses are very different, vaccination can still provide as much as 30% reduction in risk123456. Keep Reading: How Flu Viruses Can Change: "Drift" and "Shift" Host factors Host factors refer to characteristics of the vaccinated person, including, for example, their age, underlying medical conditions, history of prior influenza virus infection, and prior flu vaccinations. All of these factors can affect how well vaccines work. Study design factors RCTs provide the most reliable results because they are less susceptible to selection bias and confounding. However, RCTs may be difficult or unethical to conduct when vaccination is universally recommended in a population or for more severe outcomes that are less common. There are several observational study designs; however, many flu vaccine evaluation programs currently use the test-negative design. In the test-negative design, people who seek care for an acute respiratory illness are enrolled at care settings (such as outpatient clinics, urgent care clinics, emergency departments, or in-patient settings), and information is collected about the patients’ flu vaccination status. All participants in a test-negative design study are tested for flu using a highly specific and sensitive test for influenza virus infection, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated persons (i.e., the odds of flu vaccination) is compared among patients with and without laboratory-confirmed flu. In this way, a test-negative design study estimates VE by comparing vaccination rates among persons with confirmed flu illness (also called “cases”) against vaccination rates among persons with similar illness who do not have flu (also called “controls”) based on laboratory tests. The test-negative design reduces selection bias due to health care seeking behaviors. Specificity of the outcome Factors related to measuring specific versus non-specific outcomes For both RCTs and observational studies, the specificity of the outcome measured in the study is important. Non-specific outcomes, such as pneumonia hospitalizations or influenza-like illness (ILI), can be caused by influenza virus infections or infections with other viruses and bacteria. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness estimates for non-specific outcomes are generally lower than estimates made for more specific outcomes, depending on what proportion of the outcome measured is attributable to flu. For example, a study among healthy adults found that inactivated flu vaccine (i.e., a flu shot) was 86% effective against laboratory-confirmed flu, but only 10% effective against all respiratory illnesses in the same population and season7. When assessing vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, the most specific outcome is laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection by RT-PCR or viral culture.

Situation Update August 16, 2024 – CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by a multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, or "H5N1 bird flu," in dairy cows, poultry and other animals in the United States. CDC is working in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), state public health and animal health officials, and other partners using a One Health approach. Since April 2024, 13 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection have been reported in the United States. Four of these cases were associated with exposure to sick dairy cows and nine were associated with exposure to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus-infected poultry. 1 2 Based on the information available at this time, CDC's current assessment is that the immediate risk to the general public from H5 bird flu remains low. On the animal health side, USDA is reporting that 191 dairy cow herds in 13 U.S. states have confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows as the number of infected herds continues to grow. USDA reports that since April 2024, there have been A(H5) detections in 35 commercial flocks and 21 backyard flocks, for a total of 18.68 million birds affected. Among other activities previously reported in past spotlights and ongoing, recent highlights of CDC's response to this include: Serology Update CDC continues to work with Michigan and Colorado to conduct avian influenza A(H5N1) seroprevalence investigations among dairy farm workers with potential exposure to infected cattle. Specimens from both states will be tested by CDC for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to these viruses, a sign of prior infection. In preliminary findings from the Michigan-led study released on July 19 (CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Update, July 19, 2024), no antibodies specific to avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses were detected in any of the blood samples collected in June 2024 from 35 people who work on dairy farms in Michigan with herds that were confirmed positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus. Michigan has since completed enrollment of additional farms in the state for a second phase of the study. CDC is working with both states to interpret and share results of these studies as they become available. Laboratory Update Antigenic characterization of the viruses isolated from five of the nine human cases in Colorado poultry workers has shown that the viruses remain antigenically similar to two previously developed candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) developed by CDC and available to manufacturers for vaccine production. Virus was not recoverable from the four remaining Colorado cases, so antigenic characterization could not be performed. Testing has also shown that the viruses are antigenically similar to previous clade 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated from dairy farm workers. Results of antiviral susceptibility testing of the viruses are pending. CDC also continues to meet with commercial laboratories to discuss H5 assay licensing agreements and interest in development of commercial H5 tests. CDC's Technology Transfer Office and the Influenza Division are actively pursuing licensing agreements with multiple companies, and several have been completed. Outreach Update CDC continues to support outreach to farm workers. This includes specific outreach to farm workers in affected counties through Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and digital display and audio (Pandora). CDC also is running advertisements on local radio stations about 30 times each week to reach people who may not be on social media platforms. These resources provide information in English and Spanish about potential risks of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection, recommended preventive actions, symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what to do if they develop symptoms. Outreach metrics are summarized in Table 1 (below). Surveillance Update CDC has posted a spotlight describing the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) and its role in supporting CDC's response to avian influenza A(H5N1). One of multiple surveillance tools CDC uses year-round, the NSSP collects, analyzes, and shares electronic health record data received from more than 6,500 U.S. healthcare facilities representing nearly 80% of emergency departments (ED) in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. CDC uses syndromic surveillance in partnership with participating state and local health departments to capture data quickly, identify unusual trends in flu activity, improve situational awareness, and inform decision-making. CDC staff monitor NSSP data and provide the weekly percentage of total ED visits associated with flu diagnoses. It is important to note that these visits are among persons with any influenza diagnosis and are not specific to H5N1. However, monitoring all flu diagnoses helps establish baseline flu activity in a given area and provides an early indicator of change. This helps public health professionals determine where to look more closely if there are unexpected increases in flu activity. CDC continues to support states that are monitoring people with exposure to cows, birds, or other domestic or wild animals infected, or potentially infected, with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. To date, more than 4,500 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, and at least 230 people who have developed flu-like symptoms have been tested as part of this targeted, situation-specific testing. Testing of exposed people who develop symptoms is happening at the state or local level, and CDC conducts confirmatory testing. Since February 25, 2024, more than 40,900 specimens have been tested at public health labs that would have detected avian influenza A(H5) or other novel influenza viruses. More information on monitoring can be found at Symptom Monitoring Among Persons Exposed to HPAI. CDC also continues to monitor flu surveillance data using CDC's enhanced, nationwide summer surveillance strategy, especially in areas where avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have been detected in dairy cows or other animals, for any unusual trends, including in flu-like illness, conjunctivitis, or influenza virus activity. Overall, for the most recent week of data, CDC flu surveillance systems show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, including avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Publication Highlight An August 14, 2024 preliminary risk assessment of influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) reported that the global public health risk of these viruses is low, while the risk of infection for occupationally exposed persons is "low to moderate depending on the risk mitigation measures in place." Among other actions, the authors recommend that countries increase surveillance efforts in domestic and wild birds; include infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus as a differential diagnosis in cattle and other non-avian species with a high risk of exposure; promptly report infections in animal species to WOAH; and share genetic sequences of avian influenza viruses in publicly available databases. CDC Recommendations As a reminder, CDC recommends that: People should avoid exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows), if possible. People should also avoid exposures to animal poop, bedding (litter), unpasteurized ("raw") milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, if possible. People should not drink raw milk. Pasteurization kills avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, and pasteurized milk is safe to drink. People who have job-related contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals should be aware of the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and should take proper precautions. People should wear appropriate and recommended personal protective equipment when exposed to an infected or potentially infected animal(s). CDC has recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in people. Following these recommendations is central to reducing a person's risk and containing the overall public health risk. In addition to limiting interactions between infected animals and people, containing the outbreak among animals also is important, which underscores the urgency of the work being done by USDA and animal health and industry partners. This is an evolving situation, and CDC is committed to providing frequent and timely updates. Table 1.

It was also likely the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from a cow globally. A second human case associated with the dairy cow outbreak was identified in Michigan on May 22, 2024, followed by a third case in Michigan on May 30, 2024. The fourth human case was identified in Colorado on July 3, 2024. None of these cases are associated with the others. Cumulatively, there have been 14 human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. On July 14, 2024, CDC confirmed four human cases of H5 bird flu in Colorado, and additional (fifth and sixth) cases in Colorado were confirmed at CDC and were reported on July 19, 2024. Three additional cases in Colorado from a different farm were confirmed by CDC on July 25, 2024. Nine of these 14 cumulative human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States have been confirmed as avian influenza A(H5N1). The first human case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States was reported on April 28, 2022, in a person in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in depopulating poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu. The 2022 human case was not related to dairy cows. The person only reported fatigue without any other symptoms and recovered. SourcesC.

People 65 years and older are recommended to receive higher dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines because they are more effective for that group. In Children Flu vaccination has been found during most seasons to provide a similar level of protection against flu illness in children to that seen among adults 18-64 years. ACIP recommends any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine for children without preference for any one flu vaccine over another. In several studies, flu vaccine effectiveness was higher among children who received two doses of flu vaccine the first season that they were vaccinated (as recommended) compared to "partially vaccinated" children who only received a single dose of flu vaccine123. In addition to preventing illness, flu vaccine can prevent severe, life-threatening complications in children, for example: A 2022 study showed that flu vaccination reduced children's risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75 percent. A 2020 study found that during the 2018-2019 flu season, flu vaccination reduced flu-related hospitalization by 41 percent and flu-related emergency department visits by half among children (aged 6 months to 17 years old). In 2017, a study in the journal Pediatrics was the first of its kind to show that flu vaccination also significantly reduced a child's risk of dying from flu. The study, which looked at data from four flu seasons between 2010 and 2014, found that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu-associated death by half (51 percent) among children with underlying, higher risk medical conditions and by nearly two-thirds (65 percent) among healthy children. A 2014 study showed that flu vaccine reduced children's risk of flu-related pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission by 74 percent during flu seasons from 2010-2012. In Older Adults In numerous studies since 2010, standard dose flu vaccines offered some protection in adults 65 and older against flu illness resulting in a doctor's visit as well as flu-related hospitalization, but protection was inconsistent in this age group during some flu seasons456. As a result, beginning with the 2022-2023 flu season, CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferentially recommended the use of higher dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines for people 65 years and older. The preference applies to Fluzone High-Dose Trivalent vaccine, Flublok Trivalent recombinant flu vaccine and Fluad Trivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine. This recommendation was based on a review of available studies which suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. Because flu viruses and the effectiveness of flu vaccines can vary from one season to another, it is not known whether, in any given flu season, if one of these preferentially recommended flu vaccines will always be more effective in people 65 and older.

What the CDC is doing August 15, 2024 – CDC is using multiple data sources to assess and respond to emerging health threats like the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, which has caused confirmed infections in multiple species, including U.S. poultry and dairy cattle, as well as 13 recent human infections, as of this posting. CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) captures electronic health record data reported automatically from more than 6,500 U.S. healthcare facilities, representing nearly 80% of emergency departments (ED) in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. These data become available within 24 hours of a patient visit to a participating ED. They complement other surveillance systems, but because of their timeliness, can give public health officials an early warning about potentially concerning levels of illness, allowing further investigation and action. CDC's NSSP helps public health departments track both symptoms and diagnoses to detect unusual levels of illness, such as increases in influenza activity. In addition to tracking respiratory illnesses, ED data can be used to monitor drug overdoses, heat-related illness, tick bites, and more. More than 1,400 state and local public health partners use these data through the NSSP Community of Practice, including to inform emergency response, track use of healthcare resources, and/or connect people with preventive care. Using Emergency Department Data to Detect Potential Local Increases in Influenza During the Response to H5N1 Bird Flu As part of our ongoing effort to monitor the impact of the avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak, CDC staff monitor NSSP data and provide the weekly percentage of total ED visits associated with flu diagnoses. It is important to note that these visits are among persons with any influenza diagnosis and are not specific to H5N1 bird flu. However, monitoring all flu diagnoses helps establish baseline flu activity in a given area and provides an early indicator of change. This helps public health professionals determine where to look more closely if there are unexpected increases in flu activity. CDC routinely uses multiple flu indicators—including syndromic surveillance—to track influenza activity. Because such a high percentage of U.S. EDs contribute to NSSP, increases in reported ED visits due to influenza infections, at a more granular geographic level, may be recognized more easily than with other surveillance systems. Local public health departments are able to view local jurisdictional data. CDC, which supports local, state, regional and national responses, looks across multiple indicators when there are increases in reported influenza visits. Tracking the Virus CDC monitors influenza virus and illness activity year-round. State and local public health professionals can use the surveillance data that CDC makes available to them and to the public to get a better understanding of the avian influenza A(H5N1) situation. CDC and public health departments collaboratively monitor flu activity using data 1 from laboratories, outpatient providers, hospitals and vital statistics offices. CDC's ongoing investments in enhancing syndromic surveillance unites public health departments in tracking the spread of diseases that cross jurisdictional borders. When unusual trends or data anomalies are detected by the agency, CDC's NSSP consults with state or local health departments via the NSSP Community of Practice. Using NSSP data as well as other surveillance systems, CDC staff and state and local public health professionals are working to provide timely, accurate data so that decision-makers and the public can make informed health choices. Information on other surveillance systems that are used to track flu is available, along with how those systems are being used to track H5N1.

Prior to December 2022, the network was known as the “Influenza and Other Viruses in the Acutely Ill network.” IVY was created initially in 2019 to estimate how well influenza (flu) vaccines work to prevent severe flu illness among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In 2021, IVY expanded to also assess how well flu vaccines work to prevent flu hospitalizations and how well COVID-19 vaccines work to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations. In 2022, patients hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were added to begin monitoring RSV disease among hospitalized adults. Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Measuring vaccine effectiveness (VE) in hospitalized adults is important to better understand how well flu and COVID-19 vaccines protect against hospitalizations and ICU admissions. VE among adults 65 years and older is especially important because this group of people has the highest flu- and COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates compared to other age groups. CDC measures VE to evaluate the benefits of flu and COVID-19 vaccines in different age groups and against different clinical outcomes, such as hospitalization or ICU admission. These efforts help convey the importance and impact of flu vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination. Sites and Study Design 25 participating sites are located in 20 U.S. states: Baylor Scott & White Medical Center (Texas) Baylor University Medical Center (Texas) Baystate Medical Center (Massachusetts) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Massachusetts) Cleveland Clinic (Ohio) Emory University Medical Center (Georgia) Hennepin County Medical Center (Minnesota) Henry Ford Health (Michigan) Intermountain Medical Center (Utah) Johns Hopkins Hospital (Maryland) Montefiore Medical Center (New York) The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (Ohio) Oregon Health & Science University Hospital (Oregon) Stanford University Medical Center (California) UCLA Medical Center (California) University of Colorado Hospital (Colorado) University of Iowa Hospitals (Iowa) University of Miami Medical Center (Florida) University of Michigan Hospital (Michigan) University of Washington (Washington) Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Tennessee) Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center (North Carolina) Barnes-Jewish Hospital (Missouri) University of Arizona Medical Center (Arizona) Yale University (Connecticut) U.S. map showing the 20 participating sites of the IVY Network.

Various factors influence how well flu vaccines work including repeat vaccinations. Networks Information about the networks CDC uses to study flu vaccine effectiveness is available at CDC's Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Networks. Background How well flu vaccines work (or their ability to protect against a certain outcome) can vary from season to season. Protection can vary depending on who is being vaccinated. At least two factors play an important role in determining the likelihood that vaccination will protect a person from flu illness: 1) characteristics of the person being vaccinated (such as their age and health), and 2) how similar vaccines are to the influenza viruses spreading in the community. When flu vaccines are not very similar to some viruses spreading in the community, vaccination may provide little or no protection against illness caused by those viruses. However, the vaccines may still provide protection against other influenza viruses that circulate during the season. When there is high similarity between vaccines and circulating viruses, vaccination provides substantial benefits by preventing flu illness and complications. Each flu season, researchers try to determine how well flu vaccines work to prevent flu illness and complications. Estimates of how well a flu vaccine works can vary based on study design, outcome(s) measured, population studied, and type of flu vaccine. Differences between studies must be considered when results are compared. Repeat Vaccinations Scientists continue to study and learn more about how a person's flu vaccine history affect vaccine effectiveness. Studies have shown that previous flu vaccinations or infections can affect the immune response to flu vaccination in variable ways. A 2021 study conducted over six flu seasons (2012-2013 to 2017-2018) found that among people who get a flu vaccine each year (i.e., repeat vaccinees), getting the current season's flu vaccine generally was beneficial in reducing flu illness that results in a medical visit. There was no significant loss in protection among study participants who received the current and prior season's flu vaccine compared to those who were only vaccinated during the current season. Importantly, among people with prior season vaccination, current season vaccination provided significant added protection overall and against A(H1N1)pdm09- and influenza B-associated illnesses. These findings support the current ACIP recommendations for annual flu vaccination and demonstrate that study participants vaccinated during the prior flu season benefit overall from getting vaccinated during the current season. Some studies have shown reduced flu vaccine effectiveness–particularly against A(H3N2) viruses–among people who were vaccinated in both the current and prior season compared with those who had only been vaccinated in the current season. However, this finding could be the result of study bias related to the "carryover" benefits of the prior season's vaccine. Of note, when the benefits of current flu vaccines are analyzed separately for people only vaccinated this season and people vaccinated both this season and the prior season, benefits of current season flu vaccination are observed for both groups. CDC is learning more about how repeat vaccination affects vaccine effectiveness, but current findings continue to support the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendations for annual flu vaccination.

However, the identification and quantification of naturally occurring glycation of membrane proteins by mass spectrometry remain technically challenging. We used highly sensitive LC MS/MS analyses combined with multiple enzyme digestions to determine low abundance early-stage lysine glycation products of influenza vaccines derived from embryonated chicken eggs and cultured cells. Straightforward sequencing was enhanced by MS/MS fragmentation of small peptides. As a result, we determined a widespread distribution of lysine modifications attributed by the region-selectivity and site-specificity of glycation toward influenza matrix 1, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Topological analysis provides insights into the site-specific lysine glycation, localizing in the distinct structural regions of proteins surrounding the viral envelope membrane. Our finding highlights the proteome-wide discovery of lysine glycation of influenza membrane proteins and potential effects on the structural assembly, stability, receptor binding and enzyme activity, demonstrating that the impacts of accumulated glycation on the quality of products can be directly monitored by mass spectrometry-based structural proteomics analyses.

The early-stage glycation adducts are reversible, which can undergo Maillard reactions, Amadori and Heyns rearrangement to form stable advanced glycation end products (AGEs)3. AGEs have direct impacts on a large number of biological processes including metabolic dysfunction, chronic diseases, aging and age-related disorders1,4,5,6. Glycation is typically caused by chemical reactions of proteins in cell culture media and endogenous metabolites of protein expression2, and storage exposure to reducing sugars7, resulting in undesired modifications and negative effects on the quality, efficiency and safety of therapeutic biologics. For example, site-specific glycation of recombinant proteins in monoclonal antibody drugs affects protein stability, degradation, aggregation, antigen binding, half-life and immunogenicity2,8, and is therefore considered as a potential critical quality attribute that must be monitored and controlled. Despite its biological importance, the impairment of glycation on the protein structure and function of influenza vaccine products has hitherto not been explored. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing virus infections, with the most common influenza vaccines primarily produced by live attenuated or inactivated viruses growing in embryonated chicken eggs or cultured cells9. In the manufacturing processes, quality control of protein modifications resulting from in vivo biosynthesis and in vitro chemical reactions is essential for ensuring the safety and efficacy of vaccine products. The presence of high abundance product-related N-glycosylation of glycoproteins in influenza vaccines and process-induced modifications by β-propiolactone (BPL) and formaldehyde during virus inactivation has been extensively investigated by us and other research groups10,11,12,13,14.Efforts to achieve in-depth characterization of protein modifications of influenza vaccines, focusing on the previously uncharacterized glycation, are currently undertaken to evaluate the potential impacts on the quality of products. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) is utilized for the highly efficient separation and sensitive detection of glycated peptides following enzymatic digestions of proteins. Nevertheless, large-scale analysis of naturally occurring glycation products of influenza membrane proteins remains a technical challenge due to the lability of modifications, low abundances, poor peptide fragmentation and insufficient sequencing coverage15. Poor MS/MS fragmentation often occurs for large-size glycated peptides containing missed trypsin cleavage sites, owing to a hexose group covalently attached to the lysine residue16. Ambiguous identity may be thus retrieved by automatic database search and peptide sequencing of incomplete MS/MS fragments in the case of O-linked glucosylation and mannosylation incurred at nearby serinehreonine residues, as the isobaric mass shift of 162 Da in a glycosylated residue is the same as that of lysine hexose-glycation (i.e. hexosylation)17,18. To overcome these problems, alternative techniques of boronate-affinity enrichment and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) were previously employed to improve the reliable identification of in vitro glucose-induced glycation sites of proteins19,20,21,22, however, the wide application was restricted by small amounts of material, low levels of native glycation and the relatively low ETD fragmentation efficiency of the glycated peptide backbone compared to that of collision-induced dissociation (CID). Although the use of ETD enables the reliable identification of large peptides containing labile post-translational modifications at multiply charged states, the peptide fragmentation by transferring electrons to protonated peptides is less sensitive than CID and ineffective for doubly charged ions and small peptides.Herein, we present a straightforward method for the comprehensive characterization of early-stage protein glycation in influenza vaccines. High abundance N-glycan attachments of influenza glycoproteins were first removed by endoglycosidase PNGase F, and multiple enzyme digestions of proteins were then conducted at neutral pH conditions to generate small sized peptides for enhancing MS/MS fragmentations. Validation of the glycation sites were confirmed by manual inspection of MS/MS fragmentations of the glycated peptides based on sufficient sequencing information. Through examination of several vaccine strains of influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9) and influenza B derived from mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, human embryonic retinal cells (Per C6) and embryonated chicken eggs, we have identified a widespread distribution of early-stage hexose-glycated lysines exclusively presented in matrix 1 (M1), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surrounding the influenza envelop membrane. Structure-based topology analyses revealed that the site-specific glycation residues are highly conserved in the protein sequences across various subtypes of influenza vaccine strains. These residues are predominantly situated within distinct α-helix, β-sheet and loop regions, which are accessible to reducing sugar molecules. The critical sites of lysine glycation, localized at the transmembrane surface of protein M1 and in the receptor-binding cavity of HA and NA, are postulated to have significant effects on the structure and function of the proteins including stability, receptor binding and enzymatic activity.Results and discussionSite-specific lysine glycation of influenza proteinsTwelve influenza vaccines derived from embryonated chicken eggs and cultured cells were chosen for analyses to examine the possible glycation of proteins. The influenza virion typically contains proteins assembled by hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein M1, ion channel membrane protein M2, non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2), nucleoprotein (NP), ribonucleoprotein (RNP), nuclear export protein (NEP), polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic proteins (PB1 and PB2)23,24. Preliminary LC MS/MS analysis of protein digests, resulted from the sequential de-N-glycosylation by endoglycosidase PNGase F followed by cleavage using a single protease of trypsin or chymotrypsin, only determined partial sequences of the membrane proteins. Instead, combined enzymatic digestions with trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C and chymotrypsin at neutral pH conditions were able to yield a nearly complete sequence coverage of individual proteins. Initial screening of protein modifications was performed using Byonic wide search against the influenza proteome databases and glycan libraries, which retrieved a number of peptides bearing additional masses of 162 Da. In-depth investigation of the modified peptides by Mascot search identified the glycation at lysine residues. These glycated peptides were remarkably detected in the proteins to varying degrees in eight vaccine samples (Tables S1, S2). By comparison, high levels of glycated proteins were observed in influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (egg-derived) and B/Phuket/3073/2013, whereas the lysine glycation of influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1), A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Per. C6 cell-derived) appeared at lower frequencies. Exceptionally, influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 has only one glycation site occupied at Lys187 of M1. It is of note that the glycation of peptides merely occurred at the specific lysine sites of the membrane proteins M1, HA and NA, rather than the other structural proteins of M2, NP, RNP, NS1, NS2, NEP, PA, PB1 and PB2, suggesting the region-selectivity and site-specificity of influenza protein glycation surrounding the viral envelop membrane.To obtain the reliable identification of glycated peptides and the precise location of glycation sites, we conducted a thorough inspection of the database search results by means of high mass-accuracy measurements, MS/MS fragmentation patterns, and the existence of missed trypsin cleavage sites of peptides due to lysine glycation25. In agree with previous reports26,27, MS/MS fragmentation of glycated peptides displayed characteristic fragments involving the neutral losses of water molecules (− 18 Da, − 36 Da, − 54 Da) from the peptide precursor ions, owing to preferential cleavages of the attached hexose moiety to a glycated lysine under CID conditions. Figure 1 showed a typical MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged ions of peptide 30–40 (SVFAGK35NTDLE) at m/z 671.8223, the presence of a series of singly charged b and y ions, along with the aforementioned neutral losses, identified the hexose glycation site at Lys35 (+ 162 Da) of the M1 peptide from an endoproteinase Glu-C and trypsin digest of influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010. Therefore, the use of multiple enzyme digestions and LC MS/MS sequencing of small peptides renders comprehensive identification of lysine glycation sites in proteins. Through such analyses, we have identified 23 unique lysine glycation sites of M1 (9), HA (10) and NA (4) in the influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010 (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). Our observation based on manual data analysis of the MS/MS spectra has shown no serinehreonine O-glycation in the peptides, consistent with the previous report28.Figure 1MS/MS spectrum of a glycated peptide from an endoproteinase Glu-Crypsin digest of influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010. Peptide sequencing of the doubly charged ions of m/z 671.8223 identified the 162 Da modification at Lys35 in the peptide 30–40 of matrix 1. The mass spectrum is analyzed using Thermo Xcalibur 4.1.50.Full size imagePreferential glycation sites of the inner membrane protein M1 at Lys35 and Lys187Influenza protein M1 is the most abundant structural protein located inside the viral lipid bilayer membrane, and plays a vital role in budding and stabilizing virus particles (Fig. 2a)29,30. Sequences of M1 are highly conserved in the influenza virus family (Fig. S2), and the structure typically contains a globular N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–164) and a flexible C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 165–252)31,32,33. Positively charged residues on the surface of the NTD electrostatically interact with negatively charged lipid molecules of the viral envelope membrane, revealing a high affinity of liposome binding34,35. In influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010, the full-length sequence of M1 consists of 13 lysines (Fig. S2), in which 9 of them were found to be glycated at residues Lys21, Lys57, Lys98, Lys113, Lys187, Lys230 and Lys242 in the helix bundles and Lys35, Lys47 in the loop regions (Fig. 2b).Figure 2Topological localization of glycated proteins in influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010. (a) The typical influenza virus contains several proteins including two major surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the matrix 1 (M1) inside the virus envelope, and the ion channel membrane protein (M2) across the membrane. A hexagon shape diagram in the inset represents multi-hexose glycation of lysines in the membrane proteins of M1, HA and NA. (b) The structure of M1 is composed of 252 amino acids with the deletion of methionine at the N-terminus, consisting of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 2–163) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 164–252). (c) The HA structure encompasses the globular head domain (i.e. the receptor binding domain, RBD) and the stem domain. The glycated lysines at the structural locations are highlighted in red. The protein structure modeling and visualization are made using Phyre2 server (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/) and UCSF Chimera 1.15 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/), respectively.Full size imageThe preferential glycation sites of M1 are localized at the highly conserved residues Lys35 and Lys187 (Fig. S2), as determined to be the higher and highest occurring frequencies of glycated residues in the influenza vaccines analyzed (Fig. 3a,b). Early-stage glycation is catalyzed by the neighboring group interaction of acidic residues in the vicinity of lysine residues36,37, and is favored by stabilizing helical conformations in which the proximate position of catalytic groups is spatially aligned on the same helix face as that of lysine38,39. The sequences of the glycated peptides contain the structural motifs of 35KXXD38, 94DXXXK98 and 187KXXE190, in which the neighboring Glu190 to Lys187 branched in parallel on the helical membrane surface that catalyzes the Lys187 glycation, whereas the adjacent Asp38 to Lys35 extended its branching side chain flanked on the loop region in an antiparallel orientation and catalyzed the Lys35 glycation (Fig. 3c). Similarly, the neighboring Asp94 catalyzes the Lys98 glycation on the helical surface (Fig. 3d). The existence of nonglycated lysines at residues 101, 102 and 104, adjacent to Lys98, could be ascribed to the spatial location in the region without catalytic residues. The glycation could be also inhibited by tightly electrostatic interactions of the surface charges between multiple basic residues (Lys101, Lys102, Lys104 and Arg105) and lipid molecules in the viral membrane (Fig. 3d). Overall, the wide-spread lysine glycation of M1 can lead to the extensive removal of positive surface charges of the α-helical bundles, which has the potential to disrupt the interactions with the lipid membrane as well as the associated viral proteins, and consequently destabilize the structural integrity of influenza virus assembly.Figure 3Neighboring group effects on the glycation of Lys35, Lys98 and Lys187 in matrix 1. (a) MS/MS sequencing of the doubly charged ion of m/z 707.8440, from an endoproteinase Glu-Crypsin digest of influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010 (H1N1), identified the glycation site of peptide 179–190 at Lys187. (b) Distribution of M1 glycated residues in influenza vaccines. (c) The proximate acidic residue Glu190 branching in parallel toward Lys187 on the same helical face catalyzes Lys187 glycation, while the spatial location of adjacent Asp38 branching on the flanked loop in an antiparallel orientation toward Lys35 is favorable for Lys35 glycation. (d) The neighboring Asp94 catalyzes Lys98 glycation. However, the highly electrostatic interaction of multiple basic residues with the membrane lipid bilayer prohibits glycation of lysines 101, 102 and 104 nearby Lys98.

The mass spectrum is analyzed using Thermo Xcalibur 4.1.50, and the protein structure is visualized by UCSF Chimera 1.15 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).Full size imageStructural impacts of lysine glycation on outer membrane proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidaseInfluenza HA and NA are two major surface glycoproteins. HA is responsible for attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors and subsequent fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane, while NA cleaves sialic acids (SA) from glycoproteins enabling the virus particles to be released from the cells40. Cleavage of HA precursor (HA0) into two subunits (HA1 and HA2) in the mature protein by an endogenous protease is essential, which occurs at a site characterized by the presence of basic amino acids and conserved residues41,42. HA1 initializes the receptor binding at the early stage of virus infection and HA2 mediates cell membrane fusion43. Structural assembling of HA homotrimer comprises a highly variable globular head domain (GHD) and a conserved stem domain in each monomer44,45. The GHD contains a receptor-binding pocket, responsible for binding SA receptors, and 4 antigenic sites (Sa, Sb, Ca and Cb) that are recognized by the host immune system. In the HA structure of influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010 (Fig. 2c), the involvement of 4 loops at residues 132–165, 168–178, 183–189, 252–255 in the GHD contains 11 lysines with positive charges enables the electrostatic interactions with SA receptors. Of the identified 10 glycation sites, Lys71, Lys163 and Lys188 are situated within the flanked loop regions of the GHD, and Lys256 is positioned at the transition from a β-strand to the short loop linker extension spanning residues 252–255. These glycated lysines localize around the receptor-binding cavity, and thus could possess potential effects on the receptor binding of HA. In view of the antigenic sites reported previously (Fig. S3)45, the glycated lysine residues are not distributed in the targeted antigenic sequence regions and consequently may unveil no functional impairment on the epitopes exposed for antibody recognition (Fig. S4).In addition to receptor binding, HA also functions in mediating membrane fusion in virus infection. In this role, the stem domain folds in a central triple-stranded coiled-coil structure followed by a loop region and two antiparallel helices that anchor HA to the viral membrane. The glycation of lysines 391, 402 and 460, localized on two major stalk membrane helices, could trigger the conformational change of the protein required for membrane fusion, although proteolytic cleavage sites at the highly conserved region involving a basic residue Arg344 in the vicinity of hydrophobic fusion peptide 345GLFGAIAGFIEGGW358 remain unaffected (Fig. 2c, Fig. S5).In contrast, the NA assembles as a homotetramer anchored to the viral envelope by the N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain, consisting of GHD with the SA binding cavity surrounded by the 150 loop and 330 loop adjacent to the enzymatic active sites46,47. Four lysine glycation sites were found in the NA GHD of influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010 (Table S1, Fig. 4a), in which lysines 143, 102 and 419 are positioned at the α-helix and β-sheets of the protein surface, and the remaining Lys347 resides at the 330 loop region in the receptor binding cavity (Fig. 4b). The unmodified Lys347 naturally bearing a positive charge serves as a critical active site for SA binding, and the multiple sequence alignment of NAs indicated that Lys347 is highly conserved among influenza A and B virus strains (Fig. 4c,d and Fig. S6). As a result, Lys347 glycation could play a significant role to disrupt the interaction of NA with SA receptors and consequently influence the overall enzymatic activity. A comparable situation occurred at glycated Lys343 of NA in influenza B vaccines in the same structure region, as the reaction site is catalyzed by the neighboring residue in the protein (Table S2, Fig. 4c). Taken together, structural analyses suggested that the lysine glycation of the outer membrane proteins HA and NA may possess a detrimental effect on the receptor binding and enzyme activity. However, it does not seem to interfere with the antigenic sites recognized by antibody or the fusion peptide cleavage during the process of membrane fusion.Figure 4Lysine glycation sites of neuraminidase in influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010. (a) MS/MS sequencing of the doubly charged peptide ion at m/z 930.4031 from a chymotrypsin and trypsin digest identifies the hexose-glycation of peptide 332–349 at Lys347; (b) Multiple sequence alignment of neuraminidases of influenza NAs shows that the residue Lys347 is highly conserved; (c) The identified glycation sites at lysines 102, 143, 347 and 419 (coloured in red) by LC MS/MS are localized on the protein structure; (d) The surface topology shows the glycated Lys347 in the cavity and the receptor-binding pocket as highlighted with the atom stick model. The mass spectrum is analyzed using Thermo Xcalibur 4.1.50, and the protein structure is visualized by UCSF Chimera 1.15 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).Full size imageSequence-dependent lysine glycation of membrane proteins catalyzed by proximate residuesSimilar measurements were performed on other vaccine strains, large-scale LC MS/MS analysis identified 114 unique glycated peptides and 85 glycated lysine sites of the membrane proteins M1, HA and NA (Table S2, Fig. 5a,b). Overall, the results displayed a wide-spread distribution of glycation in the proteins, and the site density analysis showed a clearly different profile in the NTD and CTD regions of M1 between the subtypes of influenza A and B (Fig. 5c). To investigate whether these glycation sites exhibit a statistical correlation between sequence patterns and neighboring residues, we first analyzed the relative frequency of 15 amino acid residues at the N- and C-terminal side of the glycation sites using the full influenza protein sequences as the background. Sequence logos showed no consensus sequence motif of lysine glycation, and no significant feature of the alignment on a high frequency of stretched residues from the glycation sites of membrane proteins (Fig. 5d). Considering the spatial effects of proximate residues on the formation of a glycated lysine on the same side of α-helical peptide surface, we then manually examined the polar residues at the ± 4 positions away from the glycated sites (Table S3). In the refined 85 sequence fragments, 24 of them were found to contain Ser/Thr residues, and 15 and 16 sequences consist of Asp/Glu and Lys/Arg at the proximate positions, respectively. As protein folding tends to retain hydrophilic residues on the outside of a protein structure, positively charged basic residues (Lys/Arg) on the protein surface often maintain tightly electrostatic interactions with lipids of the membrane and inhibit lysine glycation. Consequently, the uncharged Ser/Thr containing the hydroxyl side chain and negatively charged Asp/Glu at the ± 4 positions function as hydrogen bonding and the hydrophilic interactions with reducing sugars, catalyzing the non-enzymatic glycation of lysines on the helical surface. On the opposite side of the helix, residues lie at ± 2 and ± 6 positions spatially far away from lysine as shown in Fig. 5e. The motif-based sequence analysis revealed the overrepresented pattern of nonpolar residues (Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, etc.) surrounding the lysine glycation sites at ± 2 and ± 6 positions (Fig. 5d), indicating the participation of hydrophobic interactions of neighboring residues to stabilize the α-helical conformation. Our analyses thus identified the catalytic effects of adjacent residues on site-specific lysines, and the glycation of membrane proteins prefers to lysine sites localized at a helical region structurally bearing hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic surface.Figure 5Sequence-dependent glycation sites of influenza vaccines.

Figure S7 showed the MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged ion at m/z 478.7920 from a chymotrypsin digest of human Per. C6 cell-derived influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008. MS/MS fragmentation revealed a set of b3 to b7 product ions, corresponding to the predicted peptide fragments at residues 353–359 (RPPAKLL) of HA with the additional mass increase of 162 Da. Based on two pairs of complementary fragments between y2/b5 and y3/b4, the unchanged residual mass at Lys357 indicated that the lysine was not glycated. The modification is therefore inferred to the hexosylation of Arg353 at the N-terminus, rather than its nearby low-reactivity amino acids 354–356 (PPA). The signature assignments on two doubly charged fragment ions of [b7 + 162 Da] at m/z 469.80 and [b7 + 162 Da − 54 Da] (i.e. the losses of three water molecules) at m/z 442.28, further supported the identity of a hexose attachment to the peptide. Although arginine is able to form AGEs by either cellular metabolites or the degraded intermediates of monosaccharide autoxidation, it is less likely to be glycated via the early-stage non-enzymatic reaction with glucose48; the incidence of 162 Da mass increment could be explained by the glycosylation of arginine in the human cells catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase. Obviously, the formation of hexose-modified arginine here is unusual, and the underlying mechanism remains to be further understood.Following careful examination of MS/MS spectra, we also found that other modified peptides containing a mass difference of 163 Da were mistakenly assigned to two modifications involving a hexose-glycated arginine (+ 162.0528 Da) and the deamidation of asparagine or glutamine (+ 0.9840 Da) (Fig. S8). The false-positive identifications were caused by the predicted peptides from a chymotrypsin digest of proteins, in which a tyrosine residue (+ 163.0633 Da) at the termini were actually missed in the sequences (HA residues 193–206 and NA residues 324–349). The MS/MS spectra revealed the mass increase of 163 Da exclusively in the series of either C-terminal y fragment ions (Fig. S8a) or N-terminal b fragment ions (Fig. S8b), suggesting the addition of tyrosine at the C- or N-terminus of the two peptides. Conceivably, alternative peptide sequence assignments of 193GIHHPNDAAEQTRLY207 of HA in influenza Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 and 323YLDTPRPNDGSITGPCESDGDEGSGGIK349 of NA in influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 were actually true to reflect the high-accuracy mass measurements and MS/MS fragmentations. Such incorrect identification can be avoided in the database search using a peptide mass error tolerance of less than 5 ppm, similar to that reported previously by Ma et al.49.Limitations of the study and potential solutionsIn this study, a LC MS/MS method has been established for the proteome-wide identification of lysine glycation in influenza vaccines, and we demonstrated that the potential impacts of accumulated glycation on the quality of products can be monitored by mass spectrometry-based structural proteomics. Influenza vaccines samples were randomly selected from those derived from embryonated chicken eggs and cultured cells, and unbiased identification of the protein glycation was achieved by LC MS/MS analyses of protein digests, database search and manual validation of mass spectra. Subsequently, topological analyses of the identified glycation sites were conducted based on structural modeling of proteins from the cryo-EM and 3D crystal structures of a H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus. However, the method currently has some limitations. First, relative quantification of protein glycation in influenza vaccines is not feasible due to low abundances of native glycation products and large variations of protein sequences among the vaccine strains. Second, database search and manual data analysis at the proteomic scale can be time-consuming if non-specific enzymatic cleavages of membrane proteins are further considered. Third, the involvement of other types of modifications on proteins may interfere with the identification of low abundance lysine glycation, careful interpretation of datasets is thus required due to isobaric masses of peptides and ambiguous locations of modified residues caused by incomplete mass spectral fragmentation for MS/MS sequencing. Future investigations would be possible to develop alternative approaches by incorporating isotopically labeled standards of proteins or glucose into samples for accurate quantification of protein glycation. In addition, the throughput of data analyses could be improved by the degree of increasing specificity of enzymatic digestions, and sequential cleavages of proteins using the stepwise addition of individual proteases at the optimum pH conditions, instead of an enzyme mixture, result in high digestion efficiency of proteins. To enhance the accuracy of peptide identifications, the utilization of high mass accuracy measurements (< 5 ppm) of peptide precursor ions can reduce uncertainties and false positives in the database search results as mentioned above. In the presence of modified proteins on multiple amino acids by diverse functional groups, a pretreatment step of samples by eliminating unrelated protein modifications may help mitigate the effect. The removal of other predominantly coexisting modifications of proteins is also favorable to boost the detection of low abundance lysine glycation by mass spectrometry, similar to that of protein de-N-glycosylation in the experimental procedure.ConclusionsThe extent of naturally occurring glycation of membrane proteins in influenza vaccine products is typically low, presenting a difficult task for analysis. We have determined the labile early-stage lysine glycation and mapped the topological location of influenza membrane proteins M1, HA and NA using highly sensitive LC MS/MS techniques. The non-enzymatic reactions of the proteins with reducing sugars are likely originated from either glucose in culture cell media or glucose and fructose generated from the hydrolysis of sucrose in influenza vaccine formulations, as the large polar metabolites of monosaccharides in embryonated chicken eggs and cultured cells cannot penetrate through lipid membrane without carrier proteins (i.e. transporters)50,51. Glucose-induced glycation can be an important quality attribute for certain therapeutic proteins2,52. The region-selectivity and site-specificity of the lysine glycation of influenza proteins surrounding the viral lipid membrane have potential effects on the protein structure, stability, virus assembly, receptor binding and enzyme activity. Accumulation of AGEs on lysine, arginine and cysteine residues by dicarbonyl metabolites is not evaluated in this study. Data analyses were hampered by the complexity of protein modifications involving high abundance process-induced BPL derivatives caused by virus inactivation10, which contain exactly the same compositions and isobaric mass changes of mono- and bis-alkylated modifications (C3H4O2, 72.0211 Da; C6H8O4, 144.0423 Da) as those of AGE products (e.g. Nε-carboxyethyl lysine (CML), Nε-carboxyethyl cysteine (CMC), tetrahydropyrimidine (THP) derivatives of arginine). In addition, the identical masses caused by the carbamidomethylation of cysteine and lysine (57.0215 Da) and the deamidation of asparagine/glutamine (0.9840 Da) during sample preparations also interfere with the global analysis of AGEs on carboxymethyl lysine (CML), carboxymethyl arginine (CMA) and carboxymethyl cysteine (CMC) (C2H2O2, 58.0055 Da).In summary, we identified a wide range of early-stage lysine glycation, predominantly occurring at the highly conserved sites of influenza membrane proteins, especially the critical residues of Lys187, Lys163, Lys347 in the surface transmembrane domains of M1 and the receptor-binding domains of HA and NA, respectively. These findings reveal potential functional significance of lysine glycation of influenza proteins, and highlight the importance of avoiding such undesired reactions to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of influenza vaccine products. The motif-based sequence analysis provides insights into the preferential sites of lysine glycation catalyzed by site-specific neighboring residues, contributing a broader understanding of glycation in membrane proteins.Methods and materialsMaterialsInfluenza vaccines, stored in a freezer at − 80 °C, were originally obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, Hertfordshire, UK) (Table S4). Specifically, influenza antigens of A/Brisbane/10/2010 (H1N1-like, 11/134), A/Texas/50/2012 (NMYC X-223A, H3N2-like, 13/162), Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 (NIBRG-23, H5N1, 07/112), A/Anhui/1/2013 (NIBRG-268, H7N9, 14/250), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (NYMC BX-35, 14/146) were derived from mammalian MDCK and human Per C6 cells, respectively. Influenza antigens of A /California/7/2009 (NYMC X-179A, H1N1, 13/164), A/Michigan/45/2015 (NYMC X-275, H1N1, 16/298), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (NYMC X-263B, H3N2, 16/286), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (16/118), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (13/234), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (16/158) were prepared from purified virus grown in eggs. All vaccines were inactivated by BPL or formalin, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and processed for freeze drying as described in the webpage (https:/ibsc.org/documents).Chemical reagents including acetonitrile (ACN), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), glutamic acid, formic acid (FA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON). Enzymes of sequencing-grade trypsin (porcine pancreas), endoproteinase Glu-C (staphylococcus aureaus V8), chymotrypsin (bovine pancreas), PNGase F (Elizabethkingia miricola) were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), Roche Diagnostics (GmbH, Germany) and New England Biolabs (Whitby, ON), respectively.Protein purification and enzymatic digestions at neutral pH conditionsVaccine samples were initially dissolved in 300 µL of 25 mM NH4HCO3, and dialyzed against 5 mM NH4HCO3 to remove low-molecular-weight compounds. Protein disulfide bonds were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 60 °C and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h each. The samples were dialyzed again and dried by a refrigerated CentriVap concentrator (Labconco, Fort Scott, KS). Subsequently, the alkylated proteins in 25 mM NH4HCO3 were deglycosylated by addition of 1 uL of PNGase F and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Enzymatic digestion of proteins was performed at 37 °C overnight using trypsin, or endoproteinase Glu-C, chymotrypsin followed by the addition of trypsin at the enzyme-to-protein substrate ratio of 1/100 (w/w), 1/50 (w/w) and 1/50 (w/w) in 25 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 7.6 for another 12 h, respectively.LC MS/MS analysis of enzymatic digestsThe enzymatic digests of influenza proteins were dried, dissolved in 0.2% FA, and analyzed by data dependent LC MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Watham, MA) coupled with an Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography M-class system (Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were trapped for 3 min at a flow rate of 5 µL min−1 of solvent A (0.1% FA in water) on a NanoEase M/Z symmetry C18 trap column (180 µm × 2 cm, 5 µm, 100 Å), followed by separation with either a NanoEase M/Z HSS C18 T3 column (75 µm × 15 cm, 1.8 µm, 100 Å) or a peptide BEH C18 column (75 µm × 10 cm, 1.7 µm, 130 Å) at 250 nL min−1 using a linear gradient of 10–30% solvent B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile) over 65 min. MS survey scans were acquired by the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 at the mass range of m/z 350 to 1800 at the positive ionization mode. MS/MS measurements were carried out on multiply charged ions of peptides using the ion-trap and helium gas at low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID), normalized collision energies of 27%. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for a period of 30 s.Identification of glycated peptides of influenza proteinsInfluenza proteome databases were created using protein sequences downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database (https://www.gisaid.org). Raw LC MS/MS data and the converted mascot generic format (mgf) files using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) were used to search for glycated peptides by Byonic (version 3.6.0, Protein Metrics Inc.) and Mascot (version 2.7.0, Matrix Science) software. To simplify data interpretation, search parameters were set to the enzymatic cleavage specificity sites of trypsin at lysine and arginine, endoproteinase Glu-C at aspartic acid and glutamic acid, chymotrypsin at phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and leucine. The maximum missed cleavage of enzymes was set to 3. Deamidation of asparagine or glutamine (+ 0.9840 Da) and the glycation of lysine and arginine (+ 162.0528 Da) were considered for variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation (+ 57.0215 Da) of cysteine was set to the fixed modification. Mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm for Orbitrap MS ions, and 0.8 Da for CID ion-trap MS/MS fragments. The significance threshold of peptide identifications was chosen to be p < 0.05 for Mascot search. A false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for Byonic in peptide assignments. The identified glycated peptides were carefully examined by Xcalibur software (version 4.1.50, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and validated by manual inspection of mass spectra based on the predicted MS/MS peptide fragments and the high mass accuracy (~ 1 ppm) of MS measurements.Topological analysis of lysine glycation of influenza proteinsStructural modeling of proteins in the influenza A/Brisbane/10/2010 was built using Phyre2 server (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/) with 100% confidence, and confirmed using AlphaFold (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk). Templates of M1, HA and NA were adopted based on the cryo-EM and 3D crystal structures of H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession numbers of 7JM3, 5K9O and 4B7Q, respectively31,53,54. The topological location of lysine glycation in the protein structures was analyzed using UCSF Chimera 1.15 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).Statistical analysis of glycated lysine sitesSequence logos were generated by pLogo algorithm (https://plogo.uconn.edu/) using a sequence window of 15 amino acid residues surrounding glycation sites. Since the identified glycation sites were restricted to proteins M1, HA and NA, full sequences of the three influenza proteins were used as the background for statistical analysis. The glycation site distribution plot was generated using ggplot in R (version 4.2.2) and the density was calculated using R package ggridges.

We examined the COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake and disparities in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic to inform vaccination interventions. We used data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre database in England and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales. The uptake of at least one dose of vaccine was 40.2% for COVID-19 and 41.8% for influenza among eligible pregnant women. We observed disparities in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake, with socioeconomically deprived and ethnic minority groups showing lower vaccination rates. The suboptimal uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, especially in those from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds and Black, mixed or other ethnic groups, underscores the necessity for interventions to reduce vaccine hesitancy and enhance acceptance in pregnant women.

Vaccinations against COVID-194 and influenza5 were found to reduce these adverse outcomes and are therefore included in the routine immunisation schedule for pregnant women in the United Kingdom (UK)6. However, although COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are recommended for pregnant women, their uptake during pregnancy remains suboptimal7,8. This may be due to concerns about side effects and vaccine safety among pregnant women9, also known as vaccine hesitancy, which were found to be related to their demographics and baseline health conditions7,10,11,12.Previous studies suggested the uptake of COVID-19 or influenza vaccines among pregnant women was lower in younger age groups7,10, black or unknown ethnicity10,11, deprived socioeconomic status10,11, those with no known risk factors for influenza11,13 and those living in large multigenerational household composition12. None of the available studies provided a population-level evaluation of COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in pregnant women in England and Wales, particularly regarding how disparities in baseline characteristics impact uptake. Understanding vaccine uptake disparities in pregnant women would inform clinicians and policymakers in developing strategies to promote vaccination and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes in the UK.The uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic could differ from normal times because of changes in vaccine hesitancy levels during a pandemic14 and the introduction and rollout of the new COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy may be more prevalent for COVID-19 vaccines due to limited evidence on maternal and neonatal safety available at the time of rollout15,16. The COVID-19 vaccination programme in the UK was initially rolled out centrally and followed a three-phase approach17,18, which may have had a significant impact on the timing of vaccination among pregnant women. Phase 1 of the rollout started on 8 December 2020, aiming to vaccinate the priority groups (health and care workers, those aged over 50, those considered clinically extremely vulnerable, and those aged over 16 with underlying health conditions) with two doses18. Phase 2 began in April 2021 and aimed to vaccinate people aged 18-49 with two doses18. Phase 3 included vaccinations for those aged 12 and over, as well as the rollout of booster vaccines starting in September 202118. Influenza vaccination, on the other hand, was traditionally run through general practice in winter seasons, though pharmacies are also widely involved19.We carried out this study to examine the COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake and disparities in pregnant women in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic between September 2020 and March 2022. We described the characteristics of pregnant women eligible for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in England and Wales. We assessed the uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in pregnant women during the pandemic. We investigated the COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake disparities in pregnant women by identifying associations between baseline characteristics (i.e., age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, household size, obesity and the number of comorbidities) and receiving a vaccine.ResultsCohort selection and baseline characteristicsA total of 133,300 pregnant women were eligible for COVID-19 vaccination during their pregnancy across England and Wales. We identified 178,690 pregnant women eligible for 2020/21 or 2021/22 seasonal influenza vaccination across England and Wales. There were 133,140 pregnant women in the study cohorts who were eligible for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations during pregnancy. The distribution of baseline characteristics was consistent between COVID-19 and influenza cohorts (Table 1).Table 1 Descriptive characteristics for the COVID-19 and influenza cohorts across England and WalesFull size tableVaccine uptake in pregnant womenOf the 178,690 pregnant women in the influenza cohort, 74,740 (41.8%) received at least one dose of influenza vaccine (Table 1). Of the 133,300 individuals in the COVID-19 cohort, 53,550 (40.2%) received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine from any vaccination setting. Among the 133,140 pregnant women eligible for both vaccinations, 57,970 (43.6%) did not receive either vaccine, 27,350 (20.5%) received both vaccines, 26,190 (19.7%) only received the COVID-19 vaccine and 21,630 (16.2%) only received influenza vaccine (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Overlap in vaccine uptake amongst those eligible for both vaccines during pregnancy in England and Wales (N = 133,140).The box shows all women eligible for both vaccines. The left circle shows those vaccinated for COVID-19. The right circle shows those vaccinated for influenza. The overlap of the two circles shows those who were vaccinated for both vaccines.Full size imageInfluenza vaccine uptake among pregnant women had a seasonal pattern and was highest between September and December in each season. The 2020/21 season saw a higher peak in the weekly number of influenza vaccinations than the 2021/22 season. The uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women was in line with the COVID-19 vaccination programme, with Phase 2 immunisation beginning in April 2021 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Vaccine uptake per week amongst pregnant women.a The weekly uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women across England and Wales between September 2020 and March 2022, categorised by Dose 1, Dose 2 and Dose3. b The weekly uptake of influenza vaccination in pregnant women across England and Wales, categorised by the 2020/21 and 2021/22 influenza seasons.Full size imageFactors associated with vaccine uptakeThe COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake exhibited similar disparities across ethnic groups, deprivation quintile (i.e., socioeconomic status), household size, and rurality (Fig. 3). Pregnant women in the black ethnic group had the least chance of receiving either vaccine (COVID-19 aOR: 0.48, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.45–0.51; Influenza aOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.57–0.65), while those of mixed (COVID-19 aOR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74–0.87; influenza aOR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79–0.91) and other (COVID-19 aOR: 0.69, 95%CI 0.63–0.76; influenza aOR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74–0.86) ethnic groups had a slightly higher chance of receiving vaccines, but still lower than those of white (reference group) or Asian ethnic group (COVID-19 aOR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.97–1.06; influenza aOR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04–1.12).Fig. 3: Factors associated with vaccine uptake in pregnant women.Factors associated with vaccine uptake for a COVID-19 (N =133,300) and b influenza (N = 178,690) in pregnant women in England and Wales between September 2020 and March 2022.Full size imageThere was a strong gradient of reduced vaccine uptake with the increase in deprivation. Pregnant women from the most deprived area had a much lower chance of receiving either vaccine (COVID-19 aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.43–0.46; influenza aOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.56–0.60), compared to those from the least deprived areas. In comparison to households of two, vaccine uptake was lower in all the other household sizes. Additionally, those living in rural areas had a higher chance of receiving both vaccines than those living in urban areas (COVID-19 aOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10–1.17; influenza aOR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.08–1.14).The vaccine uptake was inconsistent across age, comorbidity, and BMI groups between the two vaccines. Compared to the 25–29 age group, pregnant women aged 40–49 had the highest chance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.94–2.15), but the lowest chance of receiving the influenza vaccine (aOR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.69–0.76). Meanwhile, pregnant women aged 18–24 had a low chance of receiving both vaccines (COVID-19 aOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.74–0.79; influenza aOR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.75–0.80). Compared to pregnant women with no comorbidities, those with comorbidities had a higher chance of receiving the influenza vaccine. However, this trend was not observed for COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women with one to two comorbidities. In comparison to pregnant women with normal BMI, pregnant women with a BMI over 40 (severely obese) had a higher chance of receiving influenza vaccine (aOR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10–1.23), while there was no difference in receiving COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94–1.07). Pregnant women with a BMI under 18.5 had the lowest chance of receiving both vaccines (COVID-19 aOR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.78–0.88, Influenza aOR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.78–0.86).DiscussionOur analysis across England and Wales presented a low COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, with COVID-19 vaccine uptake higher in 2021/22 and influenza vaccine uptake higher in the 2020/21 season. We identified vaccine uptake disparities across various baseline characteristics, particularly among different ethnic groups and socioeconomic statuses. Women of lower socioeconomic status had a significantly lower chance of receiving COVID-19 or influenza vaccination. Women in black, mixed, and other ethnic groups had a lower chance of being vaccinated in comparison to women in white or Asian ethnic groups.The vaccine uptake in our study aligns with existing data. UKHSA estimated influenza vaccine uptake rates in pregnant women in England as 43.6% in 2020/21 and 37.9% in 2021/2220, which matches our observed rate of 41.8%. UKHSA reported that 32.3% of women who gave birth in England in September 2021 and 53.7% of women who gave birth in December 2021 had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine21,22, aligning with our finding of 40.1%. The reports from UKHSA also support our observation that COVID-19 vaccine uptake was higher in the 2021/22 season, while influenza vaccine uptake was higher in the 2020/21 season among pregnant women.Our study revealed disparities in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake among pregnant women across various baseline characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The determinants of accepting COVID-19 or influenza vaccines identified in our study include being socioeconomically affluent, of white or Asian ethnicity, living in rural areas, and residing in two-person households. These determinants align with findings from studies conducted in other countries, during non-pandemic periods, as well as from smaller-scale or qualitative studies11,12,23,24,25,26. We found that pregnant women aged 40–49 had a higher chance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine but a lower chance of receiving the influenza vaccine. This finding was also noted in previous studies, where older age was identified as a predictor of receiving COVID-19 vaccines7,27,28 while being over 40 was linked to lower influenza vaccine uptake11,24.The rollout strategy of the COVID-19 vaccine played an important role in vaccine uptake among pregnant women. The expansion of the influenza vaccination programme in the UK in 2020 aimed to safeguard vulnerable individuals from influenza, given the simultaneous circulation of COVID-19 and influenza viruses29. This initiative was important due to the limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines at the time29. The higher uptake of the influenza vaccine during the 2020/21 season, as found in our study, reflects the effect of the expanded influenza vaccination programme. Conversely, the increased uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine during the 2021/22 season reflects a more sufficient supply of COVID-19 vaccine. The difference in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake among the 40–49 age group may also be relevant to the age-based rollout strategy for COVID-19 during the pandemic, as well as the heightened concerns associated with the novelty of the COVID-19 virus compared to influenza30.Our study suggested that pregnant women with one or two comorbidities had a lower chance of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those with no comorbidities, which is opposite to the uptake pattern for the influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine has been recommended for people in clinical risk groups (e.g. chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease and vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, etc.) in the UK since the 1960s31,32. The concept that the influenza vaccine can protect people with comorbidities from the risk of developing serious illness if they contract influenza has been well accepted in the general population32,33. Therefore, we observed pregnant women with one or two comorbidities had a higher chance of receiving influenza vaccine than those without comorbidities. In contrast, the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in people with comorbidities was not fully studied at the time of the vaccination programme rollout34, which may increase vaccine hesitancy among patients with comorbidities33. The wide 95% confidence intervals shown for pregnant women with three or four comorbidities in the logistic regression results were mainly due to the small sample size in these two categories.We found that the uptake for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines was suboptimal in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among those in socioeconomically deprived groups and in black, mixed, and other ethnic groups. The mechanisms for lower vaccine uptake in people with more deprived socioeconomic status could include access to transport, confidence in vaccination, vaccination knowledge, and trust in healthcare or vaccination providers, according to an umbrella review35. A potential reason contributing to low vaccine uptake in ethnic minority groups could be a language barrier36. Another reason could be the over-registration in the UK primary care system. Over-registration is more people registered with a general practice than the estimated residents in the country. The over-registration rate in primary care in England was estimated to be 3.9% (n = 2,097,101) in 2014 and was found to be associated with non-White British residents and higher levels of social deprivation37. Pregnant women registered with a GP but not living in the UK are less likely to respond to the vaccine invitation, especially immigrants who choose to give birth in their home country. This issue can result in a falsely lower vaccine uptake among non-white ethnicities.A strength of our study is that we used large national representative primary care data in England38 and Wales39. The longitudinal data provided insights into the trend of vaccination over seasons. Another strength is that we examined the vaccine uptake for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in the same population during the same time period. This study design facilitated a comparison between the vaccine uptake disparities for the two vaccines. Also, we adjusted the logistic regression model for multiple factors that may influence vaccine uptake decisions to minimise the risk of confounding and make the observed disparities in ethnicity and SES status more reliable.There are limitations in this study. The influenza vaccine uptake information only accounted for vaccines recorded in the GP medical records and may underestimate the uptake rate. This is because vaccinations took place in pharmacies and other community or hospital settings, and vaccinations administered in other countries may not be recorded in the GP medical records. This may lead to bias in the results if certain groups of patients tend to receive the vaccine outside of general practices. Pregnancy in this study was identified from primary care medical records and may have delays in the recording of labour and miscarriages, which could cause misclassification of pregnant time periods. Also, the start date of pregnancy was derived using an algorithm based on the information available in the medical records, which may not be entirely accurate. The inclusion of non-term pregnancies in the study cohorts may introduce bias, as previous research has shown low COVID-19 vaccine uptake during the last trimester in Scotland25 and low influenza vaccine uptake during the first trimester in the UK40. Although our study adjusted for many factors, some factors, such as smoking status, educational background and changes in recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women, as well as other unmeasured confounding factors, were not accounted for in the analysis. Also, the granularity of ethnicity in our study was relatively broad, which may neglect the difference between ethnic minorities. For example, we grouped Bangladeshi/Pakistani people with Chinese people in the Asian ethnicity group, but the vaccine uptake hesitancy is much higher in Bangladeshi/Pakistani than in Chinese people41.Our study emphasised the suboptimal uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines among pregnant women, even during the COVID-19 pandemic when awareness of the importance of vaccination was heightened. Common reasons for vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women include fear of side effects or adverse events, lack of confidence in vaccine safety and low perceived risk of infection during pregnancy9. Although the safety of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in pregnant women has been well proven in clinical studies28,42, it does not seem to be well perceived by the public. Pregnant women with one or two comorbidities showed particular concern about receiving COVID-19 vaccines. This concern could likely be alleviated by providing them with the most up-to-date evidence on COVID-19 vaccine safety.Evidence shows that receiving a direct recommendation from healthcare providers, either through a consultation or a written message, can significantly increase influenza vaccine uptake in pregnant women8,43. Mitchell et al.9 constructed a framework that divided pregnant women into four distinctive groups according to their stage of vaccine hesitancy and recommended dedicated communication routes for each group9. Healthcare providers may use this framework to optimise their communication strategy, while more efforts should be put into ethnic minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged pregnant women. Frequent updates on new evidence regarding vaccine safety to healthcare providers and pregnant women are also recommended44.In addition to the direct communication provided by healthcare providers, public agencies may routinely assess the efficacy and inequalities in vaccination delivery and implement policies to reduce such inequalities17. Our findings regarding vaccine uptake disparities are also informative for policy-making in vaccination programmes, particularly as vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus is under consideration for pregnant women by the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation45. On the research front, improved recording of vaccination information in electronic health records would be beneficial for future studies.This study highlights the suboptimal uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in those from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds and black, mixed or other ethnic groups. The COVID-19 phased rollout strategy had a strong impact on the COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake pattern in pregnant women during the pandemic. Disparities in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake among pregnant women underscore the necessity for interventions from the perspectives of healthcare providers, public agencies, and scientists to reduce vaccine hesitancy and improve acceptance in pregnant women. Future studies may explore the reasons for vaccine uptake disparities identified in this study and investigate the relationship between receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine in pregnant women.MethodsData sourceWe used individual-level routinely collected primary care data and linked vaccine immunisation data from two separate large databases in England and Wales. For England, we used the nationally representative Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database, which covered around 32% of the English population (N > 19 million people) registered with over 1900 general practices across England38. The pseudonymised primary care data is linked to the National Immunisation Management Service for vaccination data. For Wales, we used the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank trusted research environment (TRE), which covered 3·2 million people from 329 (84%) general practices across Wales39, linked to national COVID-19 vaccination data in Welsh Immunisation System46. Both the RCGP RSC database38 and the SAIL databank39 are primary care databases that are representative of both demographic and clinical aspects compared to the national population.Primary care data provide pseudonymised information on patients’ demographics, disease diagnoses and some vaccinations recorded in general practices. Primary care services are the first point of contact in the UK healthcare system47, so primary care data linked with external vaccination databases would provide the complete patient demographics, medical and vaccination information needed for this study.In England, ethical approval was granted by the Health Research Authority London Central Research Ethics Committee (reference number REC reference 21/HRA/2786; integrated research application system number 30174). In Wales, research conducted within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank was done with the permission and approval of the independent Information Governance Review Panel (project number 0911). Individual written patient consent was not required for this study.Cohort selectionThe two national cohorts included women aged 18 to 49 who were eligible for either COVID-19 vaccination, influenza vaccination or both during the course of pregnancy between September 2020 and March 2022 in England and Wales (Fig. 4).Fig. 4: Patient inclusion periods.a The inclusion period for this study starts in September 2020 and ends in March 2022. b The inclusion period for the influenza vaccine was divided into two seasons: the 2020/21 season, which covered 1 September 2020–31 March 2021, and the 2021/22 season, which covered 1 September 2021–31 March 2022. The inclusion period for the COVID-19 vaccine started on 8 December 2020 and ended on 31 March 2022.Full size imageIn the UK, pregnant women have been eligible for free influenza vaccination in the influenza season since 2010 48. For the present study, we analysed influenza vaccinations during the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons. Eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women changed over time. Pregnant women were first offered the COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020 (Phase 1 rollout) if they were health and social care workers or in an at-risk group49. They were then eligible based on age groups from April 2021 (Phase 2 rollout) and were added to the clinical risk groups for COVID-19 vaccination in December 202149. Thus, analysis for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines was performed on two separate cohorts to account for differences in these vaccination programmes (Fig. 4).The influenza cohort included pregnant women who were pregnant for at least 30 days during the seasonal influenza immunisation programme rollout period in either the 2020/21 season (1 September 2020–31 March 2021) or the 2021/22 season (1 September 2021–31 March 2022).The COVID-19 cohort comprised women who were pregnant for at least 30 days after they were eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, whether first or any subsequent dose between 8 December 2020 and 31 March 2022. This means the women must have either been unvaccinated 30 days into their pregnancy and become eligible at least 30 days before the end of pregnancy or if they have already had a vaccination (dose 1 or 2) before 30 days into pregnancy, they must have become eligible for a second or third dose (over 8 weeks after the previous dose) at latest 30 days before the end of pregnancy.The start date of a pregnancy was defined as the first day of the last menstrual period. The end date of pregnancy was defined as the date of the delivery of the foetus or the termination of the pregnancy, such as miscarriage. Both dates were identified from the primary care medical records using a developed algorithm50,51. For pregnant women who had more than one pregnancy during the study period, we included only their first pregnancy for analysis.Outcome measureOur primary outcomes were the uptake of the COVID-19 and the influenza vaccine during pregnancy between September 2020 and March 2022. The vaccine uptake was defined as the number of pregnant women in the cohort who received at least one vaccination during the study period, divided by the total number of pregnant women in the cohort, and presented as a percentage.Baseline characteristics were measured as predicting factors (i.e. independent variable) for vaccination. We measured age (categorised as 18–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39 and 40–49), ethnic groups (categorised as white, Asian, black, mixed, others and unknown), body mass index (BMI, categorised as <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0–39.9, 40.0 or more and unknown), number of comorbidities (categorised as none, 1, 2, 3 and 4 or more), household size (categorised as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6–10 and 11 or more), socioeconomic status of the residential area (categorised as 1—most deprived, 2, 3, 4 and 5—least deprived) as well as rurality. Additionally, the residing health board for Wales (e.g. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, etc.) and regions for England (e.g. London, the North West, North East, Yorkshire, East Midlands, etc.) were included to control for potential confounding effects caused by differences in the distribution of the population as well as delivery of the vaccination programmes within each country.Data for these factors are available from the primary care databases RCGP and SAIL Databank. Demographics (i.e. age, ethnicity, BMI, household size and socioeconomic status) were identified at the study start date. The traceback period for identifying comorbidities was five years. Socioeconomic status was based on the quintiles of the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) in England and52 the 2019 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) in Wales53 and was derived using patients’ Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA) of residence. Since BMI and ethnic groups were not available for all the individuals, we included an unknown category to represent this. Household size was determined by the number of family members registered at the same GP practice as the pregnant women.The comorbidities in this study were defined in line with the clinical risk groups for the COVID-19 immunisation programme as stated in Chapter 14a in Immunisation Against Infectious Disease (The Green Book)49, the UK immunisation guidance. The comorbidities included are chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological disease, diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression. For England, these comorbidities were identified as part of the PRIMIS v2.3 specification54, a national data specification commissioned by the UK Health Security Agent (UKHSA) to help identify priority patients for the COVID-19 vaccination. For Wales, the comorbidities were derived from QCOVID indicators55 that were part of a COVID-19 risk prediction model.Statistical analysisWe used descriptive analysis to present the baseline demographics and comorbidities of the two cohorts (i.e. the COVID-19 cohort and the influenza cohort). We presented the weekly number of vaccinations received by individuals in each cohort over the study period in bar charts. We also presented the vaccine uptake in the sub-cohort of women eligible for both vaccines during their pregnancy, which included uptake of influenza vaccine only, uptake of COVID-19 vaccine only, uptake of both vaccines and uptake of neither vaccine.We conducted a multivariable fixed-effect logistic regression analysis to explore factors associated with vaccine uptake among pregnant women. The regression estimates adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the covariates, which were reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Descriptive statistics (frequencies) were summed, and the cohort-specific log odds ratios were meta-analysed to produce summary odd ratios. A fixed effect model was used as the same effects were anticipated in each country and as we are only using meta-analysis methods to replicate a pooled analysis. All analytical work was done using R version 4.1.356.

Additionally, during the past century, four global IAV pandemics have claimed millions of human lives. The epithelial lining of the trachea plays a vital role during IAV infection, both as point of viral entry and replication as well as in the antiviral immune response. Tracheal tissue is generally inaccessible from human patients, which makes animal models crucial for the study of the tracheal host immune response.Method: In this study, pigs were inoculated with swine- or human-adapted H1N1 IAV to gain insight into how host adaptation of IAV shapes the innate immune response during infection. In-depth multi-omics analysis (global proteomics and RNA sequencing) of the host response in upper and lower tracheal tissue was conducted, and results were validated by microfluidic qPCR. Additionally, a subset of samples was selected for histopathological examination.Results: A classical innate antiviral immune response was induced in both upper and lower trachea after infection with either swine- or human-adapted IAV with upregulation of genes and higher abundance of proteins associated with viral infection and recognition, accompanied by a significant induction of interferon stimulated genes with corresponding higher proteins concentrations. Infection with the swine-adapted virus induced a much stronger immune response compared to infection with a human-adapted IAV strain in the lower trachea, which could be a consequence of a higher viral load and a higher degree of inflammation.Discussion: Central components of the JAK-STAT pathway, apoptosis, pyrimidine metabolism, and the cytoskeleton were significantly altered depending on infection with swine- or human-adapted virus and might be relevant mechanisms in relation to antiviral immunity against putative zoonotic IAV. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that during host adaptation, IAV evolve to modulate important host cell elements to favor viral infectivity and replication.1 IntroductionInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a zoonotic virus which can infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species (1–4). IAV causes respiratory illness worldwide leading to annual seasonal epidemics estimated to result in 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000–650,000 deaths each year (5). IAV likewise gives rise to global pandemics, of which four have occurred over the past century (6, 7). The emergence of IAV pandemics is attributed to zoonotic transmission from avian or swine sources, followed by reassortment events (8, 9). This sequence of events leads to the ongoing emergence of new IAV strains capable of causing pandemics after adaptation to the new host. In order to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms behind zoonotic events, we need a better understanding of how the host reacts to both host-adapted IAV strains and non-adapted IAV strains. Innate immune responses are highly relevant when studying the zoonotic potential of IAV, as IAV must circumvent these innate mechanisms to successfully establish itself in a new host, which includes hijacking the metabolic machinery of its host cell in order to produce all necessary components for efficient viral propagation (10, 11).During IAV infection, the antiviral innate immune response is activated through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). Upon recognition by PRRs, production of interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines is initiated. In general, type I and III IFNs stimulate the production of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which interfere with and restrict viral replication (12–14). The tracheal epithelium is crucial during respiratory viral infections as it serves as one of the initial sites of viral entry, where the virus adheres to and infects epithelial cells. Animal models are essential to study disease severity and viral replication in the affected tissues, given the scarcity of clinical respiratory tissue samples from human patients. Data on host immune responses in tracheal tissue after IAV infection is scarce and has mainly been studied in vitro or in vivo using small animal models (15–20) or chickens (21–23). Given the limited data obtained exclusively from smaller animal models, it would be pertinent to conduct such investigations in the highly translational pig model, which much more accurately mirrors human respiratory architecture and composition of the innate immune system (24).In the present study, we performed an in-depth multi-omics analysis of the response in swine tracheal tissues to either swine- or human-adapted IAV three days after inoculation. This allowed us to obtain comprehensive insight into the dynamics of the antiviral immune response and host factors involved in the host cell environment, which play a role in viral replication efficiencies. It likewise provided insights to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind host adaptation and cross-species transmission.2 Materials and methods2.1 Preparation of virus inoculumA swine-adapted virus, A/Swine/Denmark/2017_10298/4_4p1/2017 (H1N1) (swH1N1; accession no. MT666901-MT666908) and a human-adapted virus, A/Denmark/238/2020 (H1N1) (huH1N1; accession no. OQ062647-OQ062654) were propagated and passaged three times in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The viruses were stored at -80°C before inoculation (25). The titers were determined by tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) assay in MDCK cells, and diluted in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco) to a TCID50/ml of 107.2.2 Experimental designThe experimental set-up has previously been described in details (25). Briefly, 22, confirmed IAV negative, seven-week-old Danish Landrace Crossbred pigs were included. The pigs were allocated into three groups and housed in separate isolation units. They were acclimatized for one week, fed non-pelleted feed, and had ad libitum access to water. Group 1 (control) consisted of six pigs, while group 2 and 3 included eight pigs each. The pigs were sedated before inoculation. A MAD Nasal intranasal mucosal atomization devie (Teleflex) was used for inoculation, as it delivers a fine mist of droplets in the range of 30 to 100 microns to more realistically mimic viral challenge. Group 1 was mock inoculated intranasally in one nostril by the MAD nasal device (Teleflex) containing 3 mL culture medium only, while group 2 and 3 were inoculated with 3 ml of 107 TCID50/ml of the swine-adapted H1N1 strain, A/Swine/Denmark/3974/2017 (swH1N1), or the human-adapted H1N1 strain, A/Denmark/238/2020 (huH1N1) (25), respectively. The pigs were euthanized 3 days post inoculation, and tracheal tissue was collected and stored in either RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at -20°C until RNA extraction or washed in PBS, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for proteomics analysis. Lung tissues for viral titration were stored in Eppendorf tubes at -80°C.The animal experiment was performed under biosafety level 2 conditions and under an animal study protocol approved by The Danish Animal Experimentation Council (protocol no. 2020–15-0201–00502).2.3 Proteomics workflow2.3.1 Sample preparationThe mucosal membrane of upper and lower trachea was stripped from the cartilage and homogenized in lysis buffer 1 (6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 40 mM chloroacetamide (CAA), 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 8.5, with cOmplete™ Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) using a TissueLyser II (Agilent) and one steel bead twice for one minute at 1–30 Hz. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 95°C for reduction and alkylation of cysteines. To remove contaminants, lysates were precipitated in acetone overnight at -20°C, centrifuged for 20 min at 4000x g at 4°C, and resuspended in lysis buffer 2 (6 M GuHCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, with cOmplete™ Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined with NanoDrop One (Thermo Fischer Scientific). A total of 50 µg of extracted protein from each sample were digested with LysC (TriChem) (1:100 protease to protein (w:w)) at 37°C for 4 hours at 300 rpm after adjusting the GuHCl concentration to 0.5 M with digestion buffer (10% acetonitrile, 50mM HEPES, pH 8.5), followed by an overnight digestion at 37°C with trypsin (Promega) (1:100 protease to protein (w:w)). The digestion was stopped by adding 20% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to all samples (1% final concentration). Samples were desalted using a Solaµ HRP 96 well plate (Thermo Scientific) by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 1 minute in every step. The plate columns were activated by 100% methanol (Merck), buffer B (40% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and buffer A’ (3% acetonitrile, 1% TFA). The samples were loaded on to the plate, followed by washing with buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and elution using buffer B. All of the samples were dried by vacuum at 45°C until dry. For spectral library generation, pools including control and infected samples were prepared for digestion with a final protein concentration of 200 µg for each pool. The pooled samples were digested and desalted as described for each individual sample. The pooled samples were fractionated into 10 fractions using high pH fractionation and a Thermo Acclaim PA2 (3 um, 300 um x 150 nm) column, using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system (U3000). The samples ran at 5 µl/min at approximately 400 bar, using AMBIC buffer (5mM ammonium bicarbonate) and buffer B (100% acetonitrile).Individual samples and library samples, corresponding to 500 ng of peptides, were placed on Evotips that had been activated by 100% acetonitrile, 100% isopropanol and buffer A according to the manufacturer loading protocol. For liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, an Evosep One HPLC system was used in-line with an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The instrument was operated in positive polarity in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode, with a gradient of 118 minutes (10SPD) using a Whisper column (EV1112, 15 cm length, 75 µm diameter, and bead size 1.9 µm) running at 100 nl/min, with column heating at 30°C, and a transfer tube temperature of 240°C. MS scans were acquired in between the MS/MS DIA scans (26) for precursor quantification. The global parameters were set to nano-spray ionization, with a static positive ion voltage of 2000V and 600V for the negative ion.The resolution of Orbitrap for MS scan acquisition was set to 120,000 with FAIMS ON with –45 CV at standard resolution mode. The resolution for the DIA scans was 60,000. The RF lens was 40% for both MS and MS/MS DIA scans. Normalized AGC Target of 300% was applied for the MS scans and the maximum injection time was automatic. The normalized AGC Target was 1,000% for the MS/MS DIA scans and the maximum injection time was automatic. The scan range for the MS scans was 400–1000 m/z. The scan range for the MS/MS DIA scans was 400–600 m/z, 600–800 m/z and 800–1000 m/z. The HCD collision energy was 32%. The window size of DIA scan was 6 m/z, with an overlap of 1 m/z.2.3.2 Spectral library generationThe spectral library was generated from DIA search archives using Spectronaut (27) (17.4.230317.55965, Biognosys AG), using default settings except the digestion type, which was set to Trypsin/P and LysC. Modifications used for the search were fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteines (C, +57.021464 Da), and variable acetylation (protein N-terminus, +42.0106 Da), oxidation (M, +15.995 Da), and deamidation (N, +0.984 Da). The protein sequences used to generate the spectral library were Sus scrofa proteome (UniProt fasta, access date: 2022–04, 48349 entries containing both reviewed and un-reviewed TrEMBL sequences for taxID 9823), and two in-house files generated from the sequenced viral strains (25) for both the human-adapted IAV (huH1N1) and swine-adapted IAV (swH1N1). The library comprised a total of 93,131 peptides and 10,003 proteins.2.3.3 DIA data analysisThe data analysis was performed using Spectronaut (17.4.230317.55965, Biognosys AG). The acquired spectra were searched against the spectral library generated in Spectronaut. Searches were run using Precursor PEP cutoff of 0.1, Protein Qvalue cutoff (run) of 0.05, and Protein PEP cutoff of 0.5. Quantification was performed using Spectronaut’s version of MaxLFQ (28) algorithm with precursor quantification on MS level. Cross-run normalization was performed with default settings, while no imputation method was used.2.4 Transcriptomics workflow2.4.1 RNA extractionWhole sections of lower trachea were homogenized in QIAzol Lysis reagent (QIAGEN) using gentleMACS M tubes (Miltenyi Biotec). Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) and treated with an RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and purity were estimated using the NanoDrop One (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the RNA integrity number was assessed by the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Supplementary Table S1) (Agilent Technologies).2.4.2 Library generation and sequencingRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were constructed with a non-stranded and PolyA selection method according to the manufacturer’s specifications (BGI Genomics). Paired-end reads with a length of 100 bp were sequenced using the DNBSEQ platform. The raw reads were filtered, which included adaptor removal, removal of contamination, and low-quality reads (ambiguous bases (N) higher than 5%, low-quality bases (quality score less than 10) higher than 20%, and having sequencing adaptor contamination).2.4.3 RNA-seq data analysisAfter filtering, clean reads were mapped to the pig genome (Sscrofa11.1, NCBI accession: GCA_000003025.6) using HISAT2 (29). RSEM (30) was used to annotate transcripts to prepare a transcript reference for subsequent calculation of gene expression levels. The clean reads were mapped to the transcript reference to quantify the gene expression using Bowtie2 (31). RSEM (30) was used to estimate the gene expression levels based on fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) for subsequent analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Data was normalized and DEGs were identified between different comparison groups by DESeq2 (32).2.4.4 Validation of RNA-seq data by high-throughput microfluidic qPCRA subset of 93 genes (including six potential reference genes for data normalization) with annotations from a statistical analysis of the RNA-seq was selected for validation using high-throughput reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Primers for the selected genes are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Primer design, cDNA synthesis, and cDNA pre-amplification were performed as described before (“Man submitted”, Laybourn HA, Pedersen AG, Brogaard B, Polhaus CH, Kristensen C, Trebbien R, et al.). High-throughput qPCR was carried out using 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC chips (Standard BioTools Inc.) on the BioMark real-time platform using a previously described PCR protocol (“Man submitted”, Laybourn HA, Pedersen AG, Brogaard B, Polhaus CH, Kristensen C, Trebbien R, et al.). Data was processed as described previously (“Man submitted”, Laybourn HA, Pedersen AG, Brogaard B, Polhaus CH, Kristensen C, Trebbien R, et al.). A biologically relevant cut-off value of log2 fold change (lfc) of ±1 compared to control was used. The change in gene expression level was considered statistically significant with a p-value below 0.05 (Student’s t-test).2.5 Histopathology and IAV stainingHistological evaluations were performed on three pigs from the control group and two pigs from each inoculated group for both upper and lower trachea samples. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for a week. Formalin-fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin wax and sliced into 2–3 µm sections. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Immunohistochemical staining targeting IAV was performed as previously reported (33) by anti-influenza A (NP) antibody (diluted 1:100,000 in 1% BSA/Tris buffered saline) (HYB 340–05, SSI Antibodies) and UltraVision ONE HRP-Polymer (AH diagnostics). The staining was visualized by adding DAB substrate (Cell Marque). The sections were counterstained by Mayer’s hematoxylin (VWR). An isotype control (Agilent Technologies) (diluted in 1% BSA/Tris buffered saline to the same protein concentration as the anti-influenza A (NP) antibody) was used as a negative control.2.6 Quantification and characterization of IAVAn in-house modified version of an RT-qPCR assay was used to detect IAV by targeting the matrix gene (M-gene) using the SensiFast Probe No-ROX One-Step Mix kit (Meridian Bioscience) as described before (25). Quantification was based on a 10-fold dilution series of the target sequence with known copy numbers. To determine the amount of infectious virus in the lungs, the lung specimen were homogenized, sterile filtered, and titrated in MDCK cells. The TCID50/ml was calculated using the Reed–Muench method (34).A pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences of the viral proteins of the inoculum strains was performed using CLC Main Workbench version 22.0 (QIAGEN) to measure the percentage identity. In addition, a sequence alignment of the NS1 sequences of the inoculum strains was performed.2.7 Statistical analysisThe global proteomics data was analyzed using R studio (R version 4.2.2), the data was log2 transformed and checked for normality. A one-way ANOVA was performed, followed by a Tukey post hoc analysis to correct for multiple testing. In the RNA-seq data, the p-values of the DEGs were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) (35). Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and DEGs were defined with a p-adjusted value (padj) below 0.05 and with a lfc of ±1. DEGs and DEPs were functionally enriched by alignment to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) (36) databases using enrichKEGG (37, 38).3 Results3.1 Global proteomics analysis highlights the importance of proteins associated with defense response to virus in the lower trachea upon IAV infectionAfter global proteomics analysis of the upper and lower trachea, 8935 protein groups (76,690 peptides) were identified of which 3830 (17,526 peptides) were quantified due to the stringent search parameters used for quantification. All DEPs identified after either infection and their expression levels can be found in in Supplementary Table S3. Only five DEPs were common for both infections in both upper and lower trachea, including four interferon stimulated proteins (OASL, MX1, IFIT3, and ISG15) and the GTPase, DRG2. The limited overlap of DEPs between upper and lower trachea after either infections (Figure 1A) indicates a diverse protein expression between the two tissues and highlights the importance of investigating the tissues separately. Clustering of mock inoculated control pigs and pigs inoculated with either swH1N1 or huH1N1 showed that infected pigs clustered distinctly from control pigs (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S1). The highest viral loads were seen after infection with swH1N1 with a similar viral load in the upper (median of 2.03 x 109 copies/ml) and lower trachea (median of 1.81 × 109 copies/ml) (Figure 1C). After infection with huH1N1, the upper tracheal tissue exhibited higher viral load (median of 2.76 x 108 copies/ml) than in lower trachea (median of 4.83 × 107 copies/ml). Infectious virus in the lung was found in 8/8 pigs after infection with the swH1N1 (mean TCID50/ml of 2.18 x 105) and 6/8 pigs after infection with huH1N1 (mean TCID50/ml of 6.15 x 104) (25).Figure 1 Figure 1 Diversity in DEPs and amount of viral RNA between upper trachea (UT) and lower trachea (LT).

All control pigs were IAV negative.Several viral proteins were identified by proteomics after both infections, including M1, NS1, PB1, HA and NP. HA and NP were quantified after infection with swH1N1 in upper and lower trachea and both were highly abundant, which agrees with the viral load. No viral proteins could be quantified after infection with huH1N1 (Supplementary Table S3).More DEPs were identified in the upper trachea compared to lower trachea after infection with either IAV strain (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table S3). Still, a larger percentage of the DEPs linked to defense response to virus (GO:0051607) was detected in the lower trachea following infection with either huH1N1 (9% of the DEPs) or swH1N1 (9% of the DEPs) compared to upper trachea (4% and 5%, respectively). Given that a greater percentage of DEPs linked to the antiviral immune response was detected in the lower trachea after infection with either huH1N1 or swH1N1, we decided to expand our omics data by conducting a transcriptional analysis of lower trachea using RNA-seq.3.2 Multi-omics analysis revealed a classical antiviral immune response in lower tracheaApproximately 2 billion clean paired-end reads with a length of 100 bp were generated in the RNA-seq analysis of lower trachea. On average, 88.9 million (73.0–94.6 million) clean reads were obtained for each sample. Among the samples, 94.8–97.0% of the clean reads were mapped to the porcine reference genome. Moreover, 90.6–93.7% of the clean reads were uniquely mapped (mapped to exactly one location within the reference genome) Supplementary Table S4). All DEGs identified after either infection and their expression levels can be found in Supplementary Table S5.A classical antiviral immune response was identified including high expression of interferon stimulated genes and proteins using multi-omics after infection with either swH1N1 and huH1N1 in the lower trachea (Figure 2). Four important antiviral ISGs, MX1, MX2, ISG15, and IFI6, were found to be upregulated after infection with either strains of IAV in the lower trachea (Figure 2) (Supplementary Tables S3, S5).Figure 2 Figure 2 Interferon stimulated genes and proteins identified by RNA-seq and global proteomics in lower trachea after both infections. (A) Heatmaps showing all differentially expressed interferon stimulated genes (left) and proteins (right) in lower trachea comparing the control group (green) with the pigs infected with the swine-adapted strain (swH1N1) (red). (B) Heatmaps showing all differentially expressed interferon stimulated genes (left) and proteins (right) in lower trachea comparing the control group (green) with the pigs infected with the human-adapted strain (huH1N1) (blue). The color key from blue to red indicates low to high gene/protein expression, respectively.KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to identify the biological pathways associated with the DEGs and DEPs in lower trachea after infection with swH1N1 or huH1N1. Not surprisingly, most identified genes and proteins belonged to pathways involved in the antiviral immune response. Of the top 10 pathways enriched after infection with swH1N1 compared to control, most were related to response to RNA viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and NOD signaling pathway) and cytokine signaling (Cytokine interactions, IL17 signaling, and TNF signaling) (Supplementary Figure S2). Likewise, enriched pathways after infection with huH1N1 compared to control were related to response to viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, IAV, Hepatitis C, and Epstein-Barr virus) and their recognition (RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway) (Supplementary Figure S3).The greater number of DEGs found after infection with swH1N1 compared to huH1N1 (Supplementary Table S5) might be connected with the higher viral load and the high abundance of viral proteins found after infection with swH1N1. Interestingly, the two pigs with the lowest viral load after infection with swH1N1 (pig 9 and 10) clustered together with the control pigs in the RNA-seq analysis (Figure 2A), but not in the global proteomics analysis (Figures 1B, 2A).3.3 Strong host transcription of a variety of interferon stimulated genes after IAV infectionAfter infection with huH1N1, a total of 28 DEGs were identified when compared to the controls. The 17 upregulated genes were all ISGs (Figure 2B) or involved in their activation (DDX58 (RIG-I), IRF7, and DDX60), except for ANGPTL4 (Supplementary Table S5). ANGPTL4 is involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and the lipid metabolism. Likewise, the most abundant group of upregulated genes after infection with swH1N1 was ISGs (Figure 2A) or genes involved in their activation (DDX58 (RIG-I), ZBP1, IFIH1 (MDA5), IRF7, and DDX60) (Supplementary Table S5). The 17 DEGs upregulated after infection with huH1N1 were shared with the swH1N1 infection (DDX58 (RIG-I), RSAD2 (Viperin), MX2, MX1, OAS1, ANGPTL4, IRF7, ISG15, IFIT1, ISG12(A), DDX60, BST2, IFI44, XAF1, LGALS3BP, RTP4, and IFI6). In contrast, 244 genes (227 unique for this infection) were differentially expressed after infection with swH1N1 compared to control (Supplementary Table S5) and included a substantial number of ISGs (HERC5, HERC6, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, ISG20, OAS2, OASL, and USP18). Based on the RNA-seq data, IFI6 was the most strongly upregulated gene after either infection (swH1N1: lfc = 2.27, padj = 1.48 x 10-36; huH1N1: lfc = 2.48, padj = 4.43 x 10-44). Genes encoding protein components of the cytoskeleton (NEB, MYOM2, MYOZ1, and MYBPC1) and surfactant proteins (A1, C, and D) were among the most significantly downregulated genes upon infection with swH1N1 (Supplementary Table S5).To verify the results of the RNA-seq, a panel of the identified genes was studied by microfluidic high-throughput qPCR (Supplementary Table S2). In agreement with the RNA-seq results, a greater number of DEGs were identified after infection with swH1N1 compared to huH1N1 (Supplementary Table S6). The expression levels of both up- and downregulated genes were confirmed to be significantly regulated in the two infected groups compared to control by qPCR (p < 0.005) (Figures 3A, B). Expression levels were consistent with the RNA-seq results, though with the tendency of fold changes being of a slightly greater magnitude for some genes when investigated with qPCR (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S6).Figure 3 Figure 3 Validation of RNA-seq data with qPCR of both upregulated and downregulated genes. (A) Log2 fold change levels estimated by RNA-seq and qPCR of selected significantly upregulated antiviral genes in the IAV inoculated groups (huH1N1, blue; swH1N1, red.) relative to mock inoculated controls. (B) Log2 fold change levels estimated by RNA-seq and qPCR of selected significantly downregulated genes in the IAV inoculated groups (huH1N1, blue; swH1N1, red.) relative to mock inoculated controls. SEM is depicted by error bars.3.4 Immune response to viruses with different host adaptation might involve central components of the JAK-STAT pathway and the pyrimidine metabolismWhen comparing expression levels of proteins and genes in the lower trachea directly between the swH1N1 and huH1N1 inoculated pigs, 67 DEPs and 52 DEGs were identified (Supplementary Table S3, S5). Using KEGG enrichment analysis of all DEGs, we found a significant proportion of differentially expressed genes to be associated with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Figure 4A). The JAK-STAT pathway plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the host antiviral immune response by mediating the production of cytokines, chemokines, and interferons and activation of antiviral genes. Generally, infection with swH1N1 induced a more pronounced antiviral immune response with enriched genes associated with cytokine signaling (Figure 4A).Figure 4 Figure 4 Components of the JAK-STAT pathway and the pyrimidine metabolism were regulated after infection with swine-adapted strain (swH1N1) compared to human-adapted strain (huH1N1). (A) Using KEGG enrichment analysis, we identified biological pathways associated with the DEGs comparing pigs inoculated with swH1N1 to those inoculated with huH1N1. The bubble diagram indicates the ratio of enriched DEGs to the total number of identified genes in a certain pathway. Circles indicate the number of genes in the corresponding pathway, and color depicts the adjusted p-value. (B) Log2 fold change levels of genes involved in the pyrimidine metabolism after infection with swH1N1 (red) and huH1N1 (blue). SEM is depicted by error bars. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test).Differential expression of genes involved in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway was likewise enriched between the two infections (Figure 4A). RRM2, CTPS1, and TK1 were highly expressed after infection with swH1N1 compared to huH1N1 (Supplementary Table S5). These results motivated a further investigation of genes associated with the pyrimidine metabolism during IAV infection by qPCR analysis. In agreement with the RNA-seq results, RRM2, CTPS1, and TK1 were significantly expressed after infection with swH1N1 relative to the pigs infected with huH1N1 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, other genes related to the pyrimidine pathway, namely NME1, NME2, and UCK2, were significantly higher expressed after infection with the swH1N1 relative to the pigs infected with huH1N1, albeit occasionally with modest fold changes (Figure 4B). Furthermore, proteins related to the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton remodeling (KRT2 and PLXNA4) and genes coding for components of the cytoskeleton, KRT13 (LOC100515166), KRT17 (LOC100737113), KRT6A, and BFSP1, were significantly higher expressed after infection with swH1N1 compared to huH1N1 (Supplementary Table S3, S5).3.5 Necrotizing tracheitis was only identified after infection with swH1N1Histopathological examination of the tracheal tissue sections showed necrosis and infiltration of immune cells after infection with swH1N1 in both examined animals in both the upper and lower trachea (Figures 5A2, B2, respectively).Figure 5 Figure 5 Histopatological changes in the upper (A) and lower (B) trachea after IAV infection. Representative images of the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of swine tracheal tissues from the control pigs (Pig 1, 3, and 5), the swine-adapted (swH1N1) infection (Pig 8 and 11), and the human-adapted (huH1N1) infection (Pig 22 and 25). (A1) Areas with moderate infiltration of neutrophils (arrowhead) in upper trachea in control pigs. (A2) Moderate infiltration of mononuclear cells in lamina propria (star), desquamated epithelial cells (arrow), and single cell necrosis of the tracheal epithelium (arrowhead) after infection with swH1N1 in upper trachea. (A3) Changes in huH1N1 infected pigs were comparable to control pig with areas with moderate infiltration of neutrophils (arrowheads). (B1) No changes were observed in the control pigs in lower trachea. Goblet cells (star) and cilia (arrowhead) are present. (B2) Single cell necrosis (arrowhead) of tracheal epithelial cells and mild infiltration of mononuclear cells in lamina propria (arrow) after infection with swH1N1 in the lower trachea. (B3) No changes were observed after infection with huH1N1 in the lower trachea.In the lower trachea, lesions comparable to an acute, multifocal, mild to moderate, necrotizing tracheitis were observed in both pigs infected with swH1N1 (Figure 5B2), which could be linked to the host immune response. Apoptosis related proteins (ANXA5 and Caspase-13/CASP4) and CAPN14, USP18, XAF1, Caspase-13/CASP4, and ISG12 transcripts were significantly upregulated after infection with swH1N1 compared to controls. The observed infiltration of immune cells after infection with swH1N1 agrees with the upregulation of chemotactic factors (AMCF-II, CXCL8/IL8, CXCL2, CXCL10, and CCL20) and their receptors (CCR1 and CXCR2) at the transcriptional level (Supplementary Table S5). The lesions observed after infection with swH1N1 could be linked to the increased transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL19, IL20, and IL27) and other inflammatory genes from the S100 family (S100A2 and S100A8). Histopathological examination of pigs infected with huH1N1 did not reveal infiltration of any immune cells or necrosis in the lower trachea (Figure 5B3). In agreement, no cytokines or chemokines were found to be significantly regulated at the transcriptional level (Supplementary Table S5) and two proteins related to recruitment and activation of immune cells were less abundant post infection compared to controls (CCL26 and IL13) (Supplementary Table S3). Consistent with the absence of necrosis, we identified a significant lower abundance of the pro-apoptotic protein PDCD10 in this group.In the upper trachea, similar histopathological changes were identified as in lower trachea after infection with swH1N1 with one pig showing squamous metaplasia (Figure 5A2). Histological changes after infection with huH1N1 revealed changes comparable to control pigs or an acute, mild, suppurative tracheitis (Figure 5A3). However, no immune cell markers, chemotactic factors, inflammatory proteins or apoptotic related proteins were present in upper trachea at this point after either infection compared to control pigs. Though, DFFA, which is an inhibitor of caspase mediated apoptosis, was markedly decreased after both infections (swH1N1: lfc = -11.63, padj = 3.18 x 10-2; huH1N1: lfc = -13.90, padj = 1.00 x 10-2).The tracheal sections were also investigated for IAV-positive cells (Figure 6). No IAV-positive cells were found in the controls or in the pigs infected with huH1N1 for either tissue (except for one IAV-positive cell in the upper trachea), whereas several IAV-positive cells were found in the pigs infected with swH1N1 in both the upper and lower trachea (Figures 6A2, B2). This is consistent with viral nucleic acid measured by qPCR (Figure 1B) and the proteomics results, where HA and NP only could be quantified in the pigs infected with swH1N1 (Supplementary Table S3).Figure 6 Figure 6 Immunohistochemical detection of IAV-positive cells in upper (A) and lower (B) trachea. The presence of IAV-positive cells (brown) was investigated by immunohistochemical staining of swine tracheal tissues from the control pigs (Pig 1, 3, and 5), the swine-adapted (swH1N1) infection (Pig 8 and 11), and the human-adapted (huH1N1) infection (Pig 22 and 25). (A1) No IAV-positive cells in the control group in upper trachea. (A2) IAV-positive cells (brown) were present in the epithelium after infection with swH1N1 in upper trachea. (A3) One IAV-positive cell (brown) was found in the epithelium after infection with huH1N1 in upper trachea. (B1) No IAV-positive cells in the control group in lower trachea. (B2) IAV-positive cells were present in the epithelium (brown) after infection with swH1N1 in lower trachea. (B3) No IAV-positive cells after infection with the huH1N1 in lower trachea.3.6 Influenza virus sequence analysisA maximum-likelihood tree of the studied viruses and selected reference viruses have been created previously (25). Here, swH1N1 clusters within the swine H1N1pdm09 clade (1.A.3.3.2), whereas huH1N1 clusters with the human clade 6B. Pairwise comparisons of all viral gene sequences were performed resulting in high amino acid identities (>95%) between the two inoculum strains for most of the viral genes. The surface proteins, HA and NA, and the NS1 protein had a lower percent identity with 92.6% and 91.7% amino acid identity for HA and NA, respectively, while the NS1 protein, known for its role in immune evasion, had an amino acid identity of 94.5% between the two strains.4 DiscussionDespite the involvement of tracheal epithelial cells in infection, replication, and spread of the IAV, there is currently limited information concerning the innate immune response of tracheal tissue to viral infection. By applying multi-omics analysis, we have elucidated host responses to IAV infection in tracheal tissue in vivo in swine, three days after experimentally infection with either swine-adapted (swH1N1) or human-adapted (huH1N1) IAV, and have provided results that possess significant translational potential for respiratory viral infections in this neglected tissue. By combining RNA-seq and MS-based proteomics, this study provides a comprehensive insight on multiple biological levels into mechanisms and defenses activated during infection with host-adapted IAV, as well as IAV adapted to infect and replicate in another mammalian host. The latter can be viewed as representative for early events that are likely to occur in a new host when IAV cross the species barrier during zoonotic and reverse zoonotic events.A classical antiviral response was induced in the upper and lower trachea of pigs upon infection with both swH1N1 and huH1N1 compared to mock inoculated control pigs, primarily through activation of several ISGs and interferon stimulated proteins in the upper (OASL, MX1, IFIT3, and ISG15) and lower trachea (OASL, MX1, MX2, ISG15, IFIT3, IFI6, RSAD2, OAS1, IFIT1, ISG12(A), BST2, IFI44, XAF1, and RTP4). The differences between upper and lower trachea could be due to differences in cell composition as especially ciliated cells and submucosal gland cells are more prevalent in the upper airway (39, 40). Another contributing factor could be the microenvironment, such as pH, oxygen levels, and the presence of commensal bacteria, which might differ significantly between upper and lower trachea, influencing the response to infection (41, 42). In lower trachea, IFI6 was one of the highest induced antiviral factors at both the protein and RNA level after either infections, indicating an important function in the antiviral immune response regardless of host adaptation level and replication capacity of the infecting strain. To our knowledge, IFI6 expression in tracheal tissue after IAV infection has never been described in a mammalian host before, contrary to other ISGs, such as ISG15, MX1, MX2, OAS1 and EIF2AK2 (PKR) (20, 43, 44), and cytokines/chemokines, such as IL6, IL8, IL1B, and CXCL10 (16, 44), which were also identified in this study. In a human respiratory epithelial cell line, A549, IFI6 was, in agreement with the present study, identified to be important and highly upregulated during infection with several different IAV H1N1 strains as well as other subtypes, including avian H5N2, H5N3, and H9N2 (45). The role of IFI6 has been described in relation to other viral pathogens, e.g. inhibition of hepatitis B virus transcription and replication (46) and hepatitis C virus entry and replication (47). In the case of IAV and SARS-CoV-2, IFI6 has been demonstrated to dampen the innate immune response by negatively affecting RIG-I activation (48). Thus, IFI6 might contribute to suppression of the antiviral immune response after infection with both swH1N1 and huH1N1. Though, IFI6 expression was higher after infection with huH1N1, especially at the protein level (∼50%), which might contribute substantially to the observed lower antiviral response. Research in IAV infected tracheal tissue from a mammalian host has mainly been focusing on T cell infiltration (15–17), but here we demonstrate induction of the innate immune response via interferons and several central interferon stimulated genes and proteins in tracheal tissue after infection with either swH1N1 or huH1N1.Despite the similarities between the antiviral responses after infection with the two IAV strains, important differences in activation of the innate pathways were also observed. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway has an essential role in regulation of the antiviral and inflammatory response during viral infections and has not been described previously in any tracheal tissue in vivo. In the present study, mRNA coding for cytokines and cytokine receptors involved in the JAK-STAT pathway, including IL19, IL20, IL21R, and IL22RA2, were highly expressed in lower trachea during host-adapted swH1N1 infection compared to non-adapted huH1N1 infection. However, the STAT1 protein was at lower abundance at the sampling time, highlighting the intricate temporal dynamics between gene expression and protein turnover in the JAK-STAT pathway and the importance of a multi-omics approach, which enable the examination of current proteins as well as the prediction of (potential) future proteins. The protein EP300, a transcriptional coactivator of STAT1 (49), was significantly increased during swH1N1 infection compared to huH1N1 infection, but as STAT1 was suppressed, the EP300 protein might be activating other transcription factors, e.g. IRF (50, 51) and NF-kb (52) contributing to the high expression of cytokines and chemokines observed after infection with swH1N1. Differences in virus sequences might also contribute to the observed variations in the antiviral responses after the two infections. We found that NS1 was the viral protein with the third lowest amino acid identity between the two inoculum strains, only surpassed by the two hyper variable surface proteins (HA and NA). Rajsbaum and colleges (53) demonstrated that NS1 inhibits the RIG-I pathway in a species-specific manner, as only NS1 proteins from human-adapted IAV strains (H1N1 and H3N2) showed binding to the RIG-I activating ubiquitin ligase RNF135 (Riplet) in a human cell line (53). Furthermore, it has been shown that a glutamic acid (E) in position 55 of the NS1 residue instead of a lysine (K) enhances viral replication and interferon suppression (54) and swH1N1 has an glutamic acid in position 55 (E55) in its NS1 sequence, while huH1N1 has a lysine (K55) (Supplementary Figure S4). NS1 binding to CPSF4/CPSF30, which is important for processing host pre-mRNA, might also contribute to the observed differences in antiviral responses. Here, an aspartic acid (D) in residue 125 is important for interaction, which is present in the huH1N1 NS1 sequence, but not in the swH1N1 NS1 sequence (Supplementary Figure S4). The huH1N1 could potentially have increased binding affinity for CPSF4, which could contribute to the observed reduced host immune response. Loss of CPSF4 binding does not seem to interfere with IFN inhibition, but it is correlated with a greater induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent a greater pathogenicity (54), which is what we have observed after infection with swH1N1. The observed variations were not due to an inability of huH1N1 to replicate as infectious virus was demonstrated in the lungs after both infections. Though, we detected a tendency of a faster clearance of huH1N1, as fewer huH1N1-infected pigs had detectable infectious virus in the lungs and no detectable viral RNA in nasal swab samples at day 7 and day 10, where RNA was detected at the same time points in one or more animals after infection with swH1N1 (25). Thus, despite a lower production of differentially expressed genes upon infection with huH1N1, the immune response was sufficient to control the infection with induction of important antiviral immune factors, such as the OAS family, the IFIT family, MX, ISG15, IFI6, RSAD2, BST2 etc. The infection with the swH1N1 virus induced a high number of antiviral genes, but the virus’ ability to still replicate efficiently might be due to a better capability to evade parts of the immune response, potentially through NS1 as proposed and/or a more abundant HA attachment (55, 56).Histological findings of immune cell infiltration in tracheal tissues after infection with swH1N1 was in line with induction of cytokines and chemotactic factors (AMCF-II, CXCL8/IL8, CXCL2, CXCL10, and CCL20) as well as receptors (CCR1 and CXCR2) in lower trachea after this infection. Immune cell infiltration in the tracheal tissues was only seen to a minor degree in the upper trachea after infection with huH1N1. T cell infiltration and the presence of NK cells and neutrophils has been described in mice tracheal tissues infected with mouse-adapted H1N1 and H3N2 IAV (15, 16) and mononuclear cell infiltration is observed in tracheal tissue from fatal human cases of H1N1 IAV infection (57), but linking the tracheal histopathological differences with inflammatory immune responses after viral infection and between host-adapted IAV and non-adapted IAV has not been described in a large animal model before. The higher degree of single cell necrosis observed in tracheal tissue after infection with swH1N1 (Figure 5) could be linked to inflammation and apoptosis, driven by the elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL19, IL20, and IL27), inflammatory related genes from the S100 family as well as pro-apoptotic genes and proteins (CAPN14, USP18, XAF1, Caspase-13/CASP4, ISG12, and ANXA5) in lower trachea. In agreement with the histological findings, no cytokines or chemokines were induced in the upper and lower trachea after infection with huH1N1 (Supplementary Table S3, S5). Only a single pro-apoptotic protein, ANXA5, was higher in abundance after infection with huH1N1 in lower trachea, and the anti-apoptotic DFFA was lower in abundance in upper trachea (Supplementary Table S3). A higher degree of apoptosis could be induced by the host-adapted IAV to increase the release of progeny viruses and spread of these to neighboring cells, but it could also be an important response of the innate immune system in order to kill infected cells (58). Anti-apoptotic factors including serine protease inhibitors (SERPINB10, SERPINA3–8 (Serpin domain-containing protein, LOC106504547), and SERPIN11A) and heat shock proteins (HSP70.2 and HSPA6), were only found after infection with swH1N1 compared to control. None of the serine proteases have been described in relation to viral infections before, but together with the heat shock proteins and the pro-apoptotic factors they might play an important role in a tight regulation of IAV induced apoptosis in its native host. This balance between an efficient infection with induction of a higher viral load compared to the non-host-adapted IAV and the ability to control pathogenicity/cell death might be acquired during host adaptation and would be an important factor during zoonotic events.The cytoskeleton is actively involved in virus entry, assembly, and release and both viral proteins (HA, NP, and M1) and the eight viral ribonucleoproteins interact with cytoskeletal elements (59–63). Genes (NEB, MYOM2, MYOZ1, and MYBPC1) coding for cytoskeleton elements were downregulated, while other genes (KRT13, KRT17, KRT6A, and BFSP1) were upregulated along with higher abundance of the proteins (PLEC, KRT2, and PLXNA4) after infection with swH1N1 compared to both control pigs and pigs infected with huH1N1. In addition, transcripts coding for S100 proteins (S100A2, S100A3, and S100A8) were upregulated after swH1N1 infection, where S100A2 and S100A8 are involved in regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics (64–67). Further supporting the important role of the cytoskeleton during IAV infection, global proteomics showed that S100A1, which has an inhibitory effect on microtubule assembly (68, 69), was less abundant following exposure to swH1N1 as opposed to huH1N1. Regulation of cytoskeleton movement may be advantageous for IAV in order to decrease virus removal from the infected epithelial cells by mucociliary clearance, and at the same time optimize cytoskeleton movement within the cell for viral entry, assembly, and release. Contrasting findings have been reported in mouse trachea after IAV infection as a decrease in mucociliary velocity has been demonstrated in vivo (19) and an increase of ciliary activity was shown ex vivo (18). Only three proteins (GSN, PLEC, and STRIP1) and one transcript (MYOM3) related to the cytoskeleton organization and dynamics were regulated in the lower trachea after infection with huH1N1. It might be speculated that viral adaptation to the cytoskeleton dynamics of the host cell is an important factor for cross-species transmission to ensure optimal pro-viral host cell metabolism and establishment in a new host.Genes involved in pyrimidine metabolism (RRM2, CTPS1, TK1, NME1, NME2, and UCK2) were induced after infection with swH1N1 compared to huH1N1. RRM2 and TK1 is involved in DNA replication and repair (70, 71), while CTPS1 takes part in RNA synthesis (72, 73). NME1 and NME2 are involved in synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates of RNA and DNA, and UCK2 catalyses the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to uridine monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP) (74). CTPS1 catalyzes the formation of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) from uridine triphosphate (UTP) (73), and is essential for influenza transcription as viral mRNA elongation will be stalled in the lack of CTP as has been described for both IAV and influenza B virus (75, 76). Furthermore, it has been suggested that CTPS1 inhibit IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection (77). Thus, the swH1N1 manipulates host cell mechanisms to boost pyrimidine synthesis ensuring sufficient quantities of essential nucleotides for viral replication, which might be connected with the observed higher viral RNA loads, a higher degree of single cell necrosis, and immune factors linked to cell death. IAV replication has been described to be dependent on the pyrimidine biosynthesis (78, 79), but the exact mechanisms of how IAV regulates the pyrimidine pathway have to be investigated.To conclude, a classical antiviral innate immune response against both host-adapted (swH1N1) and non-adapted (huH1N1) IAV infections was seen in the tracheal epithelium. Infection with the host-adapted swH1N1 virus induced a stronger immune response, with more activated innate immune genes, higher expression levels, single cell necrosis, immune cell infiltration, a higher viral load, and more infectious virus compared to infection with a non-adapted huH1N1 virus in the lower trachea. Furthermore, infection with the swH1N1 resulted in regulation of genes and proteins involved in cytoskeleton dynamics and organization, pyrimidine metabolism, apoptosis, and the JAK-STAT pathway. This suggests that with adaptation swH1N1 IAV has evolved to favor viral infectivity and replication. Using a multi-omics approach many different host factors were investigated during IAV infection and based on our findings, it could be speculated that the likelihood of a cross-species infection and establishment in a new host might be connected to the virus’ ability to interact and regulate the host cell environment to improve the chance of a successful and transmittable infection.FundingThe author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

With IRAT, CDC scientists' goals are answering two risk assessment questions, one on emergence and the other on public health impact. Health officials use IRAT to gauge the pandemic potential of flu viruses and to guide preparedness measures.The CDC has published two previous assessments for viruses from the 2.3.4.4b clade, one in July 2023 for the H5N1 virus that triggered an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm and the other in March 2022 for a sample from a wigeon duck collected in South Carolina in 2021 when the virus first began circulating in US wild birds.Moderate risk for emergence, public health impactLike the other two recent 2.3.4.4b viruses, the subtype that infected the Texas patient is in the moderate risk for both future emergence and public health impact. CDC experts submitted the scores for the virus from the Texas patient on June 26, which include information from other US cases but not the most recent ones reported in Colorado poultry workers.The CDC said the Texas virus scored slightly higher on some risk elements, but lower on others compared to other recent 2.3.4.4b strains. The newer virus had a public health impact score similar to the Spanish mink farm virus, but it had a higher emergence score than the other two viruses."However, the mean-high and mean-low acceptable score ranges for these viruses overlap, indicating that these viruses remain similar, and their overall risk scores remain 'moderate,' " the group said.Compared to 15 other viruses on the CDC's IRAT list, the Texas virus has the sixth-highest emergence score and the seventh-highest public impact score.Colorado veterinarian group warns about H5N1 in catsIn other H5N1 developments, the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association recently warned animal health providers about potential infections in cats, even if all the risk factors or clinical signs aren't present.Of six H5N1 confirmations in Colorado cats so far, only one was directly linked to a dairy farm. Three were indoor cats that had access to the outdoors and could have hunted mice or birds, and two were exclusively indoor cats. Five had similar symptoms, which started with lethargy and poor appetite and progressed to respiratory and neurologic symptoms. Several were tested for rabies, owing to a similar clinical picture.

Repurposing other established pharmaceuticals as antivirals could aid in improving treatment options. Methods: This study investigates the antiviral properties of ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride, two derivatives of the local anesthetic procaine, in influenza A virus infection of A549, Calu-3 and MDCK cells. Results: Both substances inhibit replication in all three of these cell lines in multi-cycle experiments. However, cell line-dependent differences in the effects of the substances on viral RNA replication and subsequent protein synthesis, as well as release of progeny viruses in single-cycle experiments can be observed. Both ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride delay endosome fusion of the virus early in the replication cycle, possibly due to the alkaline nature of the active component procaine. In A549 and Calu-3 cells an additional effect of the substances can be observed at late stages in the first replication cycle. Interestingly, this effect is absent in MDCK cells. We demonstrate that ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes from A549 but not MDCK cells and confirm that specific inhibition of calcium independent PLA2 but not cytosolic PLA2 has antiviral effects. Discussion: We show that ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride inhibit influenza A virus infection at several stages of the replication cycle and have potential as antiviral substances. 1 Introduction Respiratory infections with influenza A virus (IAV) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world (Paget et al., 2019). Treatment options for severe influenza virus infections are currently limited to a few direct-acting antiviral substances such as oseltamivir. Development of alternative treatment options is therefore of importance. Host-directed therapy aims at inhibiting IAV replication by modulating host factors on which the virus depends for replication. To infect the host cell the IAV attaches to the cell via binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface and the virus enters the cell via clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent endocytosis (Weis et al., 1988; Fujioka et al., 2011; Air, 2014; Byrd-Leotis et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2021). After the virus is taken up by the cell, increasing acidification during the progression from the early endosome to the late endosomal compartment and proton influx through the viral matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel cause a conformational change in the viral HA that allows fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane and the release of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cytoplasm (Yoshimura and Ohnishi, 1984; Bullough et al., 1994; White and Whittaker, 2016; Dou et al., 2018). These are then imported into the nucleus for transcription and replication by the IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Hutchinson and Fodor, 2012). The viral messenger RNA (mRNA) is exported from the nucleus and translated by cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes. Newly synthesized nucleoproteins (NP) as well as the components of the RdRp subsequently form vRNPs with the newly replicated viral RNA. The vRNPs then have to travel to the plasma membrane for the assembly of new virus particles (O’Neill et al., 1998; Neumann et al., 2000). The viral membrane proteins HA, neuraminidase (NA) and M2 move to the membrane via the ER and Golgi apparatus (Dou et al., 2018). The budding process, which appears to take place at raft sites in the plasma membrane (Takeda et al., 2003; Nayak et al., 2009; Veit and Thaa, 2011), requires the induction of membrane curvature as the IAV gains its envelope by bending it out of the plasma membrane. Membrane curvature is presumed to be achieved via several overlapping mechanisms. HA and NA, that accumulate on one side of the plasma membrane, as well as matrix protein 1 (M1) and M2 have all been discussed to play an important role in producing membrane curvature for budding (Elleman and Barclay, 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2010; Rossman et al., 2010; Dou et al., 2018; Motsa and Stahelin, 2021; Bao et al., 2022). In general, the shape of lipid bilayer membranes can also be modified by the incorporation of cone-shaped lipids into one side of the bilayer, that are produced by cellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes (Jarsch et al., 2016). The ester-type local anesthetic procaine was first synthesized in 1904 and is one of the oldest local anesthetics (Tobe et al., 2018). Its classical mechanism of action is the inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels on nerve cells, which produces anesthesia. Since procaine’s discovery it has been investigated for a number of different purposes and has been found to have several additional effects besides local anesthesia, such as DNA demethylating activity (Villar-Garea et al., 2003), anti-bacterial effects in high concentrations (Schmidt and Rosenkranz, 1970) and anti-inflammatory effects (Doran and Yi, 2007). The activity of some specific enzymes such as PLA2 and trypsin is affected by local anesthetics in varying concentrations (Waite and Sisson, 1972; Hendrickson and van Dam-Mieras, 1976; Gayda et al., 1979). Local anesthetics also interact with lipid membranes, which has been suspected as an underlying mechanism of many of their different effects (Tsuchiya and Mizogami, 2013; Krogman et al., 2023). Procaine has interestingly been seen to have antiviral effects on a range of different viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Junin virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Fuchs and Levanon, 1978; Bussereau and Genty, 1980; Castilla et al., 1994). Although it was determined to affect the entry phase of several, but not all of these viruses, overall little is known about the mechanism behind procaine’s antiviral effect. In addition, we recently published results demonstrating an inhibitory effect of procaine derivatives on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication (Häring et al., 2023). In the present study we used two derivatives of procaine, ProcCluster® (PC) and procaine hydrochloride (PHCl), and investigated their antiviral activity against IAV in vitro using three different cell lines. 2 Methods 2.1 Cell culture and viruses A549 cells (ATCC Cat. No. CCL-185, human epithelial lung cancer cell line) were cultivated in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Anprotec, Germany). MDCK cells (ATCC Cat. No. CCL-34, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line) and Calu-3 cells (ATCC Cat. No. HTB-55, human lung-adenocarcinoma cell line) were cultivated in MEM (Anprotec, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS. The virus strains used in this work are influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/05 (Wis; H3N2), A/Jena/5258/09 (Jena09; H1N1pdm), A/NRW/172/09 (NRW172; H1N1pdm) and A/NRW/173/09 (NRW173; H1N1pdm). 2.2 Chemical inhibitors ProcCluster® (supplied by inflamed pharma GmbH, Germany), PHCl (Chongqing Soutwest No.2 Pharmaceutical Factory, China) and oseltamivir phosphate (Sigma Aldrich, United States) were diluted in ddH2O and stored frozen at −20°C. Bromoenol lacton (Merck, Germany) and pyrrophenone (MedChemExpress, United States) were diluted in DMSO and stored at −20°C. 2.3 Cell toxicity assays To determine lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) release A549 cells (300,000 cells/well), Calu-3 cells (500,000 cells/well) or MDCK cells (350,000 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates 1 day (A549 and MDCK) or 2 days (Calu-3) prior to use and were then incubated with PC, PHCl or H2O at the indicated concentrations or left untreated. As control lysis buffer supplied by the CyQUANT™ LDH Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) was added to the medium of untreated cells for 15 min at 37°C after 24 h. Supernatants were collected 24 h post H2O, PC or PHCl-treatment and LDH release was determined using the CyQUANT™ LDH Cytotoxicity Assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorption was measured at 490 nm and 680 nm using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). Absorption at 680 nm was subtracted as background from that at 490 nm. Light microscopy pictures were taken using an Axio Vert.A1 light microscope (Zeiss, Germany) prior to taking supernatants for the LDH assay. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were carried out by seeding A549 cells (20,000 cells/well), MDCK cells (20,000 cells/well) or Calu-3 cells (100,000 cells/well) into 96-well plates 24 h prior to use. The cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PC or PHCl in 100 μL DMEM (A549) or MEM (MDCK, Calu-3) supplemented with 10% FCS for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period 25 μL of 5 mg mL−1 MTT were added without removing the medium and the cells were incubated for a further 2 h. The medium was removed and the cells were lysed in 50 μL DMSO. Absorption was measured at 570 nm using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). 2.4 Viral infection and plaque assay A549, MDCK or Calu-3 cells were seeded 24 h (A549, MDCK) or 48 h (Calu-3) prior to viral infection. A549 cells were seeded with 300,000 cells/well in 12-well plates or 600,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. MDCK cells were seeded with 400,000 cells/well in 12-well or 800,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. Calu-3 cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well in 12-well plates or 1,000,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) once prior to infection and then incubated with the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of IAV in PBSInf [PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA (Carl Roth, Germany), 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.9 mM CaCl2] for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. After the initial infection cells were incubated in DMEMInf (A549) or MEMInf (MDCK, Calu-3) until the desired time post infection. DMEMInf and MEMInf consist of DMEM or MEM respectively, supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2 and 0.17 μg mL−1 TPCK trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, United States). Virus titers were determined by standard plaque assays. MDCK cells were seeded in 6-well plates (2,000,000 cells/well) to form a 90% confluent layer and infected with serial dilutions of the sample in PBSInf supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) (100 U mL−1pen/0.1 mg mL−1 strep) for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. The PBSInf was aspirated and replaced by MEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 0.01% DEAE Dextran (Pharmacia Biotech, Germany), 0.2% NaHCO3 (Biozym Scientific, Germany), 100 U mL−1/0.1 mg mL−1 pen/strep, 0.25 μg mL−1 TPCK trypsin and 0.9% agar (Oxoid, Germany) and the cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. Plaques were visualized using neutral red or crystal violet staining. 2.5 Western blot Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 137 mM NaCl; 10% Glycerol; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM EDTA; 50 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate; 0.2 mM Pefabloc®, 5 μg mL−1 aprotinin; 5 μg mL−1 leupeptin; 1 mM sodium vanadate and 5 mM benzamidine) was used to lyse cells for 30 min while kept at 4°C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 rpm, 4°C) and protein content was measured using Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (BioRad, United States) and samples were diluted appropriately for equal protein amounts. Samples were supplemented with a 5× Laemmli buffer (10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 25% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 312 mM Tris pH 6.8) in a 1:5 ratio and heated to 95°C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting. Proteins were detected using the primary antibodies listed in Table 1 and WesternSure® HRP goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-CORE Biosciences, United States) as secondary antibody. Quantification normalized to the α-tubulin loading control was done using Fiji (Image J.JS v0.5.7; https://ij.imjoy.io). Table 1 Table 1. Antibodies for western blot analysis. 2.6 Virus-endosome fusion assay To investigate the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosome, IAV PR8 stock solution [1.13 × 108 plaque forming units (PFU) mL−1] was incubated with 0.2 μM 3,3′-dioctadecyl-5,5′-di(4-sulfophenyl)oxacarbocyanine (SP-DiOC18) (Abcam, United Kingdom) and 0.4 μM octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) (Sigma Aldrich, United States) for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was filtered using a sterile 0.45 μm filter. A549 cells were pre-incubated with 2 μg mL−1 U18666A (U18) (Sigma Aldrich, United States) for 18 h prior to infection as positive control. Others were left untreated. Cells were infected with the dye-treated virus particles with an MOI of 10 for 30 min on ice followed by 30 min incubation at 37°C. Mock-infected cells were incubated with a solution of R18 and SP-DiOC18 in PBS that was treated in an identical manner to the virus solution. Cells were thereafter incubated with 2.5 mM PC or PHCl for the indicated times. Cells were detached using accutase (Biozym Scientific, Germany), washed once with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS and the percentage of SP-DiOC18 positive cells (determined by comparison with the mock-infected control) out of 10,000 cells was measured by flow cytometry using a BD FACSLyric™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States). 2.7 Quantitative real time PCR To isolate RNA from A549, MDCK or Calu-3 cells we used the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used for copy DNA (cDNA) synthesis from 400 ng of total RNA from cells. For quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used. Cycle conditions were set as follows: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 10 s. The PCR cycle concluded with a stepwise temperature-increase from 60°C to 95°C (1°C every 5 s). All primers used are listed in Table 2 (fw: forward, rv: reverse). The mRNA expression relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT-method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Table 2 Table 2. Primers. 2.8 Hemagglutination and neuraminidase activity assay Human erythrocyte concentrate was purchased from the Institute of Transfusion Medicine of the University Hospital Jena. Human erythrocyte concentrate (blood type 0) was washed three times with PBS and diluted to an appropriate concentration (OD600 = 1.1–1.2 after 1:10 dilution) in PBS. Optimal dilution of the IAV stock was determined by preliminary experiments. Erythrocytes were then incubated with IAV PR8 and a dilution series of PC or PHCl in PBS in V-bottom 96-well plates at 4°C for 2 h, after which wells showing hemagglutination of the erythrocytes were documented. The plate was then moved to 37°C over night after which the state of each well was again noted. The hemagglutination pattern of PC or PHCl-treated samples was evaluated compared to untreated erythrocytes. 2.9 Phospholipase A2 assay A549 or MDCK cells were collected in PBS from cell culture plates using a cell scraper and were centrifuged at 4°C and 4,500 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were discarded and replaced by ddH2O. Cells were resuspended by vortexing and kept on ice for 30 min, after which equal amounts of 2x reaction buffer (EnzChek™ Phospholipase A2 Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) were added. Samples were centrifuged at 4°C and 4,500 rpm for 10 min. PLA2 activity of these lysates with and without the addition of different concentrations of PC or PHCl was analyzed using the EnzChek™ Phospholipase A2 Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) (Excitation: 485 nm; Emission: 520 nm). 2.10 Infrared spectroscopy measurements Infrared spectroscopy was conducted using attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy on a Nicolet™ Avatar 380 FT-IR spectrometer. 2.11 Solubility measurements in water and octanol PHCl and PC were added to water or octanol in a 10 mL volumetric flask to a theoretical concentration of 0.046 mM. After 2 h, 250 μL of the solution were added to a new flask with 10 mL of the respective solvent (water or octanol) and a UV/VIS spectrum was obtained. 3 Results 3.1 Properties of ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride PHCl (1) and PC (2) are drugs based on the active component procaine (3) (Table 3). PC is the hydrogen carbonate of procaine while PHCl, as the name suggests, is the hydrochloride of procaine. PC, or procainium hydrogencarbonate, is stabilized by the mineral salt sodium chloride. Structural differences are visualized using infrared spectroscopy in Supplementary Figure S1. PC, PHCl and procaine differ in their melting temperature (or in the case of PC decomposition temperature) as well as in their pH value (1% solution), with procaine having the highest (pH 10.4) and PHCl the lowest (pH 6.1) (Table 3). Measurements of the solubility of these substances in octanol demonstrate a much higher solubility of PC than procaine hydrochloride (Supplementary Figure S2), which would indicate improved membrane penetration of PC compared to PHCl. The lipophilic procaine is poorly soluble in water, unlike the hydrophilic PHCl and the amphiphilic PC (Table 3). Table 3 Table 3. Properties of procaine hydrochloride, ProcCluster® and procaine. 3.2 ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride treatment cause a reduction in IAV titers Cellular metabolic activity was determined by MTT assay in Calu-3, A549 and MDCK cells in order to identify tolerable concentrations of PC and PHCl in vitro (Figures 1A–C, upper panels). In A549 cells PC and PHCl caused a 50% reduction in metabolic activity at 5.36 mM [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.45 mM–6.32 mM] and 5.35 mM (CI 4.76 mM–6.00 mM), respectively. A reduction in metabolic activity in Calu-3 and MDCK cells was only observed in this assay upon treatment with high concentrations (around 10 mM) of PC or PHCl, when cells already showed strong morphological changes visible in light microscopy. We therefore did not calculate an inhibitory concentration in these cells. To further investigate potential cytotoxic effects of PC and PHCl, we performed LDH release measurements (Figures 1A–C, lower panels) and documented cell morphology using light microscopy pictures (Supplementary Figure S3). LDH release indicates apoptotic or necrotic damage to the cells. LDH release after 24 h treatment with PC, PHCl or H2O control was compared to the maximum LDH release caused by addition of lysis buffer to the cells after 24 h without inhibitor treatment. Again A549 cells showed an increase in LDH release in the presence of 6 mM and more of PC or PHCl while lower concentrations caused the same amount of LDH release as the solvent control. Calu-3 and MDCK cells however did not show an increase in LDH release until all cells were visibly detached (10–12 mM PC). The cell morphology of Calu-3 and A549 cells appears unchanged after treatment with up to 4 mM PC or PHCl. Treatment with 6 mM PC or PHCl causes the formation of large intracellular vacuole structures that increase in number with increasing treatment concentrations. The same intracellular vacuoles appeared in MDCK cells after treatment with a concentration of 3 mM or more of PC or PHCl (Supplementary Figure S3). Although these changes did not correlate directly with measurable changes in metabolic activity or LDH release, we used a maximum concentration of 2.5 mM for further experiments in all three cell lines. Figure 1 Figure 1. Metabolic activity and LDH release after 24 h treatment with PC and PHCl. (A) A549, (B) Calu-3 and (C) MDCK cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of solvent control (H2O), PC or PHCl for 24 h and analyzed by MTT- (upper panels) or LDH-assay (lower panels). For MTT-assay the metabolic activity was normalized to the H2O-treated sample (100%) and the 16 mM PC or PHCl-treated sample (0%). The mean ± SD of three independent experiments is depicted. GraphPad Prism (v.9.3.1) was used to perform a curve fit by non-linear regression. For LDH-assay the untreated cells were lysed 24 h post treatment as maximum LDH release control. The supernatants of all samples were used to determine LDH release. The data represent the mean + SD of three independent experiments as percentage of maximum LDH release. Multi-cycle infection experiments were used to determine whether PC and PHCl have an inhibitory effect on IAV replication. Calu-3 cells were infected with an MOI of 0.1 of three different IAV isolates; the H1N1 strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), the H1N1pdm isolate A/Jena/5258/09 (Jena09) from the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the H3N2 strain A/Wisconsin/67/05 (Wis) (Figure 2A). After infection the cells were treated with PC or PHCl for 24 h in concentrations from 0.1 to 2 mM. Both substances caused a dose-dependent reduction in virus titers with all three virus strains with effective concentration 50% (EC50) values ranging from 0.32 mM to 0.76 mM. The corresponding confidence intervals for the individual EC50 values do not offer good evidence that effectiveness differs depending on the virus strain used. PC and PHCl also caused a dose-dependent reduction of virus titers in PR8-infected MDCK cells, with EC50 values of 0.61 mM and 0.80 mM, respectively (Figure 2B). Figure 2 Figure 2. PC and PHCl treatment cause an inhibition of IAV replication in vitro. (A) Calu-3 cells or (B) MDCK cells were infected with either A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) (A,B), A/Jena/5258/09 (Jena09) (A) or A/Wisconsin/67/05 (Wis) (A) at an MOI of 0.1 for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with PC or PHCl or solvent control (H2O). After 24 h of incubation supernatants were collected and progeny virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay. Virus titers are shown as percentage of the solvent control. The mean ± SD of three independent experiments with two biological replicates is depicted. Effective concentration 50% (EC50) values and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined by non-linear regression in GraphPad Prism (v.9.3.1). PC and PHCl also significantly inhibited the replication of IAV PR8 and Wis in A549 cells using concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mM (Figure 3, upper panels). Virus titers of IAV PR8 where reduced by around 80% compared to the solvent control at both concentrations. IAV Wis titers with 1.25 and 2.5 mM PC or PHCl treatment were reduced by around 60 and 80%, respectively. Both substances (used at 2.5 mM) were also able to inhibit the replication of A/NRW/172/09 (NRW172; H1N1pdm) and A/NRW/173/09 (NRW173; H1N1pdm) (Figure 3, lower panels). NRW172 and NRW173 are two isolates from the same patient, taken from an early sample and after oseltamivir treatment of the patient, respectively, making the later less oseltamivir sensitive. The effect of 1 μM oseltamivir treatment is noticeably reduced in the later isolate, while the effect of PC and PHCl remains. Figure 3 Figure 3. PC and PHCl are effective against oseltamivir-tolerant viruses. A549 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PC, PHCl, solvent control (H2O) or oseltamivir (OTV) for 30 min and then infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), A/Wisconsin/67/05 (Wis), A/NRW/172/09 (NRW172) or A/NRW/173/09 (NRW173) as indicated at an MOI of 0.1 (PR8 and Wis) or 0.5 (NRW172 and NRW173) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with the indicated concentrations of PC, PHCl or OTV until 24 h p.i. Virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay. The virus titer in the solvent control sample was arbitrarily set to 100%. The mean + SD of at least three independent experiments with two biological replicates is depicted. Statistical significance was determined by one-sample t-test comparing to 100. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. 3.3 PC and PHCl show cell line-dependent differences in their effects on the IAV replication cycle To determine at which stage of the replication cycle procaine treatment limits progeny virus production we performed time of addition experiments in which we added PC or PHCl starting at different times pre and post infection with PR8 (MOI 1) and determined viral titers after 9 h (Figure 4). Interestingly, in A549 cells the reduction in virus titers by around 70% under treatment with 2.5 mM PC or PHCl was consistent throughout the replication cycle even when the substances were added as late as 6 h p.i. (Figure 4A). In Calu-3 cells, the reduction in virus titers was most pronounced when treatment was started directly after infection (over 90% reduction). Treatment at later times became increasingly less effective, but at 6 h p.i. still reduced virus titers by 60% (Figure 4B). The reduction in efficacy at later points in the replication cycle was even more pronounced in MDCK cells. Treatment with PC or PHCl directly after infection again inhibited virus titers by over 90% but had only a minor effect at 2 h p.i. and no effect starting from 4 h p.i. (Figure 4C). PC and PHCl treatment seem to affect virus replication early on in all three cell lines and have an additional effect at a very late stage of the replication cycle in A549 and Calu-3 cells but not in MDCK cells. Pre-incubation of Calu-3 cells for 16 h or 1 h prior to infection without treatment after infection had no effect on virus titers (Supplementary Figure S4). Figure 4 Figure 4. PC and PHCl treatment result in a reduction of progeny virus titers as late as 6 h p.i. in A549 and Calu-3 cells. (A) A549, (B) Calu-3 and (C) MDCK cells were incubated with 2.5 mM PC or PHCl (−30 min) or were left untreated for 30 min prior to infection. The cells were infected with IAV PR8 at an MOI of 1 for 30 min and then again treated with 2.5 mM PC, PHCl or solvent control (H2O) either immediately (−30 min, 30 min and H2O) or at the indicated times without removing the media. Viral titers were analyzed at 9 h p.i. by standard plaque assay. The solvent control was arbitrarily set to 100%. The mean + SD of three independent experiments with two biological replicates is depicted. Statistical significance was determined by one-sample t-test comparing to 100. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. 3.4 PC and PHCl treatment cause a delay in IAV RNA and protein synthesis To further determine how procaine treatment interferes with IAV infection, the levels of IAV RNA for segment 7 and viral protein synthesis were investigated at different times during the first replication cycle. Cells were infected with IAV PR8 (MOI 5) and treated with 2.5 mM PC, PHCl or solvent control (H2O) starting 30 min p.i. Cells were then lysed for RNA at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h p.i. and IAV RNA (segment 7) content was analyzed by qRT-PCR (Figure 5). In A549 cells the RNA amounts of IAV segment 7 were slightly reduced in the PC-treated samples at 2 h p.i. while those from infected cells treated with PHCl were not affected. However, at 4 h p.i., both the PC- and PHCl-treated infected A549 cells showed reduced amounts (by around 50%) of IAV RNA in comparison to control. This reduction was still present but less pronounced at 6 h p.i. and completely absent at 8 h p.i. In Calu-3 and MDCK cells on the other hand a strong reduction in the amount of IAV RNA can be seen from 4 h p.i. that remains for the 6 and 8 h time points. As would be expected a strong increase in the amount of IAV RNA can be seen over time, reaching at peak around 1,000 to 2,000-times the amount at 2 h p.i. Peak amounts were notably reached at 6 h p.i. in A549 and MDCK cells while IAV RNA amounts tripled from 6 to 8 h p.i. in Calu-3 cells. Figure 5 Figure 5. PC and PHCl treatment inhibit IAV RNA synthesis. A549, Calu-3 or MDCK were infected with IAV PR8 (MOI 5) for 30 min and were afterwards treated with 2.5 mM PC or PHCl or solvent control (H2O). The cells were washed and lysed for RNA extraction at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h p.i. A qRT-PCR was conducted to determine the relative amount of IAV RNA segment 7 using GAPDH levels for normalization. RNA levels of the solvent control (H2O) samples at 2 h p.i. were arbitrarily set to 1. The mean + SD of three independent experiments is depicted. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. Because A549 cells showed this more unusual pattern of IAV RNA synthesis under treatment we further investigated the expression of viral proteins in this cell line using western blotting. The expression of the viral proteins polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), M1 and HA were in line with the qRT-PCR results. Both PC and PHCl treatment provoked a visible reduction in viral protein expression in comparison to solvent treatment at 4 h p.i., but not at 8 h p.i (Figure 6). Thus, these results indicate that in A549 cells the synthesis of both IAV RNA and protein largely recovers from the initial delay caused by procaine treatment. Figure 6 Figure 6. PC and PHCl treatment transiently affect IAV protein synthesis. A549 cells were infected with 3 MOI of IAV PR8 for 30 min and were afterwards treated with 2.5 mM PC (A), PHCl (B) or solvent control (H2O) (A,B). Cells were washed and lysed for western blot analysis at 4 or 8 h p.i. IAV proteins PB1, HA and M1 were detected using specific antibodies. Cellular α-tubulin was detected as loading control and used to normalize expression levels. The relative protein amount was quantified using Fiji (Image J). Signal intensity in the solvent-treated samples was arbitrarily set to 1. All graphs show the mean + SD of three independent experiments. Blots show one representative example of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by one-sample t-test comparing to a hypothetical mean of 1. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. Since PC and PHCl treatment was started only 30 min p.i. in the above experiment, attachment and uptake of the viral particle cannot have been affected in this setup. However, fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome and release of the viral ribonucleoproteins could still be altered. Procaine has previously been described to potentially increase the pH of endosomes which would impair IAV release (Bussereau and Genty, 1980). Flow cytometry analysis using dye loaded virus particles can be used to follow virus release from the endosome (Sakai et al., 2006). We loaded IAV PR8 stock solution with the fluorescent dyes 3,3′-dioctadecyl-5,5′-di(4-sulfophenyl)oxacarbocyanine (SP-DiOC18) and octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) in high concentrations. The fluorescent dyes are integrated into the virus particle membrane, where their fluorescence is quenched due to the close proximity of the two dyes. We then infected A549 cells with these virus particles (MOI 10). When the viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane, releasing the content of the viral particle from the endosome, the dyes diffuse across the endosomal membrane, which reduces their proximity and strongly increases the fluorescence of SP-DiOC18. This allows the measurement of virus-endosome fusion by detecting SP-DiOC18 fluorescence by flow cytometry. A549 cells were infected for 30 min and then treated with PC or PHCl for 30 min to 3 h. We also treated cells with U18666A (U18) for 18 h prior to infection but not after infection. U18 causes accumulation of cholesterol in the endosomal membrane, which inhibits virus-endosome fusion (Kuhnl et al., 2018). After 30 min around 20% of the solvent-treated control cells were positive for SP-DiOC18 fluorescence, while only around 10% of the PC and PHCl-treated cells were positive (Figure 7). The percentage of positive control cells then increased steeply to around 60% at 1 h and reached 90% after 2 h. The amount of positive PC and PHCl-treated cells only reached about 15% after 1 h and then increased to approximately 40% at 2 h. PC and PHCl-treated cells reached levels similar to those of control cells after 3 h. U18 pre-treatment caused a reduction in the number of positive cells in the first hour but showed the same level as the control cells at 2 h and 3 h. Due to a strong variability in the overall percentage of SP-DiOC18 fluorescence positive cells between the different experimental replicates none of the effects described in this experiment were statistically significant. However, the described reduction of virus endosome fusion with PC or PHCl treatment could be seen in every experimental replicate. PC and PHCl treatment seem to delay the release of viral material from the endosome, which would explain the delay in viral RNA and protein synthesis observed in A549 cells. The fact that both RNA and protein synthesis reach levels near those of the control cells indicates however that this is not the main mechanism responsible for the reduction in virus titers observed in A549 cells. Figure 7 Figure 7. PC or PHCl treatment results in a delay of IAV RNA release from the endosome. (A) A549 cells were incubated with 2 μg mL−1 U 18 for 18 h or left untreated. IAV PR8 stock-solution was treated with 200 nM SP-DiOC18 and 400 nM R18 for 1 h. The cells were then infected with this IAV PR8 (MOI 10) for 30 min on ice followed by 30 min at 37°C. Afterwards the cells were treated with 2.5 mM of PC or PHCl or solvent control (H2O) for the indicated times. The cells were detached using accutase and the percentage of SP-DiOC18 fluorescence positive cells was assessed using a flow cytometer. Positive cells were those showing fluorescence above the values of mock-infected control cells. The graph shows the mean + SD of four independent experiments. Statistical significance was tested using two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. (B, top panel) Representative depiction of flow cytometry gating for A549 single cell population at 1 h p.i. (H2O-treated sample). (B, bottom panel) Representative depiction of cutoff (black horizontal lines) used to distinguish SP-DiOC18 fluorescence positive and negative cells by comparison to mock-infected sample. Colored curves show cell number by fluorescence intensity. Additionally, the interferon (IFN) response in infected A549 cells treated with procaine was reduced compared to the solvent-treated cells, which is potentially a further effect of the lag in endosomal release and RNA synthesis. We measured the mRNA expression of IFNβ, IFNλ1, IFNλ2/3, MxA (myxovirus resistance protein A) and IP-10 (IFN-gamma induced protein 10 kD) at 6 h p.i. and found their expression to be reduced by around 50% in PC and PHCl-treated infected cells compared to untreated infected cells (Figure 8). There was nonetheless a strong induction of the interferon response in all infected cells compared to the uninfected control cells. Figure 8 Figure 8. PC and PHCl treatment cause a reduction in the anti-IAV IFN-response at 6 h p.i. A549 cells were infected with IAV PR8 (MOI 5) for 30 min and were afterwards treated with the indicated concentrations of PC or PHCl or solvent control (H2O). RNA lysates were performed at 6 h p.i. A qRT-PCR was conducted to determine the relative amount of mRNA for the indicated genes using GAPDH levels for normalization. The mRNA expression of the untreated IAV-infected samples was arbitrarily set to 1. The mean + SD of three independent experiments with two biological replicates is depicted. Statistical significance was determined by one-sample t-test comparing to a hypothetical mean of 1. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. 3.5 PC and PHCl do not affect viral NA or HA activity Since PC and PHCl treatment of IAV infection in A549 cells only caused transient effects on IAV RNA and protein synthesis as well as virus endosome fusion, but nonetheless inhibited progeny virus titers even when added late in the replication cycle, an additional effect of the substances towards the end of the replication cycle appears to exist. A possible late action of IAV inhibitors is inhibition of the viral NA activity. We used human erythrocytes to investigate whether PC and PHCl affected the activity of HA or NA (Figure 9A). The erythrocytes were incubated with IAV PR8 and a range of concentrations of PC, PHCl or zanamivir (a commercially available neuraminidase inhibitor) at 4°C for 2 h. In these conditions viral HA, which unlike NA activity does not require higher temperatures, can cause hemagglutination of the erythrocytes. None of the substances affected hemagglutination by the virus. The plates were then incubated at 37°C over night to allow for NA activity, which reverses the hemagglutination caused before. As would be expected zanamivir inhibited the reversal of hemagglutination. PC and PHCl even in concentrations up to 10 mM had no effect on NA activity. Figure 9 Figure 9. PC and PHCl treatment do not inhibit IAV HA and NA activity and do not cause an ER stress response. (A) Human erythrocytes were incubated with IAV PR8 as well as increasing concentrations of PC, PHCl (0.3 mM–10 mM), or zanamivir (12.5 nM–400 nM) in 96-well plates at 4°C for 2 h and hemagglutination of the erythrocytes was assessed at this time (A, left picture). The plates were then incubated at 37°C for around 15 h over night and hemagglutination of the individual wells was assessed again to evaluate neuraminidase activity (A, right picture). (B) A549 cells were infected with IAV PR8 at an MOI of 5 for 30 min and then treated with 2.5 mM PC or PHCl until 6 h p.i. Cells were washed and then lysed for RNA extraction. The relative amount of mRNA for the indicated ER-stress markers was assessed by qRT-PCR using GAPDH levels for normalization. RNA expression of untreated uninfected cells was arbitrarily set to 1. The mean + SD of three independent experiments with two biological replicates is depicted. The translation of viral proteins HA, NA and M2 occurs at the ER. The proteins translocate into the ER and are transported to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus for budding. We used qRT-PCR to measure the mRNA expression of heat shock protein (HSP) A5/binding immunoglobulin protein (HSPA5/BiP), HSP90B1/endoplasmin and DDIT3 (DNA damage inducible transcript 3), two ER chaperone proteins and a transcription factor, respectively, that are upregulated in response to ER stress. None of the three ER stress markers were upregulated 6 h p.i. independent of procaine or solvent treatment (Figure 9B), which suggests that PC and PHCl do not affect trafficking of viral proteins through the ER, as the accumulation of viral protein in the ER would likely lead to the induction of ER stress. 3.6 PC and PHCl inhibit PLA2 from A549 but not MDCK cells Procaine has also been reported to act on PLA2, a group of enzymes responsible for lysing membrane phospholipids producing a lysophospholipid and a free fatty acid. There are several subtypes of PLA2 and there are varying reports on the effects of procaine on these enzymes (Waite and Sisson, 1972; Hendrickson and van Dam-Mieras, 1976). We used a commercially available fluorescent substrate to investigate the effects of procaine on intracellular PLA2 from A549 and MDCK cells. We lysed the cells by treatment with distilled water to gain a PLA2 containing sample for the assay. Notably, PC and PHCl treatment did inhibit the activity of PLA2 from A549 cells by 30 to 40% in this assay at the concentrations we used in cell culture (Figure 10A, left panel). PLA2 activity was further reduced at 5 and 10 mM. We previously published results showing that PC and PHCl inhibit the activity of PLA2 from Calu-3 cells in the same way (Häring et al., 2023). PLA2 from MDCK cells however was not affected by PC or PHCl treatment here (Figure 10A, right panel). Figure 10 Figure 10. PC and PHCl inhibit PLA2 from A549 but not MDCK cells. (A) A549 and MDCK cells were lysed for 30 min on ice using distilled water. The activity of cellular PLA2 in the lysate was assessed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of PC and PHCl. PLA2 activity of untreated samples was arbitrarily set to 100%. (B) Calu-3 cells were infected with IAV PR8 at an MOI of 0.1 for 30 min and then treated with the indicated concentrations of bromoenol lacton (BEL), pyrrophenone (PP) or left untreated until 24 h p.i. Virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay and the titer in the solvent-treated samples was arbitrarily set to 100%. (C) Calu-3 cells were treated (−30 min) with 30 μM bromoenol lacton (BEL) or left untreated for 30 min prior to infection. Cells were then infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1 for 30 min. Afterwards cells were treated with 30 μM BEL or solvent control (DMSO) immediately (−30 min, 30 min and DMSO) or at the indicated times (without removing the media). (A–C) Statistical significance was determined by one sample t-test comparing to 100. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. To confirm whether inhibition of PLA2 has antiviral effects in our cells we used the specific inhibitors, bromoenol lacton (BEL) and pyrrophenone (PP) which inhibit calcium independent PLA2 (iPLA2) and cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), respectively. Both of these PLA2 enzymes should be present intracellularly. Treatment of PR8-infected Calu-3 cells with BEL for 24 h p.i. caused a concentration-dependent reduction in virus titers. They were reduced around 40, 60 and 75% with 1 μM, 10 μM and 25 μM BEL, respectively. PP in concentrations of 10 nM, 100 nM and 300 nM did not affect virus titers. We next conducted a 9 h time of addition experiment similar to the experiment shown in Figure 4 using BEL to investigate how iPLA2 inhibition effects viral replication at different times during the replication cycle (Figure 10C). We infected Calu-3 cells with 1 MOI of PR8 and added 30 μM BEL starting 30 min prior to infection, directly after infection, 4 h p.i. or 6 h p.i. and measured virus titers at 9 h p.i. Addition of BEL directly after the initial infection (with or without pre-incubation) caused a strong reduction in virus titers, while addition at 4 h or later had no effect. Overall, PC and PHCl exhibit an antiviral effect in all three cell lines used here and affect several stages of the replication cycle at early and late times after infection. However, the specific steps of the replication cycle that are affected differ between the cell lines used. 4 Discussion Over the past decades, local anesthetics in general and procaine specifically have been investigated for several purposes not related to analgesia, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects (Gradinaru et al., 2021). Studies with procaine on HSV, WNV, VSV and Junin virus conducted in the 1970s, 80s and 90s already showed inhibitory effects of procaine on these viruses (Fuchs and Levanon, 1978; Bussereau and Genty, 1980; Castilla et al., 1994). Our own studies recently demonstrated that PC and PHCl treatment inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 and Vero-76 cells. We observed an inhibition of viral RNA replication as well as viral release from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Häring et al., 2023). In the present study we show that PC and PHCl treatment result in inhibition of IAV replication (Figures 2, 3). Previously, procaine treatment was reported to affect the attachment or entry of HSV and WNV into the host cell when cells were treated prior to infection (Fuchs and Levanon, 1978). We did not observe an effect of pre-incubation with PC or PHCl on IAV uptake (Supplementary Figure S4). Nonetheless, independent of the cell line used, virus titers were decreased when treatment was started 30 min after viral internalization (Figure 4). Part of this antiviral effect is likely due to the delayed release of viral material from the endosome that we observed (Figure 7). This process is highly pH dependent, requiring acidification of the endosome and subsequent acidification of the viral particles via the M2 ion channel. Local anesthetics exert their primary function of anesthesia by blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels on nerve fibers and procaine has also been found to act on Ca2+- and K+-channels (Zahradníková and Palade, 1993; Huang et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2013). The delay in IAV RNA release from the endosome could in theory be due to direct inhibition of channels involved in the acidification of the endosome or the viral M2 ion channel. However, the inhibition of virus endosome fusion could also be explained by a more indirect mechanism. Procaine, the active component in both PC and PHCl, is a weak base. Drugs that are weak bases, including local anesthetics, are known to accumulate in endocytic compartments. These drugs can diffuse into the organelle in the uncharged state and are then protonated due to the low pH in the endosome and cannot diffuse back out (Aki et al., 2012; Marceau et al., 2014). This process is known as cation-trapping. Accordingly, previous investigations into the effects of different amines including procaine on endosomal pH and VSV release from the endosome demonstrated 50% inhibition of virus endosome fusion at 3.3 mM procaine, a concentration around 15-times higher than that required of the local anesthetic lidocaine and around 150-times higher than that required of chloroquine (Miller and Lenard, 1981). The partial or transient inhibition of virus endosome fusion we observed with 2.5 mM PC or PHCl treatment is in line with reported results. Cation-trapping is also known to cause osmotic vacuolization (Marceau et al., 2014), which we also observed here starting from concentrations of about 6 mM in Calu-3 and A549 cells and about 3 mM in MDCK cells. It is not entirely understood if vacuolization is harmful to the cells (Aki et al., 2012), although excessive vacuolization is unlikely to be beneficial. PC or PHCl treatment affects viral RNA replication and subsequent protein synthesis differently in the cell lines investigated here. Even though continuous PC or PHCl treatment started 30 min p.i. both viral RNA and protein synthesis were only transiently inhibited in A549 cells and recovered towards the end of the replication cycle (Figures 5, 6). In contrast, RNA levels remained decreased compared to the control from 4 h onward in Calu-3 and MDCK cells. At least part of the effect on viral RNA replication observed is likely due to the described inhibition of virus release from the endosome. However, the fact that the inhibitory effect is much stronger in Calu-3 and MDCK cells suggests that procaine exerts a further more direct effect on viral replication in these cells. Local anesthetics such as procaine have been described to interact with biological membranes, changing their organization and fluidity and this has been suggested as an underlying mechanism of their effects on various channels (Tsuchiya and Mizogami, 2013; Krogman et al., 2023). The wide range of proteins that could potentially be affected by procaine treatment through such a mechanism makes it difficult to identify a specific target, responsible for the procaine-mediated antiviral effect we observed. A549 and, to a lesser extent, Calu-3 cells showed diminished virus titers even when PC or PHCl was added late in infection (Figures 4A,B). This suggests that progeny virus release was influenced by procaine. Virus titers from MDCK cells were only reduced if the substances were added right after infection (Figure 4C). Since both, the expression of ER stress markers as well as the activity of viral HA and NA was unaffected by treatment (Figure 9), we concluded that improper processing of viral proteins in the ER or inhibited release from the cell surface were not the cause of this late effect. However, both PC and PHCl inhibited the activity of PLA2 enzymes of A549 cells but not MDCK cells (Figure 10A). We have previously also shown that PC and PHCl are able to inhibit the activity of PLA2 from Calu-3 cells (Häring et al., 2023). PLA2 enzymes hydrolyze membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 (stereospecifically numbered 2) position of one of their fatty acid chains. This alters the shape of the resulting lysophospholipid, which can play an important role in membrane remodeling activity (Brown et al., 2003). There are several different groups of PLA2 enzymes in humans and animals that have been described in detail (Schaloske and Dennis, 2006). The main types of PLA2 enzymes are secreted PLA2 (sPLA2), cPLA2, iPLA2, PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AH) and lysosomal PLA2. The EnzChek™ PLA2 assay kit detects the activity of any phospholipase capable of the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the sn-2 position. The way in which the cells were lysed for the assay excludes any of the PLA2 enzymes that are extracellular, specifically all sPLA2 and one subgroup of PAF-HA, from contributing to the assay. It has previously been shown that specific inhibition of cPLA2 does not affect the replication of IAV (Müller et al., 2018) while inhibition of iPLA2 does, potentially by influencing membrane bending and inhibiting virus budding (Nakano et al., 2009). We could confirm that inhibition of iPLA2 using BEL leads to a dose-dependent reduction in viral titers while inhibition of cPLA2 using PP in concentrations of up to 300 nM does not (Figure 10B). PP inhibits cPLA2 with an IC50 of 4.2 nM in a cell free system and inhibits the release of arachidonic acid (a common product of phospholipid hydrolysis by PLA2 enzymes) with an IC50 of 190 nM in human blood (Seno et al., 2001). Previous research indicated that inhibition of iPLA2 affected virus budding, raising the hypothesis that PLA2 inhibition may be involved in the effects late in the replication cycle in A549 and Calu-3 cells. However, addition of BEL 4 h or 6 h after infection had no effect on viral titers in our experiments (Figure 10C). This suggests that the antiviral effect of PC and PHCl at late stages is not due to iPLA2 inhibition. However, inhibition of iPLA2 or other PLA2 subtypes could contribute to the overall antiviral effect of PC and PHCl. Both Calu-3 and A549 cells are adenocarcinoma-derived human lung epithelial cells and therefore could be considered a better model for infection in humans than MDCK cells, which are canine kidney epithelial cells. However, the effects of PC and PHCl during the replication cycle vary even between Calu-3 and A549 cells. In future primary lung epithelial cells, more complex cell culture systems or in vivo models could be used to further investigate the effects of procaine on viral replication. In vivo experiments would further aid in determining the safety of PC as an antiviral treatment. We show that PC is 50% effective at around 0.5 mM (Figure 2) and starts to cause potentially harmful changes to cells at around 10-times that concentration (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S3). PC could be applied by inhalation in in vivo experiments and this might improve the relationship of required dose and potential systemic toxicity. Nebulization of local anesthetics to achieve topical anesthesia in the respiratory tract has been described since the 1940s and has since been used for endoscopic procedures and investigated for its use in asthma and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Miller et al., 1949; Slaton et al., 2013; Welter et al., 2023). Application of the local anesthetic lidocaine via inhalation has been shown to cause lower plasma concentrations compared to other applications, with subsequently reduced toxicity (Labedzki et al., 1990; Slaton et al., 2013). Future investigations would, however, still need to clarify the doses that could be reached safely by inhalation without direct toxicity to the lung. PC and PHCl treatment also led to reduced IAV-induced mRNA expression of the type I and type III IFNs IFN-β and IFN-λ1, -2 and -3 and the IFN-stimulated MxA and IP-10 in A549 cells 6 h p.i. (Figure 8). There has been previous descriptions of a dependence of the strength of IFN-λ1 induction on cellular MOI within the first 8 h p.i. in A549 cells (Martin et al., 2020). The reduction in IFN expression seen here is likely related to a reduced pathogen load. We do not observe any clear differences in the antiviral activity and mechanism of PC and PHCl treatment, even though these two compounds exhibit different chemical properties such as different pH values in solution. Membrane penetration depends on the balance of the charged (active) and uncharged (transport) form of these substances, which is also improved with PC compared to PHCl. However, the differences in the chemical properties of these substances do not seem to have any relevant effects in simple cell culture models such as the ones used here. Nonetheless, the different properties of PC and PHCl probably play a larger role in a more complex system. Overall, we show that PC and PHCl affect viral replication in vitro at several points during the replication cycle. Although variations can be seen in the mechanism of action between the three cell lines, virus titers are reduced by a comparable amount in all of them in multi-cycle experiments.

Therefore, results from observational studies can be more difficult to interpret. Bias can be reduced through careful study designs and analyses of data collected. Observational studies of flu vaccine effectiveness are subject to at least three forms of bias: confounding, selection bias, and information bias. Confounding Confounding is when the effect of vaccination on the risk of the outcome being measured (e.g., flu-related hospitalizations confirmed by testing) is distorted by another factor associated both with vaccination (the exposure) and the outcome. In RCTs, factors associated with exposure and outcomes can be evenly distributed between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. This is not always true in observational studies. For example, chronic medical conditions can confound the association between flu vaccination and hospitalization with flu in observational studies. Chronic medical conditions increase the risk of flu-related hospitalization, and vaccination is more common among people with chronic medical conditions. Therefore, the presence of a chronic medical condition in a study participant is a potential confounding factor that should be considered in analysis. This is an example of confounding by indication because those at greatest risk for the outcome being measured (i.e., flu-related hospitalization) are targeted for vaccination, and therefore, they are more likely than those without a chronic medical condition to receive a flu vaccine. Not adjusting for confounders can bias the vaccine effectiveness estimate higher or lower than the true estimate. In the example given, the vaccine effectiveness estimate could be biased lower, or towards lower effectiveness. Selection bias Selection bias occurs when people with the outcome being measured by the study (e.g., flu virus infection) differ from people who do not have the outcome in a systematic way. In observational studies of flu vaccine effectiveness, people with and without flu may have different likelihoods of being vaccinated, and this can bias the estimate of vaccine effectiveness. For example, people who visit their health care provider in outpatient settings (e.g., clinics and urgent care) may be more likely to be vaccinated than people who do not go to a provider for care as often. If controls are selected from a different population than the cases (e.g., cases are from a health clinic and controls from a community sample) with different health care seeking behaviors, selection bias related to health care seeking (and the likelihood to be vaccinated) may be introduced. The test-negative study design minimizes selection bias related to health care seeking by enrolling patients who seek care for a respiratory illness. This study design is used by many researchers globally, including CDC-funded networks that measure vaccine effectiveness. Information bias Information bias occurs if exposures or outcomes are based on different sources of information for people with and without the disease of interest. For example, if researchers obtain information on vaccination for children with flu from vaccination records but ask parents of children without flu if the child was vaccinated, this difference in data collection procedures could bias the results of the study.

For this evaluation, we assessed how the outlook's hypothetical scenarios for combined peak hospital burden compared to observed data. We found the outlook provided useful ranges to help inform long-term planning for public health decision-makers and planners. What was our assessment for the 2023-2024 season? Last season, CDC released its first-ever respiratory disease season outlook to provide decision-makers with information to assist in public health preparedness for major respiratory virus illnesses. In our September 2023 assessment, we estimated the 2023-2024 respiratory virus season would likely have a similar number of total hospitalizations as the 2022-2023 season. We also considered peak hospitalization burden and developed two hypothetical scenarios for the combined peak burden of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV: Scenario A: For this scenario, the combined respiratory peak hospitalization rate would be roughly 20% lower than the 2022-2023 peak. We developed the scenario by combining historical disease data for a moderate COVID-19 wave (winter 2022-23) with historical data for a moderate influenza peak (2019-2020) and the RSV rate during the same week in that season (2019-2020). We also shifted the timing of the COVID-19 wave so that the peak would occur three weeks prior to the peak of influenza and RSV hospitalizations, resulting in staggered timing of disease peaks. Scenario B: For this scenario, the combined peak hospitalization rate would be similar to the 2022-2023 season peak, and slightly higher than the peak for COVID-19 alone in winter 2020-2021. We developed the scenario by combining historical disease data for a moderate COVID-19 wave (winter 2022-2023) and historical data for a high-severity influenza peak (2017-2018) and RSV data from the same week in that season (2017-18). We also shifted the timing of the COVID-19 wave so its peak would occur in the same week as influenza and RSV peak hospitalizations, resulting in overlapping disease peaks. While we updated the outlook four times throughout the respiratory season, our overall assessment remained unchanged. Our confidence in this assessment increased as the season progressed. How did our assessment compare to observed data? We note that our long-range outlook was intended to offer potential scenarios for how the season would unfold and was not intended as a prediction or a forecast. However, we compared the outlook to observed data to evaluate how well our assessment captured overall trends, and to consider improvements for future seasonal outlooks. For this evaluation, we assessed how our hypothetical scenarios for combined peak hospital burden compared to combined peak burden using data from the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET)A. RESP-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. Since the combined 2023-2024 hospitalization peak fell between Scenario A and Scenario B, we conclude that our hypothetical scenarios and assessment provided useful ranges to help inform long-term planning for the 2023-2024 season (Figure 1). The season aligned most closely with Scenario B, partly because we observed overlapping peak burden for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV (Figure 2). View Larger Figure 1. Bar plot displaying observed combined hospitalization data for the 2023-2024 respiratory season for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to two hypothetical scenarios outlined in the respiratory season outlook: A) moderate flu and RSV, moderate COVID-19, and staggered timing of weekly hospitalization peaks; B) severe flu and RSV, moderate COVID-19, and overlapping timing of weekly hospitalization peaks for each disease.Show More Below, we outline how the observed 2023-2024 peak hospitalization burden compared to our hypothetical scenarios by disease: COVID-19: The peak hospitalization burden from COVID-19 during the 2023-2024 season was 7.7 weekly hospitalizations per 100,000—lower than the 2022-2023 season rate of 10.9 hospitalizations per 100,000, which we used to define the moderate COVID-19 peak for hypothetical scenario BB. The introduction and predominance of the JN.1 variant likely drove the COVID-19 wave during this period, although the wave was smaller than past winter waves. Influenza: The peak hospitalization burden from influenza during the 2023-2024 season was 9.0 weekly hospitalizations per 100,000—substantially higher than the 2019-20 season rate of 6.0 hospitalizations per 100,000, which we used to define a moderate-severity influenza peak in Scenario A, but lower than the 2017-2018 influenza season peak of 10.2 hospitalizations per 100,000, which we used to define a high-severity influenza peak in Scenario B. RSV: The peak hospitalization burden due to RSV during the 2023-2024 season was 4.2 hospitalizations per 100,000—higher than both the 2019-2020 and the 2017-2018 season rates for Scenarios A and B. View Larger Figure 2. Weekly hospitalizations per 100,000 people by surveillance month for RSV, Influenza, COVID-19, and all three diseases combined for the 2023-2024 respiratory season. Data from RESP-NET. To evaluate our assessment that the 2023-2024 season would have a similar number of total hospitalizations compared to the previous season, we compared the combined 2023-2024 cumulative hospitalization rate for COVID-19, influenza and RSV to that of the 2022-2023 season, using RESP-NET cumulative hospitalization rates. The combined cumulative hospitalization for the 2023-2024 season was 264.3 per 100,000 (week ending 5/04/2024C), 14.2% lower than the rate of 308.1 per 100,000 during the 2022-2023 season (week ending 5/6/2023C). We believe our outlook provided a reasonably accurate assessment for a long-range outlook, given the difference between these rates was under 20%. What does this mean for next season’s outlook? Our first respiratory disease season outlook provided useful ranges to help inform long-term planning for public health decision-makers and planners. We plan to evaluate potential additional activities to help inform the outlook in the coming season, which we are intending to publish in late August.

Data limitations related to active surveillance networks exist, including variability in ascertainment of data year-to-year, underestimation of hospitalization rates due to undertesting and underreporting of cases, differing testing practices across healthcare providers, and differences in diagnostic test sensitivity. Additionally, the most recent data available is preliminary and subject to change; rates are updated as new data is received. For Scenario A, in order to account for staggered timing, we used the hospitalization rate 3 weeks prior to the peak during the 2022-2023 COVID-19 wave, which was 9.4 hospitalizations per 100,000.

This outlook provides decision-makers information to assist with public health preparedness planning. February Update As of Thursday, February 8, 2024 CDC anticipates that total hospitalizations for COVID-19, influenza and RSV will decline but remain elevated into February. We have moderate confidence in this assessment because current levels of emergency department visits for viral respiratory illnesses are stable or decreasing across most areas of the country. However, further increases in one or more viral respiratory diseases are still possible and influenza has recently been increasing in some parts of the country and in some key indicators. Hospitalization rates observed during December 2023 (the highest values observed so far this season) reached levels similar to those observed last season, aligning with scenarios described in the September assessment.1 COVID-19 surveillance data, hospital admission forecasts, and growth estimates indicate that COVID-19 activity remains elevated but has decreased and is likely to continue decreasing into February. We continue to track variants of COVID-19, including the JN.1 variant. The emergence of a COVID-19 variant that causes more severe illnesses could change our assessment. After a few weeks of declining or stable trends, influenza activity is increasing in parts of the country and in some key indicators. Hospital admission forecasts and growth estimates indicate that influenza activity will remain elevated into February. CDC continues to monitor for an additional period of increased influenza activity. RSV activity remains elevated but is decreasing nationally. The national per capita hospitalization rate remains lower than the peak for last season. Other indicators, such as emergency department visits with diagnosed RSV and RSV test positivity, are also decreasing. We do not anticipate producing additional respiratory disease outlooks during the remainder of the 2023-2024 season. We continue to monitor respiratory diseases and will update this outlook should we identify any unusual events, such as significant resurgence of disease. Vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against serious outcomes of these viral respiratory illnesses. Vaccination is especially important for people at increased risk for severe disease, including infants, older adults, pregnant people, and people with certain disabilities or underlying medical conditions. For COVID-19 and influenza, prescription antiviral medications are an important addition to vaccination for people at higher risk of serious illness. These antivirals should be started as early as possible. You can take more actions to protect yourself and others from viral respiratory illnesses. Learn about how to reduce your risk of getting sick from these viruses. Outlook CDC expects the upcoming fall and winter respiratory disease season will likely have a similar number of total hospitalizations compared to last year. As with last year, the number of hospitalizations is expected to be higher than that experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, when severe disease was caused primarily by the influenza virus and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, it remains possible that hospitalizations this season may be higher than last year, with more widespread illness and healthcare system strain. This increase could result from the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant with an increased ability to evade the body’s prior immunity, or from a severe influenza season combined with COVID-19 and RSV waves that are similar to last year, or, as we saw last year, an increase in RSV infections. A key factor is the timing of the peak number of hospitalizations associated with each disease and whether those peaks coincide. This outlook is based on expert judgment, historical data, and scenario modeling for COVID-19. We have low to moderate confidence in this assessment because of uncertainties in anticipating the timing of when diseases will peak and levels of disease. Vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against serious outcomes of these diseases. Vaccination is especially important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications. CDC is offering this outlook to provide decision-makers information to assist with public health preparedness planning, including potential surges in hospital demand. What is the rationale for this outlook for each disease? Infectious disease experts and scenario models provide evidence that this season is likely to bring a moderate COVID-19 wave, causing around as many hospitalizations at the peak as occurred at last winter’s peak. There is widespread, population-level protective immunity to COVID-19 from prior infections and/or vaccinations, making it unlikely that COVID-19 will cause very large waves of severe disease or hospitalization, according to modeling by the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. COVID-19 could peak earlier than last season, however, because of limited summer activity compared to past years. Experts anticipate that the influenza season will fall in the typical range of severity. However, even typical seasons vary widely in the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. Experts do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic—and associated interventions and behavior changes—will continue to have a major impact on influenza transmission, following reduced influenza activity in 2020-2021 and an early peak for the 2022-2023 season. Experts anticipate that RSV is likely to return to normal season patterns following a severe season last year. Last year’s season likely elevated population immunity to typical levels, which had previously been lower because of reduced RSV circulation early in the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also new RSV prevention tools available, which could potentially decrease hospital burden. These include vaccines for those aged 60 years and older and an immunization for infants. What are the key uncertainties? High immunization uptake could reduce the number of hospitalizations substantially.2345 It is difficult to predict the size and timing of peak activity for each disease, as well as how the timing might overlap. These factors will affect the level of strain on the healthcare system. There is also considerable uncertainty about the level of vaccine uptake, particularly for the RSV vaccine for older adults and RSV immunization for infants that are new this season. The COVID-19 pandemic changed patterns for influenza and RSV circulation, and there could be lingering effects on population immunity or behavior that continue to affect influenza or RSV levels this season. Other disease-specific uncertainties include the following: The virus that causes COVID-19 is constantly changing, and a new variant could emerge which is less effectively mitigated by immunity from past infections or from existing vaccines and treatments. COVID-19 has not yet occurred as a regular seasonal disease, so we do not yet fully understand how the timing and magnitude of waves will vary. We do not yet know which influenza viruses will predominate, which can affect the number of severe illnesses and hospitalizations. We also do not yet know how effective vaccines will be against the predominant viruses. Particularly for RSV, we have less precise estimates for the burden of illnesses and hospitalizations data on past seasons to inform expectations for this fall/winter. What are some potential scenarios for the peak hospital demand during the upcoming season? CDC developed two hypothetical scenarios for the peak hospital burden of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. These scenarios illustrate how the additional burden from COVID-19 during a moderate season for the three respiratory diseases may generate more hospital demand – potentially resulting in hospital strain – than a severe influenza and RSV season prior to the emergence of COVID-19 (Figure 1). View Larger Bar plot displaying weekly hospitalization rates for the 2017-2018, 2021-2022, and the 2022-2023 respiratory seasons, and two hypothetical scenarios outlined in the respiratory season outlook. The graph above shows that a moderate influenza and RSV season with a moderate COVID-19 wave (the combined orange bar on the left) could generate more hospital strain than a severe, pre-COVID-19 influenza and RSV season (the light gray bar on the left). While we cannot predict the precise timing and impact of these three pathogens each season, these are two plausible scenarios In scenario A, we combine a moderate past season peak for influenza and RSV equal to 2019-20 with a moderate COVID-19 wave equal to winter 2022-23. We also shift the timing of the COVID-19 wave so that the peak occurs three weeks prior to the peak of influenza + RSV hospitalizations. In this scenario, the peak hospitalization rate is roughly 20% lower than the 2022-2023 peak. The peak is higher than the level for a severe season of influenza and RSV combined, as illustrated by Scenario B. In scenario B, we combine a severe past season peak for influenza and RSV equal to 2017-18 with a moderate COVID-19 wave equal to winter 2022-23. We also shift the timing of the COVID-19 wave so that its peak occurs in the same week as influenza + RSV peak hospitalizations. In this scenario, the peak hospitalization rate is similar to that of the 2022-2023 season and slightly higher than the peak hospitalization rate for COVID-19 alone in the 2020-2021 season. How does the emergence of new COVID-19 variants such as BA.2.86 affect this outlook? At this time, we do not know enough about BA.2.86 to assess its potential impact on the upcoming disease season, though the scenarios outlined here likely account for the emergence of a wide range of variants. CDC is continually monitoring for new variants and studying their potential impact on public health. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC’s current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. At this point, there is no evidence that this variant is causing more severe illness. That assessment may change as additional scientific data are collected. We are monitoring carefully and will update this outlook as we learn more. How will CDC monitor respiratory illnesses this season? CDC has a robust system of domestic and global monitoring and early warning systems, which include tracking data on hospitalizations, emergency department visits, laboratory tests, genomic sequencing, and wastewater testing. CDC is also working to improve real-time analysis and forecasting for these diseases. CDC produces regular influenza forecasts throughout the season. For COVID-19, we are producing regular forecasts and working to improve these predictions through integrating past data on COVID-19 activity to understand seasonal variation in epidemic timing and magnitude. CDC will update this outlook as we learn more about respiratory virus activity this season. Previous Updates See the previous updates of the 2023-2024 Respiratory Disease Season Outlook.

Those are the results of a randomized, controlled trial of the vaccine candidate, administered in nasal spray form in conjunction with the annual shot to a group of 65- to 85-year-olds in 2022. The findings were recently reported in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. Here are the details: A different kind of influenza vaccine The vaccine candidate tested in this study, FluGen’s M2SR, is based on technology developed by UW–Madison researchers Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Gabriele Neumann more than a decade ago. It differs in a few ways from seasonal flu shots, which for decades have provided suboptimal protection against severe disease for vulnerable people: Typical flu vaccines use inactivated influenza virus administered via a shot in muscle tissue, prompting the immune system to create antibodies that can recognize and combat the virus. The candidate vaccine M2SR relies instead on live virus with an essential replication gene deleted from its DNA. The vaccine is administered directly into the upper respiratory system with a nasal spray. The gene deletion means “it can’t continue replicating and make you sick, but it stimulates the immune system just like a natural virus infection,” says Pamuk Bilsel, who led the study as chief scientific officer for FluGen, a spinoff company founded by Kawaoka, Neumann and FluGen CEO Paul Radspinner. A safety study with promising results In 2022, FluGen tested the vaccine candidate among more than 300 people in the United States between the ages of 65 and 85, assessing its safety and the immune response it elicited. Some participants received only the annual flu shot formulated for people in this high-risk age group, while others received only the nasal spray candidate vaccine. A third group received both, and a fourth group received the regular shot and a nasal spray placebo. Participants who received the nasal spray vaccine candidate tolerated it well, with a minority reporting minor side effects including runny nose and nasal congestion. Blood and nasal swab samples taken one day and again 2-4 weeks following vaccination showed that participants who received both the nasal spray vaccine and flu shot had significantly more protective antibodies along with other protective immune responses not seen in participants who received the flu shot alone. Those participants “got not just the antibodies that those normal flu shots give you, but also the local immunity, mucosal immunity and T-cell immunity,” says Bilsel. “It’s a multifaceted, broad spectrum response.” Better protection against annual influenza and possibly pandemics While the study was focused on assessing the vaccine candidate’s safety, data on the immune responses it elicited suggests that vulnerable seniors would be better protected from influenza if they receive both the flu shot and nasal spray vaccine. A more protective immune response possibly offered by administering both vaccines could apply to both seasonal influenza and potential pandemic strains since current vaccines are the first line of defense should a strain like the currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza become widely transmissible in humans. While the vaccine candidate shows promise, larger studies are planned to confirm that it’s safe and provides protection. Those studies will take a couple years to complete. “Older adults deserve better alternatives to prevent infection, illness and hospitalization from influenza and finally we believe we have one,” says Radspinner. “We hope existing manufacturers agree and will be working with them to find ways to make this a reality for patients sooner rather than later.” This research is supported by the Department of Defense (W81XWH2110563).

Accurate prediction of influenza activity is crucial for reducing its impact. Therefore, this study seeks to develop a hybrid Convolution Neural Network—Long Short Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM) model to forecast the percentage of influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate in Hebei Province, China. The aim is to provide more precise guidance for influenza prevention and control measures.MethodsUsing ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in the Hebei Province, spanning from 2010 to 2022, we employed the Python deep learning framework PyTorch to develop the CNN-LSTM model. Additionally, we utilized R and Python to develop four other models commonly used for predicting infectious diseases. After constructing the models, we employed these models to make retrospective predictions, and compared each model’s prediction performance using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and other evaluation metrics.ResultsBased on historical ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in Hebei Province, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Indagate Moving Average (SARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM) models were constructed. On the testing set, all models effectively predicted the ILI% trends. Subsequently, these models were used to forecast over different time spans. Across various forecasting periods, the CNN-LSTM model demonstrated the best predictive performance, followed by the XGBoost model, LSTM model, CNN model, and SARIMA model, which exhibited the least favorable performance.ConclusionThe hybrid CNN-LSTM model had better prediction performances than the SARIMA model, CNN model, LSTM model, and XGBoost model. This hybrid model could provide more accurate influenza activity projections in the Hebei Province. Peer Review reports BackgroundInfluenza (also referred to as the flu) is an acute infectious respiratory disease. It is caused by two major influenza virus types, flu A and flu B. It is highly contagious, with a short incubation period and severe symptoms [1], and has a history of causing global pandemics, such as the Spanish flu in 1918, the Asian flu in 1957, and the swine flu in 2009 [2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are approximately one billion cases of flu reported worldwide each year. Among these cases, 3 to 5 million are classified as severe, with 290,000 to 650,000 resulting in fatalities. Thus, flu seriously endangers individual and public health and is responsible for a great deal of economic burdens [3]. Flu typically manifests as an annual seasonal epidemic or a sporadic pandemic [4, 5], and understanding its activity patterns is crucial for effectively carrying out prevention and control measures. Currently, the primary measure against the flu epidemic is widespread vaccination. However, due to the variability of the flu virus and unexpected outbreaks, vaccines have effectiveness as low as 20% [6, 7]. As a result, analyzing historical surveillance data and making prediction about flu is of great importance.Flu was the first infectious to be monitored by the WHO. The indicators monitored include influenza-like-illness (ILI), flu specimen positivity rates, and reported flu cases. The sensitivity of various indicators varies across regions. In southern China, the positivity rate of flu specimens serves as a better reflection of the flu epidemic situation, whereas in the north, the ILI proves to be more sensitive [8]. Conversely, the reported number of flu cases often lags significantly behind [9].Flu surveillance data can be regarded as time series data. Constructing prediction models using previous data can allow for the creation of public health guidance for future epidemics. Traditional prediction models like logistic regression models, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Indagate Moving Average (SARIMA) models, have been utilized for predicting various contagious diseases such as hand, foot, and mouth disease [10], tuberculosis [11], and COVID-19 [12], and have demonstrated good prediction performance. Additionally, various deep learning methods including the Recursive Neural Network (RNN), the Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and the RNN-based improved Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM) have been applied across numerous domains. For instance, CNNs are used to detect anomalies in circuit signals [13], while LSTMs are utilized for predicting stock prices [14], weather patterns [15], and the number of cases [16]. In comparison to traditional prediction models, these methods have stronger nonlinear mapping and sequence information extraction capabilities [17]. In addition, different neural networks possess varying information processing capabilities; CNNs excel in information extraction, while LSTMs are more suitable for processing long sequence prediction tasks. Combining the strengths of these different models may enhance prediction performance.Hebei Province, which is situated in northern China, typically experiences concentrated influenza activity during the winter and spring seasons [18]. In recent years, the number of reported flu cases during the flu season in Hebei Province has been increasing [19]. It is crucial to utilize surveillance data for predicting peak outbreaks in advance to effectively prevent and control flu in the region. However, there are few studies on flu prediction models, with most focusing on several sentinel hospitals in urban areas. Furthermore, these studies predominantly rely on traditional prediction models such as ARIMA and multiple regression models [20, 21]. However, compared to machine learning and deep learning models in other studies, their predictive results are not very good. Thus, there is a significant gap in the development of accurate and representative flu prediction models specifically tailored for Hebei Province. Here, we gathered ILI data reported by 28 sentinel hospitals across 11 cities in Hebei Province. We then developed a hybrid CNN-LSTM model (which leveraged the distinct advantages of both the CNN and LSTM architectures) on the PyTorch platform. Finally, due to the SARIMA and XGBoost models are frequently employed in time series forecasting and characterized by high accuracy. We chose the SARIMA model and the XGBoost model as the baseline models, and compared the predictive efficacy of our hybrid model to the SARIMA, XGBoost, CNN, and LSTM models using retrospective forecasting.MethodsFigure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of our research methodology, including the materials and methods used to develop the SARIMA, XGBoost, CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models Forecasting Model for ILI fluctuation in the Hebei Province of China.Fig. 1Study methodologyFull size imageData acquisition and splittingData were retrieved from the China Influenza Surveillance Information System, which gathers weekly reported ILI cases and related outpatient/emergency department visits from 28 national sentinel hospitals in the Hebei Province. Our data covered the period from the first week of 2010 to the 52nd week of 2022. Due to variations in the sizes of sentinel hospitals and the population bases of different areas, calculating the ILI percentage helps to minimize these factors [22]. ILI% were calculated based on ILI cases and visit data using the following formula:$$ILI\%=\frac{number of ILIs}{total number of outpatient/emergency visits}\times 100\%.$$We then split the dataset using an 80–20 ratio, with the initial 80% used as a training set and the remaining 20% used as a testing set for predicted results.Traditional modelsSARIMA modelSARIMA models consist of four components: autoregression (AR), integration (I), moving average (MA), and seasonal effects (S) [23]. SARIMAs can be classified as either multiplicative or additive models, depending on the relationship between seasonal effects and other components. In a multiplicative model, the expression is SARIMA \((p,d,q){(P,D,Q)}_{s}\), where \(p\) and \(P\) represent the orders of ordinary AR and seasonal AR, respectively; \(d\) and \(D\) represent the orders and the steps and orders of the difference function; \(q\) and \(Q\) represent the ordinary orders of MA and seasonal MA individually; and \(S\) represents the seasonal period. The SARIMA calculation formula was as follows [24]:$$\begin{array}{c}\phi_p(B)\Phi_P(B^S){(1-B)}^d{(1-B^S)}^Dy_t=\theta_q(B)\Theta_Q(B^S)u_t,\\\phi(B)=1-\phi_1(B)-\phi_2{(B)}^2-......-\phi_p{(B)}^p,\\\Phi\left(B^S\right)=1-\Phi_1\left(B\right)^S-\Phi_2\left(B\right)^{2S}-......-\Phi_P\left(B\right)^{PS},\\\theta(B)=1-\theta(B)-\theta_2{(B)}^2-......-\theta_q{(B)}^q,\\\Theta(B^S)=1-\Theta{(B)}^S-\Theta_2\left(B\right)^{2S}-......-\Theta_Q\left(B\right)^{QS},\\E\left(u_t\right)=0,Var\left(u_t\right)=\sigma^2,\\E\left({\mathrm u}_{\mathrm t},{\mathrm u}_{\mathrm S}\right)=0,S\neq t,E\left(y_s,u_t\right)=0,\forall_S< t_{\circ} \\\end{array}$$In this formula, \(B\) is the lagging operator, \(\phi\) and \(\theta\) are the ordinary AR and MA coefficients, \(\Phi\) and \(\Theta\) are the seasonal AR and MA coefficients, \(s\) is the seasonal period, \({y}_{t}\) is a zero-mean steady random time series, and \({u}_{t}\) is a white noise sequence.The SARIMA modeling process involves several key steps includes time series preprocessing, stationarity testing, parameter identification, and model fitting [25]. The initial data processing step includes conducting an augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and a white noise sequence test (Box-Ljung test) to determine whether the data represent a stationary and non-white noise sequence. If the data are non-stationary, differencing is necessary to achieve stationarity. The values of \(d\) and \(D\) are defined by the number and order of the differencing steps.Next is the model identification phase, which involves examining the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Within these plots, the AR can be identified in a significant autocorrelation at lag (\(p\)) in the PACF, and the MA can be identified in significant autocorrelation at lag (\(q\)) in the ACF. The parameters \(P\) and \(Q\) correspond to the determination of \(p\) and \(q\). Finally, seasonal patterns are recognized as periodic spikes which appear at multiples of the seasonal lag (\(S\)). These steps help systematically determine the appropriate parameters for constructing SARIMA models.XGboost modelXGBoost is a boosting algorithm proposed by Chen Tianqi et al. in 2016 [26]. Based on the gradient boosting framework, it sequentially trains multiple weak classifiers, minimizes the loss function through gradient descent, and continuously enhances the model’s predictive ability. Figure 2 illustrates the basic structure of the XGBoost model. Initially, input features are constructed using the hysteresis method, and a simple prediction model is initialized. Subsequently, the model calculates the error between its predictions and the training set, adjusts parameters based on this error, and constructs a new model. This iterative process constructs multiple models sequentially, gradually improving the performance of a single model. Finally, all models are integrated and weighted according to their contribution to the overall prediction effect, resulting in the final XGBoost model.Fig. 2Architecture of the extreme gradient boostingFull size imageDeep learning modelsData pre-processingIn neural network models, training process, large differences in data scales can lead to excessively large or small gradient updates. Additionally, outliers in the data may cause certain features to dominate others. Normalization ensures that all features are on a similar scale, reduces the impact of outliers, and enhances the model’s convergence speed and generalization ability [27]. Here, original data were normalized with the formula provided below:$$X=\frac{x-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}$$where the \(X\) is the normalized value of the data, the \(x\) is the original data, and \({x}_{max}\) and \({x}_{min}\) are their maximum and minimum values, respectively.Furthermore, the input data for these models needed to contain both inputs (X) and outputs (Y), and needed to be reconstructed into 3D tensors format (samples, timesteps, features). Given that the ILI% data were a one-dimensional dataset of length n, a sliding-window approach was employed (Fig. 3). Observations of the current k time points consisted of the input data X, and observations of the current time points consisted of the output data Y. We then used the Numpy library in Python to convert data into an (n, n-k, 1) format.Fig. 3Sliding window method to generate inputs (X) and outputs (Y)Full size imageCNN modelCNN models have superior capabilities in extracting local features [28]. They can be employed in computer vision and time series prediction and analysis [29]. CNN models consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, and dense layers (Fig. 4). For our time series data, 1D kernels were used to slide across the data (x) and compute dot products between the kernel and local data at each step, eventually generating feature maps. We then used max pooling on feature maps to reduce dimensions while retaining important features. After adding non-linearity to pooled data using a tanh function, data were input into the dense layer and produced a CNN model using the following formula:$$\begin{array}{c}X=(x\ast w)+b_i\\X_c=max\left(X_{i:i+k-1}\right)\\y=W\ast X_c+b_j\end{array}$$where \((x * w)\) denotes the convolution operation, \(b\) is a bias term \({X}_{i:i+k-1}\) is a set of consecutive elements in the input feature sequence, \(max( )\) is a maximum extraction operation, \(W\) is a weight matrix, and \(*\) is a matrix multiplication operation.Fig. 4Architecture of the convolutional neural networkFull size imageLSTM modelLSTM models are improved neural networks based on RNN [30]. They have a similar structure to RNN, but enhanced memory units (Figs. 5 and 6) [31]. By introducing gate control mechanisms, LSTM models address the long-period dependency problems and the gradient vanishing and exploding issues that are present in RNN models. Our LSTM memory units consisted of input (I), forget (F), and output (O) gates, where the F gate decided the discording and preserving of information, the I gate decided what new information to store in the cell state, and the O gate decided what the next hidden state should be. The calculated LSTM formula was as follows [32]:$$\begin{aligned}\left\{\begin{array}{ll}cf_t&=\sigma\left(W_f\cdot\left[h_{t-1},x_t\right]+b_f\right)\\i_t&=\sigma\left(W_i\cdot\left[h_{t-1},x_t\right]+b_i\right)\\{\widetilde C}_t&=tan h\left(W_C\cdot\left[h_{t-1},x_t\right]+b_C\right)\\C_t&=f_t\ast C_{t-1}+i_t\ast{\widetilde C}_t\\o_t&=\sigma\left(W_o\cdot\left[h_{t-1},x_t\right]+b_o\right)\\h_t&=o_t\ast tan h\left(C_t\right)\end{array}\right.\end{aligned}$$where \({W}_{C}\) is the weight matrix, and \(b\) is the bias term.Fig. 5Neural units of the recursive neural networkFull size imageFig. 6Memory cells of the long-short term memory neural networkFull size imageThe F gate takes the previous hidden state \({h}_{t-1}\) and current input \({{\varvec{x}}}_{{\varvec{t}}}\) as input, passes a sigmoid activation function, and outputs\({f}_{t}\). In the I gate, the σ layer outputs \({i}_{t}\) and the tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values\({\widetilde{{\varvec{C}}}}_{t}\), and the cell state \({C}_{t}\) vector is updated by combining\({f}_{t}\),\({i}_{t}\), and\({\widetilde{{\varvec{C}}}}_{t}\). Finally, in the O gate, It filters the input information by passing it through the σ layer with the output \({o}_{t}\),and\({o}_{t}\), along with the \({C}_{t}\) that has been operated on by tanh layer, completes the update of\({h}_{t+1}\).CNN-LSTM modelOur novel hybrid CNN-LSTM model combined the local feature extraction capability of CNN models and the long-term dependency resolution of LSTM models [33, 34]. Figure 7 visualizes the architecture of our CNN-LSTM model, which was composed of convolutional layers, pooling layers, LSTM layers, the tanh activation function, and a dense layer. The convolutional layers were encoders that used 1D kernels to extract features from the original data and convert them into feature maps. The pooling layer selected and reduced the dimensions of the feature maps, which were then decoded by the LSTM layers and fed into the dense layer to get the model output. This process generated the following formula:Fig. 7Hybrid model frameworkFull size imageModel construction and validationThe SARIMA model was constructed using the “forecast” package based on R 4.2.3. The XGBoost model was constructed using the “xgboost” and “sklearn” libraries in Python 3.9. Additionally, the CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models were developed using the PyTorch 2.2.1 deep learning framework based on Python 3.9.After the models were constructed, they need to be validated and their parameters determined. For the SARIMA model, the prediction performance varies based on different parameter combinations. By analyzing the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot and the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plot, appropriate values of p, q, P, and Q can be identified. Typically, these values do not exceed 2. Therefore, we can construct multiple alternative models using an exhaustive method to find the best fit. Subsequently, the residuals of the model undergo a Box-Ljung test to identify outliers and assess the distribution. Finally, the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value is selected as the optimal model.For models such as XGBoost, CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models, their performance is also influenced by hyperparameters. During the model training phase, the first step involves determining the range of hyperparameters using the training set. Next, the training set is randomly divided into k subsets using the K-fold cross-validation method, where k-1 subsets are used for training and the remaining subset is used for validation. The grid search method iterates through various hyperparameter combinations, training a model on each subset, and calculating the average loss across all k subsets. Finally, the hyperparameter set that yields the smallest average loss is chosen to build the best-performing model.Comparison of model predictive effectsAfter the models are constructed and validated, the testing set is used to make retrospective predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (\({R}^{2}\)), correlation coefficient (r), and explained variance (Evar) were calculated to evaluate the predictive performance of each model against the true values. The formulas used for calculation were as follows:$$\begin{array}{c}MAE=\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\left|x_i-{\widehat x}_i\right|\\RMSE=\sqrt{\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\left(x_i-{\widehat x}_i\right)^2}\\MAPE=\frac{100\%}N\sum_{i=1}^N\left|\frac{x_i-{\widehat x}_i}{x_i}\right|\\R^2=1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i-{\widehat x}_i)}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i-\overline x)}^2}\\r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{((x_i-\overline x)-(y_i-\overline y))}^2}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i-\overline x)}^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N{(y_i-\overline y)}^2}}\\Evar=1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\left(\left(x_i-{\widehat x}_i\right)-E\left(\overline x-{\widehat x}_i\right)\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N\left(x_i-\overline x\right)^2}\end{array}$$where \({x}_{i}\) represents the true value at time \(i\), \({\widehat{x}}_{i}\) is the predicted value of the model at time \(i\), \(N\) is the sample size at the time of testing, and \(\overline{x }\) is the mean value of the sequence \(x\).ResultsTemporal distribution of ILI%The fluctuation in ILI and ILI% in Hebei Province between 2010 and 2022 are demonstrated in Figs. 8 and 9. The changes in both are essentially identical. From 2010 to 2019, the seasonal distribution of ILI% showed a unimodal pattern, with the peak of the epidemic in the winter and spring of each year, starting from the 40th week of the first year and continuing to the 15th week of the following year. Between 2020 and 2022, in addition to the peak of the epidemic in winter and spring, there was a small ILI% peak in the spring and summer. Between 2017 and 2019, the ILI% prevalence peak increased year over year, returned to fluctuating levels between 2020 and 2021, and reached a new peak at the end of 2022.Fig. 8ILI and ILI% activity from 2010 to 2022Full size imageFig. 9Annual changes in ILI and ILI% from 2010 to 2022Full size imageData partitioningOur 2010 to 2022 data spanned 676 weeks. We thus segmented it in the 21st week of 2020 to represent an 80–20 split. The initial 80% of the data, or 540 weeks, was used as the training set, and the remaining 20%, or 136 weeks, was used as the test set. Results are shown in Fig. 10.Fig. 10Data division into training and testing setsFull size imageSARIMA modelPrevious research suggests that ILI has a noticeable seasonality Fig. 7. Specifically, ILI exhibits a seasonal cycle of 52. ADF testing of the training dataset revealed a lack of sequence stationarity. However, after applying first-order seasonal differencing, the sequence became stationary and passed both the ADF and white noise tests. Thus, data were successfully transformed into a stationary white noise sequence suitable for the development of the SARIMA model (Table 1). Table 1 Sequence stationary and white noise test resultsFull size tableAfter determining the values of \(d\) and \(D\) through the previously-mentioned differencing operation, we initially determined the values of \(p\), \(P\), \(q\), and \(Q\) by examining the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced series (Fig. 11). Various alternative models were constructed by combining different parameters (Table 2). The best model of those that passed the parameter tests, selected following the principle of minimizing AIC, was the SARIMA (2, 0, 2) (1, 1, 1)52 model. Residual testing showed that residuals at different lag orders exhibited white noise sequences, indicating effective use of sequence information (Fig. 12).Fig. 11Sequence’ autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation functionFull size image Table 2 Alternative model parameters and test resultsFull size tableFig. 12SARIMA model residual test resultsFull size imageXGBoost modelThe construction process of an XGBoost model can be divided into three parts: feature engineering, model construction, and model validation. Since the ILI% data is one-dimensional, we use the current value as the output and construct input features by lagging one seasonal period (52 weeks) before building the XGBoost model. During the model building phase, we utilize the XGBRegressor class to establish a gradient boosted tree regression model with mean squared error as the loss function.The alternative hyperparameters for the XGBoost model include the maximum depth of the tree (3, 5, or 7), the learning rate (0.01, 0.1, or 0.2), the number of decision trees (100, 200, or 300), and the proportion of subsamples (0.7, 0.8, or 0.9). Through fivefold cross-validation using the grid search method provided by the sklearn library, we determined the optimal combination of hyperparameters: maximum tree depth of 7, learning rate of 0.2, 200 trees, and subsample proportion of 0.7, yielding a minimum average error of 0.1173. The results are shown in Fig. 13. Finally, we built an XGBoost model based on the best hyperparameters described above.Fig. 13XGBoost’s losses for different combinations of hyperparametersFull size imageCNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM modelsThe ILI% period of 52 led us to select a time step of 52 for data reconstruction using the sliding window method. Following reconstruction, the training set had a data shape of (488, 52, 1) and the test set had a data shape of (84, 1).The development process of neural network models involved into three parts: model definition, validation, and training. During the models definition phase, we defined the model structures and forward propagation modules based on the PyTorch platform. Specifically, the CNN model includes convolutional layer and pooling layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layer with the ReLU activation function. The LSTM model consists of LSTM layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layer. The CNN-LSTM model combined aspects from both the CNN and LSTM models by incorporating convolutional layer, LSTM layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layer. In the forward propagation modules: For the CNN model, the tensor input passes through the convolutional and pooling layers, followed by activation functions and dropout layers, culminating in the fully connected layer to produce the output. The LSTM model generates output through its LSTM layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layer. The CNN-LSTM model processes the feature map through a convolutional layer, LSTM layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layer to obtain the final output.In the model validation phase, alternative hyperparameters for the CNN model include the number of convolutional layers (1 or 2), convolution kernel size (3 or 5), number of pooling layers (1 or 2), learning rate (0.01 or 0.001), and batch size (16, 32, or 64). For the LSTM model and CNN-LSTM model, hyperparameters include the number of LSTM layers (1, 2, or 3), number of hidden units (16, 32, or 64), learning rate (0.01 or 0.001), and batch size (32, 64, or 128). After fivefold cross-validation using the grid search method, optimal hyperparameter combinations were determined: The CNN model consisted of 2 convolutional layers with a kernel size of 5 and 1 pooling layer, using a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 16, achieving a minimum average loss of 0.0038. The LSTM model included 2 LSTM layers with 64 hidden units, a learning rate of 0.01, and a batch size of 128, achieving a minimum average loss of 0.0031. Additionally, the CNN-LSTM model featured 1 LSTM layer with 16 hidden units, a learning rate of 0.001, and a batch size of 32, achieving a minimum average loss of 0.0021. These results are illustrated in Fig. 14. Finally, three models were constructed using the best combination of hyperparameters.Fig. 14Losses of distinct hyperparameter combinations in three modelsFull size imageIn the model training phase, which includes backward propagation and iterative training. MSE served as the loss assessment metric and Adam as the optimizer. After 200 training epochs, the losses converged: CNN model loss was 0.0005, LSTM model loss was 0.0010, and CNN-LSTM model loss was 0.0014. The training loss of three models are shown in Fig. 15.Fig. 15Change in training loss over 200 epochs of the three modelsFull size imageComparison and analysis of modelsAfter constructing the models, we utilized the aforementioned five models to make retrospective predictions (Fig. 16) and compared them with the test set to calculate MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R2, r, and Evar. The SARIMA model was used to forecast ILI% over a span of 136 weeks starting from week 21 in 2020. The XGBoost model predicts 84 weeks based on the constructed input features (starting from week 21 in 2021). And the neural network models were used to generate forecasts for the subsequent 84 weeks (starting from week 21 in 2021) via test inputs created by the sliding-window method. All the models demonstrated improved prediction accuracy with regard to ILI% tendencies. We evaluated the models’ predictive performance using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R2, r, and Evar, with specific results detailed in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6. On the testing set, the SARIMA model had the highest MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, indicating relatively poor prediction performance in terms of R2, r, and Evar. Conversely, the CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, and CNN-LSTM models showed smaller prediction errors and higher R2, r, and Evar. Among these models, prediction errors ranked from largest to smallest as CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, and CNN-LSTM, while R2, r, and Evar followed as CNN, XGBoost, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, respectively. Overall, CNNs demonstrated the weakest forecasting performance, whereas CNN-LSTM showed the most accurate predictions. Across the entire testing set, compared to the SARIMA model, the CNN-LSTM model exhibited reductions in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE by 0.4388, 0.3548, and 27.2063%, respectively, resulting in corresponding accuracy improvements of 49.21%, 25.47%, and 65%. When compared with the XGBoost model, these reductions were 0.0300, 0.0319, and 0.5149%, respectively, with corresponding improvements of 6.21%, 2.98%, and 3%, respectively. The specific results are shown in Table 3.Fig. 16Comparison of forecasting results from all four five modelsFull size imageTable 3 Mean Absolute Errors across different modelsFull size tableTable 4 Root Mean Squared Errors across different modelsFull size tableTable 5 Mean Squared Percentage Errors across different modelsFull size tableTable 6 Other metrics across different modelsFull size tableWe used five models for predictions over the next 4 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks, and calculated prediction errors, R2, r, and Evar. These specific results of these are shown in Table 7. As prediction length increased, so did prediction errors for all models (Fig. 17). At each prediction interval, the SARIMA model consistently showed the largest prediction error, accompanied by lower R2, r, and Evar. In predictions for the next 4 weeks, the XGBoost model exhibited the smallest prediction error, followed by CNN and LSTM, with CNN-LSTM showing the largest error. Over 26 weeks, CNN-LSTM had the smallest error, followed by XGBoost and LSTM, while CNN had the largest error. Looking ahead to 52 weeks, CNN-LSTM maintained the smallest error, followed by XGBoost and LSTM, with CNN demonstrating the largest error. It’s important to note that R2, r, and Evar are influenced by sample size, with these metrics generally showing an initial increase followed by a decrease across different prediction periods for the five models. For instance, in predictions over the next 4 weeks, the XGBoost model showed the highest r and Evar values, followed by LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN, while LSTM exhibited the highest R-squared, followed by XGBoost and CNN-LSTM, and CNN showed the lowest values. Over 26 weeks, CNN-LSTM had the highest scores across all three metrics, followed by XGBoost, with CNN and LSTM close behind. Over 52 weeks, LSTM had the highest r, with CNN-LSTM and XGBoost close, while CNN-LSTM showed the highest R2 and Evar values, followed by XGBoost and LSTM, with CNN recording the lowest scores.Fig. 17Comparison of the evaluation metrics of the five models at different prediction scalesFull size imageTable 7 Evaluation metrics of five models in different prediction scalesFull size tableDiscussionILI surveillance is crucial for flu prevention and control efforts. By tracking ILI cases and using historical data to construct predictive models, deeper understandings of ILI fluctuation patterns can be obtained. These understandings allow for the implementation of proactive measures to reduce the impact of flu. In this study, we utilized historical ILI% data spanning from 2010 to 2023 to develop a CNN-LSTM hybrid model for retrospective forecasting. We examined and compared its predictive with the SARIMA model, XGBoost model, and standalone neural network models. The study revealed that all five models effectively captured the trend in ILI% changes and demonstrated strong predictive capabilities. Upon further analysis across varying forecast horizons, the CNN-LSTM model exhibited the highest forecasting accuracy, followed by the XGBoost model, LSTM model, and CNN model, with the SARIMA model performing the least accurately.The SARIMA model is a widely used time series forecasting model that extrapolated future outcomes by integrating autocorrelation and moving average error results. Unlike the XGBoost and neural network models, SARIMA models do not rely on input features and may offer superior forecasting ability for stationary time series. However, SARIMA models’ predictive capabilities diminish when forecasting over long-term horizons. In Qiang Mao’s study, SARIMA effectively predicted tuberculosis incidence in China for short-term forecasts but showed declining accuracy with longer prediction horizons [11]. Which have demonstrated SARIMA’s superior accuracy in short-term prediction tasks. In our comparative study, SARIMA demonstrated poorer predictive capability too. In contrast, neural network models have no specific data requirements and have robust nonlinear mapping capabilities, enabling them to leverage more information for prediction [17]. This disparity underscores why the neural network models in our study had superior prediction accuracy compared to our SARIMA model. Research by S. Siami-Namini et al. indicates that SARIMA’s structure, built on data autocorrelation and dependence, suits linear data prediction better than the other models examined [35]. SARIMA’s performance on nonlinear data is inferior to that of machine learning and deep learning models, which aligns with our findings.The XGBoost model is a highly popular machine learning technique renowned for its exceptional accuracy and robust generalization in sequence prediction. Utilizing an ensemble learning algorithm, XGBoost integrates multiple decision tree models through gradient boosting, continuously optimizing split points and leaf node divisions to minimize the loss function and enhance model performance. In our study, we employed the XGBoost model to forecast the test set across various time intervals, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities. Among the five models evaluated, XGBoost outperformed the LSTM, CNN, and SARIMA models, though it slightly lagged behind the CNN-LSTM hybrid model in accuracy. In research by Zheng-gang Fang et al., the XGBoost model effectively predicted Covid-19 case numbers in the United States and surpassed the ARIMA model in predictive accuracy, corroborating our findings [36]. Conversely, Junling Luo et al. found that the LSTM model exhibited superior accuracy over XGBoost in predicting Covid-19 cases in Canada [37]. In our study, while the LSTM model’s prediction accuracy was slightly lower than XGBoost’s, this difference may stem from our use of historical ILI% data exclusively for prediction. Notably, the CNN-LSTM model’s predictive efficacy surpassed that of XGBoost in our study, suggesting that combining CNN and LSTM techniques holds promise for improving prediction performance.CNN and LSTM are both deep learning models with distinct applications. CNN is commonly used in image and speech recognition, whereas LSTM excels in analyzing long time series data. Each model has unique advantages: CNN effectively learns sequence dynamics by extracting local patterns, while LSTM addresses long-term dependency issues using gate mechanisms within its memory units. The CNN-LSTM hybrid model combines these strengths and finds extensive use in fields such as finance and yield forecasting. In our study, CNN-LSTM was applied to forecast flu activity, outperforming individual models and ranking highest among the four models compared. In Muhammad, L. J et al.’s research, CNN-LSTM successfully predicted Covid-19 case numbers in South Africa and Botswana, achieving commendable accuracy [33]. Similarly, studies by Zhang, J et al. and Rui Yan et al. utilized CNN-LSTM to forecast air quality in Beijing, China, comparing it with CNN and LSTM models. Their findings consistently demonstrated CNN-LSTM’s superior predictive performance [38, 39]. Notably, Rui Yan et al. also employed CNN-LSTM for multi-period prediction, aligning closely with our study’s results.limitationsFlu activity is influenced by various factors, including population immunity, conditions of transmission, and viral variability. In the retrospective projections of this study, the prediction accuracy of the five models declined to varying degrees during 2021 and 2022. This decline possibly due to the stringent preventative measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Hu CY’s study, many provinces and cities in China adopted preventive measures such as mask-wearing, closure of large public venues, and prohibition of large gatherings to control COVID-19. As COVID-19 spreads similarly to flu, activities related to flu and other respiratory infections were disrupted [40], and COVID-19 has similar clinical symptoms to influenza, and many COVID-19 patients go to the hospital to see an increase in the number of ILIs [41]. These will lead to significant bias in predictions. For future studies, data processing methods like singular spectrum analysis or one-hot encoding should be considered to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 prevention measures [42, 43].In additional, since meteorological data such as meteorological data in the study area are not publicly available. Our study solely utilized ILI% data from 28 flu sentinel hospitals in Hebei Province. Although optimal hyperparameters were employed in model construction, the dimensions of the input features could potentially impact prediction results. In Athanasiou et al.’s study, multi-source data including monitoring, meteorological data, and Twitter search data were integrated, yielding excellent prediction outcomes [44]. This suggests that incorporating more diverse and relevant data into models can enhance prediction accuracy. Future studies should consider leveraging multi-source data to improve overall model performance.In infectious disease modeling, both linear and nonlinear relationships often coexist. Prediction methods for infectious diseases include linear models, machine learning models, and deep learning models, the latter of which possess strong nonlinear extraction capabilities. Although our study only utilized the combined advantages of CNN and LSTM to construct the CNN-LSTM model, there may be limitations in its ability to extract linear relationships. In Yiran Wan’s prediction study on hand, foot, and mouth disease in Chongqing, China, the SARIMA-EEMD-LSTM model was employed, demonstrating higher prediction performance compared to single models [45]. This suggests that integrating different types of models could be beneficial for our future work.Finally, it is crucial to provide a reasonable estimate of uncertainty in forecasting. As mentioned earlier, influenza incidence is influenced by many factors, and the predictive accuracy of the model can vary with changes in these uncertainties during actual predictions. It is essential to assess a reasonable confidence interval to model’s predictive results. In a study by Morris, Michael et al., they utilized various neural network models to predict influenza activity and employed Gaussian distribution to estimate prediction result intervals, enhancing the realism and effectiveness of their predictions [46]. In our study, we did not adequately estimate the prediction uncertainty interval. Future research should address this by employing appropriate methods to estimate uncertainty factors, thereby incorporating confidence intervals into the model’s prediction results to enhance effectiveness.ConclusionsSeasonal flu epidemics impose a significant disease burden, emphasizing the need for scientifically accurate predictive models to facilitate early intervention. Our study developed a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to forecast the activation of flu in Hebei Province. We compared the predictive performance of the hybrid model against the SARIMA model, XGBoost model, CNN model, and LSTM model. Our analysis revealed that while all models effectively predicted ILI activity trends, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model demonstrated superior prediction accuracy compared to the others. These findings not only enhance the precision of flu prediction in Hebei Province but also demonstrate the efficacy of hybrid models in specific forecasting tasks. By providing timely scientific guidance before the flu season, proactive measures can be planned and implemented for prevention and control in Hebei Province. These findings not only enhance the precision of flu prediction in Hebei Province but also highlight the efficacy o f hybrid model in specific predictive tasks. By providing timely scientific guidance before the flu season, proactive measures can be planned and implemented for prevention and control in Hebei Province.

Study: Evaluation of a novel intramuscular prime/intranasal boost vaccination strategy against influenza in the pig model. Image Credit: ezps / Shutterstock.com Live-attenuated influenza vaccines against the influenza virus LAIVs induce a local immune response directed against several viral antigens. Hemagglutinin (HA), a specific type of immunoglobulin A (IgA) secreted into the respiratory tract, can block the virus at its point of entry and prevent its spread. Unlike traditional influenza vaccines, LAIVs do not require an adjuvant and provide immunity for longer durations. However, a key challenge regarding LAIV development is adequate replicative capacity, which could lead to over-attenuation of the virus, which subsequently prevents the ability to generate a sustained immune response. Comparatively, an insufficiently attenuated vaccine could lead to viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract, thereby increasing the risk of the emergence of more virulent viruses. Thus, finding an appropriate balance between achieving sufficient immunogenicity while ensuring the safety of this vaccination approach is crucial. About this study To date, several LAIVs have been developed. For example, LAIVs based on cold-adapted viruses are recommended for individuals between the ages of two and 49. Other LAIV strategies utilize the recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) with a modified non-structural 1 (NS1) protein. Previously, the authors of the current study developed the recombinant LAIV candidate NS1(1–126), which encoded a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein and combined it with a mutation in the PA gene (NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX). This modification of the PA gene, which prevented PA-X protein expression, enhanced the safety profile of the NS1(1–126) LAIV candidate. Recombinant viruses are associated with reduced apoptotic cell death, attenuated viral replication, and improved innate immune response induction in a porcine bronchiolar epithelial cell line. The present study aims to assess the efficacy of these LAIV candidates using an in vivo pig model. In the first animal study, 15 healthy 10-week-old pigs were assigned to three groups that were intranasally infected with wild-type pH1N1/09, pH1N1/09-NS1(1–126), or VSV-Luc as control. The second experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a novel prime/boost immunization protocol. To this end, 25 healthy 10-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) were initially primed intramuscularly with VSV-H1 or the control VSV-Luc and subsequently boosted with nasal immunization of NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX or NS1(1-126) ΔPAX LAIV. Study findings NS1(1-126) infection led to viral excretion at significantly lower levels and reduced pH1N1/09-specific antibody levels as compared to wild-type infection. However, virus-specific IgG levels remained similarly high in bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in both NS1(1-126) and wild-type infected pigs. Animals that were initially primed with the control vector VSV-Luc and subsequently immunized with NS1-(1-126) ΔPAX exhibited reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding, whereas no viral shedding was observed in pigs initially primed with VSV-H1 and subsequently boosted with NS1(1-126) ΔPAX after six days. Serum IgG and IgA levels were not detected following primary immunization with VSV-H1; however, a strong antibody response was observed after boosting with NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX or NS1(1–126) LAIV. Whereas serum IgA levels peaked at two weeks, followed by a sharp decline, serum IgG levels plateaued two weeks following booster immunization and decreased slowly thereafter. Primary vaccination with VSV-H1 did not produce a high level of virus-neutralizing antibodies. However, boosting with NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX or NS1(1–126) LAIV led to a significant increase in virus-neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T-cells. CD4+ T-cells expressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon γ (IFNγ), independently and together, but not interleukin 17 (IL-17). These effects were absent in pigs that were immunized with the control VSV-Luc and subsequently boosted with NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX. Following their booster vaccination, pigs were intranasally inoculated with pH1N1/09 to determine the efficacy of this vaccination protocol against infection. To this end, no viral RNA was identified in nasal samples obtained from VSV-H1/NS1(1-126) ΔPAX, VSV-H1/NS1(1-126), and VSV-Luc/NS1(1-126)- ΔPAX groups. Conclusions The study findings suggest that the proposed vaccine protocol induced systemic IAV-specific immunity in terms of enhanced memory Th1 cells, IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers. Primary vaccination with VSV-H1 and subsequent boosting with NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX LAIV augmented the safety by significantly reducing LAIV shedding and altogether preventing challenge virus shedding. The novel prime/boost vaccination protocol established in this study will likely support the future development of next-generation vaccination strategies to manage seasonal influenza epidemics more effectively. The mucosal immunity generated by this approach can potentially improve herd immunity, mitigate the spread of IAV, and potentially control future IAV epidemics, as this strategy can be easily adapted and timed to emerging IAV subtypes.

The state’s new avian influenza website is keeping tabs on the spread of bird flu. The risk is low for humans, but it’s dangerous for poultry flocks. ByDavid MatthauAugust 17, 2024 Listen 1:03 FILE - This 2005 electron microscope image shows an avian influenza A H5N1 virion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, announced it will spend $5 million to buy seasonal flu shots for livestock workers. (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP, File) From Camden and Cherry Hill to Trenton and the Jersey Shore, what about life in New Jersey do you want WHYY News to cover? Let us know. The New Jersey Departments of Agriculture, Health and Environmental Protection launched an Avian Influenza website earlier this month that displays up-to-date information on prevention and response to the H5N1 virus. “As we prepare for the fall migration of wildlife from north to south, we wanted to have a landing page for people to find relevant information related to how it’s moving through the area,” said Ed Wengryn, Secretary of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. There has not been a single case detected in New Jersey. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor What is Avian Influenza or H5N1 virus? Bird flu began to spread in North America three years ago. Wild birds worldwide are carriers of the virus. The virus created havoc among domesticated poultry and dairy cows in some states. Dairy workers have also been infected. The Center for Disease Control says the current risk to humans is low, but it is monitoring for exposure among people. Here is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s resource for Bird Flu Current Situation. Symptoms in birds and dairy animals Officials say bird flu infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and is often fatal to avian populations. The virus can also infect dairy cows. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, cows infected with the virus may experience a sudden decrease in appetite and their milk production levels will drop, sometimes dramatically. They may also have respiratory issues and clear nasal discharge. Threat to Humans? New Jersey state epidemiologist Dr. Tina Tan said officials are carefully monitoring the situation but “the risk to humans right now, to people, the general risk is very low.” She said humans infected with H5N1 experience typical flu-like respiratory symptoms. Some people may also develop conjunctivitis. Who is most likely to be affected? Wengryn said avian influenza can pose a potential threat to “people working with livestock, with poultry, turkeys, chickens, people with backyard flocks or their own flock or particularly production people that use free-range poultry are mostly at risk.” ‘It’s an alert thing’ One farm worker in Colorado was diagnosed with avian influenza in 2022 and three others tested positive for the virus in Texas and Michigan earlier this year. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Earlier this summer, health officials in Pennsylvania told medical providers, health offices and hospitals to test for influenza. The virus has been detected in a total of 13 states in dairy animals and humans. Wengryn said H5N1 surveillance is especially important right now because migratory birds are heading south in the coming weeks along the western, central and eastern flyways. They have all been together in the same Canadian nesting-ground, where the virus could have spread. What can New Jerseyans do? State officials are asking residents to contact state fish and wildlife officials immediately if they come across more than one dead bird in the wild. Pasteurization kills the virus, and officials are advising residents against consuming raw milk products until the threat disappears. Get daily updates from WHYY News!

Dr Bright is also a former director of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).In the session, Dr Bright invited experts in vaccinology, epidemiology, surveillance and outbreak response to explore the question: Zoonotic influenzaâwould we be ready for an equitable 100- day response and what can we do to prepare?Afterwards, CEPIâs Kate Kelland caught up with Dr Bright to ask for his insights on the current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, otherwise known as H5N1 avian influenza, among cattle and poultry in the United States and on whether the global health security system is moving swiftly and effectively to counter its threat.(The interview has been lightly edited for clarity)Q: Can you start by describing the sort of situation weâre now in with H5N1, and how much of a risk it is?The spillover risk is this: the more people infected, the more chance for mutation, and the more chance that this will change rapidly and get out of control and could be a deadly virus.A: With H5N1, the risk is increasing daily. Itâs a virus that weâve known about for a long time, and historically it has infected about 950 people who have had direct contact with a sick animal, a sick bird for example. And in that population (of direct contacts) about 52 percent of the people have died. Now we find ourselves in a very different situation, because this virus has not only infected wild birds, it has also infected domestic poultry â turkeys and chickens â and now it has spilled over to dairy cattle in the United States.The problem with that situation is that there are a lot of people who work daily in constant interaction with these dairy cattle, so the exposure level of people working with these infected animals is increased. The chance for infection and spillover in the people is increased. And the chance for the virus to mutate is increased. In the general population, the risk is somewhat low because we're not all milking cows, but in those people who work very close to these infected animals, the risk is very high. And the spillover risk is this: the more people infected, the more chance for mutation, and the more chance that this will change rapidly and get out of control and could be a deadly virus. Q: Is this situation one that is already a crisis, or is it something where we should be sounding the alarm and responding to that alarm?A: The alarm is sounding. This is an unprecedented outbreak that we see now in domestic mammals. It's in dairy cattle, itâs in cats, it's in mice, and now it's spilling over from those animals, those domestic mammals, back into birds. It's affecting marine wildlife as wellâand more people.So the alarm bells are going off. There are things we should be doing and we're not, and we're not even being as transparent as we should be with the data that we might be collecting to inform how alarming this might be. Some people want to hit the snooze, and others want to take concrete actions to be ready, to make sure that we can respond in an equitable way when this takes off. Q: And at this point, would you say that we are ready? Are we better prepared than we have been in the past for a zoonotic flu outbreak? Could we respond with an effective 100 Days Mission response?We have to invest with an eye on equity. Not an eye on a charitable donation from high income countries that would donate what's left when it's already expired, but an eye on equity first.A: No, we're not ready. We could not respond with an equitable response. If we had an outbreak of avian influenza today, we would not have enough vaccines ready and available to distribute globally, especially to low- and middle-income countries, who were also last in line in the last influenza pandemic (of H1N1 influenza in 2009). They waited almost a year to get their vaccine. Nothing has changed since then. We wouldn't have enough diagnostics to be able to conduct the surveillance to inform countries of the risk. We wouldn't have enough therapeutics and drugs available, we wouldn't have enough masks and PPE and respiratory protection. There's a lot of work that needs to be done.At the same time, I would say we are more prepared - because we spent a lot of money (on this) 25 years ago. We spent billions of dollars. We built manufacturing capacity around the world. We've done a lot of things, but a lot of it is outdated. A lot of it could be improved on with modern technologies and modern tools. But we do have to invest. And we have to invest in it with an eye on equity. Not an eye on a charitable donation from high income countries that would donate what's left when it's already expired, but an eye on equity first. That's the only way we're going to ever be ready for an equitable response to a pandemic. Q: What three things would you like to see happening right now to get us closer towards that state of readiness to be able to respond?We have to know what's coming at us, where it is, how it's changingâor we can't do anything about it until it's too late.A: Well, we just had an excellent panel of experts (at the July 29th-30th 2024 Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit in Brazil) and I asked them what one thing they would like to see to get us there, to make us more ready for an equitable response. One of the most predominant statements was surveillance. We have to not just think about surveillance in the human population. We have to think about surveillance in the animal population, those animals at high risk for spillover and spill back from humans to animals as well in wildlife. We're not doing enough surveillance there, and that's critical. We have to know what's coming at us, where it is, how it's changing -- or we can't do anything about it until it's too late.Another thing would be to make sure that we are modernizing our vaccine approaches. You know, we can't rely on a 1940s technologyâan egg-based influenza vaccineâfor a 2024 emergency response. There are new tools. We have new vaccines. We have super powerful computing capabilities to understand how we can make the vaccines better. So we need to make better vaccines. The third thing I would say is we have to think about how those vaccines are administered. It can't be a needle and syringe in a super-cold freezer storage where very few places have that capability. We have to think about access as well as production. Can we change the vaccines for mucosal delivery, oral delivery, intranasal delivery or transdermal delivery? Can we make the vaccines more room stable, so they don't require cold storage? Can we make the vaccines cross-protective? So that as the virus changes, we're not chasing the virus anymore, but we're out there in front of it with a vaccine that's going to keep it from changing. Those are three critical things we can do right now with innovation, technology and equity in mind first that would make a huge difference for an equitable response to a pandemic.

A study published in 2019 found that these viral infections interact negatively, meaning one may protect against the other. A cold is typically caused by rhinovirus, while the flu is caused by influenza viruses. You may catch both of these viruses at the same time, but it can be difficult to tell the difference. Both colds and the flu cause similar symptoms, including coughing, headaches, a runny nose, and sore throat. The two viruses circulate more frequently throughout the United States during cold and flu season. Millions of people catch a common cold each year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year, and children have even more. Read on to learn whether it's possible to have both a cold and the flu at the same time and how to protect yourself against both. RSV vs. COVID-19: Symptoms To Watch For Can You Have a Cold and the Flu at the Same Time? There's been plenty of research on colds and the flu, but few studies focus on the concurrence of both viral illnesses. In a study published in 2019, researchers analyzed viral test results of more than 44,000 people in Glasgow from 2005 to 2013. The researchers found that the influenza virus and rhinoviruses, one of the causes of a cold, interact negatively. The viruses possibly compete with each other, explaining why you don't see many colds during flu season. This doesn't mean it's impossible to have both illnesses simultaneously. "The cold virus spends most of its time up in your nose and your sinuses and the back of your throat," William Schaffner, MD, professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, told Health. "The flu virus gets into the back of your throat and has the tendency to get down into your chest." Both are respiratory viruses, and there's no reason they can't both infect a person simultaneously. The same goes for other causes of cold-like illnesses, such as COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The body can fight two infections simultaneously, but it may leave you feeling even worse than a normal bout of a cold or the flu. "You probably wouldn't be able to tell that you have both at once. You would probably just be several degrees more miserable than normal, and you'd have the impression that you've got a really nasty case of the flu," said Dr. Schaffner. Causes and Symptoms Knowing a little about how and why the two illnesses occur may help explain how catching both viral illnesses at the same time may happen. There are several types of influenza virus, two of which, influenza A and B, are the typical causes of seasonal flu. Several viruses can cause a cold, but the most common culprit is rhinovirus. Cold and flu symptoms are similar. It can be difficult to distinguish between them, but some key differences exist. Flu Symptoms The flu generally causes symptoms like: Chills Congestion Cough Fatigue Fever Headaches Muscle aches and pains Runny nose Sore throat Cold Symptoms Colds, on the other hand, are generally milder than the flu. Symptoms include: Congestion Cough Headache Runny nose Sneezing Sore throat What About Other Infections? A more significant concern may be catching a bacterial infection while you're already sick with the flu. A review published in 2017 highlighted the ability of bacterial infections, like pneumonia and staph infections, to occur at the same time as the flu. Bacterial infections occur afterward or concurrently in as many as 65% of lab-confirmed flu cases. The influenza virus obliges bacterial infections in many ways. The flu can weaken your immune system and cause cell destruction, making you more susceptible to bacterial infections. Some illnesses, like bacterial pneumonia, can worsen the severity of the flu and other viral infections. Antibiotics can help treat bacterial infections. These drugs come with risks, including overprescription and antibiotic resistance. How To Protect Yourself The yearly flu vaccine is key to safeguarding against getting a combination of infections during cold and flu season. Like other vaccines, the flu shot doesn't guarantee you won't become ill. The vaccine can still reduce your risk of catching the flu and experiencing serious complications like bacterial infections. The flu vaccine provides varied protection between seasons. Age, health status, and the "match" between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation also affect its effectiveness. Other ways to protect against colds and the flu include: Avoiding close contact with others if you or they are sick Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze Not touching your face, nose, or mouth without washing your hands Staying home if you're sick Washing your hands regularly If you catch a cold or the flu, make sure to get plenty of rest and fluids. These home remedies can help your body fight off the viruses and recover. 8 Illnesses That Cause Flu-Like Symptoms That Aren't the Flu A Quick Review It's not common to concurrently have a cold and flu, but it's possible. The good news is that your body can fight two infections simultaneously. You'll likely feel worse than with a normal illness. Protecting yourself from the flu by getting the flu vaccine during cold and flu season is essential. It's also important to avoid germs and prevent their spread by washing your hands and not sharing personal items like utensils. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

To combat this worrying trend, WHO and the Ministry of Health have designed proactive short- and medium-term communication strategies. Utilizing the Communication for Health (C4H) approach, these strategies aim to raise awareness of avian influenza risks among citizens and empower them to adopt preventive behaviours. In Cambodia, poultry is an integral part of daily life, both in diet and livelihoods. Families often raise poultry in their backyards, relying on them for meat, eggs and additional income. Remarkably, 93% of poultry production in the country is under traditional backyard systems.1 Despite this prevalence, people’s perception of avian influenza risks remains low, with limited knowledge about appropriate protective measures.Avian influenza A(H5N1), or bird flu, is a viral disease that mainly affects birds, but can sometimes infect mammals, including humans, through close contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infections can range from mild to severe and may be fatal. Recent global media coverage has highlighted cases of avian influenza in dairy cows and farm workers in the USA, underlining the global nature of this threat. The outbreak investigations identified that all human cases of avian influenza in Cambodia involved exposure to sick or dead backyard poultry, with increased infections occurring around festival periods when poultry slaughtering is more common. A study2 conducted in 2023 in Prey Veng, a province with high poultry density, showed that 97.1% of adults reported burying dead poultry, while 22.6% admitted to cooking sick or dead poultry for their families. This discrepancy highlighted unidentified barriers preventing adherence to food safety advice. Subsequently, to better understand these barriers, message testing was conducted and revealed that only 50% of participants had heard the advice not to touch or eat sick or dying birds when preparing food, and only 36.9% said they would follow it. This indicated an urgent need to address gaps in knowledge about protective measures during food preparation. Targeted outreach to increase risk perceptionIn April 2024 during the Khmer New Year festival season, a pilot campaign was launched primarily on Facebook, Cambodia’s most popular open social media platform. This campaign aimed to gather crucial baseline data and insights to refine future communication strategies for maximum impact. The campaign messages were framed to be culturally relevant and simple, featuring a clear call to action and encouraging the audience to share messages with family and friends, who were identified as the primary source of knowledge (39%) in the Prey Veng study. Visuals were designed to reflect the festive and vibrant atmosphere of the Khmer New Year celebration.An example of social media assets of the pilot campaign. The messages were simplified and made culturally relevant while the visuals matched the festive Khmer New Year atmosphere.© WHO CambodiaWorking with Cambodia’s Ministry of Health, WHO engaged long-standing partners, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to leverage synergies and maximize the impact of communication efforts. The Ministry of Health also proactively distributed printed campaign posters, leaflets and stickers to pagodas, schools and households, in addition to health centers, in five high-risk provinces ahead of Khmer New Year, ensuring broad and effective outreach around the festival season.Print posters were produced in addition to social media materials and distributed in high-risk provinces, specifically pagodas, health centers and communal areas in rural communities.© WHO CambodiaResults and lessons learnedThe online campaign reached 8.8 million people (just over half the population of Cambodia) and garnered 1.2 million engagements. However, despite its extensive reach and engagements, the rapid, short-term campaign has its limits, specifically in shifting behaviors. To create more meaningful impact, we conducted further desk research and a scoping visit to two villages to gain deeper insights into local attitudes and practices and design a more effect intervention. As a result, we found other risky behaviors, including the belief that freezing sick poultry after slaughtering will kill any viruses. These insights highlighted the need to better target audiences with tailored behavioural messages based on their barriers and motivators to change. Applying these lessons, WHO, the Ministry of Health and partners are already refining the communication strategy and testing creative concepts to address behavioral barriers and promote adoption of preventive actions among target populations ahead of Cambodia’s October to November festival season.

USDA officials, in a call with reporters along with staff from other US health agencies, said the tests will begin in mid-September and urged livestock workers to remain vigilant. Nearly 200 herds in 13 US states have contracted bird flu since March after the virus jumped from wild birds to cows, according to USDA data. The USDA in May tested 109 beef samples from dairy cows sent to slaughter and found bird flu virus particles in one cow's tissue sample. Older dairy cattle are often slaughtered for ground beef. The expanded testing will continue for the rest of the year, and will focus on beef from dairy cows, said Emilio Esteban, USDA's under secretary for food safety. Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said the USDA is confident with the current level of bird-flu testing conducted by the nation's dairy farmers. "I do feel that the response is adequate," he said. The Food and Drug Administration is talking with states about the plausibility of additional nationwide raw milk testing, said Steve Grube, chief medical officer of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Colorado implemented mandatory weekly milk testing for dairy farmers on July 22 and has since detected 10 additional positive herds in the state. Farm workers remain at risk of bird-flu infections so long as the virus circulates among livestock, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thirteen poultry and dairy workers have contracted bird flu since April, according to the CDC. The CDC is working on expanding its surveillance wastewater testing to H5 viruses in advance of the fall and winter flu season, Shah said.

Pfizer and BioNTech on Friday announced that their investigative mRNA combination vaccine for influenza and COVID-19 met only one of its two primary immunogenicity endpoints, forcing the partners to consider “adjustments” to the candidate.The companies did not provide specific data in their announcement but revealed that compared with a commercially licensed flu shot, the mRNA vaccine elicited lower seroconversion against the influenza B strain. At the same time, Pfizer and BioNTech’s investigational shot was able to produce “robust influenza A responses” and a “continued higher trend” of immunogenicity against this strain versus a licensed vaccine.The combination vaccine candidate also met its second primary immunogenicity endpoint, triggering a non-inferior response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty.Despite missing one primary endpoint, Pfizer’s head of vaccine R&D Annaliesa Anderson struck an optimistic note in a statement, saying that the companies are “encouraged” by the immunogenicity seen against influenza A. According to Anderson, this response “was similar to what we had seen for our initial quadrivalent influenza vaccine.”Still, with the underwhelming influenza B response, the partners are now “evaluating the next steps” for the combo vaccine candidate, including potential “adjustments” to its formulation to potentially improve the immune response against this specific strain. Pfizer and BioNTech will also work with regulatory authorities to identify the way forward for the candidate.The late-stage stumble could cause added problems for BioNTech, which in its most recent Q2 business report announced a more than fourfold spike in losses—on top of several consecutive quarters of declining revenues. While the German biotech is mostly banking on its cancer pipeline to turn its fortunes around, the combination shot could also potentially help the company improve its balance sheet.In its Q2 investor call, co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin said that BioNTech was targeting approval for the combo vaccine in time for the 2025/2026 season.Meanwhile, Pfizer and BioNTech’s mixed Phase III data could be a boon for Moderna, which is also working on a COVID-19-flu combo vaccine. In June 2024, Moderna announced that compared with commercially licensed vaccines, mRNA-1083 induced significantly stronger immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and three flu virus strains—H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria. Moderna’s shot was also non-inferior to the comparator vaccine for the B/Yamagata flu strain.Pfizer on Friday also revealed Phase II data for its second-generation trivalent influenza mRNA vaccine candidate, which triggered “robust” immune responses against the influenza A and B strains. The pharma will continue to advance this program in coordination with regulatory authorities.

Gauger1 Show authors npj Viruses volume 2, Article number: 27 (2024) Cite this article 1148 Accesses 10 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Influenza virusViral epidemiologyViral evolutionViral transmission AbstractThe Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory detected nineteen human-to-swine reverse zoonoses of the 2022–2023 human seasonal H3N2 between November 2022 and November 2023. Cases from seven U.S. locations were detected: 3 Colorado, 1 Illinois, 1 Indiana, 2 Missouri, 7 North Carolina, 1 Ohio, and 1 Pennsylvania. One additional case was detected in Mexico and two cases were identified from Chile. Case samples were comprised of 4 nasal swabs and 15 oral fluids. Virus was successfully isolated from two of four nasal swab samples, but isolation from oral fluids was unsuccessful. The swine detections of H3 human viruses were classified to one of two human-seasonal H3 clades, 3C.2a1b.2a.2b and 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.1. Phylogenetic inference indicated at minimum 7 reverse zoonotic events occurred, with possible swine-to-swine transmission following the initial spillover. Twelve neuraminidase genes were sequenced, and nine were classified as human-seasonal H3N2 lineage: the remaining were endemic swine IAV NA genes from the N2.2002B, N2.1998, or the N1.Classical lineage, suggesting reassortment. The two viral isolates obtained from nasal swab samples were sequenced and were entirely human-lineage viruses. Seven swine samples with human seasonal H3 were sequenced and revealed co-detections with H1 1A.3.3.3 (gamma), with internal gene segments from both the triple reassortant internal gene (TRIG) and pandemic 2009 lineages. Serologic investigation of samples from swine production systems provided evidence for infection with human seasonal H3N2. One farm in the United States and four farms in Mexico had concurrent virologic evidence. The swine-isolated 3C.2a1b.2a.2b H3N2 was antigenically distinct from endemic 1990.4.A, 2010.1, and 2010.2 swine H3N2 lineages, but retained antigenic similarity to a recent human seasonal H3N2 (A/Darwin/6/2021). Pigs experimentally inoculated with a representative isolate demonstrated replication in the nose and lungs and minimal to mild macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions, but primary pigs did not transmit the virus to indirect contacts. If sustained in the pig population, this human seasonal H3 would represent the first new lineage detected in pigs the 2020 decade and present an emerging threat to swine health and production.

Reverse zoonotic spillover of H3 subtype IAV from humans to swine occurred with regular frequency in the past1,2,3,4,5. The introduction of genetically distinct human lineage H3 IAV into swine has increased genetic diversity circulating within the swine population, complicating control efforts. Swine have also been the source of variant virus infections in humans6,7, highlighting the role and risk of inter-species transmission for the continued diversification of IAV.Historically, there has been evidence of H3 infection in North American swine since 1980 based on serological detection8. However, the first isolation of H3N2 from North American swine was described in Quebec, Canada in 19909,10. Between 1995–1998, H3, composed of a triple reassortant virus with segments from human, swine, and avian origins was introduced through three distinct human-to-swine spillover events denoted as Clusters I, II, and III3,4. Each spillover expressed moderately different antigenic properties11. The Cluster IV lineage evolved from Cluster III, and when first reported in 2005, had acquired a distinct human N212. This lineage of virus diversified into multiple genetic clades over the last two decades, including Cluster IVA (now designated as 1990.4.a in the global swine H3 nomenclature), a major H3 lineage regularly detected in swine13. The presence of H3 in swine remained stable until the 2010 decade, when two H3 reverse zoonosis events were successfully established within the US swine population, denoted as 2010.1 and 2010.22,5,14,15, each introducing genetically and antigenically diverse IAV into the swine population. At present, the 1990.4a and the 2010.1 lineages compose the majority of H3 detections in US swine13,16.Not all detected H3 reverse zoonotic events become endemically established in swine17. Through the efforts of the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) swine IAV passive surveillance system and the voluntary participation of producers and veterinarians, approximately 15 dead-end reverse zoonosis events were detected in swine from 2013 to 201916. There were not detections of human-origin reverse zoonoses events in the swine population between 2019–2022. Notably, this occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when human influenza cases were reduced18,19. Social distancing measures put in place by governments and employers may have acted as an additional layer of biosecurity between humans and animals. With the relaxation and removal of prior SARS-CoV-2 restrictions, the number of human IAV cases in the 2022–2023 human IAV season dramatically increased. In late February of 2023, approximately 75% of the IAV positive tests reported to the CDC by U.S. public health laboratories were H3 subtype, with the majority of cases belonging to the 3C.2a1b subclade 2a.2b20. By early July of 2023, H3 cases dropped to approximately 6% of weekly detections but accounted for 71% of the cumulative human Influenza A and Influenza B detections in the 2022–2023 human influenza season21.Historical cases have shown that reverse zoonosis introduces additional genetic and antigenically diverse IAV in swine, which complicates vaccine control efforts. Herein, we describe 19 H3 subtype IAV reverse-zoonosis events in swine in the U.S., Chile, and Mexico, occurring between November 2022 and November 2023. All swine detections were genetically related to the prevalent H3 3C.2a1b.2a.2 circulating in humans but were derived from two different subclades. The potential for these H3 introductions to become endemic within U.S. and global swine populations is an outstanding question. However, these events emphasize how human seasonal IAV is a risk to swine health and impacts the ecology and evolution of IAV in the swine host.MethodsEthics statementAll animal experiments were conducted in a manner that complies with the Code of Federal Regulations for animal welfare22. Ferrets were cared for in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Animal Disease Center, USDA, ARS. All groups of swine for airborne transmission studies were housed separately in biosafety level 2 containment rooms and cared for in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Animal Disease Center.Detection and validation of diagnostic submissionsViral RNA extraction, subtyping, and Sanger sequencing were performed at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) according to standard operating procedures (SOP)1. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from both oral fluid and nasal swab samples under the manufacturer’s instructions (MagMAX pathogen RNA/DNA isolation kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nasal swabs are specific to an individual animal whereas oral fluids are a population sample type, typically pooled from multiple swine chewing on a rope. IAV RNA was detected through reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (VetMAX Gold SIV Detection Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), using VetMAX Xeno as a positive internal control. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) were subtyped from RT-rtPCR positive samples (VetMAX Gold SIV subtyping kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), using separate reactions for H1, H3 and N1, N2. Sanger sequencing was conducted on genomic material that was amplified using a separate RT-PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions (qScript XLT 1-step RT-PCR kit; Quantabio), using primers proprietary to the ISU VDL. Amplified genomic material was cleaned and submitted to the Iowa State University DNA facility (Ames, IA). Sequence assembly was performed using Geneious Prime23. Virus isolates were successfully obtained from two nasal swabs using a prior published isolation protocol1.The cases in this study originated from routine submissions of clinical pigs where the client was seeking a diagnosis of the etiological agent afflicting their swine or were submitted for routine surveillance from healthy populations of swine. Additional samples were requested from a farm in North Carolina to identify continued circulation of human-like virus, yielding sample A02758610. The predominant sample type submitted was oral fluid, an antemortem pooled population sample type that is frequently used due to ease of collection.The index case HA sequence, A02751184 detected on November 7, 2022 in North Carolina, was automatically identified as novel by the ISU FLUture automated clade designation system16,24. BLAST and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirmed the virus was similar to human seasonal H3 influenza. Subsequent cases were detected and assigned a “human-to-swine-2022” designation by the automated classification system. Human H3 subtype HA sequences from the US (United States) from October 2020 to May 2023 were downloaded from GISAID on May 9th, 2023 (n = 13,656)25 and annotated with the human clade designation using Nextclade (Reference: A/Darwin/6/2021, Updated: 2023-04-02)26. Human sequences were paraphyletically subsampled to approximately 600 sequences, or 5% of the data using smot27, and aligned using MAFFT28. Amino acid alignments of the swine-origin sequences were visualized using Geneious Prime (Supplementary Fig. 1). An additional 47 sequences from GISAID sampled between May 9th, 2023 to December 23rd, 2023 were appended to the dataset with subsequent realignment. The clade assignment of swine gene sequences was confirmed for each virus by maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis using IQ-TREE, with a general time-reversible model using gamma-distributed rates and invariant sites, run with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps for branch support (Fig. 1)29. The antigenic motif, six amino acid sites located at 145, 155, 156, 158, 159, and 189 that have been noted to have a disproportionate effect on the antigenic phenotype, were identified for all swine sequences and genetically similar human sequences30. Glycosylation sites on the HA gene were predicted using NetNGlyc v1.0, using a threshold of 6/9 jury agreement and a potential greater than 50%31.Fig. 1: H3 3C.2a1b.2a hemagglutinin maximum-likelihood tree.Branches are colored by lineage, with swine sequences indicated by red dots and text. Each branch is labeled with bootstrap support, calculated from 1000 ultrafast bootstraps.Full size imageNeuraminidase sequences were obtained from 11 samples. Human-origin N2 sequences were confirmed by BLAST comparison and phylogenetic inference. A subsample of N2 neuraminidase sequences associated with prior sampled human HA sequences was aligned with swine N2 sequences using MAFFT28. Alignments of the swine-origin sequences were visualized using Geneious Prime (Supplementary Fig. 2). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using IQ-TREE, with a general time-reversible model using gamma-distributed rates and invariant sites, run with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps for branch support (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: N2 human seasonal neuraminidase maximum-likelihood tree.Branches are colored by the lineage of the paired hemagglutinin, with swine sequences indicated by red dots and text. Each branch is labeled with bootstrap support, calculated from 1000 ultrafast bootstraps.Full size imageWhole genome sequencing of influenza A virus strainsWhole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on seven clinical samples. Next-generation sequencing was performed on extracted viral RNA (MiSeq platform, Illumina) following standard Illumina protocols at the ISU VDL using TruSeq sequencing libraries (TruSeq stranded total RNA library preparation kit, catalog 20020596, Illumina). Reads were trimmed and assembled based on prior published ISU VDL protocols1. Assembled sequences were classified into genetic clades or evolutionary lineage using octoFLU32.Temporal reconstruction of IAV transmission in the United StatesA low parameter Bayesian model was employed to infer a temporal phylogenetic tree using BEAST version 1.10.4. The analysis used host as a trait (19 swine, 617 human), and incorporated an asymmetric substitution model using BSSVS to infer the social network33,34,35,36,37,38,39. The model implemented an uncorrelated relaxed clock and had state change counts reconstructed with change history logged to the tree, an HKY85 substitution model, and an exponential growth tree prior, and was run for 200,000,000 states logging every 10,000 states. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were built using 20% burn-in using the Tree Annotator program of the BEAST 1.10.4 package. Subtrees inclusive of the swine sequences from North Carolina and Colorado were directly sampled from the MCC tree for visualization.Human seasonal influenza virus data was downloaded from CDC FluView interactive on April 10, 2023, for influenza seasons 2009–2010 to 2022–2023. The number of H3 positive detections was divided by the total positive cases per season to determine the percentage of H3 positives per year. The linear relationship between the percentage of H3 detections per season and number of observed H3 human-to-swine spillovers was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.Serologic detectionsSerologic testing indicated additional introduction events of human-origin H3N2 in commercial swine. Five commercial breeding farms (A–E) were NP ELISA positive for IAV (Swine Influenza Virus Antibody Test, IDEXX, Westbrook, ME) during the influenza season of 2022–2023. These farms were different than the farms that submitted samples for sequencing. All but one had evidence of IAV detection in oral fluids. Serum samples obtained from these five farms were tested against a panel of human and swine IAV by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Sera were treated by heat inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min, 20% kaolin in PBS incubation for 20 min and adsorbed with 0.5% turkey red blood cells for 20 min to remove nonspecific hemagglutination inhibitors and natural serum agglutinins. HI assays were performed using standard techniques40, using PBS as a negative control in place of virus. Group HI titers were transformed into log2 geometric means for comparison purposes. The HI antigens represented human seasonal clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.1 (A/Darwin/6/2021) and a human-origin swine virus isolated from this investigation from farm D to represent human seasonal clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2b (A/swine/North Carolina/A02751333/2022). The additional antigens tested were a human seasonal H1N1 (A/Hawaii/70/2019-like) and representative swine H3N2 strains from lineages 1990.4.a (A/swine/Iowa/A02750897/2022), 2010.1 (A/swine/Iowa/A02636454/2022) and 2010.2 (A/swine/Indiana/A02635878/2021) to rule out co-circulation of other IAV subtypes and H3 lineages.Antigenic characterizationHuman seasonal H3N2 vaccine strains (A/Iowa/60/2018, A/Hong Kong/45/2019) and candidate vaccine viruses (CVV)s (A/ Minnesota/11/2010 X 203, A/Ohio/13/2017-IDCDC-RG60 and A/Ohio/28/2016-IDCDC-RG55C) and antisera produced in ferret against these strains were provided by the Virology, Surveillance, and Diagnosis Branch, Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA. Human seasonal H3N2 vaccine strains (A/Cambodia/E826360/2020-cell, A/Darwin/9/2021, and A/Darwin/6/2021-like) were provided by the University of Pennsylvania. Swine H3N2 isolates representative of 1990.4.a clade (A/swine/North Carolina/A02245294/2019), 2010.1 clade (A/swine/Kansas/A02245675/2020, A/swine/Utah/A02524953/2020, A/swine/Iowa/A02636454/2022A/swine/Iowa/A02636476/2022) and 2010.2 clade (A/swine/Iowa/A02524572/2020, and A/swine/Indiana/A02635878/2021) were provided by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) IAV in swine surveillance system in conjunction with the USDA-National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN). Viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells grown in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA). The virus growth media contained antibiotics and antimycotics and 1 μg/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ).H3N2 antisera was produced in ferrets against human seasonal strains (A/Cambodia/E826360/2020-cell, and A/Darwin/6/2021-like), and representative swine strains of clades: 1990.4.a (A/swine/North Carolina/A02245294/2019), 2010.1 (A/swine/Utah/A02524953/2020) and 2010.2 (A/swine/Iowa/A02524572/2020) by intranasal inoculation with 106 TCID50/ml of each strain. Blood was collected when ferrets reached an HI titer of >160. Ferrets were cared for in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Animal Disease Center, USDA, ARS.Prior to HI assays, ferret antisera were heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, then treated with a 20% Kaolin suspension (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), followed by an adsorption with 0.75% guinea pig red blood cells to remove nonspecific agglutinins and inhibitors of hemagglutination. HI assays were performed using 20 nM of oseltamivir carboxylate41, using PBS as a negative control in place of virus. Cross-HI tables were merged and mapped in 3 dimensions using antigenic cartography to quantify antigenic distances between antigens42. Antigenic distances between viruses were calculated in antigenic units (AU), in which 1 AU is equivalent to a 2-fold loss in HI cross-reactivity. Antigenic distances were plotted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).In vivo pathogenesis and transmission studyThe A/swine/North Carolina/A02751333/2022 (NC/22) isolate was propagated and titrated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA) containing antibiotics/antimycotics and 1 µg/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) and clarified virus from infected cell culture was used for challenge. Back-titration of challenge inoculum was done to confirm the desired titer of 3.16 × 105 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ ml. Three-week-old piglets were obtained from a commercial source free of IAV and prophylactically treated with a dose of ceftiofur crystalline free acid and tulathromycin (Zoetis Animal Health, Florham Park, NJ) prior to transport. After arrival, pigs were screened for IAV antibodies by a commercial nucleoprotein ELISA kit (Swine Influenza Virus Antibody Test, IDEXX, Westbrook, ME), subcutaneously microchipped for body temperature monitoring (Destron Fearing™, Dallas, TX) and randomly divided into three groups: negative control (n = 5), primary challenge (n = 10), and indirect contact (n = 5). All groups were housed separately in biosafety level 2 containment rooms and cared for in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Animal Disease Center. On day 0, primary pigs were inoculated by intratracheal (2 ml) and intranasal (1 ml) routes under sedation using an intramuscular injection of ketamine (8 mg/kg of body weight; Phoenix, St. Joseph, MO), xylazine (4 mg/kg; Lloyd Inc., Shenandoah, IA), and Telazol (6 mg/kg; Zoetis Animal Health, Florham Park, NJ) cocktail. Nasal swabs (NS) from negative controls and primary challenged pigs were collected daily until 5 days post-inoculation (dpi), in media containing 2 ml minimum-essential-medium (MEM) supplemented with 1:1000 of 1 µg/ml TPCK Trypsin. On 2 dpi, five indirect naïve contact piglets were introduced into the challenge containment room and kept in a separate raised deck. Routine nasal swab collection of the contact pigs began on day 0 post-contact (dpc) and continued on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 dpc. At 5 dpi, the negative control and challenge groups were humanely euthanized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital (Fatal Plus; Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI). At necropsy, blood and nasal swabs were collected and lungs were aseptically removed and lavaged with 50 ml of MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). The percentage of the lung affected with purple-red consolidation typical of IAV in swine was visually estimated at 5 dpi as previously described43. Tissue samples from the trachea and right middle or affected lung lobe were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathologic examination. Tissues were processed by routine histopathologic procedures, slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and lesions scored by a veterinary pathologist43. Serum samples were obtained from the contact pigs at 13 dpc. Lung lesion scores, log10-transformed virus titers, and log2-transformed HI reciprocal titers were analyzed using t-test, with a p value of <0.05 considered significant (GraphPad Prism software version 9; San Diego, CA).Nasal swab samples were filtered with a 0.2-micron syringe filter and plated onto 24-well plates containing 80% confluent MDCK cells and cultured at 37 °C for 48 h, using media only rows as the negative control. Plates were fixed and stained for immunocytochemistry (ICC) as previously described44. BALF samples were streaked (100 µl) on Casmin (NAD-enriched) and blood agar plates to evaluate bacterial growth. BALF was also tested for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus type 2 according to ISU VDL SOP. Virus isolation-positive nasal swabs and BALF samples were titrated in 10-fold serial triplicate dilutions on 96-well plates of MDCK cells. At 48 h, plates were fixed and stained44. Titers were calculated for each sample as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per ml and transformed to log10 for comparison purposes. RT-rtPCR was performed to confirm virus isolation detection in nasal swab and BALF samples (VetMAX™-Gold SIV Detection Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA).ResultsMultiple detections of human-origin H3 influenza A virus in swineNineteen human-to-swine transmission events of seasonal H3 IAV were detected by molecular or virologic methods in swine samples submitted to the ISU VDL between November 7, 2022 to November 28, 2023 (Table 1). Fifteen IAV were sequenced from oral fluids and four from nasal swabs; virus isolates were obtained from two nasal swab samples, A/swine/North Carolina/A02751333/2022 and A/swine/North Carolina/A02758610/2023. Samples were collected from nine U.S. production premises: 3 from Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, 2 from Missouri, 7 from North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, 1 case was collected from Mexico and 2 cases from Chile.Table 1 List of USDA barcodes, received date, state, sample type, and genetic lineage of the HA and NA for each reverse zoonotic H3 strainFull size tableMaximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference indicated that all HA sequences clustered within the human 3C.2a1b.2a lineage, with sequences falling into the 3C.2a1b.2a.2b and 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.1 clades (Table 1 and Fig. 1), herein referred to as clades 2b and 2a.1, respectively. The HA genes collected from swine were placed in multiple locations across the phylogeny, nested within clades of human seasonal HA genes indicating that multiple human-to-swine spillovers occurred during this human influenza season (Fig. 1). Three cases were detected as co-infections with endemic swine lineage viruses. Based on WGS of the HA and NA gene from clinical samples, cases A02758604–A02758606 were co-detected with H1 subtype IAV: H1.1A.3.3.3 (gamma), H1.1B.2.2.1 (delta1a), and H1.1A.3.3.2 (pdm09), respectively, with case A02758604 also containing an N1.Classical sequence. Pairwise differences between sequences derived from the clinical cases were calculated across the entire HA (1701nt), with a maximum difference of 42nt between all 19 sequences, 40nt differences among seasonal H3 clade 2b sequences, and 34nt among the seasonal H3 clade 2a.1 clade sequences (Supplementary Table 1).There were eight notable clade-specific amino acid differences between the 2a.1 and 2b lineages. Using H3 numbering with the signal peptide trimmed, these amino acids labeled with the 2a.1 lineage first are E50K, G53D, F79V, G104D, I140K, S156H, R276K, and R503K in the HA2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Six amino acid changes were found on the nine human NA, A238T, V263I, R315S, G346S, N463D, and S465N (Supplementary Fig. 2). Two antigenic motifs were present, distinct to each lineage. The 2a.1 lineage had a motif of STSNNK, and the 2b lineage motif was STHNNK. Notably, the only difference is at position 156, where 2a.1 had a serine and 2b had a histidine. The motifs found in the swine sequences matched the motifs of genetically similar human sequences.Glycosylation was predicted at amino acid positions 7, 21, 37, 62, 132, 164, 245, and 284 for all U.S. swine-origin 2b clade sequences using H3 numbering, including the isolate A/swine/North Carolina/A02751333/2022 used in phenotypic characterization. ISU78274 and ISU97104 from Mexico and Chile respectively were predicted to have lost glycosylation at position 132 and 164, with strain ISU97104 potentially gaining glycosylation at position 125. Predicted glycosylation sites for the human-like 2a.1 clade HA additionally included position 44. Case A02751292 was an exception and lacked a predicted glycosylation at position 44, and case ISU110711 from Chile had an additional glycosylation at position 125.Sanger sequencing for neuraminidase was performed on eleven cases, yielding eleven N2 subtype sequences and one N1 sequence from a co-detection case (Table 1). Nine sequences were human-origin N2, suggesting that the surface proteins of these viruses were still wholly human-origin (Fig. 2). The human-origin N2 sequences formed two clades on the tree, analogous to their paired H3 lineage. Two neuraminidases from A02758601 and A02758604 were related to endemic swine NA lineages N2.2002B and N2.1998 respectively. One sample, A02758605, contained an N1.Classical lineage NA, which was likely associated with the H1 1A.3.3.3 clade HA co-detected in the sample45. The sample type for the co-detections was oral fluid, a pooled population sample, thus no conclusion can be drawn about co-infection or reassortment between the viruses. The swine-origin N2.2002B lineage neuraminidase was compared to similar sequences on ISU FLUture via BLAST and found to be genetically similar to NA sequences commonly paired with 1990.4.a H3 HA. The N2.1998 lineage sequence identified from A02758604 was genetically similar to NA found associated with 1990.1 H3 HA1.Mixed internal genes from co-detectionsWhole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on seven clinical samples and two isolates (Fig. 3). Four samples (A02751333, A02758600, A02758607, A02758610) yielded only human-origin gene segments. Sample A02758606 yielded 8 human-origin segments, and an additional pandemic 2009 lineage NP segment was detected. Sample A02758604 yielded a human seasonal H3 clade 2b HA, N2.1998 NA, TRIG NP and NS, and a pandemic M. No reliable length of sequence was recovered for any polymerase gene in this sample. Sample A02758605 yielded a mixture of human-origin and swine triple-reassortant origin internal genes, with both a human-origin and pandemic 2009 M protein. The WGS results on clinical samples indicated that the human-origin H3 viruses circulated concurrently in barns that also harbor endemic swine lineage IAV.Fig. 3: Genetic lineage constellations of whole genome sequences.Co-detections are marked via triangles. The polymerases of A02758604 were not able to be sequenced.Full size imageH3 was the predominant subtype detected in humans from 2010–2011 to 2012–2013, 2014–2015, 2016–2017 to 2017–2018, and 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 flu seasons. However, based on available CDC H3 detection data, there was no evident correlation between the prevalence of H3 in humans during an influenza season and the number of detected human-to-swine spillover cases (Pearson correlation = 0.13).Temporal reconstruction suggests swine-to-swine transmissionTemporal phylogenetic trees were inferred for U.S. sequences using Bayesian inference methods. All sequences included in the tree coalesced to a single common ancestor in late June of 2020 (95% HPD Jan 30, 2020–Nov 16, 2020). The mean rate of substitution was 3.99 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 3.56 × 10−3 to 4.46 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year), which equates to approximately 6.79 substitutions/year across the 1701nt of the HA gene.Bayesian inference inferred a mean of 8.27 host transitions over the span of the phylogeny (95% HPD 7–10), indicating between 7 to 10 independent human-to-swine spillover events occurred within the United States. The maximum clade consensus tree revealed geographic patterns between the sequences. Seven North Carolina sequences were in the human seasonal H3 2b clade, with six sequences forming a single group, potentially representing a swine-to-swine transmission chain (Supplementary Fig. 3a). A clade composed of sequences from North Carolina and Pennsylvania was also present in the human seasonal H3 2b clade, with the remaining events being single detections.The largest human seasonal H3 clade 2a.1 group contained sequences from Colorado and a single gene sequence isolated in Missouri 4 months prior to the Colorado detections. The Colorado cases occurred across a 3-week span, and it was not clear whether this grouping of genes was derived from a single or multiple interspecies transmission events (Supplementary Fig. 3b). All other H3 2a.1 clades occurred as single events on the maximum-likelihood tree.Serologic evidence of human-origin H3 spillover into commercial swine herdsPig serum samples from Mexico (farm A) and U.S. (farm B, C, D, and E) displayed HI positivity (HI ≥40) to a contemporary human seasonal H3N2 (A/Darwin/6/2021) and NC/22, but limited HI cross-reactivity to H1 human seasonal or other contemporary swine H3N2 representative strains of the 1990.4.a, 2010.1 and 2010.2 lineages. Farm A in Mexico had 75% of the serum samples HI positive to A/Darwin/6/2021 and NC/22. Farm B from the U.S. had 85% of serum samples HI positive for A/Darwin/6/2021 and 100% for NC/22. U.S. farm C had 60% of serum samples HI positive for A/Darwin/6/2021 and 70% for NC/22. U.S. farm D had 50% of serum samples HI positive for A/Darwin/6/2021 and 80% for NC/22. U.S. farm E had 100% of serum samples HI positive for A/Darwin/6/2021 and NC/22 (Table 2). These data confirmed that the H3N2 virus introduction was antigenically related to a human seasonal H3N2 (A/Darwin/6/2021).Table 2 Serologic evidence of human to swine H3N2 transmission in breeding farms from Mexico and U.S.AFull size tableHuman-like swine isolate was antigenically distinct from contemporary swine IAV lineagesAntigenic relationships between A/swine/North Carolina/A02751333/2022 (NC/22 and human seasonal H3N2 strains, CVVs, and contemporary swine H3N2 strains are shown in the three-dimensional antigenic map (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table 2). NC/22 (clade 2b) showed a closer antigenic similarity to the recent human seasonal H3N2 vaccine strains A/Darwin/9/2021 and A/Darwin/6/2021-like (clade 2a.1) with 1.8 and 1.9 AU, respectively. NC/22 retained antigenic similarity of <3 AU with other human seasonal H3N2 strains such as A/Hong Kong/45/2019 and A/Cambodia/E826360/2020. In contrast, NC/22 was 3.1 AU away from a human seasonal A/Iowa/60/2018 and more than 5.0 AU from the tested pandemic preparedness CVVs (Fig. 4B). The antigenic distances between NC/22 and swine H3N2 contemporary strains from 1990.4.a, 2010.1, and 2010.2 lineages showed a range of 3.8 to 6.0 AU (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that NC/22 is antigenically distinct from endemic swine H3N2 and antigenically similar to a human seasonal H3N2 strains of 2a.1.Fig. 4: Antigenic characterization of NC/22 by ferret anti-sera.A Three-dimensional map showing antigenic relationships between swine NC/22 and human seasonal H3N2 vaccine strains, candidate vaccine viruses (CVV)s and contemporary swine H3N2 representative strains.

At the 5 dpi necropsy, minimal to mild lesions typical of experimental IAV infection were observed, and there was no significant difference between the weighted average lung lesion percentages between the negative (non-challenged) group and the NC/22 challenged group of pigs. This was consistent with microscopic lung and tracheal lesion scores (Table 3). Virus shedding was detected in nasal swabs of all primary inoculated pigs with variable titers. Onset of nasal shedding was 1 dpi, and peak group shedding was recorded at 4 dpi. The NC/22 strain replicated at a mean titer of 4.67 log10 TCID50/ml in the lungs of inoculated pigs (Table 4). Despite sustained shedding from primary pigs, airborne transmission of NC/22 strain to indirect contact pigs was not detected. All nasal swabs from contact pigs throughout the study were negative for IAV by virus isolation and RT-rtPCR. HI assays confirmed a lack of airborne transmission with an absence of seroconversion at 13 dpc.Table 3 Macroscopic, microscopic and IHC lung and trachea scoresFull size tableTable 4 Nasal shedding of primary pigs challenged with A/swine/North Carolina/A02751333/2022Full size tableDiscussionDuring the 2022–2023 human influenza season, repeated H3 reverse zoonotic spillovers from humans into swine were detected. While human-to-swine transmission events were detected in the past through routine sampling by the ISU VDL, the number of independent introductions and overall detections during a single human influenza season is the highest recorded to date. The detected viruses were from two phylogenetic clades estimated to have diverged in mid-2020 in humans, emphasizing that multiple spillover events occurred and that genetically diverse IAV were introduced into swine. HI titers detected against the human-like swine isolate from the human seasonal H3 2b clade and human seasonal H3 2a.1 clade virus indicate these strains were antigenically novel in swine and would further diversify the antigenic landscape if they became endemic. The spillover viruses in this study originated from the same H3 human seasonal lineage that seeded the H3.2010.1 and H3.2010.2 lineages circulating in swine from the previous decade. The lack of antibody cross-reactivity is reflective of the divergence of these lineages post species transitions and suggests the antigenic phenotype may be a major contributing component to the transmission dynamics between swine and humans. While an isolate was not obtained for the 2a.1 clade, the World Health Organization’s recommendation for vaccine composition in the northern hemisphere in 2023–2024 human serology experiments indicated that A/Darwin/6/2021-like (lineage 2a.1) post-vaccination virus neutralization geometric mean titers were not significantly reduced to either the 2b or 2a.1 clade46. This is suggestive that the vaccine candidate provides some protection to both 2b and 2a.1 lineages in humans and may indicate antigenic cross-reactivity in swine as well. This is supported by the HI titers in the sera from farms with antibodies to strains from both clades.Eighteen cases from this study were identified from routine diagnostics requested by producers. Only one case, A02758610, was requested by the diagnostic lab to identify if human-origin virus was persisting. Although further sampling was not conducted, the serological evidence indicates that multiple swine in the field during the period of this study were exposed to human H3N2 IAV. An active sampling strategy of targeting farms with seropositivity could better characterize how these spillover viruses are affecting the genetic landscape of swine IAV. Previous work identified a linear correlation between H1N1pdm09 prevalence in humans and the number of human-to-swine spillovers47. A correlation between human seasonal H3 detections between humans and the number of interspecies transmission events was not observed in the current data. The lack of an observable correlation may be due to species barriers that typically minimize human-to-swine transmission of H3N2 when compared to the H1N1pdm09. The H1N1pdm09 lineage emerged in pigs and has some genetic components, including the HA gene, that have evolved in the swine host for nearly a century48. This contrasts with the human seasonal H3 influenza viruses that are circulated primarily in humans since 19683,4,49. However, the unprecedented number of independent transmission events from humans into swine suggests the human seasonal H3N2 from 2022–2023 possessed a phenotype that may be more infectious to the swine host. The serological data indicated widespread exposure to human H3 viruses within multiple farm systems, thus there may be greater spread of human seasonal H3 viruses in the swine population that have not been detected through passive surveillance. Human seasonal clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 viruses were noted for having altered glycosylation and sialic acid binding properties in humans50. This change in biochemical properties may have provided these H3N2 viruses a selective advantage in swine. Prior literature has noted the tendency for endemic swine IAV to be less glycosylated than human lineages51. The human seasonal 2b viruses were predicted to lack glycosylation at position 44 compared to 2a.1 H3 genes, and this subclade was associated with swine-to-swine transmission of the 2b lineage as observed in North Carolina. Notably, U.S. 2b strains had 8 predicted glycosylation sites while strains from Mexico and Chile had 6 and 7 predicted sites, respectively.Despite the high numbers of human seasonal H3 detections in swine, it is unknown if any of the reverse-zoonotic H3 introductions will become endemic in the swine population. Indication of viral spread between production systems and state borders was not observed. Multiple co-detections with endemic swine IAV were found in this study, but there were no clear indication of reassortment between the human seasonal H3N2 spillover strains and endemic swine viruses that has previously been detected as a factor in the persistence of novel spillovers2,5,14. The sample type for the co-detections was oral fluid, a pooled population sample, thus no conclusion can be drawn regarding co-infection or reassortment between the viruses. We did not detect samples with single gene segment origins representing a reassortant IAV isolate. However, the occurrence of co-detections in 3 out of 16 cases ( ~ 19%) demonstrates these spillovers are occurring in production systems with active swine IAV infections, showing reassortment events are possible. The lack of sufficient samples and sequences from Mexico and Chile make it impossible to discern the spread in this region. Establishment of a new H3 clade in swine has the potential to further complicate vaccine-based control efforts by increasing viral diversity of endemic IAV circulating in swine as described in prior spillovers represented by the H3.2010.1 and H3.2010.22,5.A notable challenge of this study was the lack of virus isolates obtained. Antigenic characterization as well as sequencing of the internal genes is easier and often more successful to perform if a virus can be isolated from a sample and propagated to high titers. The majority of sample types diagnosed with human-like H3N2 were oral fluid, a minimally invasive sample to obtain from pigs and a common diagnostic specimen used for surveillance the RT-rtPCR cycle threshold (CT) values are typically higher, and successful virus isolation and sequencing is more difficult compared to other antemortem sample types such as a nasal swab. As oral fluids are a pooled sample, it is also difficult to determine if an IAV codetection is derived from a single virus or detection of individual IAV infection from multiple swine that contributed to the oral fluid sample. For future detections, cases of human-to-swine spillovers should be followed by epidemiological investigations with a request to the client for nasal swabs, nasal wipes, and other individual respiratory samples with the goal of obtaining isolates for further characterization. Our study also included serologic evidence that confirmed exposure to a virus that is antigenically similar to recent human H3 seasonal strains in commercial breeding herds where virologic identification of transmission was unsuccessful. This suggests additional spillover events and potential circulation of this human seasonal H3N2 virus clade in pig farms and regions is likely to have gone undetected or under-reported. Under-surveillance is concerning as prior human-to-swine spillovers have persisted for multiple years, reassorted to acquire endemic swine IAV genes, and then dramatically increasing in detection frequency so that the genetic and antigenic landscape of IAV in swine was shifted5,52,53.Our in vivo study demonstrated that the human-origin H3N2 virus (NC/22 strain) carrying a complete human (H) origin internal gene constellation HHHHHH replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tract of directly inoculated pigs without causing significant lesions. This suggests pigs may be subclinical or exhibit mild clinical disease in farms with human seasonal H3N2 spillovers. Despite consistent nasal viral shedding from primary inoculated pigs, there was no aerosol transmission detected in indirect contact pigs, explaining the minimal evidence of onward transmission within and between production systems. We recognize that our study design only allowed for the assessment of airborne viral transmission and therefore our results might dismiss the ability of this virus to transmit in field conditions where direct nose-to-nose transmission occurs. However, we have previously established that well adapted swine H3N2 IAV are capable of transmitting efficiently in indirect contact experimental model54,55.Internal gene constellations in combination with the surface glycoproteins HA and NA impact efficiency of virus replication, transmission pattern, and disease severity of IAV2. The 2022–2023 human viruses introduced into pigs may need further adaptation and/or reassortment with endemic swine IAV for efficient transmission and maintenance in the U.S. swine population. This study indicates an immediate potential threat to swine herd health with the introduction of an antigenically novel lineage of H3 IAV from humans. This study also underscores a reoccurring pattern of new introductions of human lineage IAV into swine, dictated by what is predominately circulating in humans2,5,14,47. The current best practice to prevent human-seasonal IAV introductions into swine herds are to adhere to stringent biosecurity protocols and to avoid letting ill humans interact with swine herds. Routine vaccination of swine has been shown to reduce viral shedding in swine56,57. Additionally, vaccination has been shown to reduce the chance of a reassortment event occurring, speculatively through the reduction in the number of days for a productive infection58. There is an inextricable link between IAV circulating in humans and swine. To break this pattern and mitigate future disease introduction additional focus will be needed to minimize spread of disease at the human-swine interface.

Grube said though 17% of the products had traces of the virus (viral RNA), follow-up testing yielded no viable virus, which he said confirms the effectiveness of commercial pasteurization. He said since dairy products aren't always made where the milk was collected, so it's hard to pinpoint the source for products that had virus traces. If live virus were found, however, scientists could unblind the samples and take steps to trace the products.All 23 aged raw milk samples were negative for viral RNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, but Grube said more research is needed to assess if the aging process is effective for virus inactivation. Affected farms receive $2 million in supportEric Deeble, DVM, the USDA's deputy undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said the agency continues to intensify its efforts to let dairy farmers know about support for affected farms. So far, 35 farms have applied for compensation for avian flu related milk losses, and 23 have been approved so far for support totaling about $2 million. Meanwhile, Emilio Esteban, DVM, PhD, USDA undersecretary for food safety, said the USDA is launching a study to sample more samples from beef collected from culled dairy cows—animals that aren't sick but are removed from production for reasons such as lack of milk production. He said USDA scientists will test 800 samples over the next year. Too soon to say if virus ebbing in dairy cattleAt today's briefing, Deeble said it's too soon to say if federal officials have gotten ahead of the outbreaks in dairy cows. Testing continues at a high level, and he said he thinks the federal response is adequate and that federal officials have a good picture of how the virus has spread through cattle movements to different states. Currently, H5N1 confirmations in dairy herds appear to have slowed, standing at 190 herds in 13 states.As fall approaches, though, interstate movements of dairy cows pick back up with a greater demand for milk, partly due to school resuming.Grube said federal officials remain in contact with state regulators to best understand how and where to test milk in the supply chain.

Credit: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock. Pfizer and BioNTech have announced that a Phase III trial studying their investigational combination mRNA vaccine for the treatment of influenza and Covid-19 has failed to meet one of its two primary endpoints. While the vaccine demonstrated a trend of higher responses in neutralising the influenza A strain compared to a licensed influenza vaccine, it failed to demonstrate non-inferiority against the influenza B strain in geometric mean titers (GMT) and seroconversion, as per a 16 August press release. Additionally, data indicated that the combination vaccine showed “comparable” responses for SARS-CoV-2 when compared to Pfizer’s licensed approved Covid-19 vaccine, Comirnaty (tozinameran).

No new safety signals were found in the Phase III study. “Today’s results provide insight and direction towards achieving this goal, and we remain optimistic about our combination Covid-19 and influenza program, for which we are evaluating the next steps,” said Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, Senior Vice President and Head, Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer. Comirnaty, which gained full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2021, is indicated for use in individuals aged 12 years and older for protection against Covid-19. The vaccine achieved peak sales of $42.4bn in 2022. However, there has been a decline in Covid-19 revenues in recent times, with pharma scrambling to make up the deficits. In May, Pfizer announced a cost reduction programme to combat declining Covid-19 revenues, which was expected to save the company approximately $1.5bn by 2027. This measure came after the company announced in October 2023 that it would implement a $3.5bn cost-saving programme to combat a $5.5bn non-cash charge after the US government returned nearly eight million courses of the company’s Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid (nirmatrelviritonavir).

Not a moment too soon, yes? This is, you may recall, our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans. Our agenda is fairly modest. We hope to hang with a couple of our short people, spend time with our Pharmalot ancestor, and promenade with the official mascots. We also hope to hold another listening party, where the rotation will likely feature this, this, this, this and this. And what about you?

Well, whatever you do, have a grand time. But be safe. Enjoy, and see you soon. … Pfizer and BioNTech disclosed that their combined mRNA vaccine candidate against influenza and Covid-19 showed a lower immune response against one type of influenza, influenza B, in a Phase 3 trial, a setback for the vaccine, STAT says. The combination vaccine met its goal in generating an immune response against influenza A and against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid. But the companies are considering adjustments aimed at improving immune responses against influenza B. A Phase 2 study of a second-generation formulation of the combination vaccine did result in an immune response against influenza B that was similar to an approved vaccine, as well as a more pronounced response to influenza A than the approved flu vaccine.advertisement Bavarian Nordic, one of the few companies with an approved mpox vaccine, says it will be able to meet the immunization needs of African nations in the throes of an mpox outbreak, STAT tells us. “By the end of this year, we could manufacture another 2 million doses. And by the end of next year, it’s 10 million in total,” said Bavarian Nordic chief executive officer Paul Chaplin. The vaccine developer has about 300,000 doses ready for shipping immediately. The World Health Organization declared the fast-spreading outbreak a global public health emergency on Wednesday. The Africa Centres for Disease Control deemed the potentially deadly virus that has swept across at least six countries a continent-wide emergency a day earlier.

Frenck Jr, MD, FAAP What do COVID-19, Lyme disease and influenza have in common? All are zoonotic infections typically found in animals—but they can spread to humans. Pigs and birds​ are the two main animal hosts for influenza. Influenza virus infects the animal and reproduces in its cells. Swine flu in pigs causes symptoms that are similar to flu in humans: a respiratory infection that may include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. Swine flu viruses spread year-round in pigs. But just like influenza in people, cases of swine flu usually occur more commonly in late fall and winter.Infections with flu viruses that spread from pigs to people happen every year, often at agricultural fairs. In July 2024, swine flu was reported in a child in Colorado and an adult in Michigan. The child developed an infection after attending an agricultural event. They did not require hospital caer for the infection. Public health experts are still investigating the cause of infection in the person in Ingham County, Michigan.Some people are at higher risk of serious illness from zoonotic diseases like swine flu: children younger than age 5 years; people with certain long-term health conditions like asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions;pregnant women and people age 65 years and older.How does swine flu spread to people?Rarely, swine flu spreads from pigs to people and on occasion, people can spread flu to pigs! Most commonly, infected pigs spread the virus to people who have direct or indirect contact with: pig saliva, urine, feces, blood other fluids, scratches and bites from a pig, or by eating or drinking contaminated food or water (for example, eating or drinking with unclean hands after touching a pig at a fair). However, if meat from pigs is handled and prepared properly, there is no evidence that you will catch swine flu by eating pork. Infections that spread to people often occur through close contact with infected pigs. For example, the virus has spread in pig barns and at livestock exhibits at fairs. The virus can spread through the air when infected pigs cough or sneeze. People also can get infected from droplets of infected pigs that land in their nose or mouth and if they breathe infected droplets in the air. The infection also can spread to a person if they touch a surface with virus on it and then touch their mouth or nose. Most of the time, even if the varieties of flu found in birds and swine do infect a person, it is not common for those people to spread the virus to others. But if you are at high risk for zoonotic diseases such as swine flu and you plan to attend a fair where pigs are present, you should avoid direct contact with pigs or their barns. What precautions can families take if they have contact with pigs?People who have contact with pigs should follow precautions to avoid the spread of germs: Do not eat or drink or put anything in your mouth in pig barns or show arenas. Do not take toys, pacifiers, cups, bottles, strollers or similar items into pig barns and show arenas. ­Make sure children wash their hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel after touching pigs, corrals or fences, food and water dishes and other surfaces. 2009 swine flu pandemic: lessons learnedSwine flu from the influenza A virus has caused a pandemic in humans in the past. For example, in 2009, a new flu virus that was originally in swine was identified in California. It quickly spread throughout the country and the rest of the world. All ages of people were infected. Children and young adults were at higher risk—possibly because they were less likely to have immunity from a past infection. To control the pandemic, the United States used effective strategies, including: Short-term school closure: 600,000 children from 980 schools were affected. Vaccination and antivirals: An H1N1 influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir) were made available.In total, 60 million people were infected, 274,000 were hospitalized and 12,469 died from the virus in the United States. It took a combination of public health measures to ease the pandemic. H1N1 viruses continue to circulate to this day.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, announced it will spend $5 million to buy seasonal flu shots for livestock workers. CYNTHIA GOLDSMITH, JACKIE KATZ/CDC VIA AP Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. will pay for flu shots for farmworkers this year, a strategy to prevent bird flu from changing into something more dangerous.Dairy and poultry farms are dealing with outbreaks of bird flu, and 13 workers have picked up infections. All cases are mild and are believed to have spread directly from infected animals to people.But health officials are worried about what might happen if people are infected with bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time. It's possible the viruses could swap gene segments, in a process that scientists call reassortment. Bird flu, for example, could gain the ability to spread as easily among people as seasonal flu does.To prevent coinfections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said it will spend $5 million to buy seasonal flu shots and get livestock workers vaccinated this fall, working with state and local officials. Another $5 million will be spent to promote the shots.“We want to do everything we can to reduce the risk that the virus may change," said the CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah.Seasonal flu shots do not protect against bird flu. But they might reduce coinfections, he said. The CDC is also discussing the possibility of offering some farmworkers the antiviral medication Tamiflu to prevent getting the flu, Shah said.U.S. officials say there are at least 200,000 livestock workers in the country. According to the National Center for Farmworker Health, about a quarter of livestock workers typically get a seasonal flu shot.Production of a limited amount of bird flu vaccine for people is underway, but the government is not recommending it for farmworkers. There isn't the kind of person-to-person spread that would trigger that kind of vaccination campaign, Shah said.A bird flu virus has been spreading since 2020 among mammals — including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises — in scores of countries. Earlier this year, the virus known as H5N1 was detected in U.S. livestock.

These results come two months after Moderna’s combination vaccine succeeded in its Phase 3 trial. By Frank Vinluan on August 16, 2024 Share Share Options Share a link too this article Copy Link Copy Link Email Facebook LinkedIn X A messenger RNA combination vaccine that Pfizer and BioNTech are developing for both Covid-19 and influenza posted mixed results in a pivotal study, meeting just one of the two main goals assessing the shot’s ability to trigger an immune response, the companies announced Friday. The vaccine combination pairs an experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine candidate with Comirnaty, the FDA-approved Pfizer and BioNTech mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. The Phase 3 study enrolled more than 8,000 adults ages 18 to 64, randomly assigned to receive either the experimental combination vaccine or a licensed influenza vaccine and Comirnaty given in the same visit. Without providing specific figures, the companies said the combination vaccine elicited “robust responses” to influenza A. But against the influenza B strain, the combination vaccine showed lower marks on measures of antibody response. In Covid-19, response to the combination vaccine was comparable to Comirnaty. Sponsored Post The Future of Hospitals and Pharma Companies Will Depend on Strength of Healthcare Analytics Insights PurpleLab® stands out from others in this sector by providing its data analytics services to several different groups of users across healthcare and pharma companies. By Stephanie Baum No safety signals were reported for the combination vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech said they are evaluating adjustments to the combination vaccine to improve immune responses against influenza B and will discuss with regulators the best way to proceed. “We are committed to developing vaccines that will reduce the burden of respiratory diseases and believe that combination vaccines are the most efficient way to do this,” Annaliesa Anderson, senior vice president and head, vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in a prepared statement. “Today’s results provide insight and direction towards achieving this goal, and we remain optimistic about our combination Covid-19 and influenza program, for which we are evaluating the next steps.” The two types of influenza that cause seasonal disease are influenza A and influenza B. Of the two, influenza B is less common. Influenza B has been a tough target for vaccine developers. Last year, an experimental Moderna mRNA vaccine posted positive data against influenza A but disappointing results against influenza B. However, in June, Moderna reported preliminary data showing its experimental flu and Covid-19 combination vaccine met the main goal of a Phase 3 test, including positive marks against both influenza A and influenza B. Meanwhile, an experimental mRNA influenza vaccine developed by partners CureVac and GSK posted preliminary Phase 2 data in April showing it did not beat comparator vaccines. This seasonal flu vaccine is now in the hands of GSK, which last month agreed to pay CureVac €400 million (about $431 million) to acquire that program, a Covid-19 vaccine, and an avian influenza vaccine.

By Eve McDavid - CEO of Mission-Driven Tech {The following two paragraphs added with analyst comments.} In a note sent to investors Friday, William Blair analyst Myles Minter said the disappointing trial result for Pfizer and BioNTech gives Moderna the clear lead in developing an mRNA flu/Covid-19 combination vaccine. Even if the partners are successful in tweaking their combo vaccine and running another clinical trial as Moderna did, that work could put them about eight months behind. But Minter isn’t writing off the Pfizer and BioNTech combo vaccine. “However, considering the modularity and flexibility of mRNA vaccines, combined with the relatively short trials required to demonstrate immunogenicity and gain accelerated approval, we are not ready to rule out BioNTech/Pfizer from a competitive standpoint, and they remain a material competitive threat in the commercial vaccine space given ex-U.S. Covid-19 market dynamics and contracting,” Minter wrote. Pfizer has other standalone influenza programs still in development. The pharmaceutical giant previously reported positive preliminary Phase 3 results for a first-generation quadrivalent mRNA flu vaccine tested in adults ages 18 to 64. However, this vaccine did not meet efficacy goals in adults age 65 and older. Pfizer then developed second-generation influenza vaccines intended to offer a better immune response and breadth of protection. These programs include new trivalent influenza mRNA vaccine candidates. Pfizer said a Phase 2 test of these second-generation influenza vaccines demonstrated robust influenza A and B responses. The company added that data in participants age 65 and older will become available at a later date.

The world is currently seeing the fastest-spreading, largest-ever outbreak of H5N1, a highly contagious, deadly strain of avian influenza. Scientists say this virus now presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity, with the risk to humans rising as it continues to leap the species barrier, reaching new host species. 12 August 2024 16 min read by Mongabay More than 95% of southern elephant seal pups (Mirounga leonina) born in 2023 perished in that year from the deadly outbreak of avian influenza. Image © Antonio Alcami. H5N1 has already impacted at least 485 bird species and 48 mammal species, killing seals, sea otters, dolphins, foxes, California condors, albatrosses, bald eagles, cougars, polar bears and a zoo tiger. Since it broke out in Europe in 2020, this virus has spread globally. Carried by birds along migratory pathways, it has invaded six continents, including Antarctica.This current H5N1 animal pandemic (or panzootic) was caused by humans: A mild form of avian flu carried by wild birds turned deadly when it infected domestic poultry. Many industrial-scale poultry farms adjoin wetlands where migrating birds congregate, facilitating rapid spread.The toll on some bird and mammal populations has been devastating. With continued outbreaks, some imperiled species could be pushed to the brink, with wildlife already fighting to survive against a changing climate, disappearing habitat and other stressors.Brown skuas and south polar skuas, two gull-like species that nest in Antarctica, are sometimes called the “pirates of the Southern seas.” These migratory seabirds are fierce, competitive predators that hunt or scavenge anything, from eggs and adult birds to seafood, mammals or garbage.“They’re really tough animals — and they’re dying,” says Antonio Quesada, director of the Spanish Polar Committee.He gravely recounts why this season’s field work in the Antarctic was like no other: A lethal strain of avian flu, H5N1, breached this fragile ecosystem in February. Only a handful of specially trained researchers were allowed onshore in outbreak sites, garbed in hazmat suits to prevent contagion and spread.The true scale of the event is still unknown, but reports were grim. In the Falkland Islands, H5N1 killed 10,000 black-browed albatross and ravaged a gentoo penguin colony. Scientists discovered a mass skua die-off: 50 carcasses littered a Beak Island nesting colony of 130.Quesada has rarely seen a single dead skua in 20 years’ work in Antarctica. “They’re an indicator species. If they’re dying, what does it mean for other birds?” he asks.The threat posed by H5N1 extends far beyond the frozen South. Few people realize that the world is currently gripped in another serious pandemic — or, to be exact, a panzootic, the animal equivalent. This virus has now infected more than 500 bird and mammal species.

Image © Martin Brogger. The world’s animals in troubleSince it emerged in 2020 in Europe, this “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)” strain has blazed a trail of death across the planet, the largest outbreak in history. The virus is both lethal and unusually transmissible, jumping between birds, mammals and livestock with frightening agility.Experts say the threat to humans is rising. Many countries are increasing surveillance and developing or buying vaccines. Cases are ticking up in the U.S.: Four people contracted the virus from cows and 10 others caught it from chickens.Meanwhile, it continues to devastate wildlife, including many endangered animals, says Chris Walzer, executive director of health at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. As of March, H5N1 had leapt the species barrier to infect some 485 types of bird and at least 48 mammal species, according to United Nations estimates. Many of these species had never been diagnosed with avian influenza before.The disease has infiltrated even the most remote regions on six continents. When a polar bear in Alaska succumbed in 2023, it marked the first detected mammal death from avian flu in the Arctic. Thus far, only Australia and the Pacific Islands have been spared. And the virus is still on the move, spreading to new hosts as it evolves and picks up genes from other bird flu strains.Victims have died in staggering numbers, especially animals that congregate in large groups like pinnipeds. The virus swept along South America’s Atlantic and Pacific coastlines, slaying more than 30,000 sea lions in 2022-23. It then killed some 17,000 Southern elephant seal pups on Argentina’s Península Valdés — the species’ largest die-off ever.H5N1 has been carried worldwide by migrating birds. But new research shows that this current strain (dubbed clade 2.3.4.4b) can now spread directly between mammals, with frightening implications. It seems that “H5N1 viruses are becoming more evolutionarily flexible and adapting to mammals in new ways,” the study’s authors write, which “could have global consequences for wildlife, humans, and/or livestock.”Walzer warns, “H5N1 now presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity.” Worldwide, seabirds have been particularly hard hit by this avian flu panzootic, including terns (Sterna hirundinacea) pictured here that died at Punta Leon in Argentina. Image © Marcela Uhart, UC Davis. A human-caused problemIt’s important to understand that this panzootic “is a man-made problem,” says Vincent Munster, who heads the Virus Ecology Section at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Avian flu is not uncommon in wild birds, particularly in its natural hosts: ducks, geese, gulls, terns, swans and other waterfowl. They carry a low pathogenic form, a mild virus that may be asymptomatic. It spreads seasonally, when multiple species congregate at migration stopover sites or cluster together to nest.But when avian flu spills over into poultry, it can morph into a highly contagious, fatal virus.The current panzootic began when this H5N1 strain jumped from domestic poultry back into wild birds — which happened because of modern livestock production methods. Humans further facilitated spillover by destroying wetlands, which crowds migrating birds into small scraps of habitat, often with poultry farms nearby.When farms encroach wetlands, it creates the perfect interface for this type of virus, Walzer says. It’s a veritable petri dish of opportunity for avian flu to swap genes and mutate into potentially more virulent or transmissible strains. This environment allowed the virus to infect chickens, geese and ducks –– and jump back into the wild in a virulent form.“The emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza is a direct result of commercial, large-scale poultry farming,” Munster says. There are more than 34 billion chickens on Earth, according to Food and Agriculture Organization estimates.The U.S. Delmarva Peninsula offers a prime example of farm-wetland overlap. It’s both a migratory stopover and a wintering ground along the North American flyway on the nation’s Mid-Atlantic coast. It’s also the site of a $4.4 billion poultry industry that raised 600 million chickens in 2023. H5N1 has hit there — and across the globe. In Cambodia, for example, farmers that raise their ducks and geese in wetlands have also seen outbreaks.The virus is now spreading among cows, infecting at least 171 herds in 13 U.S. states. It thrives in udder cells, and RNA from H5N1 has been found in milk.Another serious concern: H5N1 has not petered out between spring and fall migrations, like avian flu normally does. It’s now endemic in Europe and North America. When that happened, Walzer says, “people began worrying that it’s not going to go away anymore.”It has flared for four years straight now, with wild birds currently carriers, reservoir hosts and victims of the virus.Super-evolution: A brief history of a deadly global scourgeH5N1 isn’t new. In 1996, a goose in China’s Guangdong province may have been “patient zero” for the current strain, which spread among the flock and passed to wild birds. The virus then morphed into a severe respiratory disease that infected 18 people and killed six in Hong Kong. That outbreak ended after 1.5 million chickens were slaughtered.Next came a “viral chatter” phase. Viruses don’t just break through species barriers. As they change, they make periodic forays into other species, sometimes over years. In most cases, these ventures are unsuccessful. Unless a virus can enter cells and replicate, it circulates harmlessly.Flu viruses mutate rapidly as they acquire genes from other viruses: mixing, matching, reassorting and adapting, says Colin Ross Parrish, a virologist at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Each genetic mutation creates a new building block for evolution: Genetic sequences are cellular instructions. They help a virus evade immunity in a host, determine how it causes infection, how it spreads and much more.Avian influenza’s eight-section genome offers numerous opportunities to reassort its genetics, not unlike a Las Vegas slot machine –– and in 2003, it hit a viral jackpot. Avian flu mutated to successfully spill back from poultry into wild birds, launching the current panzootic.Fast forward to 2020 when H5N1 appeared in its current form in European birds and then successfully infiltrated new species, including mammals. It quickly spread to Africa and the Middle East, as it was carried long distances along migratory flyways. Humans helped by selling and shipping infected poultry across national borders.The virus crossed the Atlantic, reaching U.S. and Canadian shores in late 2021. Soon, mallards and swans were dying in the U.S. Midwest, bald eagles died nationwide, seals perished in Maine, as did bobcats in Wisconsin and raccoons in Washington and Michigan, to name just a few of the many losses.The virus then aggressively invaded South America, targeting birds and sea mammals. Genetic studies on dead seabirds, a dolphin and a sea lion in Peru shed light on H5N1’s movement and adaptations. Researchers discovered that in the U.S., the Eurasian strain added genes; in this form, it expanded its repertoire of hosts and raged like wildfire through large seal and sea lion colonies.H5N1 finally reached both poles. Outbreaks continue to arise nearly everywhere.Portrait of a global killerProximity is a big factor in how viruses spread, as the world learned during the COVID pandemic. Sharing a home or gathering in large groups poses a huge H5N1 risk, says Amandine Gamble, an infectious disease ecology expert at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. To understand where birds go and how they spread H5N1, she is collecting genetic material from various species in the Falkland Islands and outfitting them with tracking devices to follow their movements.Regardless of the location, the virus triggers a systemic infection in birds. They may become lethargic, sneezing, coughing, gasping for air or experiencing intestinal issues. The virus also invades the brain. Sick birds may become disoriented, uncoordinated, stumbling, swimming or walking in circles, trembling or jerking their necks before keeling over dead. Some suddenly die without showing any sign of illness. Survivors may pass the virus to others.Mammals experience many of the same symptoms as birds, but postmortems have also revealed pneumonia and bleeding in the heart, liver and other organs. Autopsies of 55 mammals showed that the most commonly afflicted part of the brain was the frontal lobe, which explains the movement and cognitive symptoms.The genie is out of the bottle, says Waltzer. He emphasizes that the length of the outbreak, as well as the amount of the virus in the environment, is unprecedented. “The sheer global distribution of this virus,” he notes, “is underestimated everywhere — as well as the breadth of ecosystems that are being impacted.”Researchers are deeply concerned by the effects of this red-alert virus: “High pathogenicity H5N1 is a real, tangible threat to wildlife, of a magnitude and scale never seen before,” says Marcela Uhart, who heads the Latin American program at the University of California Davis’ One Health Institute.On a United Nations situation update map, swaths of the world seem untouched, but that is likely because some regions have little or no monitoring for avian influenza, Walzer notes. For example, experts suspect there is vast underreporting in Africa. Many countries have slim resources, so pathogen hunters target the deadliest human threats: malaria. Ebola, Lassa fever and other infectious diseases.Incomprehensible carnageMany pathogens, including avian influenza, are zoonotic: They jump between wildlife, livestock and humans. In recent decades, zoonotic diseases have emerged and spread at accelerating rates. They are frequently fatal and have no cure.As humanity encroaches on wild areas, people, livestock and wildlife come into into unnatural proximity, exposing all to germs they have no immunity to — like avian influenza –– and leave wild animals with ever-shrinking habitat. Add poaching for the illegal wildlife trade, bushmeat hunting, and rapidly changing climate, and it’s no surprise that many species are in serious danger of extinction.H5N1 is the newest threat. “The number of different species being infected is quite profound,” says Emily Denstedt, a health program adviser with the Wildlife Conservation Society.Wild birds are among the most affected animals. This is a major change: previous H5N1 strains primarily attacked poultry. At least 485 bird species from 25 classifications have been infected, including puffins, pelicans peregrine falcons, owls, toucans, parrots, bald eagles, warblers, finches and many others.However, seabirds are by far the hardest hit. H5N1 “super-spreader” events in the U.K. offer sobering examples of the carnage wrought by this virus, though there’s no way to accurately count the casualties.Nesting colonies are now notably emptier in many locations. In Scotland — home to 60% of the world’s great skuas — breeding numbers have plummeted by three-quarters since 2021. Some 16,000 gannets died and the population in Wales dipped to precarious lows not seen since the 1960s. Rangers discovered more than 660 dead Arctic tern chicks in England.During the spring of 2022 in Africa, thousands of birds perished, particularly along the East Atlantic Flyway migration route in Senegal and The Gambia.Later that year, South Africa lost at least 28 African penguins –– a tragedy for these endangered birds.In the U.S., the virus struck Lake Michigan’s Caspian terns, killing 62%. In early 2023, pelicans littered Peruvian beaches; more than 40% of the population died. At least 20 critically endangered California condors perished in Arizona, endangering their perilous recovery from just 22 birds in 1987.So far, seals and sea lions are the only mammals dying en masse. However, the sheer number of affected mammals is worrying, ranging from grizzly bears, lions, pika, cougars, cows and dolphins to domestic dogs and cats, racoons, foxes, sea otters and a zoo tiger. Six dead walruses were discovered in Svalbard in 2023, some 965 kilometers (600 miles) from the Arctic Circle.Uhart explains the broader collateral damage: All species play a role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, and big losses reverberate throughout the entire community. She offers pinnipeds as an example. As top predators, seals, sea lions and walruses keep prey species in check. Without them, previously constrained species multiply, may expand their ranges and displace other animals.“We almost wiped out pinnipeds in the past, hunting them for their fur and their blubber, and they are only now recovering after years of protection,” Uhart says. “We can’t let a disease put them at risk again.”There may be other, less obvious effects on wildlife. Birds that sicken and survive probably won’t fledge young, Munster says, and birds that breed in large colonies may not thrive in smaller groups. Walzer notes that we humans and our monitoring systems are really bad at detecting these more subtle decreases in populations, “And suddenly, they’re gone.”Have you read?Should we be worried about bird flu?The bird flu virus is mutating to infect mammals more easily, raising concerns of a pandemic threatA clouded, potentially deadly futureThe ultimate extent of this global animal apocalypse will hinge on H5N1’s vigor, endurance and adaptability — and importantly, on precisely how it adapts.Much depends on the ways species interact. “Lifestyle impacts the dynamics of how [H5N1] spreads in animal populations,” says Cornell’s Gamble. In close quarters, it passes between birds, but not all develop terrible disease. They may become “silent spreaders.”Another important factor is how animals are exposed — and where. H5N1 is a resilient organism: It replicates in the respiratory tracts of mammals and birds — and in birds’ intestines. Animals can shed virus from infected cells after only six hours.It’s quite hardy and remains infectious in water. One study found that H5N1survived in bird feces for nearly a day in extreme heat (42° Celsius, 107° Fahrenheit), five days in balmy temperatures (24°C, 75°F) and for up to two months in the cold (4°C, 39°F). This strain’s resilience is still unknown.Carnivores and scavengers can catch the virus by eating an infected bird carcass. But researchers have also confirmed that mammals now transmit the virus between themselves, in the wild, on farms and in zoos. It spread on a mink fur farm in Spain (where tens of thousands lived in about 30 barns), among dairy cows in the U.S., tigers in a Chinese zoo and pinnipeds in Argentina. Scientists determined that the strain that killed elephant seals also infected terns –– which could spread it far and wide.Quesada is deeply concerned about the coming breeding season in the Antarctic. Confirmation of the virus in elephant seals “puts us on even higher alert,” he says.Risk to humans grows as the virus racks up an ever-longer list of mammal hosts. Fourteen people have been diagnosed this year in the U.S.; all worked with cattle or chickens. So far, there’s no evidence that the virus can pass directly between humans. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has cautioned public health officials to get ready for a potential spillover. Alert levels will jump if H5N1 becomes airborne, if it can be sneezed out and carried via aerosols or respiratory droplets, Uhart says.A key question remains: As individuals develop immunity, will the virus fizzle out? And if so, when?Predictions for wildlife aren’t good. In places where H5N1 has already invaded, Uhart says, “it will take years, maybe decades or more, for some wild species to recover.” In those locations, she says she believes “it will likely remain, continue to adapt … and evolve into new strains.” She expects recurring deadly waves and “for some species that are currently endangered, just one outbreak may mean extinction.”Munster likens this panzootic to the SARS pandemic — but in wildlife, “with no preemptive, therapeutic or prophylactic countermeasures, like social distancing, masking, vaccines and antivirals.”One strategy, vaccinating poultry against avian flu, could stop or limit the current H5N1 evolutionary pool, Walzer says.For decades, experts have been waving a red flag, trying to gain traction for a “One Health” strategy to prevent future pandemics. It’s a holistic approach, inclusive of human, wildlife, livestock and ecosystem health. Importantly, it incorporates disease risk into decision-making. A One Health approach shifts the onus on officials to prevent diseases before they jump between species, rather than the current model — reacting once a crisis hits. Studies show this to be the most effective and economical pandemic strategy.In December 2021, amid COVID’s mass human mortalities, the WHO and representatives from 194 nations agreed to negotiate a pandemic treaty. But countries have not yet reached an agreement, missing a May deadline to deliver the document at the 77th World Health Assembly. A recent editorial stated that negotiators are “nowhere close to adopting text that will truly prevent consequential pathogen spillovers from wildlife.”With massive industrial livestock operations located within migratory flyways, “We could have seen [this panzootic] coming, but our ability to actually intervene on a legislative and political level is not there unfortunately,” Munster says. “And… [wildlife] is definitely paying the price.”Meanwhile, viral chatter continues to surge, invisible and unabated between domestic and wild species.Citations:Bouvier, N. and Palese, P.

Over the past five months, a mutated strain of the H5N1 influenza virus detected in dairy cattle poses a potential risk for a pandemic-causing virus. Yet governments and international organizations have done far too little to prepare for such a scenario, despite the lessons they should have learned from the global battle with COVID-19.After the COVID-19 crisis revealed the shortcomings of the global public health response system, many assumed that governments and international organizations would strive to fix the most obvious problems. Given the catastrophic human and economic costs of the pandemic, countries had a strong incentive to start spending heavily on developing new generations of more protective influenza and coronavirus vaccines, as well as to greatly expand global manufacturing and distribution networks. But this has not happened. At current funding levels, it will likely take a decade or longer to develop more effective and longer-lasting vaccines. Although there are groups at work on new treatments and other antiviral initiatives, on the whole, global society does not appear to be much more prepared for a future coronavirus or influenza pandemic than it was five years ago.The resurgence of H5N1 influenza in humans and animals has highlighted these failures. Although the virus was identified in the 1990s, over the last 20 years it has continued to mutate, reinventing itself over and over again. Today, it is infecting millions of birds, but it has also become more capable of spilling over into at least 40 species of mammals. It still cannot easily transmit between humans, but infections in dairy cattle, which have influenza receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses in their udders, demonstrate the risk for a new pandemic.It is impossible to know when a new pandemic will arise, or which specific pathogen will be its cause. H5N1 is just one of the viruses that could mutate into something that will start a pandemic. But eventually, one will happen. It is therefore time to move away from vague recommendations and best practices to a far larger-scale program aimed at producing new and better vaccines, antiviral drugs and other countermeasures, and building the infrastructure at the scale needed to protect entire populations. Although such efforts will be costly, failing to take these steps could be catastrophic.THE AVIAN THREATAlthough it has never caused a human pandemic, the H5N1 virus has been on the public health radar for decades. It was first identified in late 1996, when a new influenza virus, initially known as high pathogenic avian H5N1, began circulating in avian species in Asia. Influenza strains are classified by the characteristics of two proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, on the virion particle’s surface. The pathogen gained international attention for causing a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, killing six of the 18 people infected. To control the spread, Hong Kong was forced to cull millions of poultry from its markets and from the supplying farms.In December 2003, H5N1 reemerged. For the next three years, wild birds spread the virus to domestic waterfowl and chickens in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. It also infected a limited number of mammals, including tigers in Thai zoos, and eventually made its way to 148 humans in five Asian countries. Seventy-nine of those cases—53 percent—proved fatal. As the virus spread, public health officials grew concerned that the world was on the brink of a devastating pandemic. In 2005, at the height of that scare, one of us (Osterholm) wrote a Foreign Affairs article explaining how governments should prepare for such a scenario. The essay noted that the World Health Organization’s (WHO) and various countries’ pandemic response plans were vague and did not offer a realistic blueprint for how to get a population through a potential one-to-three-year pandemic. The article recommended an initiative to provide vaccines for the entire world, with a well-defined schedule to ensure that it would be carried out in a timely way.Fortunately, H5N1 did not cause a pandemic in 2005. But in late 2019, a different virus did. COVID-19 was a novel coronavirus—so called because of the protein spikes on the virion surface that give it a corona-like appearance—that began infecting thousands of people in Wuhan, China. Soon, it spread across China, then the continent, and then the world. In its first year, COVID-19 infected hundreds of millions of people and killed at least three million.THE HUMAN MIXING BOWLInfluenza pandemics are not a new phenomenon. From 2009 to 2010, an H1N1 virus—popularly known as swine flu—rapidly spread around the planet, killing an estimated 575,000 people. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 60.8 million people were infected, 273,300 hospitalized, and 12,469 died. This level of morbidity and mortality was tragic, but for a flu pandemic, relatively mild. After all, the 1918 flu pandemic, also H1N1, killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide, or at least 2.7 percent of the world’s population.It might be tempting to conclude that the 2009 pandemic was less deadly than its 1918 counterpart because of 90 years of intervening medical progress, including improved vaccines. Unfortunately, that conclusion is incorrect. The 2009 virus was simply less virulent than the one that spread in 1918. Moreover, the most vulnerable group—people over 65—already had H1N1 antibodies, thanks to previous infections with related viruses. As COVID-19 showed, the world is no better prepared for pandemics today than it was a century ago and, in some ways, is worse off. Today, there are three times as many people as in 1918. Hundreds of millions live close to poultry and pigs. Air travel can transport infected carriers anywhere in the world within hours. (There are more than a billion international border crossings annually.) And global supply chains have created far greater international interdependence. Humanity, in other words, has become an extraordinarily efficient biological mixing bowl as well as a highly productive viral mutation factory.That does not mean an H5N1 pandemic is about to unfold. Both the WHO and the CDC assess the current risk of H5N1 in humans to be low. So far, there is no compelling evidence that the current virus is becoming better at attaching to the receptor sites for influenza in the human respiratory tract, the critical bar H5N1 must clear before it can cause a pandemic. To date, the primary outcome of humans becoming infected with H5N1 in the United States—whether by association with infected poultry flocks or working with infected dairy cows—is conjunctivitis. This is unsurprising since humans have receptor sites in the eye for bird viruses.But nature can change fast. Viruses are constantly mutating and reassorting. Influenza reassortment can occur when a human, pig, or cow becomes infected simultaneously with two different viruses, presenting the opportunity for the pathogens to swap critical genetic segments and create new strains. Although the vast majority of these alterations either have little significance or make the new form less robust and adaptable, occasionally a mutation or reassortment will make a virus more transmissible, dangerous, or both. H5N1 could experience such a transformation at any point, turning the current consensus on its head. And H5N1 is just one of the influenza strains the epidemiology community is closely monitoring.Officials should make no mistake: there will be more influenza and coronavirus pandemics, and any one of them could prove far more catastrophic than the COVID-19 pandemic. Whenever it occurs, it will almost certainly be a virus, primarily transmitted from person to person via the airborne route, a “virus with wings,” meaning the viral particles can be suspended in the air for long periods and distances. When such an outbreak transpires, rapid global transmission will happen before anyone realizes the world is in the earliest days of a years-long pandemic. Governments cannot wait to prepare until a virus is already spreading around the world. As the last five years have shown, even a moderately deadly disease can have enormous health, economic, social, and political consequences.IN SEARCH OF A SILVER BULLETIt is time for all nations to wake up to the danger and prepare for a new pandemic. At the top of the list should be a game-changing improvement in the medical countermeasures that governments put in place to fight influenza viruses and coronaviruses. Specifically, this means vaccines, drug treatments, and diagnostic tests. Improving the design and systems for manufacturing personal protective equipment quickly and in sufficient numbers will also be essential. Governments must begin investing heavily in vaccine research and development, including studies aimed at creating universal influenza and coronavirus vaccines: ones that provide protection against multiple strains of either virus, offer durable protection for extended periods, and can be manufactured quickly and distributed globally.To be fully effective, improved vaccines must be safe and provide multiyear protection against most possible influenza strains. They must significantly reduce the likelihood of serious illness, hospitalization, and death, as well as prevent infection and transmission. Ideally, they should be produced and routinely administered to the general population before a pandemic virus emerges, and be readily available in low- and middle-income countries. Researchers are still a long way from creating such a vaccine, though current developments in the lab suggest it is possible. But at the current level of support for research and development, it could take a decade or more to achieve these game-changing vaccines. With significantly greater government support, this timeline almost certainly could be shortened.The price tag for such measures will be high, and not all of the investment will pay dividends. But a new pandemic could prove far more deadly or costly than a new war, and governments rarely shy away from spending whatever is deemed necessary on new and better weapons. Biological security is just as important as military security, and the United States needs to accept the idea that it would be going to war against a microbial enemy potentially far more dangerous than any conceivable human foe.THE WEAPONS WE HAVEUntil these universal or near-universal vaccines are created, policymakers will need to work with currently available influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. These shots are good, but hardly great. For example, they limited illness and deaths caused by the 2009‒10 H1N1 influenza and the COVID-19 pandemics, but the protection they provide against infection varies widely. Even now, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic illness, disease severity, and hospitalization is largely determined by the viral variant then circulating and whether the infected person is immunocompromised. Similarly, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against illness requiring medical care ranges from less than 20 percent to as high as 60 percent for any given flu season.COVID-19 and flu vaccines also lack durability. In one recent study, the CDC found that COVID-19 inoculations provided approximately 54 percent protection against the need for medical care at an average of 52 days after vaccination. According to a different study, the vaccine loses almost all of its protective powers after a year. Current flu vaccine protection is even shorter, beginning to wane after only a month or two.To keep up, health authorities generally recommend booster vaccines every year for influenza and even more often for COVID-19, with the antigenic component changing to match the most recent circulating strain. But when a reassorted or mutated virus with pandemic potential emerges, it is likely to be significantly different, causing vaccines to miss their targets. That, in part, was why H1N1 was able to spark a pandemic in 2009. The United States has tried to get out ahead of H5N1 by stockpiling 4.8 million vaccine doses, which were recently tested and found to be potentially effective against H5N1 by the Food and Drug Administration. But if a new H5N1 variant were to cause a pandemic, the changes to the virus’s makeup could render the present vaccines largely or entirely ineffective. COVID-19 and flu vaccines lack durability.Even if the vaccine in the current stockpile does prove effective, there are not enough doses to control an emerging H5N1 pandemic. The United States is home to 333 million people, each of whom would need two shots to be fully immunized, meaning the 4.8 million doses on hand would cover only about 0.7 percent of the population. The government would, of course, try to scale up production quickly, but doing so would be tricky. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the first lot of vaccine was released on October 1, almost six months after the pandemic was declared. Only 11.2 million doses were available before peak incidence.Other countries are no better equipped. In a 2019 report, the WHO and three academic centers estimated annual worldwide seasonal influenza vaccine production capacity to be 1.48 billion doses, with potential production capacity to be 4.15 billion doses. That means a maximum of two billion people—25 percent of global population—could be vaccinated in the first year of a pandemic.The WHO’s estimates rely on some optimistic assumptions. In the event of a pandemic, for example, the research assumes that there would be an adequate supply of egg-laying chickens, since fertilized chicken eggs are the vessels in which most influenza vaccines are grown. But since the natural reservoir for all influenza strains is avian, the virus could kill off or otherwise compromise large numbers of chickens. Even if it didn’t, an H5N1 pandemic might erupt when manufacturers are in the middle of their normal, seasonal vaccine production, making it hard for them to rapidly switch. And a pandemic influenza vaccine strain may not grow as well in eggs and cells as do seasonal virus vaccines.The 2019 WHO study also identified several potential bottlenecks. Manufacturers may not have sufficient facilities to put their vaccine into vials or syringes, and there may not be a sufficient and timely supply of those vials and syringes, or of reagents—the chemicals to produce the vaccines. Shipping and administration of shots will be a significant challenge in many low- and middle-income countries. Manufacturers could lack the workforce protection needed to ensure continuous production. And producers may be short on adjuvants, compounds that enhance immune responses. Without them, twice as much antigen would be needed per dose.THE MILITARY MODELPublic health experts and government health officials are aware of the threat of another pandemic and have launched a variety of initiatives to mitigate it. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations—focused on developing vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases—has outlined a plan for delivering “pandemic-beating vaccines” within 100 days of a WHO declaration. CEPI has laid out five areas of innovation needed to make this a reality: creating a library of prototype vaccines for pathogens across multiple virus families, having clinical trials networks at the ready, speeding up identification of immune response markers, building global vaccine manufacturing capacity, and strengthening disease surveillance and global early-warning systems. These innovations, if realized, would greatly improve the world’s pandemic readiness. But with current funding levels, the project’s 100-day target is hugely ambitious and unlikely to be realized over the next decade for either influenzas or coronaviruses. And as public health experts and governments rightly focus on shortening the time from the beginning of the pandemic until the first vaccine doses are available, just as important is how long it takes until everyone is vaccinated.Nonetheless, some important steps forward have been made since the 2019 report. Improvements in mRNA technology, first used to make the most successful COVID-19 vaccines, could help speed up influenza vaccine production. Three Phase 3 trials are underway to evaluate the effectiveness of mRNA influenza vaccines. But no such vaccines are yet ready, and it is unclear when they will be.In response to all these shortcomings, beginning in 2019, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, which one of us (Osterholm) directs, has led an effort to coordinate research and development of new seasonal and universal influenza vaccines. Using a team of 147 multidisciplinary experts, CIDRAP launched the Influenza Vaccines Research and Development Roadmap to advance the scientific and policy knowledge needed to produce better vaccines and track progress. So far, the initiative has identified more than 420 projects that address at least one of these strategic goals, totaling over $1.4 billion, with U.S. government agencies funding approximately 85 percent of these research studies. This is a start toward more effective vaccines, but only a start. Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) provided $176 million to Moderna to develop an mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine aimed at multiple strains of the virus. This effort should improve the speed with which a vaccine can be made available in an emerging influenza pandemic, but it is not expected to improve on the effectiveness of the current generation of mRNA vaccines. Hope is not a strategy.BARDA has recently launched an initiative to develop better coronavirus vaccines and antiviral drugs, called Project NextGen. While it is to be hoped that this effort leads to better and quicker results, the $5 billion government investment—a tiny fraction of what the United States devotes to weapon systems procurement—is only a minimal down payment on the research and development needed to accomplish this important goal. There is nothing currently in the legislative pipeline to suggest that Project NextGen will continue receiving vital government support.Given these shortfalls, it will likely be a long time before scientists develop game-changing vaccines. In the interim, governments will have to dramatically increase the capacity to produce at pandemic scale the vaccines the world already has. This will mean high-income nations subsidizing their own pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and helping middle- and low-income countries establish facilities and train workers to staff them.At first glance, the costs may seem prohibitively high. But consider the stakes. If H5N1, or any other airborne virus that begins to spread in the human population, sparks a pandemic with a fatality rate even three to five percent higher than COVID, the world will be going to war against a terrifying microbial enemy. It would be far more deadly than any pandemic in living memory or any military conflict since World War II. Viewed from that perspective, adopting a military model of planning, procurement, and development is not just rational but essential. Yes, some of the pandemic preparedness projects the government funds may not pan out. Others may never go into use. But governments, and the people who vote them into power, have long accepted that aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and other weapons systems come with enormous price tags and take many years to finance, design, build, test, and commission. And they also accept that some of these arms may sit in storage until they are obsolete. Nations invest anyway, because in war, such weapons become indispensable. It is urgent that governments begin to think the same way about pandemic preparedness.Of course, it is still possible that such a pandemic may never arise—or that it doesn’t occur for many years. But hope is not a strategy. The United States and the rest of the high- and middle-income world need to start devoting the necessary resources to developing better vaccines, treatments, and other countermeasures immediately.

(NYSE: PFE, "Pfizer") and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, "BioNTech") today announced top-line results from their Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the companies’ combined mRNA vaccine candidate against influenza and COVID-19 in healthy individuals 18-64 years of age. The combination candidate consists of Pfizer’s mRNA-based influenza vaccine candidate with the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine. The Phase 3 trial measured two primary immunogenicity objectives (immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 as well as immunogenicity against influenza A and B), of which one was met. In a separate Phase 2 trial, Pfizer evaluated trivalent ("tIRV") influenza mRNA standalone vaccine candidates which demonstrated robust immunogenicity in individuals 18-64 years of age. The companies are evaluating adjustments to the combination vaccine candidate aimed at improving immune responses against influenza B and will discuss next steps with health authorities. Update on Phase 3 Pfizer and BioNTech Combination Vaccine Trial The Phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded study (NCT06178991) enrolled more than 8,000 adults 18 through 64 years of age to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single dose combination vaccine candidate against influenza and COVID-19. In this clinical trial, the vaccine candidate was compared to a licensed influenza vaccine and the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine given at the same visit. The primary immunogenicity objectives were to demonstrate that the antibody responses to influenza (hemagglutination inhibition, "HAI") and to SARS-CoV-2 (neutralizing titer, "NT") elicited by the combination vaccine candidate were non-inferior ("NI") to standard of care ("SOC"). Compared to a licensed influenza vaccine, the tIRV formulation was noteworthy for eliciting robust influenza A responses, including a continued trend of higher influenza A responses versus a licensed influenza vaccine, while it showed lower geometric mean titers ("GMT") and seroconversion against the influenza B strain. In addition, the formulation demonstrated comparable responses against SARS-CoV-2 versus the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine. No safety signals with the combination vaccine have been identified in an ongoing safety data review. Participants who received a licensed influenza and COVID-19 vaccine with co-administration continued to elicit robust immune responses against both influenza and COVID-19 with no safety signals identified to date. Story Continues "We are encouraged by the robust immunogenicity we saw with our combination vaccine against influenza A, which was similar to what we had seen for our initial quadrivalent influenza vaccine where we saw superior relative vaccine efficacy against a comparator flu vaccine," said Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, Senior Vice President and Head, Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer. "We are committed to developing vaccines that will reduce the burden of respiratory diseases and believe that combination vaccines are the most efficient way to do this. Today’s results provide insight and direction towards achieving this goal, and we remain optimistic about our combination COVID-19 and influenza program, for which we are evaluating the next steps." "We are dedicated to developing combination vaccines which provide broader protection against multiple respiratory diseases," said Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. "The insights gained from this combination vaccine trial are highly valuable and will play a crucial role in guiding the further development of Pfizer’s and our combination vaccine program against influenza and COVID-19. We are committed to drawing on our experience in developing mRNA-based vaccine candidates against multiple antigens and believe we can successfully accomplish this task in collaboration with our partner Pfizer." Update on Pfizer's Phase 2 Second Generation Influenza Vaccine Trial Pfizer’s Phase 2 trial (NCT06436703) to evaluate second-generation candidates against influenza was initiated earlier this year and enrolled 450 participants 18-64 years of age, who were randomized to receive investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccines or influenza vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). As previously stated, Pfizer announced positive top-line Phase 3 results from its first-generation quadrivalent ("qIRV") vaccine candidate which achieved the first and only demonstration of efficacy for an mRNA vaccine in a group of study participants 18-64 years of age. The primary endpoints for this qIRV first-generation candidate were not met in adults aged 65 and older, as statistical non-inferior relative vaccine efficacy ("rVE") compared to a licensed influenza vaccine was not met based on the number of cases accrued. Pfizer developed second-generation candidates with the goal of improving immunogenicity and potentially breadth of protection, including new tIRV formulations that matched updated recommendations by the World Health Organization ("WHO") and the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee ("VRBPAC"). The tIRV formulations elicited robust influenza A responses and B responses, including continued trend of higher influenza A responses versus a licensed influenza vaccine. There were no safety signals reported. Data from this Phase 2 trial for adults 65 years of age and older will become available at a later date. Pfizer will also continue to evaluate its influenza vaccine program and discuss next steps with health authorities. About InfluenzaInfluenza causes an estimated 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, 12,000 to 52,000 deaths1 and about $25 billion in economic loss2 in the U.S. each year. People 65 and older are at increased risk of serious complications from influenza, including hospitalization and death.3 Even when a vaccine matches circulating strains well, current influenza vaccines typically confer 40% to 60% protection each year, with even lower protection in years with poor matching of strains.4 The impact of influenza on racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. is even larger. Black Americans are nearly two times more likely than their white counterparts to be hospitalized for influenza while Latino and Indigenous Americans are 1.2 and 1.3 times more likely, respectively.5 With circulating influenza strains continually changing, predicting the best match for the next season’s vaccine is difficult for global health experts as those strains are chosen more than six months before the start of the flu season that they target. The flexibility of mRNA technology and its rapid manufacturing could potentially allow better strain matches in future years, and in a pandemic influenza situation, mRNA technology could enable rapid, large-scale manufacturing of vaccines.

Agriculture Dept. officials said the additional testing will begin in September and continue for the rest of this year. While they said beef and dairy products remain safe to consume, they’re remaining vigilant and acknowledge the spread of bird flu among dairy cattle. Older dairy cattle are often slaughtered for ground beef. The agency’s testing program will focus on beef from those dairy cows. Emilio Esteban, undersecretary for food safety, told reporters on a conference call Aug. 13 the new testing program follows three studies undertaken during the spring and summer that all found beef in the nation’s food supply is safe to eat, according to a report in Government Executive. “However, we want to move forward with an additional step. And what this means is that when those carcasses are tested, they are held and are not going to go into commerce until we get the results back.” Nearly 200 dairy cow herds in 13 U.S. states have contracted bird flu since March after the virus jumped from wild birds to cows, according to USDA data. The agency in May tested 109 beef samples from dairy cows sent to slaughter and found bird flu virus particles in one cow's tissue sample.

Reports of 13 human cases from close contact with dairy animals in the US have cast a spotlight on the evolving nature and zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses. These reports have also raised an alert in organisations working on pandemic preparedness across the world, advocating close monitoring and assessment of current threat levels. While the current avian influenza outbreak in the US poses a low public health threat due to limited human-to-human transmission, we should be attentive to the potential of this zoonotic virus to cause significant disruptions. Spillover of avian influenza from birds to mammals A salient feature that puts this family of influenza viruses in the pandemic watchlist is their ability to cross-species boundaries and mix up their genomes, while continuing to accumulate mutations. These changes can result in viruses that are so different from the circulating/past influenza viruses that previous exposures or vaccinations may no longer work, or the virus may even be able to infect a completely new host with no existing immunity to this virus—resulting in outbreaks and the threat of a pandemic. Figure 1: Avian Influenza detected in mammalian species across the world Source: WOAH Since early 2022, numerous mammalian species around the world have succumbed to avian influenza, caused by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 sub-type of Influenza A viruses. While the primary targets/hosts of HPAI H5N1 (one of the types of the avian influenza virus) are birds, massive deaths of elephant seals and sea lions as a result of an H5N1 outbreak were reported from South America in 2023. As the virus continues to mutate and adapt, monitoring these cross-species transmissions becomes ever more critical. Figure 2: Countries that reported human Avian Flu H5N1 cases to WHO between 2022-2024 Source: WHO and CDC The transmission of the H5N1 virus to humans is rare (Figure 2), typically requiring close contact with infected birds or animals and their secretions. In the 2024 outbreak of bovine HPAI H5N1 affecting 171 cattle herds across 13 states in the USA only 13 cases have been confirmed, and there has been continuous monitoring of people who have interacted closely with animals. The detection of the virus in unpasteurisedaw milk has added another layer of complexity. Although this might sound alarming—heat inactivates the virus in milk, making pasteurisation an effective safeguard. Another intriguing feature of the bovine HPAI H5N1 outbreak in the USA is its genetic distinctiveness. The virus strain causing the outbreak in the Americas belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, setting it apart from its Southeast Asian counterparts. The expansion of this strain likely began with a single introduction from an infected bird in late 2023 or early 2024. This genetic insight has real-world implications for tracking and controlling outbreaks. Genetic sequencing of viruses from the human cases of bovine HPAI H5N1 would help address these questions. Since the range of animals that can be infected by a virus depends on whether or not they have the right binding partner for the virus, changes in what a virus binds to are important to monitor for understanding receptor affinity. A study published in July 2024 found that a HPAI H5N1 virus isolated from a cow from the US 2024 cattle outbreak, was able to bind to the sialic acids expressed in the human upper respiratory tract. If this change is seen frequently it could have implications for human infections. It is also important to monitor the genomes of bovine HPAI H5N1 viruses for emergence and expansion of other mutations that facilitate replication and transmission in mammals. Genetic sequencing of viruses from the human cases of bovine HPAI H5N1 would help address these questions. Preparedness from a global and Indian perspective: From a preparedness standpoint, many countries do have stock-piles of the H5N1 vaccine. A study published in July 2024 confirmed that these vaccines, derived from earlier strains of HPAI H5N1, generated cross-neutralising antibodies against the circulating H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, with seroconversion rates of 60-95 percent in vaccinated individuals after 2 or 3 doses of the vaccines. This suggests that these stockpiled vaccines could serve as bridging vaccines until updated H5N1 vaccines become available. Not all countries have a national stockpile nor is the global capacity currently sufficient for scaling emergency vaccine production and equitable distribution. As part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, the WHO has launched an initiative to advance mRNA vaccine development against human avian influenza. Additionally, Oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu) which has been used in the treatment of human influenza viruses, is currently being recommended for both the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of HPAI H5N1 in the US. The limited availability of genetic data from these outbreaks hampers our ability to understand the local circulation of the virus and monitor its evolution. Globally, avian influenza outbreaks in birds are a regular occurrence. In India several states, including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Jharkhand, are grappling with ongoing outbreaks in birds. While there have been no human cases of H5N1 reported in India, a case, of H9N2 was recently confirmed in West Bengal. The limited availability of genetic data from these outbreaks hampers our ability to understand the local circulation of the virus and monitor its evolution. This gap in data means that we do not know if the avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is present in India nor do we have adequate genomic surveillance in place to monitor introduction and spread. On the other hand, India is a long-standing contributor to WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), with National Institute of Virology recognised as a WHO National Influenza Centre (NIC) since 1980. India also has at least three (as of 2019) manufacturers of influenza vaccines and multiple companies that produce generic versions of Tamiflu. A key gap for a public health response is going to be the absence of timely surveillance data signalling a local outbreak. This is primarily due to two reasons, one being the non-availability of H5N1 diagnostic kit and the other being delays in genomic sequencing. India does have an Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (2021) with a focus on animals. Towards the end of 2023, the WHO organised a regional workshop on Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative. Subsequently India initiated the development of a National Preparedness Plan for Respiratory Viruses in alignment with WHO-PRET. If the technical packages and proposed networks assist with simulations and drills for testing the system, it could prove to be an invaluable framework helping the country address gaps in preparedness. India does have an Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (2021) with a focus on animals. India’s pandemic threat level from bovine HPAI H5N1 does seem low from the available data. However, India has one of the largest livestock populations in the world. Consequently, the situation across the world does warrant a call for an integrated effort with transparent data sharing among stakeholders both in animal health and public health. Multiple initiatives such as the One Health framework being formed in are key in developing tools and strategies for early detection of an outbreak, preventive measures and an outbreak response that spans/considers multiple species.

Beaty/DenveriteA feral cat that lives in a Commerce City neighborhood. Dec. 17, 2021.Colorado’s outbreak of H5 bird flu is now showing up in another animal species: cats.Six feline cases of Influenza A (also known as HPAI, Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu H5N1) have been diagnosed in domestic cats in Colorado so far this year. That’s according to the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association’s website.At least five of the cases were located in Northern Colorado, in Larimer, Adams and Morgan counties, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture website tracking the virus in mammals.The site also documents the broad reach of the virus into a wide variety of species. Since 2022, the virus has been detected in the following Colorado mammals: deer mouse, house mouse, desert cottontail, prairie vole, raccoon, striped skunk, red fox, mountain lion, bobcat and black bear.“It's just remarkable how fast and furious it's moving. So I hope we can get a handle on it soon,” said Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian with RSM Consulting who has worked with both dairy cows and poultry, which have been hard hit by the virus this year.No known human cases of H5N1 have been linked to exposure to infected cats, according to the state health department. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to state that the risk to the general public is low, according to a spokesperson for the state health department.“People with direct contact to infected cats should be considered at the same risk as those in direct contact with other infected animals, such as cows or poultry,” she wrote in an email. “The risk of human infection from contact with cats is not well understood."The five cases listed on the USDA website are all of the same strain, H5N1, which raises the level of concern, according to May Chu, an epidemiologist and clinical professor from the Colorado School of Public Health. She suggested more testing is needed, in particular, sequencing of the full genome of these strains to investigate the chain of transmission.The details regarding H5 bird flu in domestic cats on the CVMA website said two of the six cases were “indoor-only cats with no direct exposures to the virus,” according to the post.Three were “known indoor/outdoor cats” that hunted mice and/or small birds as prey and also spent time indoors with their owners. “I think the link is potentially here with the house cats that don't go outside is we're seeing a lot of mice that are testing positive for H5N1,” said Russo. “So I wonder perhaps if these wild mice populations are picking up the virus and then bringing that into the houses. Because in Colorado we tend to see mice get in fairly frequently, especially as the weather shifts.”Or perhaps owners are feeding the cat a raw diet or the owner thinks of their cat as an indoor cat, but it actually does spend time outdoors. Still, “the indoor-only cats is what's pretty concerning,” said Russo. Cat owners, especially those living closer to agricultural communities, should “probably try to keep your cats indoors a little more than what you have done in the past, given the increased risk and respond fairly quickly if you start to see signs” of illness. The best advice for people to avoid infection, or control it, is to limit contact between pets and wild birds as well as ill livestock and places that could be contaminated with the virus, according to the CVMA. People should consider changing clothing and shoes after interacting with animals or birds with unknown health status, and before interacting with personal pets and wash hands thoroughly after touching or interacting with animals outside their home. Also, avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.The association also recommends you contact a veterinarian immediately if your pet has decreased energy and appetite, which progress to neurologic signs like a lack of coordination, inability to stand, tremors, and seizures. The cat may also show respiratory signs, including nasal mucus coming out of the nose, coughing, or sneezing.Russo urges cat owners to especially look out for those neurologic symptoms.“As soon as you start to see that progression, which is fairly rapid from what I've understood, get that animal into the veterinarian and alert your veterinarian that you are seeing symptoms that could be indicative of influenza infection,” Russo said. “And it's really important that the owners and the veterinarians observe utilization of proper PPE because this is in fact a zoonotic infection,” meaning it can jump from animals to humans. “People need to report if their cats especially get sick, and it may look like rabies, it may look like other diseases that cats can get, like hantavirus,” said Chu. “Those cats need to be seen by the vet to rule out that it's not influenza.”Colorado is clearly a hot spot for avian flu in 2024, mostly in domestic dairy cattle in commercial dairy herds, with the virus spilling over into mammals and wild birds on or near those farms.The state has recorded 10 cases in humans, nine in poultry workers and one in a dairy farm worker. Their symptoms were mild and no one was hospitalized.Half the state’s dairy herds are infected with the virus. The spread into poultry operations has led to the culling of millions of infected birds.Public health officials say the risk to the broader public is low and there’s no sign of human-to-human transmission.Still, the ongoing spread into more types of mammals adds to the risk that the virus could eventually mutate into a strain that spreads in humans or causes more severe disease. And there’s still a lot of mystery about exactly how it’s being spread.According to the Veterinary Medical Association site, five of the cases have shown similar clinical signs and progression of the disease progression: at first lethargy and a lack of or reduced appetite, followed by progressive respiratory signs in some and “fairly consistent progressive neurologic signs in most.” The site also notes that the strain of the H5 bird flu virus is now spreading in animals that historically were not reservoirs for the virus. It also says this line of virus has not currently been detected in migratory waterfowl.The CVMA site also provides more recommendations for veterinarians evaluating feline cases of H5 bird flu infections.The CVMA website directs questions from vets to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s zoonoses team at [email protected] or the Animal Health Division with the Colorado Department of Agriculture at [email protected].Coloradans can find information about when and where the feline cases were detected on the USDA’s HPAI Detections in Mammals webpage. Also, the state health department suggests veterinarians assessing HPAI in domestic felines, check out CVMA guidance.Related storiesAs Colorado’s bird flu outbreak continues, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urges Coloradans to be preparedEverything you need to know about the bird flu outbreak in ColoradoCommercial dairy cow farmers in Colorado must now test herds weekly for avian flu Colorado has the most cases of bird flu among dairy cows in the U.S.You care.You want to know what is really going on these days, especially in Colorado.

This innovative approach, tested on pigs, has shown promising results in inducing a strong immune response and preventing infection. What are vaccinations? Vaccinations are a cornerstone of modern medicine, protecting individuals and communities from preventable diseases. They work by exposing the immune system to a weakened or inactive form of a virus or bacteria, enabling the body to develop immunity without experiencing a full-blown illness. This protection is crucial in preventing outbreaks and safeguarding public health. A combined approach: Two-step vaccination The new vaccination method involves a two-step process. Firstly, an intramuscular injection primes the immune system with a viral vector vaccine. This is followed by a nasal spray containing a live-attenuated flu vaccine. This combination has proven to be highly effective in protecting against the flu virus. Traditional flu vaccines often offer limited protection, especially against emerging strains. Live-attenuated vaccines, while more effective, carry the risk of transmission. The two-step strategy addresses these challenges by providing robust immunity while minimizing the risk of viral spread. Promising results The study, conducted on pigs, demonstrated complete protection against influenza infection in animals vaccinated using the two-step approach. This is a significant improvement over previous vaccination methods. Additionally, the researchers found that the vaccine significantly reduced the shedding of the virus, minimizing the potential for transmission. The path forward While further research is necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of this approach in humans, the results are promising. The development of a more effective and long-lasting flu vaccine could significantly impact public health. This innovative vaccination strategy offers hope for better protection against influenza and its potential to cause widespread illness.

Here’s how to tell what your symptoms mean and what to do if you actually do have the flu.ByPaula DerrowMedically ReviewedbyMichelle Seguin, MDPublished on August 13, 2024Feeling flu-y? The only way to know for sure is to get tested.iStockDuring the height of summer, it doesn’t seem right (or fair) to come down with what may seem like the typical signs of flu: any combination of chills, cough, fever, a runny nose, fatigue, a sore throat, and even gastrointestinal issues among other troublesome symptoms.But can you really get the influenza virus in summer in the United States — or could you have a different kind of illness, like COVID-19? Here experts share insights.You Can Get the Flu in Hot Weather, but It’s UncommonIf you live in the United States or elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s unlikely you’ll be struck down by flu in summer.“One of the great things about influenza is that it tends to be seasonal and predictable, surging in fall and winter in the United States,” says Geeta Sood, MD, an infectious disease physician and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Maryland.Why isn’t there more flu in summer? “It’s probably a combination of both human behavior [people tend to congregate outdoors in warmer weather, where flu spreads less easily] and the nature and characteristics of the virus itself during different seasons,” says Dr. Sood.Another possibility: “It could also be that many of us have already been exposed to flu during the fall and winter, so we have antibodies left over from the recent season — or from the flu vaccine,” says Sharon Nachman, MD, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital in New York.That doesn’t mean influenza completely disappears in the summer. “The flu doesn’t take a vacation,” says Dr. Nachman. People can and do get sick with the flu year-round.For instance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that during the week ending August 3, 2024, only about 0.6 percent of flu tests came back positive.[1]In contrast, during a random week in January 2024, roughly 14 percent of people tested for the flu actually had it.[2]Symptoms of Summer FluIf you do wind up getting the flu in summer, symptoms tend to be milder than in winter.“Someone with the flu may be slightly more likely to have muscle aches and less likely to have a runny nose than someone who has rhinovirus [a cause of the common cold],” says Sood. “But the symptoms are not reliably different enough to be able to tell without a test.”“In general, respiratory viruses tend to look and act the same way, whether you’re talking about flu, RSV, COVID-19, enteroviruses, or rhinoviruses,” says Nachman. Nasal allergies can also mimic symptoms of viral infection.“These things all tend to produce the same sneezy, cough-y symptoms, which means you usually can’t tell what a patient has just by looking at or listening to them,” says Nachman.“The only way to tell for sure whether someone has the flu is to give them a flu test,” she adds.How to Know for Sure if You Have FluRetail pharmacies, urgent care centers, doctor’s offices, and community clinics can administer a flu test (possibly combined with a COVID-19 test) if you are showing symptoms. For at-home use, the LUCIRA by Pfizer home test and Pixel by Labcorp home collection kit use nasal swabs to determine if you have flu, COVID-19, or (with Pixel) RSV.Don’t dally in taking action. “Especially for older adults and people with multiple medical problems or those who are immunocompromised, it makes sense to find out what you have so you can get treatment with antivirals, ideally within 48 to 72 hours of first experiencing symptoms,” says Sood.Treatment for Summer Flu and When to See a DoctorAs with COVID-19, whether or not to get medical treatment for flu depends on your age, general health, and any underlying health issues you might have.“If you’re young and healthy, you may not want to opt for an antiviral like Tamiflu, since it can cause gastrointestinal side effects,” says Nachman. On the other hand, “If you’re an 80-year-old with chronic lung disease, it might make sense to take an antiviral within the first 48 to 72 hours.”The flu can cause serious and even life-threatening complications that warrant a trip to the doctor. Nachman recommends seeing a healthcare provider if you’re wheezing, can’t keep fluids down, have difficulty walking up stairs because you can’t catch your breath, or have a fever.“Most adults don’t get fever very often compared with children,” says Nachman. “So when an adult has a fever, even just 99, that may not tell me that they have the flu — but it does tell me that they’re sick.”How Long Does Summer Flu Last?No matter the season, most people who get the flu and are not at higher risk of complications tend to start feeling better in anywhere from two or three days to two weeks, according to the CDC.[3]In addition to prescription medication (if needed), you can also manage summer flu symptoms with the following measures:Stay hydrated. The best treatment for any respiratory infection, flu or not, is to “aggressively hydrate,” says Nachman. (Chicken soup counts, even in August!)Get plenty of rest.Take long, steamy showers, and breathe deeply to ease chest congestion and cough.Try a little honey. “We do have evidence that honey can help reduce symptoms of a cough,” says Sood.[4]Use over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen to combat muscle aches, sore throat, and headache.What experts don’t recommend are antibiotics — these aren’t effective against viral infections like flu, only bacterial infections.How to Prevent Summer FluThe best way to avoid flu and other respiratory infections that can happen any time of year is to take precautions that have become commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic.“We know this by now, but I still remind people that it’s important to wash your hands well and frequently; to socialize or work in well-ventilated spaces; and, if you are in a crowded environment, consider wearing a mask. Masks don’t just help prevent COVID-19, they can also help prevent infection with influenza,” says Sood.And when summer’s over? Get your annual flu shot when it becomes available in the fall. It’s the best way to reduce the threat of flu year-round.The TakeawayYes, you can get the flu in the summer, though it’s less common than in the fall and winter. If you feel sick with flu-like symptoms, getting tested will help you figure out the cause, especially since symptoms may overlap with other respiratory illnesses. Remember to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest to support your recovery if you do catch the flu.Resources We TrustMayo Clinic Influenza (Flu)Cleveland Clinic Flu (Influenza) TestU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Flu Symptoms & ComplicationsDartmouth Health How Do You Know If You Have COVID-19, Flu, or RSV?American Lung Association Preventing FluEditorial Sources and Fact-CheckingEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

Prev Next For months, avian influenza has been detected in cattle and chickens across Colorado and now it's been found in six domestic cats, according to the Colorado Dept. of Public Health and Environment. By: Veronica Acosta Posted and last updated DENVER — For months, avian influenza — better known as bird flu — has been detected in cattle and chickens across Colorado but it has now spread to at least six domestic cats, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). One of those infected cats was "directly associated with a known infected commercial dairy facility," two other cases were "indoor only cats with no direct exposure to the virus," and the three remaining were known "indoor/outdoor cats that hunted mice and small birds, but also spent time inside with their owners," the CDPHE said. At least three of the cats infected with bird flu were in Larimer County, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. A fourth cat case was found in Adams County and a fifth in Morgan County. Denver7 has followed how bird flu has developed around Colorado in recent months:On July 3, state officials announced that a Colorado dairy worker was diagnosed with bird flu. This marked the fourth case tied to an unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza among dairy cattle in the U.S. Colorado health officials believe this was the first instance in which avian influenza was likely transmitted from a mammal to a human.Nearly a week later, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis declared a disaster emergency following an avian flu outbreak at a commercial egg facility in Weld County.In mid-July, state health officials confirmed to Denver7 that three poultry workers at a commercial egg-laying facility in Weld County affected by an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza had tested presumptive positive for bird flu. On July 14, health officials confirmed four poultry workers in Colorado had been diagnosed with bird flu.By late July, Colorado announced it would be the first state to mandate testing for H5N1 at dairy farms. Denver7 has a deep dive into what this means here. We also looked into the impact on egg prices here after more than 3.2 million egg-laying chickens had to be culled by the state.Three Colorado poultry workers at a second egg facility tested positive for the bird flu, state officials said on July 25, bringing the total number of confirmed human cases in Colorado to 10 for the year. Dr. May Chu, an epidemiologist at Colorado's School of Public Health, said the infected cats that spent time both outside and inside could have been infected by other animals. "It's very likely that the cats who wander off or wander out may have caught a deer mouse or some kind of forage that they go through and they pick up something from an infected rodent," Dr. Chu said. Dr. Gina Rodriguez, medical director at Evans East Animal Hospital, said symptoms look like a common cold."It can be as vague as lethargy, which is just kind of feeling under the weather," she said. "So, sneezing, eye discharge, nose discharge, coughing." The six domestic cats were only diagnosed after they were tested for rabies first, explained Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist with the CDPHE. "We know that rabies causes neurologic symptoms, and so that can include things like lack of coordination, inability to stand, tremors, or even seizures might occur in cats and so those are the same types of neurologic symptoms that can be seen in this H5N1 influenza infection," she said. Dr. Rodriguez said she hasn't seen or heard of any cases in the Denver area, and both Dr. Herlihy and Dr. Chu told Denver7 these infections aren't something cat owners should panic about at the moment. The cases are rare right now, Dr. Herlihy said, but added that cat owners should stay vigilant, especially for those who work or live near dairy farms. There has been no transmission from infected cats to humans, she said. "When we talk about risk to pets, we know that pets have very close contact with humans, so it's important to know that no human cases of this virus have been linked to exposure to infected cats, so we haven't seen cat-to-human transmission, so that's really important to know," she said. "But we do want people who may have contact with a cat that is suspected to have this infection to take the same precautions we are asking workers on farms to take, and so that's going to include things like PPE wearing masks, gloves, eye protection."

Pregnancy weakens the immune system of the mother, thus making them a vulnerable group that is susceptible to experiencing more severe effects from Covid-19 or influenza infection.

ReportsSeasonal Influenza - Epidemiology Forecast to 2028 Data Insights The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more In the UK, vaccinations against Covid-19 and influenza during pregnancy are highly recommended and included in routine immunisation. The current epidemiology of Covid-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in pregnant women in England and Wales is unknown at a population-based level, as are the disparities in vaccine uptake between subgroups of pregnant women with differing baseline characteristics. Gu and colleagues have undertaken an epidemiological assessment to address this gap in the literature, published in npj Vaccines (2024), with the goal of informing vaccine interventions in the UK and ultimately improving the uptake rate. Data on vaccine uptake in pregnant women in England was obtained from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank for Wales for the period of September 2020 to March 2022.

Of the 178,690 pregnant women eligible for the influenza vaccine, only 41.8% had at least one dose; of the 133,300 eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, 40.2% had at least one dose. Among the 133,140 pregnant women eligible for both vaccines, only 20.5% received both vaccines. Influenza vaccine uptake was highest during September and December of each year. Similar patterns of disparity across baseline characteristics were seen across the influenza and Covid-19 cohorts. Pregnant women of Black ethnicity had a 52% lower rate of receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and a 39% lower rate of receiving the influenza vaccine compared to those in the White ethnic group or those in the Asian ethnic groups. Those of mixed and other ethnicities also had a lower vaccine uptake rate compared to White or Asian ethnic groups, though higher than pregnant women of Black ethnicity. Socioeconomic status played a large and statistically significant role in vaccine uptake; vaccine uptake decreased with increased deprivation levels. Pregnant women from the most deprived areas were 56% less likely to receive a Covid-19 vaccine and 42% less likely to receive an influenza vaccine than pregnant women in the most affluent group. Pregnant women living in urban regions were more likely to receive either vaccine than those living in rural regions. Some inconsistencies between the two vaccine cohorts were witnessed. Pregnant women 40-49 years had the highest vaccine uptake in the Covid-19 cohort but the lowest chance of receiving the influenza vaccine; pregnant women 18-24 years had the lowest vaccine uptake in both cohorts. Women with comorbidities had a higher chance of receiving the influenza vaccine compared to those with no comorbidities. However, this was not observed in the Covid-19 cohort. Continually encouraging the public to keep receiving the Covid-19 vaccination is important in kerbing the spread of infection and minimising adverse side effects in pregnant women. Leading data and analytics company GlobalData‘s epidemiologists estimate that by the end of 2024, 52% of men and women of all ages in the UK will have had their second Covid-19 booster vaccine, and that number is expected to increase only marginally to 53% by the end of 2026. Thus, there is significant room to improve vaccination rates. A meaningful conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that vaccine interventions should focus on vaccine promotion and education in the groups with the lowest odds of receiving either or both of the vaccines. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and rurality are influencing factors that affect the uptake of Covid-19 and influenza vaccines similarly.

Advanced Search Pfizer and BioNTech share late-stage results for COVID-19/flu combination vaccine The combined vaccine approach could simplify immunisation practices and lead to higher uptake Pfizer and BioNTech have announced top-line results from a late-stage study of their mRNA-based combination vaccine for influenza and COVID-19. The partners have been evaluating the candidate against a licensed flu vaccine and their own licensed COVID-19 vaccine given at the same visit in more than 8,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years. The trial met one of its two primary immunogenicity endpoints, with a single dose of the combination candidate demonstrating comparable responses against SARS-CoV-2 versus the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine. Despite eliciting higher influenza A immune responses compared to the standard flu vaccine comparator, the combination candidate showed weaker results against the influenza B strain. The companies said they are now evaluating adjustments to the vaccine aimed at improving immune responses against influenza B and will discuss next steps with health authorities. The combined vaccine approach could alleviate the impact of both COVID-19 and flu while offering a combined administration, potentially simplifying immunisation practices for healthcare providers and patients. Annaliesa Anderson, senior vice president and head, vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said: “We are committed to developing vaccines that will reduce the burden of respiratory diseases and believe that combination vaccines are the most efficient way to do this. “[These] results provide insight and direction towards achieving this goal, and we remain optimistic about our combination COVID-19 and influenza programme, for which we are evaluating the next steps.” Ugur Sahin, chief executive officer and co-founder of BioNTech, added: “The insights gained from this combination vaccine trial are highly valuable and will play a crucial role in guiding the further development of Pfizer’s and our combination vaccine programme against influenza and COVID-19.” The announcement comes just two months after Moderna shared positive phase 3 results for its own flu/COVID-19 combination vaccine candidate. The immune responses from a single dose of mRNA-1083 were found to be non-inferior to the flu and COVID-19 vaccine comparators co-administered in the study, with the candidate also demonstrating statistically significantly higher immune responses against three influenza virus strains and against SARS-CoV-2.

Avian flu (also called Avian influenza A or bird flu) is a virus that is spread from bird to bird. In rare cases, certain strains of the virus can transform into a human virus and spread to people. Most people who get infected with bird flu have close contact with infected birds or bird droppings. It is mostly a problem in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. According to the CDC, in 2024, sporadic cases of a serious bird flu virus have been found in animals in the United States, Canada, and other countries, but the risk to most people is still low. The H5 bird flu is common in wild birds and is causing problems for poultry and dairy cows in the U.S. There have been a few cases of people getting sick from a different type of bird flu, but the illness was not severe. Symptoms of avian flu Symptoms usually appear 2 to 7 days after exposure. They are similar to what you experience with seasonal flu. Common symptoms include: Fever Sore throat Cough Achy muscles Headache Pink eye (conjunctivitis) More serious symptoms can include: Severe respiratory problems (shortness of breath, trouble breathing, pneumonia, serious respiratory distress, and respiratory failure) Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea In some cases, avian flu can cause mental confusion and seizures. At its worst, it can lead to death. As with any flu virus, some people have higher risk of developing a serious illness. These include: Pregnant women People with weakened immune systems Seniors age 65 or older What causes avian flu? The disease is mainly caused by direct contact with an infected bird. This could be through touching or plucking. It is also caused by contact with an infected bird’s saliva or its droppings. This includes swimming in water contaminated with bird droppings. It can also spread if you touch the surface of where an infected bird has been. The virus spreads when your contaminated hands touch your nose, eyes, or mouth. The virus can also be inhaled through small moisture droplets or dust particles. It can only be passed from human to human if it transforms into a human flu virus. This is rare. It is also possible to get the virus from undercooked meat or eggs from infected birds. Meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165° F. Eggs should be cooked until the whites and the yolks are firm. Your risk of getting bird flu is higher if: You work with poultry. You travel to areas where the virus is present. You touch an infected bird. You go into a building that has infected birds or droppings from infected birds. You eat raw or undercooked meat or eggs from infected birds. How is avian flu diagnosed? Avian flu is commonly diagnosed during a visit to the doctor. Your doctor will examine you and ask you questions about your symptoms. They will ask you about recent events that may have put you in contact with a contaminated bird or human. Lab tests are needed to confirm the virus. Your doctor will take a sample of mucus from your nose or the back of your throat with a long cotton swab. That swab will be sent to the lab for testing. Can avian flu be prevented or avoided? The best way to avoid the virus is to avoid direct contact with birds in high-risk areas. This includes when traveling to the countries most affected and visiting live-animal markets. Avoiding contact with a human known to have the virus also is a good way to avoid illness. As with all viruses, regular hand washing is the best way to control your exposure. If you can’t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with your hands. If possible, use a tissue to cover a cough or sneeze. If you know you have the disease, do not expose others at work, school, and the community. Try to separate yourself from the rest of your family at home. People who work with live poultry should follow their work safety guidelines. Because Avian flu is rare, a vaccine to prevent it is not available to the public. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a vaccine they are storing in case the disease becomes widespread in the U.S. Avian flu treatment Some antiviral prescription medicines can lessen or shorten the symptoms of the virus. However, they won’t prevent or eliminate the virus. Doctors treat the symptoms by recommending over-the-counter medicines, extra fluids, and rest. For more serious symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. Hospitalization could involve intravenous fluids (given through a small needle inserted into your vein) and breathing treatments. Living with avian flu Living with avian flu may mean a week or two of living with mild symptoms that get better over time. Rest and fluids will help. Questions to ask your doctor Should I be concerned about catching avian flu if I plan to travel to one of the affected countries? Can you catch avian flu from cooked poultry? How do you tell avian flu apart from normal, seasonal flu? Is avian flu more serious for young children and older adults?

Photo: CanvaA team from the University of Bristol are recruiting UK poultry farmers, bird keepers and others who have contact with domestic and/or wild birds as part of a major avian influenza study.The researchers note that avian influenza is a highly infectious disease that affects domestic and wild birds as well as other animals, including humans. As well as being found all over the world, in 2022/3, highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed on more than 150 poultry farms in England and the UK’s Health Security Agency identified 4 people in contact with birds on infected premises, who had become infected with avian influenza.They want to find out:How important is avian influenza to bird keepers in the UK?What biosecurity measures are being taken to prevent the spread of avian influenza?Are current public health plans scalable given increases in avian influenza infections?What is the best way to engage farmers and bird keepers in a public health response?What might localised avian influenza outbreaks in the UK look like? The Avian Contact Study team say the transmission of the H5N1 virus from either birds or a contaminated environment to humans shows that avian influenza is zoonotic (transmitted to humans by animals), and the potential spread of this virus poses a risk to public health. Therefore, we need to understand how the virus is spread from bird to human and from human to human in order to put control measures and interventions in place to limit its transmission to the wider public.For more updates and articles on avian influenza around the world, click here.The study is being carried out by the Avian Influenza Group at the University of Bristol in collaboration with the Behavioural Science and Evaluation Unit at the University of the West of England under the chief investigator Professor Ellen Brooks-Pollock, professor of infectious disease modelling.As part of their work, they are keen for new farmers and people who work with or own birds in the UK to help improve the study further.Public involvement can involve:Advising on study designShaping the research questions to improve relevanceReviewing study materialTelling people about the studyRecruiting people for the studyAttending study daysWriting blogs or plain English summaries.

Thousands of birds are estimated to have died so far this year.Courtesy of Moss Driscoll via Klamath Water Users AssociationA combination of botulism and bird flu has led to estimates of thousands of birds dying in the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex this summer.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorBirds are dying at the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge in far Northern California. Last week, refuge staff deployed in a boat and collected 500 dead birds from Sump 1A, the largest water body in the Tule Lake Refuge.John Vradenburg, supervisory biologist at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex, suspects they’re dealing with a dual outbreak of botulism and highly pathogenic avian influenza, which was discovered in the refuges earlier this summer.“We’re well-versed in botulism response,” says Vradenburg. “This is a new pressure we’ve never dealt with.”Irrigators and waterfowl advocates are calling for managers at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to release water from Upper Klamath Lake and divert it to the refuges. Refuge staff are hoping the outbreak doesn’t escalate into a repeat of 2020, when 60,000 ducks, geese, and shorebirds died of botulism.“Any of us that had been here in 2020 were like, ‘Oh my god; I don’t want to deal with this again,’” says Vradenburg.Echoes of 2020 outbreakA complex of six wildlife refuges spanning the Oregon-California border, the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex serves as vital feeding and breeding grounds for tens of thousands of birds that use the Pacific Flyway to migrate.The Lower Klamath and Tule Lake Refuges have been teeming with ducks, geese, grebes, and shorebirds this year, thanks in part to a wet winter and a greater allocation of water to the Klamath Project, the management project developed by the Bureau of Reclamation to supply farmers in the Klamath Basin with irrigation water. In spring, the Bureau of Reclamation diverted additional water to the refuges to avoid creating unsafe conditions on the Klamath River while three dams are being removed in Southern Oregon and far Northern California.“Compared to what we can tell from historic records, this is the highest and most diverse waterbird population we’ve had on Tule Lake in three or four decades,” says Vradenburg. He estimates there are about 30,000 nesting grebes on the large water body known as Sump 1A, and 250,000 molting birds and up to 60,000 ducklings on Sump 1A and Sump 1B combined.National wildlife refuges in the Klamath Basin.Winston Szeto / OPBThe refuges rely on allocations from the Klamath Project for water; during the recent drought years, they received virtually none.Tule Lake in particular has transformed, says Moss Driscoll, director of water policy for the Klamath Water Users Association, or KWUA. “What had been a 14,000-acre patch of weeds turned right back into an incredible vibrant wetland.”Related: No bird flu cases in Oregon cattle, although the state is taking precautionsBut after the last water releases from Upper Klamath Lake in May, the wetlands in the refuges began to warm and dry out, heightening the risk for an outbreak of avian botulism.The disease is caused by a toxin produced by a certain species of soil-dwelling bacteria. Birds become poisoned when they ingest infected fish, water, plant matter, or invertebrates. Infected birds experience nerve damage, weakness, and paralysis; often, they drown because they can’t hold their heads up. The disease spreads as birds feed on other maggot-infested bird carcasses.The 2020 botulism outbreak was the worst in refuge history. The next summer, with the region still in the grips of a severe drought, a combination of luck and creative management helped avoid another disaster.The key to preventing botulism “is not letting it get started,” says Driscoll. Wetlands that remain flooded with water circulating through them are less likely to experience an outbreak.On July 12, KWUA sent the Bureau of Reclamation a letter, urging the agency to take action to avoid a disease outbreak on the refuges, and to increase water allocations to irrigators to save this year’s crop harvests.Around that same time, refuge staff started spotting dead and dying eared grebes. All of the samples they collected tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. This disease, also known as H5N1, has been ravaging wild and domestic birds across the globe. In the U.S., bird flu has spread to dairy cows, and there have been several confirmed cases of human infection.The combination of bird carcasses, drying wetlands, and warm water created a “perfect storm” of conditions for botulism, says Vradenburg.A mallard swims in one of the Klamath National Wildlife Refuges in August, 2024 during a botulism and avian flu outbreak.Courtesy of Moss Driscoll via Klamath Water Users AssociationTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThough it’s too late to prevent a botulism outbreak now, the damage could be minimized, say advocates. The Bird Alliance of Oregon (formerly Portland Audubon), California Waterfowl Association, and Ducks Unlimited have all called on the Bureau of Reclamation to divert water to the refuges immediately.Vradenburg says that would help flush water through the system and cool temperatures. Perhaps most importantly, it would flood more wetlands, helping disperse birds across a greater area — an especially important strategy if the bird flu virus is still present.In an Aug. 15 letter, KWUA called for “dynamic operations” to circulate water within and between the various wetlands in Tule Lake Refuge. The organization also urged the bureau to provide more water to the Lower Klamath Refuge to support the thousands of hatchlings there. Otherwise, the letter warned, this wetland could go dry before the birds have a chance to fledge.The Bureau of Reclamation did not respond to JPR’s questions in time for publication.Long-term solution neededThe bureau is tasked with managing flows to satisfy a number of obligations: providing irrigation water to farms in the Klamath Project; maintaining lake levels in Upper Klamath Lake to support endangered suckers (c’waam and koptu, which are vitally important to the Klamath Tribes); and ensuring flows in the Klamath River to support threatened coho salmon. During many years, there’s more demand for water than is available.Spawning adult and young suckers rely on the wetlands along the shores of Upper Klamath Lake; when lake levels drop too low, they can no longer access them. In the past, the Klamath Tribes have expressed support for collaborative solutions that benefit the refuges, but not at the expense of suckers in Upper Klamath Lake. The Tribes also want to make sure there’s enough water to flood a massive 14,000-acre restoration project adjacent Upper Klamath Lake this fall without jeopardizing young suckers in the Upper Klamath Lake wetlands.The volumes being discussed would lower the elevation of the 96-square-mile Upper Klamath Lake by no more than one-tenth of a foot, or a little over an inch, says Driscoll. He says the lake is currently about one foot above the end of season threshold required by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s analysis.Related: US is ‘flying blind’ with bird flu, repeating mistakes of COVID, health experts sayIn the long term, KWUA recommends flowing water from Upper Klamath Lake, through the refuge system, and back to the Klamath River as a way to mitigate future botulism outbreaks in the refuges while supporting agriculture and water quality for fish. Such a scenario would utilize pumping water between Tule Lake and Lower Klamath Refuge via a 4,000-foot tunnel through the base of Sheepy Ridge.“You can run water all the way from Upper Klamath Lake all the way through the Klamath Project down into Tule Lake, pump it over to Lower Klamath, and send it back to the Klamath River,” says Driscoll.This spring, the pump system known as “D Plant” was activated for the first time in four years, diverting water from the already full sumps in Tule Lake Refuge to the Lower Klamath.Vradenburg says refuge staff and many others think this “flow-through” strategy could improve the health of a fragmented wetland ecosystem. “In the long term, if D Plant had the capacity to turn on, it could help flush the system,” he says.In a response to KWUA’s July letter, Karl Stock, regional director for the California-Great Basin region at the Bureau of Reclamation, wrote that “‘flow through’ may have potential to improve project operations and ecosystem health in the future,” but that the proposal needed more analysis.Ducks in flight in an undated photo at one of the Klamath National Wildlife Refuges.Courtesy of Mary Hyde via USFWSAvian flu complicates outbreak responseFor the last two weeks, refuge staff have been surveying the wetlands and collecting dead birds. Vradenburg estimates at least 5,000 have died so far.The likely presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza is complicating how they respond to the crisis. Unfortunately, this means staff can’t set up a rehab hospital to treat birds sickened with botulism, as they have in the past, because they can’t risk people coming into contact with the bird flu virus in a confined area. As it is, refuge staff are following heightened biosecurity protocols when they’re out in the field.“This one’s tough for us; it’s not how we’d like to be doing it,” says Vradenburg. “But we can’t pivot to a new management action until we have results.”Samples have been sent to the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, for analysis. At this time, all of the refuges are still open to the public.Related: Migratory birds could cause avian influenza in Northwest dairy cattleIf there’s a silver lining, it’s that the outbreak has not yet spread beyond Sump 1A at Tule Lake, and numbers of sick and dead birds have not increased significantly from day to day.Cooler temperatures and active management could be helping to dampen the outbreak. Refuge managers have been strategically dewatering smaller wetlands in the Lower Klamath Refuge to keep the largest one filled. Restoration work completed during the drought is helping water flow through parts of the Tule Lake Refuge, which could be helping keep botulism in check there.Refuge staff are holding their collective breath, hoping the thousands of hatchlings and molting birds can weather the threat.“The wetlands are extremely productive right now, and they should be even better next year as water quality continues to improve,” says Vradenburg. “There’s good stuff happening along with the bad stuff.”THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

As of this writing, three people in the U.S. have contracted the H5N1 strain, one person in Mexico has died from the H5N2 strain, and H5N1 has been detected in 118 U.S. dairy herds across 12 states. Thankfully, the disease is not easily transmissible between humans - but some epidemiologists fear that eventually, it will be. Here's what you need to know about bird flu and human health. What Is Bird Flu? Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is shorthand for influenza type A viruses and the illness they cause. Although avian influenza is common in birds, non-avian species can contract it as well. There are many, many different strains of bird flu. However, most strains are what's called low pathogenic, meaning they're either asymptomatic or only cause mild symptoms in birds. For instance, low pathogenic strains of avian influenza, or LPAI, might cause a chicken to have ruffled feathers, or produce fewer eggs than normal. But high pathogenic strains of avian influenza, or HPAI, cause severe and often deadly symptoms in birds. It's important to note, though, that this distinction between LPAI and HPAI strains only applies when avian species contract it. A cow who gets an LPAI strain of bird flu might experience severe symptoms, for instance, while a horse who gets an HPAI strain might be asymptomatic. In humans, both LPAI and HPAI strains of bird flu can cause both mild and severe symptoms. Can Humans Get Bird Flu? We sure can. Bird flu strains are categorized on two different spectrums based on two different proteins on their surface. The protein hemagglutinin (HA) has 18 different subtypes, labeled H1-H18, while the protein neuraminidase has 11 subtypes, labeled N1-11. The two proteins combine with one another to create unique strains of bird flu, which is why strains have names like H1N1, H5N2, and so on. Most of these strains don't affect humans, but a handful of them do. Several strains have been particularly concerning to epidemiologists: H7N9 H5N1 H5N6 H5N2 The current strain of bird flu that's been detected in humans is H5N1. How Do Humans Get Bird Flu? In very rare cases, it's possible for bird flu to pass from human to human. Most of the time, though, humans get bird flu by coming into contact with infected animals or their byproducts. This could mean touching the carcass, saliva or feces of an infected bird; however, bird flu is also transmissible by air, so merely breathing while in the vicinity of an animal with the virus can also be enough to contract it. There are no documented cases of humans contracting bird flu by drinking raw milk, but some recent cases suggest that it may be a possibility. The current strain has been detected in cow's milk, and in March, several cats died after drinking raw milk from a cow who'd been infected with the virus. What Are the Symptoms of Bird Flu? At the risk of stating the obvious, the symptoms of bird flu in humans are generally what one would describe as "flu-like," including: Fever Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Nausea and vomiting Coughing Fatigue Muscle aches Diarrhea Shortness of breath Pink eye Birds who've contracted avian flu, on the other hand, might display slightly different symptoms, including: Decreased appetite Purple discoloration of body parts Lethargy Reduced egg production Soft-shelled or misshapen eggs General respiratory issues, such as nasal discharge, coughing and sneezing Lack of coordination Sudden, inexplicable death Can Humans Die of Bird Flu? Yes. In the three decades since bird flu was first detected, 860 humans have contracted it, and 463 of them died. This means the virus has a staggering 52 percent mortality rate, though there have been no deaths in the U.S. attributed to the most recent spread of the disease here. Who Is Most At Risk of Contracting Bird Flu? Because the disease is primarily transmitted to humans through animals and their byproducts, people who spend time around animals are at the highest risk of contracting bird flu. Wild and farmed animals pose the greatest risk, but even dogs can get bird flu if, for instance, they come across the infected carcass of an animal who had it. Domestic pet owners whose animals don't go outside are not at risk. Occupationally-speaking, the people most susceptible to getting bird flu are those who work in the poultry industry, as they spend a significant amount of time around birds, their byproducts and their carcasses. But livestock workers of all sorts are at a high risk; the first person to test positive for this most recent strain works in the dairy industry, and is believed to have caught it from a cow. Other people who face elevated risks of bird flu include hunters, butchers, certain conservationists, and anybody else whose line of work involves touching potentially infected animals or their carcasses. What's Going on With the Current Strains of Bird Flu? The H5N1 strain has been slowly spreading across the globe since 2020, but it wasn't until March that it was detected in the unpasteurized milk of U.S. dairy cows. This was significant for two reasons: it was the first known instance of that strain infecting cows, and it was discovered in multiple states. By April, it had spread to 13 herds across six different states. Also around that time, humans began contracting H5N1. The first two people only experienced mild symptoms - pinkeye, to be specific - and quickly recovered, but the third patient experienced coughing and watery eyes as well. That may sound like a minor distinction, but because a virus is much more likely to be spread through coughing than an eye infection, that third case has virologists on edge. All three were farmworkers who'd had contact with dairy cows. By May, H5N1 had been detected in the muscle tissue of a dairy cow - though the meat didn't enter the supply chain and had already been marked as tainted, as the cow was sick beforehand - and by June, cows infected with the virus had died in five states. Meanwhile, a man in Mexico died after contracting H5N2, a different strain of bird flu that had never before been detected in humans. It's unclear how he contracted it. To be sure, there's no reason to believe that a widespread outbreak among humans is imminent, or even possible (yet). But the fact that there have been so many bird flu "firsts" in such a short time has many experts concerned, as it raises the possibility that a strain could mutate and become more easily transmissible to humans. While much of the coverage of H5N1 has focused on cows, the current outbreak has wrought havoc on chickens, too: As of June 20, more than 97 million poultry have been affected by H5N1, according to the CDC. Is Drinking Raw Milk An Effective Deterrent Against Bird Flu? Absolutely not. If anything, coming into contact with raw milk increases your exposure to bird flu, not to mention your risk of contracting other potentially serious illnesses. In April, the Food and Drug Administration announced that 1 in 5 milk samples from grocery stores were found to contain traces of H5N1. That's not quite as alarming as it sounds; these milk samples were pasteurized, and preliminary studies show that pasteurization neutralizes, or "inactivates," influenza type A viruses. What's especially worrisome is sales of raw milk have been increasing since the latest bird flu outbreak, spurred in part by viral misinformation spread by health influencers touting raw milk. Could Bird Flu Become a Human Pandemic? Though it's difficult to say for certain, the general consensus in the scientific community is that the extant strains of bird flu are, in their current forms, unlikely to reach pandemic levels. The reason for this is that they almost never pass from one human to another, and are instead contracted from animals. But viruses mutate and change over time, and the long-gestating fear among epidemiologists is that a strain of bird flu will mutate, or undergo a genetic reassortment, in such a way that allows it to be easily transmitted from human to human. If this were to happen, it could very plausibly become a global pandemic for humans. How Is Bird Flu Diagnosed? In humans, bird flu is detected via a simple throat or nasal swab, but infectious disease experts warn that much like the early days of the Covid pandemic, we aren't testing most of the population or measuring disease spread in wastewater. In other words, we don't know for sure whether the disease is circulating. Physicians don't routinely test for bird flu, so you'll have to specifically request a test if you're concerned that you might have it. Do Standard Flu Shots Protect Against Bird Flu? No. The current annual flu shot that we're all encouraged to get protects against the common flu, including swine flu, but not avian influenza. The Bottom Line Development is underway for a new bird flu vaccine, and the CDC says that despite all of these recent developments, the public health risk of bird flu is still low. But there's no assurance that this will always be the case; as a highly fatal virus with multiple, mutating strains, bird flu is a constant looming threat for humans and animals alike.

Lawmakers have proposed the PASTEUR Act to fix the pipeline. New antibiotics are critical but they must be used sparingly, which means private drug companies cannot recoup their investment. David Hyun, director of the Antibiotic Resistance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the bill would establish a subscription model to fund research for certain drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. "It delinks their revenue from the volume of sales and provides an up-front payment to the companies purely based on the value of the public-health value of the new antibiotic," Hyun explained. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said patients in the U.S. contract 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections each year and more than 35,000 of them die. Experts estimate the U.S. spends $4.6 billion a year to treat infections caused by drug-resistant germs. Dr. Sarah Doernberg, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, said the ability to treat infection dictates the safety of all kinds of medical procedures from giving birth to having surgery. "We are able to operate ICUs and transplantation and give chemotherapy agent," Doernberg noted. "All of these things that we do that are very invasive and come with risks of infection, and we need to be able to treat the infections in order to be able to provide modern health care." Despite bipartisan support, a similar bill failed to pass in 2021. Senate lawmakers reintroduced the PASTEUR Act in 2023 with reduced funding but it remains stalled in committee.

It means patients may experience delayed access to treatment. Dr. Mukul Singal, hematologist at the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center in Indianapolis, believes hematologists need to be trained to break the cycle which draws many to only the study of hematology oncology, or blood cancer, after their initial hematology training. "More and more medical students, and even more than medical students, internal medicine residents, need to be exposed to hematology clinics, to inpatient hematology," Singal contended. "Once they go there and they get exposure to that, it is something that draws people in." Singal pointed out one way to meet the need is to increase the number of mentors. He added the American Society for Hematology has started 10 fellowship programs to train 50 hematologists over the next 10 years. Four years of medical school, three years of residency, and two to four years of fellowship for adult, pediatric hematology/oncology or pathology training are required to become a hematologist. Singal argued bureaucrats and decision-makers should allocate more funding for mentoring as a path to increasing the number of hematologists per patient. Doing so would allow more time for patient-doctor engagement during appointments. Singul stressed the average physician spends just 15 to 20 minutes per patient. "That sort of leeway has to be available to physicians, so they don't have the financial disincentive when they talk to patients, they spend time with patients," Singal emphasized. "That is something that is a little beyond me, but that needs to change as well." Singal added hematology patients can expect 30 to 60 minutes on average for new patient appointments and longer to ask questions if a patient's condition is complex or if additional exams are needed right away. The Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center is the only federally recognized hemophilia treatment center in Indiana.

The ongoing challenge underscores the importance of cardiac rehabilitation programs, which help patients recover from heart-related events and learn preventive health practices. Murphy, 100, a notable participant, recovered from a silent heart attack through cardiac rehabilitation at Novant Health, serving as an example of the effectiveness of programs like this in helping people reclaim their health. "I'm trying to maintain my strength and that's why I continue coming here," Murphy explained. American Heart Association data show strokes and heart diseases together account for more U.S. deaths than cancer and chronic respiratory diseases combined. Jan Wagoner, director of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation for Novant Health, said cardiac rehabilitation offers patients a vital pathway to recovery by helping them regain a sense of control and wellness. She pointed out patients like Murphy get medically supervised exercise, nutritional guidance and a supportive community. "He was one of the few blessed patients who had been active enough in his life and had good genetics that his heart had created its own bypasses," Wagoner noted. "We call that collateral circulation. And so he was in rehab, gaining strength, gaining knowledge, regaining that sense of control over his life, feeling like he was thriving again." She stressed cardiac disease is increasingly affecting younger adults and the shifting demographic illustrates how lifestyle choices can have significant consequences later in life. Wagoner emphasized adopting healthy habits including regular exercise and a balanced diet can make a substantial difference in heart health over time and reduce the risk of heart-related events. "This is a disease that doesn't choose an age anymore," Wagoner observed. "It used to be that people were in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s, and then it's now in their 30s and 40s and we see it all across." The American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 guidelines highlight simple steps for better heart health, focusing on two areas: healthy habits like eating well, staying active, quitting tobacco, and getting good sleep; and managing key health factors such as weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure. get more stories like this via email Antibiotics have been widely overused worldwide, according to experts in California and elsewhere, giving the "superbugs" the chance to evolve and become drug-resistant.

PDF FILE In recent years, the United States has faced a significant challenge in its turkey industry due to the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus. This outbreak has had devastating consequences for commercial turkey flocks, resulting in substantial losses. The unexpected rise of wild turkeys Before delving into the impact of HPAI on commercial turkeys, let’s explore the unexpected success story of wild turkeys. Approximately 50 years ago, efforts were made to reintroduce wild turkeys to the northeastern United States. At that time, no one anticipated that these birds would thrive in suburban areas. However, they did just that. Ted Walski, a biologist from New Hampshire Fish and Game, released 25 turkeys as part of the reintroduction program. Fast forward to today, and the population of wild turkeys in New Hampshire alone has reached around 45,000 birds—a remarkable achievement. Wild turkeys have adapted well to living alongside humans. They take advantage of habitat edges, feed on human-provided food (including birdseed), and face fewer natural predators. However, their bold behavior has also led to conflicts, such as disrupting traffic and pecking at doors. In some cases, they’ve even attacked people. Despite these challenges, the wild turkey population continues to thrive in New England and neighboring states. The grim toll on commercial turkeys While wild turkeys have flourished, the commercial turkey industry has faced a different fate. The HPAI outbreak has hit turkey flocks hard. Here are the key points: Number of affected flocks: A total of 340 U.S. commercial turkey flocks have been affected during the past three years. Of these, 305 were meat turkey flocks, 25 were turkey breeder hen flocks, and four were turkey breeder replacement hen flocks. Bird losses: Approximately 14.7 million turkeys have been lost due to HPAI. Most of these losses (13.98 million) were meat turkeys, while breeder hens and replacement hens accounted for the rest. Comparison with other poultry types: Turkey flocks have borne the brunt of the outbreak. By comparison, the egg industry lost 57 flocks, the broiler industry lost 43 flocks, and the duck industry lost 24 flocks. Monthly trends: The majority of turkey flock losses occurred in 2024, with 185 flocks affected. In 2023, 91 flocks were lost, and during the first seven months of 2024, 30 flocks were affected. Overall impact: U.S. turkey losses represent about 14.67 percent of the total commercial poultry losses during this period. Looking aheadContinue after advertising. The battle against HPAI continues, and poultry producers are closely monitoring cases. While the wild turkey success story is heartening, the commercial industry faces ongoing challenges. As the outbreak persists, efforts to control the virus remain critical. The impact on the turkey supply chain underscores the need for vigilance and biosecurity measures. In summary, the HPAI outbreak has reshaped the landscape for both wild and commercial turkeys in the United States. While wild turkeys thrive, commercial flocks grapple with losses, emphasizing the delicate balance between wildlife conservation and poultry production.

Published Aug. 16, 2024 Delilah Alvarado Staff Reporter post share post print email license Pfizer Inc. signage is seen on July 22, 2020 in New York City. Jeenah Moon via Getty Images Dive Brief: Pfizer and BioNTech on Friday said a combination flu and COVID-19 shot they’ve been developing met one of its main goals in a Phase 3 trial but missed another, leaving the vaccine’s future in doubt. The study tested Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine against separately administered, marketed COVID and flu shots in more than 8,000 people between the ages of 18 and 64. While the combination vaccine spurred a comparable immune response against COVID and influenza A, it didn’t meet that mark against the “B” strain of the flu. As a result, two companies are “evaluating adjustments” that would improve the vaccine’s performance against influenza B while discussing next steps with health authorities. Shares of Pfizer and BioNTech each ticked down slightly midday Friday. Dive Insight: Pfizer and BioNTech are in a race with rival Moderna to develop vaccines that can simultaneously protect against multiple respiratory viruses, hoping the convenience of one shot will spur an uptick in flagging immunizations. The undertaking has proven difficult, forcing the makers of mRNA shots to search for doses that are potent against multiple pathogens while minimizing side effects. The eventual financial reward is also unclear, as the timing of COVID and flu spikes aren’t currently lining up, complicating the utility of a single shot at a particular time, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a research note. Both groups have found trouble with influenza B viruses, which are less common than their “A” counterparts. For example, Moderna’s initial flu vaccine struggled against influenza B before adjustments led to the success of a combination shot in a Phase 3 trial earlier this year. Pfizer last year reported a flu-only shot also failed to generate a sufficient immune response against influenza B, and on Friday reported similar issues with its combination vaccine. Those stumbles could leave the door open for Sanofi and Novavax, which this year partnered to develop a protein-based combination vaccine. Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger noted that “dose optimization is well-characterized” with those shots, potentially making their path through testing less complicated. Still, Pfizer and BioNTech intend to press forward with combination shots. On Friday, executives from both companies claimed they’re committed to pursuing multi-pronged vaccines. “Today’s results provide insight and direction towards achieving this goal,” said Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer’s head of vaccine R&D, in the statement. “We are dedicated to developing combination vaccines which provide broader protection against multiple respiratory diseases,” added BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin. They’re also still working on a vaccine only directed at the flu. A Phase 2 study of a new “trivalent” shot spurred a meaningful immune response against influenza B. By that measure, it also surpassed an existing shot against influenza A, the companies said. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Pharma, Clinical Trials BioPharma Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: Select Newsletter: Daily Dive M-F Select Newsletter: Commercialization Weekly Every Wednesday Select Newsletter: Gene Therapy Weekly Every Thursday Select Newsletter: Emerging Biotech Weekly Every Tuesday Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Source of the infection is uncertain, but it may be linked to the proximity of the affected farm to areas visited by wildlife, according to the agriculture ministry.Located in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, the premises is in the Brittany (Bretagne) region in northwest France. The ministry confirms that several seabirds from along the region’s coast have tested positive for HPAI in recent weeks. Following confirmation of the infection, restriction zones were set up around the farm, including a protection zone within a 3-km radius, and a surveillance zone extending up to 10km around the outbreak.Across the rest of France, the ministry describes the HPAI risk as “negligible.” Of the 1,200 poultry at the farm, 190 died and the rest of the flock has been destroyed, according to the official notification to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).Starting in October of last year, the French authorities began an HPAI vaccination campaign, which aimed to protect the nation’s commercial duck flocks from future outbreaks.Latest figures from the ministry put the number of birds receiving a first dose of vaccine at more than 47.9 million (as of August 1). That represents an increase of around 6.3 million since the end of June. HPAI hits poultry in Germany, PortugalFollowing a three-month hiatus, the H5N1 HPAI virus has been detected again in poultry flocks in the northwest German state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. A total of 700 birds died at two commercial farms that appear to be around one kilometer apart, according to the WOAH notification. Affected were mixed flocks comprising ducks and geese for fattening, and chickens, totaling around 2,500 and 6,500 birds each.To WOAH, the Portuguese veterinary authority has notified a confirmed HPAI outbreak starting earlier this week. Testing positive for the H5N1 virus serotype was a non-commercial flock in the northern municipality of Viano do Castello. It comprised 100 laying hens, 60 of which died and the others have been destroyed. Gradual increase in European wild bird casesOver the past month, eight European countries have registered with WOAH one or more wild birds that have tested positive for HPAI virus of the H5 group.The most cases — just over 40 — have been confirmed in France. Also recording recent cases have been Belgium, Germany, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. HPAI developments in Africa, Asia-PacificEarlier this year, a series of HPAI outbreaks occurred in Australia, affecting mainly flocks of laying hens in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. Mortalities, culling of around 1.8 million birds, and movement restrictions led to shortages of eggs on supermarket shelves.However, following the country’s largest ever HPAI outbreak in poultry, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports that egg supplies are gradually returning to normal. During the months of May and June, the animal health authority notified WOAH about a total of 12 HPAI outbreaks. Three different virus serotypes were detected at affected farms. In addition, four of Australia's non-commercial poultry flocks have tested positive for the virus.At the end of July, the Cambodian veterinary agency notified WOAH about a second HPAI outbreak linked to the H5N1 virus variant. Affected was a village flock of around 1,200 poultry in the southeastern province of Svay Rieng. This was more than 100km from the previous outbreak. Since the end of June, no further HPAI outbreaks in South Africa have been reported to WOAH. Between May and December of 2023, HPAI outbreaks involving the H7N6 virus serotype occurred in 115 poultry flocks across the country. Directly impacted were more than 11.3 million of the nation’s poultry. 2 new human cases in Cambodia In its latest update on human infections with influenza A virus of avian origin, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports two new cases in Cambodia linked to the H5N1 virus. During the last week of July, infections were confirmed in a four-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl. Both lived in Svay Rieng — the same province as the recent poultry outbreak — but the cases were not epidemiologically linked, according to WHO.

Stainton, Health Care Writer | August 14, 2024 | Health CareNo cases of bird flu have been reported in New Jersey among humans or animals Credit: (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)File photo: Turkeys, among the poultry that can be infected with bird flu There are no reported cases of bird flu in New Jersey among humans, cattle or chickens and commercial pasteurized milk is safe to drink, according to the state. But to help people get accurate information about the highly contagious H5N1 virus that causes the infection — also known as influenza A or H5 — a trio of state departments teamed up to launch a web page with guidance, tips to stay safe and links to up-to-date reports on bird flu activity. The website is also designed to help those who may be more at risk, like farmers and hunters, who come in contact with certain domestic and wild animals that are more likely to carry the virus. “While the risk of bird flu to the general public remains low, it’s important to empower our residents, workers who may be at higher risk, and health care providers with information and resources needed to keep them and those they serve healthy and safe,” said state Health Commissioner Dr. Kaitlan Baston. Health CareBird flu outbreak spreads, but risk to public ‘very low’The site includes information about food safety and offers guidance to farmers, agricultural workers, hunters and others who might be more at risk of exposure to the virus, which is relatively common among some wild birds. The page also reiterates a warning that people and pets should not to consume raw milk — the sale of which is illegal in New Jersey — which can contain pathogens, including traces of H5N1. The site was launched earlier this week by the state departments of Health, Agriculture and Environmental Protection. “We want this material to be easily accessible so if there are any questions about the virus farmers and the public can have a single resource page at their disposal as needed,” Agriculture Secretary Ed Wengryn said. By the numbers Nationwide 14 people have contracted H5 since 2022, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors disease outbreaks. The majority have been farmworkers, with four of the infections connected to dairy cows and 10 linked to poultry. Most of the diagnoses have been reported in Colorado — where someone first tested positive in 2022 — with a handful in Minnesota and one in Texas. Credit: (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP)This 2005 electron microscope image shows an avian influenza A H5N1 virion. No fatalities have been linked to bird flu in the United States. H5 is more common in other countries, especially those where people eat wild game. Worldwide nearly 900 cases have been reported since 2003, a total assumed to be an undercount. Roughly half of the cases were fatal, the World Health Organization found. The virus is believed to spread from infected wild birds to cows, chickens or other animals, where it can then pass to humans. It is not known to spread from person to person, but some epidemiologists and public health leaders have raised concerns about the potential for a pandemic similar to COVID-19. Wild birds in New Jersey carry H5N1 but the virus has not been reported in cows or domestic poultry here, according to state officials. As of last week, the CDC reported “no unusual influenza activity in people” in the U.S., with no new cases of H5. The agency said that since earlier this year it has analyzed nearly 40,000 specimens for the virus, monitored 4,500 people who were exposed to infected animals and tested more than 250 others. Wild birds in New Jersey carry H5N1 but the virus has not been reported in cows or domestic poultry here, according to state officials. Farmers, veterinarians or other professionals who might work with infected animals are urged to wear personal protective gear, like masks and gloves, which they can get for free from the Rutgers University co-op extension office, they said. Basic advice Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette urged members of the public not to touch dead or sick birds and report any such findings to the NJ Fish and Wildlife Hotline at 1-877-WARNDEP. Health CareCurbing Legionnaires’ disease in NJ“With the addition of this important resource, the public now has access to multiple sources of key information that can help prevent the spread of avian influenza among wildlife and inform safety practices for hunters, bird enthusiasts, or even a homeowner placing a bird feeder in their yard,” LaTourette said. New Jersey’s H5N1 website explains how the virus spreads and provides links to the CDC’s national monitoring page, where people can get the latest updates. Along with guidance for farmers and agricultural workers, hunters, veterinarians and others who work with animals on how to stay safe, the state site has information on food safety, including details about the risks involved with consuming raw milk. Some information is also available in Spanish. The Health Department has also created a separate pamphlet with H5N1 guidance for people working at or attending state fairs or animal exhibitions, where they might interact with infected or exposed animals.

Is your cat at risk?Eduardo Cuevas USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Bird flu's 'low risk' to public, experts say. Here's how to avoid it.Despite a number of farm workers catching bird flu across the U.S., experts say there's low risk to the general public with a few exceptions.A handful of house cats in Colorado died this year from bird flu and some had no direct exposure to outbreaks on dairy farms. State public health officials haven't determined how Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 circulating in infected herds sickened six domestic cats, including two indoor cats, raising questions for some about how the virus spreads and infects different animals.State officials "suspect it is directly related to dairy farm exposures," Kristin Richmann, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email."Through genetic testing of the virus, the infections in several of these cats have been linked to the avian flu outbreak in dairy cattle, but we did not document direct exposure to dairy cattle in all cases," she said. As for the two indoor cats, she added, it's possible "tracking of virus from the environment into the home" caused infections in the pets.Experts said the deaths could be linked to mice in and around homes that carried bird flu. Cats could have preyed on these rodents and owners may not be aware it happened, said Dr. Jane Sykes, a professor of small animal internal medicine at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. Another source of infection could be raw food that people feed their pets.Cats living on farms with infected livestock died of bird flu during recent outbreaks this year. However, it's unclear how house cats with no exposure to sick animals on farms got the virus. "Honestly, when you see just this small number of animals that are reported, it's often the tip of the iceberg," Sykes told USA TODAY. "There are often lots of cases that don't get recognized."Bird flu in cats, humansThe risk of bird flu to the public is low, state and federal officials say. It's also unlikely that sick pets would transmit the virus to humans. There has been no transmission of the virus between people during this outbreak.Last week, the Colorado State Veterinarian's Office announced that six domestic cats had been diagnosed with H5N1.One case was directly associated with a commercial dairy facility where cows were infected. Two others were indoor cats, and the remaining three cats had spent time outside hunting mice or small birds, according to the announcement posted by the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association.Five of the six cases had similar symptoms. Pet owners reported initial complaints that their cats were lethargic and not eating. Some later became severely ill with respiratory symptoms, and most developed neurologic issues. Several were tested for rabies, which has similar symptoms, but were negative. All the cats died. All tested positive for bird flu.The virus detected in nearby dairy herds spilled over to mammals and wild birds on and near these premises, the state veterinarian said. The specific strain of H5N1 has been spreading to species that hadn't previously been considered reservoirs for the virus.Citing U.S Department of Agriculture data, Colorado Public Radio linked five of the six cats to northern Colorado, where outbreaks among livestock have occurred. The USDA said via mail that its National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed 36 domestic cats with bird flu. In many cases, they had the same strain found in dairy cattle.Across the U.S. this year, 13 people have been infected with bird flu, including 10 in Colorado. All were poultry or dairy workers. No person has become ill from an infected cat, said Richmann, from the state public health department. Officials have monitored people exposed to the sick cats for 10 days after their last exposure, she said.Cats are typically "dead-end hosts," meaning they don't tend to transmit bird flu to other animals once infected, according to Sykes, from UC Davis. Death rates from bird flu have been high among cats: about two-thirds of cats died once they were infected, according to one study. There have been instances of cats spreading disease. In 2016, a cat infected a person with a different type of avian influenza at a New York City animal shelter. Thailand and Germany experienced prior outbreaks of bird flu in cats.Jennifer Martin, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Colorado School of Public Health, said it’s important to understand the genetic sequence of H5N1 in cats to determine whether the virus is mutating, or just finding hosts in which it's already adapted to survive. "That's going to be really helpful in putting together a puzzle that seems to be expanding," Martin said. "But is it an expansion that's caused by a change in the virus or is it a natural expansion?" She said once that question is answered, "we can rely on best practices to address it."What can I do to protect my cat?How much the bird flu has spread beyond infected farms remains unclear. In the meantime, the public should rely on established methods to protect people and their pets from getting sick, Martin said. These steps are as simple as washing hands after handling food or litter boxes. Pet owners should also avoid serving their pets raw milk or meat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people and pets avoid contact with wild birds.Pet owners should watch for signs of illness in their cats and should contact a veterinarian if respiratory and neurological symptoms develop. The Colorado Veterinarian's Office said bird flu infection should still be considered in cats even if symptoms and risk factors aren't all present.People get sick when they inhale the virus or get it in their mouth, eyes or nose. In humans, symptoms have included eye redness and flu-like respiratory issues.

Vaccines are prepped, just in case.Eduardo Cuevas , Karen Weintraub USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Bird flu's 'low risk' to public, experts say. Here's how to avoid it.Despite a number of farm workers catching bird flu across the U.S., experts say there's low risk to the general public with a few exceptions.HOLLY SPRINGS, N.C. ‒ A quiet effort to prevent the next global pandemic began rolling off an assembly line this summer behind the gates of an office complex in suburban Raleigh.In this sprawling factory, sheltered by thick pine groves, workers at CSL Seqirus are bottling millions of doses of a new vaccine targeting the H5N1 bird flu virus.The virus, which first emerged in wild birds around 1997, has been spreading this year among dairy and poultry farms across the United States. Thirteen farmworkers have been infected with the virus this year, some suffering eye redness, others a cough. No one became sick enough to require hospitalization, although, in other countries, about half of the people diagnosed with H5N1 over the years have died.The virus is not being passed from person to person – and that is key to why public health officials aren't hitting the panic button. Because the risk to the general public remains low, the federal government doesn’t think it’s worth vaccinating anyone against H5N1 yet – even the farmworkers most at risk for getting sick from infected chickens or cows.But behind the scenes, officials are getting ready at Seqirus' advanced facility in the biomanufacturing hub of Holly Springs.Already, 4.8 million doses of a potential vaccine are sitting in an undisclosed Seqirus distribution center, ready for delivery if needed.“An exercise like this gives our partners a chance to exercise that muscle, to make sure that the manufacturing’s there,” Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told USA TODAY during an exclusive tour of the vaccine factory in late July.In past disease outbreaks, she said, getting enough vaccine made in time to stop individual infections and slow the spread of disease has been the government's "Achilles' heel."Get the information you need to start your day smart. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.So here, in the heart of North Carolina’s coveted Research Triangle, winding conveyor belts and hanging robotic arms are filling one thumb-sized glass vial at a time to avoid the next global pandemic.True success would mean at some point the contents of those vials could essentially be flushed down the toilet – because bird flu no longer poses a theoretical threat to human health.But at a time when the virus seems to be spreading to new farms every week, when America’s healthcare system and treatment of farmworkers means infections are likely going undetected and fall flu season is rapidly approaching, public health officials say there’s no such thing as being too careful. “You want to prepare for the worst case,” said Dr. Raj Panjabi, who oversaw pandemic preparedness at the White House from 2021 to 2023 as a special assistant to President Joe Biden. “This gets the engine moving.”On the production lineThrough several security doors at the Seqirus facility, scores of workers in white zip-up plastic suits, hairnets and goggles worked along conveyor belts carrying small tubes along a packaging line.Seqirus’ packaging lines are capable of producing 2 million flu vaccine doses every two weeks, said Jonathan Kegerise, vice president of manufacturing and the site head for the facility in Holly Springs. The 4.8 million doses of H5N1 were slotted in between batches of seasonal flu and didn’t affect the production of those shots. Robotic arms filled and capped vials as workers stood watch and prepared machines for the next batch. Along the way, lights flashed as cameras captured images of the vials for quality control. They would undergo additional inspections before they were packed away, ready for shipping if the federal government decided the H5N1 vaccines were needed.The liquid was mainly divided into 10-dose vials. Seqirus produced an additional 250,000 pre-filled, single-dose syringes for times when opening a 10-dose vial would be wasteful. The H5N1 vaccine had already been manufactured at the same Seqirus facility and stored at temperatures between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Concentrated doses are made ahead of time as part of the national stockpile.The vaccine has now been poured into vials allowing public health officials to more easily distribute doses if they are needed.Making the substance for the doses takes about a month, followed by a day to formulate a batch, another day to fill the vials, and one last day to inspect and package them.Seqirus is producing all 4.8 million doses under a $22 million agreement with the federal government, the company said. Two types of vaccines are being prepared as defenses against the H5N1 virus. In addition to the vaccine being readied at Holly Springs, in July, the government also directed $176 million to Moderna to develop mRNA influenza vaccines, including for H5N1. The two vaccines use different technologies – mRNA can be made faster, in case a pandemic is spreading quickly; the more traditional, cell-based vaccine rolling off these assembly lines takes longer to produce.It makes sense to now complete the cell-based vaccines that are already in the national stockpile, said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, the founding director of Boston University’s Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. She told USA TODAY an mRNA vaccine could help if the virus changes enough that a new vaccine has to be developed.Still, Bhadelia, who worked in the Biden administration during COVID-19, worries that Congress hasn’t allocated enough money to get ahead of the bird flu virus. “Nothing can happen without money,” she said. The vaccine we have nowScientists hope the vaccine being poured into vials here would protect someone against a severe H5N1 infection, but they aren’t sure.So far it has been tested only in ferrets, the animal typically used by labs to test flu vaccines. Seqirus already manufactures an H5N1 vaccine that FDA has determined is safe and effective. This new bird flu vaccine replaces the H5N1 strain with the circulating virus.The first human trials for the new vaccine have begun, starting with healthy people to ensure the vaccine triggers the desired effect on the immune system. Those results are expected later this year.At this point, researchers believe the vaccine coming off this assembly line will be effective, but it's not guaranteed, Bhadelia said. It’s also possible that by the time the virus transforms enough to become truly dangerous to large numbers of people, it will have changed so much that the vaccine that has been prepared here will no longer work, said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Even if the vaccine works well, there’s the problem of scaling up production and getting it to enough people fast enough. To work effectively, the vaccine requires two doses to be delivered at least three weeks apart. It’s unclear how much protection someone gets after the first dose. In emailed responses, Seqirus wouldn’t say when the vaccine doses expire and when they'd have to be replaced.Delivering them to people will be challenging, too. With the COVID-19 vaccine, it was more difficult than expected to get the doses from the warehouses to vaccine clinics and into arms. Cold storage, bottle size and other factors posed problems that had to be resolved on the fly.The National Biodefense Plan, which Panjabi oversaw, was launched in 2022 with the goal of providing enough vaccines for all at-risk populations within four months of a pandemic’s start.If bird flu could be addressed early enough – contained before it spreads beyond farmworkers and their families and not spread among the general public – it would be much easier to make enough vaccine and deliver it to the right people in four months' time.That’s why some public health experts believe farmworkers should be offered vaccines before the virus has a chance to become more dangerous.Vaccinating farmworkers would not reduce the number of people who become severely infected with bird flu, Bhadelia said, but she thinks they should be offered it as part of a research trial. "It will just potentially help with severe disease and to further our scientific understanding," she said.Still, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, doesn’t think the time is right to start vaccinating anyone.H5N1 has not caused serious cases of disease, it is not spreading person-to-person, and its genetics haven’t changed substantially since the vaccine was developed against it. Right now, he told reporters in late July, a readily available antiviral is a better tool for anyone infected or exposed than the vaccine would be.“The H5 vaccine, at this moment in time, is not performing the job that we really need,” Shah said.A different vaccinationFinland made a different decision. In June, Finnish officials began distributing 20,000 doses of a different Seqirus vaccine to people ages 18 and older exposed to animals they believed were susceptible to bird flu, including workers in the country’s mink industry. In late July, fewer than 200 people in Finland had received shots, and the vaccines must be used by mid-September before they expire, said Mia Kontio, chief specialist for the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare's infectious disease control and vaccinations. Many Finns are on vacation in the summer, she added, so August is going to be “very hectic” to quickly immunize people with the two-dose regimen.The return of wild migratory birds in the fall, potentially carrying the virus, add to the urgency, she said.“We felt that it's our responsibility to actually do something if we can,” Kontio told USA TODAY. “Because the situation might change very quickly.”Where are we now?In the U.S., federal officials expanded regulations on interstate transportation of livestock in recent months. They've added alerts on products such as unpasteurized milk, and warned that shared equipment can spread the virus among animals.They have also provided personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, goggles and gloves, in states affected by bird flu.Recently, federal officials launched an effort to vaccinate livestock workers against the seasonal flu. That vaccine doesn’t offer any protection against H5N1, which is a different strain of influenza, said Shah, from the CDC.Getting the seasonal vaccine, however, could prevent someone from simultaneously having both the seasonal flu, which is highly contagious, and H5N1, which can be extremely dangerous. A worst-case scenario would be a virus that combines the two, Shah said. Flu viruses are known to exchange genes with one another, so such a combination is always possible.“Viruses are sort of smart,” May Chu, a clinical professor of epidemiology at Colorado School of Public Health, told USA TODAY. “Our bodies offer the place where they replicate. And so if you don't let the virus into you, you aren't going to be contributing to the genetic growth of this virus. This is what you want to stop. Because the more people get infected, the more viruses grow, and the more chances of the genetic variant arising of deleterious effect.”Such a combination, she emphasized, would be “bad for us.” Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Avian Flu Spreads to 23 Mammal Species: Cats Emerging as Major Concern डाउन टू अर्थPrint EditionSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewslettersSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewsletters HealthAvian flu spreads to 23 mammal species, cats become major concernDomestic cats potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans, suggests new paperAs felines feed on dead wild birds, they may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals, the study suggestediStockHimanshu NitnawarePublished on: 14 Aug 2024, 1:14 pmCopiedA pre-print paper has raised concerns about the potential role of cats in the spread of avian influenza, highlighting the need for increased surveillance of the virus in felinesSince May 2022, the increasing spread of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also known as avian flu H5, has infected up to 23 mammal species. According to the US Department of Agriculture, 374 animals have been infected, resulting in illness, severe disease and even death in some cases.The avian flu has infected 97 red foxes, 82 house mice, 43 skunks and 36 domestic cats. Infections have also been reported in mountain lions (22 cases), harbour seal (21 cases) and skunk (43 cases). Other species that have been impacted are raccoon, deer mouse and bobcats among others.Also ReadUS: After dairy, now poultry workers down with bird fluHowever, the spread of disease among domestic cats is becoming a cause of concern. A recent paper examining the spread of avian flu among cats over the last 20 years found the latest strain of H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) poses increased risks.A pre-print study Avian Influenza Virus Infections in Felines: A Systematic Review of Two Decades of Literature stated that given the emerging threat of a human pandemic caused by avian influenza, infections in felines or cats that are susceptible to avian flu virus infection must be closely monitored among other mammals.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently added avian flu (influenza A virus) to its list of priority pathogens that could potentially trigger the next pandemic.Also Read‘Who will compensate Kuttanad’s poultry farmers?’ Existential crisis in Kerala’s backwaters as panel urges bird ban till next March over avian flu fearsThe pre-print paper explained that felines feed on dead wild birds and hence “may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals.”Previous studies have shown feline-to-feline experimental transmission. “Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans,” the paper stated.From 2004 to 2024, the highest number of infections in domestic cats was reported in 2023. The rise in infection cases coincided with the latest clade spreading among mammals.The study discovered that the current strain of H5N1 caused a 67 per cent fatality rate and that cats were also susceptible to infection from other cats. Over a 20-year period, the researchers investigated approximately 486 avian flu virus infections in felines and discovered 249 deaths from the disease.Also ReadAs millions of birds are again culled over avian flu fears, farmers in central & southern Kerala’s backwaters concerned over futureThe researchers also noted infections in 12 feline species across seven geographical regions and 17 countries, with Asia, including Southeast Asia, reporting the highest rate of infection (54 per cent). Europe and North America reported 24 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively. Apart from the US, feline infections of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b have also been reported from Finland, Italy, France, Peru, Poland and South Korea, including domestic cats, bobcats, lynx, lion and caracals.Though the majority of the cases involved bird-to-feline infection because the animals were fed dead pigeons, chickens and other birds, three cases involved feline-to-feline infection and two cases involved infection from cattle because they were fed raw milk and colostrum.Also ReadIn a first, a polar bear has died of avian flu in the ArcticThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified the risk to humans as low because no reports of the virus infecting humans have surfaced.

The companies are evaluating adjustments to the combination vaccine candidate to improve immune responses against influenza B.On Friday, Pfizer Inc. PFE and BioNTech SE BNTX released topline results from the Phase 3 trial of the combined mRNA vaccine candidate against influenza and COVID-19 in healthy individuals 18-64 years of age. The combination candidate comprises Pfizer’s mRNA-based influenza vaccine candidate with the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine. The Phase 3 trial measured two primary immunogenicity objectives (immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 and immunogenicity against influenza A and B), of which one was met.

Compared to a licensed influenza vaccine, the trivalent (tIRV) formulation demonstrated influenza A responses, including a continued trend of higher influenza A responses versus a licensed influenza vaccine, while it showed lower geometric mean titers and seroconversion (the time between exposure to a virus and when antibodies show up in the blood) against the influenza B strain. In addition, the formulation demonstrated comparable responses against SARS-CoV-2 versus the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine. An ongoing safety data review has not identified any safety signals with the combination vaccine. The companies are evaluating adjustments to the combination vaccine candidate to improve immune responses against influenza B and will discuss the next steps with health authorities. The Phase 3 study enrolled 8,000 participants. The setback comes after Moderna Inc. MRNA released positive Phase 3 trial data for its combination vaccine against Influenza and COVID-19 in June. In a separate Phase 2 trial, Pfizer evaluated trivalent (tIRV) influenza mRNA standalone vaccine candidates, demonstrating robust immunogenicity in individuals aged 18 to 64. Last year, Pfizer announced topline Phase 3 results from its first-generation quadrivalent (qIRV) vaccine candidate, which achieved the first and only demonstration of efficacy for an mRNA vaccine in a group of study participants aged 18- 64. The primary endpoints for this first-generation candidate were not met in adults aged 65 and older, as statistical non-inferior relative vaccine efficacy compared to a licensed influenza vaccine was not met based on the number of cases accrued. Pfizer developed second-generation candidates to improve immunogenicity. The tIRV formulations elicited robust influenza A and B responses, including a continued trend of higher influenza A responses compared to a licensed influenza vaccine. No safety signals were reported. Data from the Phase 2 trial for adults 65 and older will become available later. Pfizer will also continue to evaluate its influenza vaccine program and discuss next steps with health authorities. Price Action: BNTX stock is down 3.72% at $84.00, and PFE stock is down 0.03% at $28.70 during the premarket session at last check Friday.

(Xinhua/Liu Jie)Influenza A, also known as HPAI, Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu H5N1, has been detected in many mammals, such as deer mouse, house mouse, desert cottontail, prairie vole, raccoon, striped skunk, red fox, mountain lion, bobcat and black bear, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of H5 bird flu in the United States has showed up in more animal species, including 23 species of mammals, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The department's website tracking the virus updated Tuesday that Influenza A, also known as HPAI, Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu H5N1, had been detected in many mammals, such as deer mouse, house mouse, desert cottontail, prairie vole, raccoon, striped skunk, red fox, mountain lion, bobcat and black bear."There are many species that are potentially susceptible to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)," the website said. "In addition to birds and poultry, H5N1 viruses have been detected in some mammals. Infection may cause illness, including severe disease and death in some cases."The department noted that due to the increased interest in domestic cats associated with the HPAI outbreak, the authority collected the concerned information since March and reported them to World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH)."As companion animals, domestic cats provide a potential pathway for avian influenza viruses to spillover into humans," according to Kristen Coleman, an assistant professor at the School of Public Health of the University of Maryland and an affiliate professor at Department of Veterinary Medicine, reported in the university's news outlet in June.A cat enjoys chin rubs at the Mega Adoption event in Houston, Texas, the United States, on Nov. 10, 2019. (Photo by Yi-Chin Lee/Xinhua)"We looked at the global distribution and spread of bird flu infections in feline species between 2004 and 2024 and found a drastic rise in reports of feline infections starting in 2023, with a spike in infections reported among domestic cats, as opposed to wild or zoo-kept animals. This increase coincides with the rapid spread of the current strain of H5N1 among mammals," Coleman added.Bird flu is not currently reported to be contagious between humans, and it is not guaranteed to evolve in that direction, but the disease is clearly changing, the report warned. "The current strain of the H5N1 has been spreading to animals that have never been affected before, and pets that can pass it to people could play a role in how it evolves."Bird flu, a virus usually spread among wild birds and domesticated poultry, made the leap to dairy cattle in the United States in December or January, and has since spilled to other species of animals.Since the emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle, 35 domestic cats have been reported to be infected to date, while no known human cases of H5N1 have been linked to exposure to infected cats, according to health officials."It's just remarkable how fast and furious it's moving. So I hope we can get a handle on it soon," said Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who has worked with both dairy cows and poultry, which have been hard hit by the virus this year.In Colorado, six feline cases of Influenza A have been diagnosed in domestic cats so far this year, according to the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association's website.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continued to state that the risk to the general public is low. However, Russo said the surge of confirmed cases raise the level of concerns."People with direct contact to infected cats should be considered at the same risk as those in direct contact with other infected animals, such as cows or poultry," she wrote in an email to Colorado Public Radio Tuesday, "The risk of human infection from contact with cats is not well understood." ■ CommentsComments (0) Send You may like An elephant's journey is conservation milestone View of Beijing on sunny day Scenery of Great Wall shrouded in clouds in Hebei In pics: Closing ceremony of Paris 2024 Olympic Games highlights Olympics | Sparkling moments at Paris 2024 leave lasting memories Shanghai Disneyland to welcome first major Marvel attraction More from GLOBALink GLOBALink | Shanghai sees summer travel surge with vibrant events, visa-free policies GLOBALink | Reform, innovation reconfigure growth pattern in China's western region GLOBALink | Türkiye's enhanced ties with multilateral platforms beneficial: expert Follow us on More from GLOBALink GLOBALink | Shanghai sees summer travel surge with vibrant events, visa-free policies GLOBALink | Reform, innovation reconfigure growth pattern in China's western region GLOBALink | Türkiye's enhanced ties with multilateral platforms beneficial: expert Follow us on Roundup: 23 species of mammals found infection of H5 bird flu in U.S. outbreakFluzone side effects: What they are and how to manage them Medical News TodayHealth ConditionsHealth ConditionsAlzheimer's & DementiaAnxietyAsthma & AllergiesAtopic DermatitisBreast CancerCancerCardiovascular HealthCOVID-19DiabetesEnvironment & SustainabilityExercise & FitnessEye HealthHeadache & MigraineHealth EquityHIV & AIDSHuman BiologyLeukemiaLGBTQIA+Men's HealthMental HealthMultiple Sclerosis (MS)NutritionParkinson's DiseasePsoriasisPsoriatic ArthritisSexual HealthUlcerative ColitisWomen's HealthHealth ProductsHealth ProductsAllNutrition & FitnessVitamins & SupplementsCBDSleepMental HealthAt-Home TestingMen’s HealthWomen’s HealthDiscoverNewsLatest NewsOriginal SeriesMedical MythsHonest NutritionThrough My EyesNew Normal HealthPodcastsAll3 ways to slow down type 2 diabetes-related brain agingToxic metals in tampons: Should you be worried?Can tattoos cause blood or skin cancer?Can we really ‘outrun the Grim Reaper’?What makes a diet truly heart-healthy?Is intermittent fasting actually bad for your heart?ToolsGeneral HealthDrugs A-ZHealth HubsHealth ToolsFind a DoctorBMI Calculators and ChartsBlood Pressure Chart: Ranges and GuideBreast Cancer: Self-Examination GuideSleep CalculatorQuizzesRA Myths vs FactsType 2 Diabetes: Managing Blood SugarAnkylosing Spondylitis Pain: Fact or FictionConnectAbout Medical News TodayWho We AreOur Editorial ProcessContent IntegrityConscious LanguageNewslettersSign UpFollow UsSubscribeFluzone side effects: What you should knowMedically reviewed by Paul Hetrick, PharmD — Written by Kimberly Rath, PharmD on August 15, 2024More common side effectsMild side effectsSerious side effectsFAQSpecificsPrecautionsFluzone (influenza) is a brand-name vaccine that’s used for preventing the flu.

CNA photo Aug. 14, 2024 Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA) Influenza now appears to be a year-round disease, and the government should provide publicly funded booster influenza vaccines for people aged 65 and above to achieve longer-term protection, an expert recommended Wednesday.Huang Li-min (黃立民), an attending physician specializing in pediatric infectious disease at National Taiwan University Hospital, said at a press conference that the flu epidemic, the first summer flu outbreak in Taiwan in seven years, has been "very severe."There have been 1,231 influenza cases with severe complications recorded as of Aug. 9, Huang said, showing that the flu epidemic was not over and that it had become a year-round phenomenon.Statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) show flu numbers are up, with the number of visits to outpatient and emergency care clinics by people with flu-like symptoms in the first 32 weeks of 2024 up 70 percent from the same period last year.Given those trends, Huang argued that Taiwan should follow advanced countries in offering adjuvanted (immune-response enhanced), high-dose and genetically recombinant flu vaccines as the standard publicly funded vaccine for people aged 65 and older to protect them for a full year.Traditional flu vaccines provide protection for only six months.Huang said the heightened flu issues are related to what he described as an "immunity debt" caused by reduced exposure to immune stimulation due to preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that reduced people's active and passive immunity.He speculated that this "immunity debt" effect may not be paid off until the end of next year.In the past, the incidence of influenza infection typically began to increase in autumn and peaked in the winter months, Huang said, but with global warming the flu now occurs year-round.When the difference in temperature between winter and summer is significant enough, a large number of people get infected in winter, and people infected with the virus develop an immune response that makes it less likely they will be infected with the flu in the summer.If the winter months are not cold enough, however, fewer people are affected during that time of the year and the flu will be spread over all four seasons, he said.At the same time, according to Huang, a surge in travel over the past two years since COVID-19 travel restrictions were lifted has helped spread flu viruses around the world and given them more of a year-round presence.Thus, providing protection for a full year was important and only the more advanced vaccines could achieve that, he said.CDC Deputy Director-General and spokesman Lo Yi-chun (羅一鈞) told CNA in response that the government had already completed its purchasing process for publicly funded flu vaccines this year.In terms of the idea of giving the booster flu vaccines to those 65 and older, the issue has been handed over to the Center for Drug Examination (CDE) to do a cost-benefit analysis of the newer vaccines, Lo said, and the proposal could be discussed by an expert committee in the spring of 2025.

According to the Ministry of National Defense’s budget report, the batch of military hardware from the US, including 11 sets of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and 64 MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems, had been scheduled to be delivered to Taiwan between the end of this year and the beginning of next year.

The 42-year-old concrete and steel structure that serves as an elevated walkway over the intersection of Heping and Xinsheng roads is to be closed on Tuesday in preparation for demolition slated for completion by the end of the month. However, in recent days some local residents have been protesting the planned destruction of the intersection overpass that is rendered more poetically as “sky bridge” in Chinese. “This bridge carries the community’s collective memory,” said a man surnamed Chuang Taiwan delivers letter to Donald Trump 2024-11-10 Representative to the US Alexander Yui delivered a letter from the government to US president-elect Donald Trump during a meeting with a former Trump administration official, CNN reported yesterday.

While the data is only available for the Auckland metropolitan area, Te Whatu Ora national clinical director Dr Susan Jack said it was a good barometer of illness levels likely being experienced by hospitals across the country. Maria Packe-Leonard, 53, who was otherwise fit and healthy, died at Hutt Hospital on 21 July, and her husband, 53-year-old John Leonard, is still in a critical condition in Auckland's ICU after developing flu-like symptoms believed to be influenza A. 27-year-old Te Arani Anthony Munro-Campbell died from influenza A while his mother lay in intensive care in Hawke's Bay Hospital in July. And 16-year-old William Rollaso, who was usually fit and healthy, died just days after developing flu-like symptoms - sore throat, runny nose and a cough - in June. What is influenza A? Influenza, or the flu, is a viral infection. It can cause symptoms like a fever, chills, muscle or body aches, headache, runny or stuffy nose, cough, sore throat, upset stomach, vomiting or diarrhoea. Some people may have no symptoms, but can still pass it on to others. Around one in four New Zealanders are infected with the influenza virus each year - most often between May and October. Influenza A is one of four main types of influenza: A, B, C, and D. It is the most common type in New Zealand. How long does it last? It can take between one to four days to feel symptoms. Symptoms usually last about five days, but some can last up two to three weeks. What is the contagious period? Between one and two days before symptoms start until about day five. What is the incubation period? Usually between one and three days, but can be up to seven. How do you test for influenza A? Te Whatu Ora public health medicine specialist Dr Matt Reid said healthcare providers do not usually test for the flu. "They usually diagnose you based on your symptoms," he said. "They might order tests to make sure it is not a different illness if you have serious symptoms." However, Dr Sue Huang, director of the World Health Organisation National Influenza Centre at the Institute of Environmental Science and Research, said a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or a rapid antigen test can be used to diagnose Influenza A. Can you die from influenza A? Dr Reid said around 500 people die from the flu each year. The flu virus changes often, with the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A the predominant strains in New Zealand, Huang said. General Practice New Zealand chair Dr Bryan Betty said, anecdotally, more people appeared to be affected "very, very badly" by these two strains compared to previous years. "We know that every year some people can get very, very badly affected by the flu. And we've seen cases of that this year where younger people have been really, really affected by the flu and there have been a couple of tragic deaths across New Zealand." People with an ongoing health condition - such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, a heart or lung condition, and other conditions that affect the nervous or immune systems, people with serious mental health or addiction issues, significantly overweight people, people aged 65 or over, Māori and Pacific people aged 55 or over, pēpi, tamariki, pregnant people and those who have just given birth have a higher risk of getting complications from the flu. What are the treatments for influenza A? Early use of antivirals, such as Tamiflu (oseltamivir), within the first 48 hours of developing symptoms, can reduce the duration of symptoms and the risk of complications from influenza, Dr Huang said. Otherwise, over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen may help to relieve fever, body aches and headache. Lozenges or gargles may ease symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose and cough too. Pseudoephedrine, an active ingredient in some medicines used to relieve nasal congestion, has been available at pharmacies without a prescription since May too. How can you avoid getting influenza A? The only protection against influenza is vaccination, Dr Betty said. This year, there are five quadrivalent influenza vaccines available in New Zealand: Influvac Tetra, Flucelvax Quad, Fluad Quad, FluQuadri, and Afluria Quad. They protect against two influenza A strains - H1N1 and H3N2 - as well as two influenza B strains. The influenza vaccine is free for people aged 65 or over, people with a long-term medical condition such as diabetes, asthma, or a heart condition, children under four who have been hospitalised for respiratory illness, or have a history of significant respiratory illness and people with mental health conditions. In 2022 and 2023, the influenza vaccine was also free for children under 12 and Māori and Pacific people aged between 55 and 64. However, vaccine funding provided to Pharmac throughout the Covid-19 pandemic ran out this year. Dr Betty said this had likely led to a drop off in the number of people getting vaccinated. It can cost up to $45 per vaccine, depending on how much clinics and pharmacies charge.

They say it's difficult to know "how grim it's going to be when it arrives".abc.net.auewseam-preparing-for-bird-flu-outbreak-on-macquarie-island/104223138Link copiedShareShare articleInside the headquarters of the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), dozens of experts have gathered for a simulated emergency.They're here to wargame their response to an outbreak of avian influenza on Macquarie Island — something they fear could become reality within months."It's an evolving scenario," AAD operations manager Robb Clifton said of the training exercise.Bird flu is already on some sub-Antarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is killing wildlife. (Supplied: Dr Meagan Dewar)It begins with 10 petrels being found dead on a remote tip of the island.A short time later, 200 deceased penguins are located.By the end of the day, a dead skua is discovered near the island's research station.The scenario participants discussed included researchers finding dead birds around Australia's Macquarie Island research station. (ABC News: Jordan Young)"So it starts off with a number of instances of dead wildlife being encountered that are showing very likely signs of avian influenza," Mr Clifton said."[It then builds] up to where we think we're at real risk of transmission into the human population because of the proximity of the wildlife on Macquarie Island."While the risk of animal-to-human transmission is low, the consequences could be severe, particularly in such a remote location.Gentoo penguins can be found near the research station on Macquarie Island. (Supplied: Jason Munday/AAD)For that reason, Mr Clifton said advanced planning and simulated training were essential."For us, it's about getting on the front foot," he said."Obviously, logistics to Antarctica and Macquarie Island aren't easy."It's making sure our people have got the right equipment, they've got access to the right experts, but also they've got the right training."Rob Clifton is the operations manager at the Australian Antarctic Division.

(Supplied: Meagan Dewar)However, scientists are concerned the virus could spread to those areas as early as this spring."It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when it arrives in these locations," AAD seabird expert Louise Emmerson said.Macquarie Island is about 1,500 kilometres south-east of Hobart (Supplied: AAD/Pete Harmsen)Once that happens, the consequences for animals, including seals, penguins and other seabirds, could be significant."Where we've seen it go through areas in the past, it's had a very devastating impact on many of the species, including up to 90 per cent, and in excess of 90 per cent, mortality of wildlife."Dr Louise Emmerson says scientists don't yet know how badly the virus will affect wildlife populations in Antarctica. (ABC News: Jordan Young)Despite such statistics, Dr Emmerson said other variables made it difficult to predict the impact of future outbreaks."It's really hard to know how grim it's going to be when it arrives," she said."It could be mass mortality that has a very significant impact on populations, or it may not be the case."It just depends on how robust the populations are, how healthy they are when it hits them, and how susceptible they are."Team to 'bear witness' to bird flu in Australia's territoryA bird which died of avian influenza on the Antarctic Peninsula. (Supplied: Meagan Dewar)In the coming months, she and other bird experts will be deployed to different parts of the Australian Antarctic Territory to check for signs of the virus and monitor its impact once it arrives there.She knows it will likely be a confronting task."It's hard to see the animals that you've been monitoring for years, sick, dying, or the population numbers declining," she said."We know that that will have a toll on the researchers, but our job is to really bear witness to see what happens."The Australian Antarctic Division led a multi-agency exercise.

A deadly strain of avian influenza has breached the world's most remote continent. Scientists say it's only a matter of time before it reaches Australia.When the H5N1 strain eventually spreads to the Australian Antarctic Territory and Macquarie Island, it will raise the risk of it reaching Australia, too."We're the last continent on Earth that doesn't have this strain, so we want to keep it that way," national animal disease preparedness coordinator Dr Brant Smith said.Dr Smith said it was vital to remain vigilant."It's really important we continue to do our surveillance, making sure that we are looking for signs of disease early and responding quickly if we did find an incursion of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] in Australia."Loading...Posted Wed 14 Aug 2024 at 9:59pmWednesday 14 Aug 2024 at 9:59pmWed 14 Aug 2024 at 9:59pm, updated Wed 14 Aug 2024 at 10:52pmWednesday 14 Aug 2024 at 10:52pmWed 14 Aug 2024 at 10:52pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

H5N1 was confirmed in western Antarctica in February. It has also killed an estimated 30,000 sea lions and 17,000 southern elephant seal pups in the Antarctic region.Emmerson said the strain had been spreading rapidly, including moving to other unexpected animals such as cats, raccoons and cows.“It’s had a very big impact on many different species … some populations have been really badly impacted with in excess of 90% mortality,” she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, last week warned the highly infectious strain was “coming for us”, and said it could push some bird species towards extinction if it arrived in Australia.Plibersek said the risk applied to both birds in captive breeding programs and species that were currently doing well in the wild, and that the coming months would be a “particularly dangerous time” as birds migrated from the northern hemisphere. There needed to be an “all-in” approach across government and private organisations to minimise the threat, she said.The planning exercise on Wednesday was testing emergency response and coordination in the event of an outbreak, preparations for seabird mass mortality and potential wildlife to human transmission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said scientists would be sent to Australia’s Antarctica territory in spring to check for signs of the strain during summer breeding. Monitoring on Macquarie Island, a world heritage outpost about halfway between Tasmania and Antarctica and a haven for penguins, seals and seabirds, occurs year-round.“What we do know is spring and going into summer we get a lot more wildlife moving around the sub-Antarctic,” Clifton said. “We know the risk of [transmission] is going up.”Dr Brant Smith, from the federal agriculture department, saidearly detection was key. He said anyone who saw sick, dying or diseased animals should contact authorities.Australia is the only continent in the world free of the H5N1 variant. Other bird flu variants have been linked to more than 900 cases in humans since 2003, and more than 400 deaths.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian climate and environment in focusBird fluTasmaniaAntarcticanewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
