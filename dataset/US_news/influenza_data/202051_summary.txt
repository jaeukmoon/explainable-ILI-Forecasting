- Pre-existing influenza immunity significantly impacts antibody response to influenza viruses.
- Antibody response differs between individuals who are vaccinated or naturally infected.
- Initial antibodies stimulated after infections or vaccinations come from old B cells, indicating the role of immune system memory.
- Antibodies from infections target non-neutralizing sites, while antibodies from vaccinations target neutralizing sites.
- Understanding pre-existing immunity is important for developing a universal influenza vaccine.
