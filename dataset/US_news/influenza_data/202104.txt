The vaccine’s effectiveness also depends on correct predictions about which strains will be most common in a given season. For these reasons, a one-and-done universal vaccine that would provide lasting immunity over multiple flu seasons and protect against a variety of strains has been a long-term goal for scientists. Researchers are now one step closer to hitting that target. Scientists recently completed the first human trial of a vaccine created by recombinant genetic technology to fool the immune system into attacking a part of the virus that does not change so fast and is common among different strains. I am a microbiologist interested in infectious diseases, and I’ve followed the seasonal flu epidemic for several years. I’m excited by this news, which could mark the turning point in the quest for a universal flu vaccine. Here’s how it all works. 3D model of an influenza virus. Its genetic material is inside, with proteins – HA in blue, NA in red – poking out from the surface. Smith Collection/GadoArchive Photos via Getty Images Biology of the invading influenza virus Like the virus that causes COVID-19, the influenza virus has a protein shell that is coated by a lipid membrane. Sticking through the membrane are multiple copies of three types of proteins: haemagglutinin, abbreviated as HA; neuraminidase, abbreviated as NA; and the matrix protein, M2. It’s the properties of the HA and NA proteins that distinguish the different strains of the virus. You’ve probably heard of strains like H1N1 and H3N2, both of which are infecting people in the U.S. this year. The HA molecule is shaped a bit like a flower bud, with a stalk and a head. Once someone inhales the virus, the tip of the HA molecule’s head binds to a receptor on the surface of the cells that line the person’s respiratory passages. This initial binding is crucial as it induces the cell to engulf the virus. Once inside, the virus gets to work replicating its own genetic material. But the enzyme that copies its single-strand RNA is very sloppy; it can leave two or three mistakes, called mutations, in every new copy. Sometimes the genetic changes are so drastic that the progeny viruses don’t survive; other times they are the start of new flu strains. Based on viral samples collected from around the world, the flu virus that arrives one year will have about seven new mutations in the gene for HA and four in the gene for NA compared to the previous year’s virus. These differences are a big part of why the same influenza vaccine won’t be as effective from one year to the next.

Juan Gaertner/Science Photo Library via Getty Images Fighting off a flu infection When infected with the flu virus, your immune system produces antibodies to fend it off. Most of these antibodies interact with the HA head and prevent the virus from getting into your cells. But there’s a downside to that strong reaction. Because the immune response to the virus’s head is so vigorous, it pays little attention to other parts of the virus. That means that your immune system is not prepared to fend off any future infection with a virus that has a different HA head, even if the rest of the virus is identical. Current flu vaccines are inactivated versions of the influenza virus and so also work by inducing antibodies targeted to the HA head. And that’s why each version of the vaccine usually works only against a particular strain. But, as the flu spreads, the rapid rate of genetic change can produce new versions of the HA head that will evade the antibodies induced by the vaccine. These newly resistant viruses will then render even the current season’s vaccine ineffective. The stalk portion of the HA molecule is much more genetically stable than the head. And HA stalks from different flu strains are much more alike than their head regions are. So, an obvious way to protect people against different flu strains would be to use just the HA stalk in a vaccine. Unfortunately vaccination with only a headless stalk doesn’t seem to prevent infection. Scientists are currently pursuing several different solutions to this problem. A new kind of flu vaccine A team of scientists led by Florian Krammer at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai just completed the first human clinical trial of what they hope will be a universal flu vaccine. The researchers used recombinant genetic technology to create flu viruses with “chimeric” HA proteins – essentially a patchwork quilt built from pieces of different flu strains. Volunteers for the clinical trial received two vaccinations separated by three months. The first dose consisted of an inactivated H1N1 virus with its original HA stalk but the head portion from a bird influenza virus. Vaccination with this virus induced a mild antibody response to the foreign head, and a robust response to the stalk. This pattern meant that the immune systems of the subjects had never encountered the head before, but had seen the stalk from previous flu vaccinations or infections. The second vaccination consisted of the same H1N1 virus but with an HA head from a different bird virus. This dose elicited, again, a mild antibody response to the new head, but a further boost in response to the HA stalk. After each vaccine dose the subjects’ stalk antibody concentrations averaged about eight times higher than their initial levels. Researchers found that even though the vaccine was based on the HA stalk of the H1N1 virus strain, the antibodies it elicited reacted to HA stalks from other strains too. In lab tests, the antibodies from vaccinated volunteers attacked the H2N2 virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic and the H9N2 virus that the CDC considers to be of concern for future outbreaks. The antibodies did not react to the stalk of the more distantly related H3 viral strain. The antibody response also lasted a long time; after a year and a half, the volunteers still had about four times the concentration of antibodies to the HA stalk in their blood as when the trial started. Avoiding the vigorous immune response to the protein’s head means the immune cells can concentrate on the more stable stalk of the protein. Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images Since this was a phase 1 clinical trial testing only for adverse effects (which were minimal), the researchers didn’t expose vaccinated people to the flu to test if their new antibodies protected them. However, they did inject the subjects’ blood serum, which contains the antibodies, into mice to see if it would protect them against the flu virus. Getting a shot of serum taken from volunteers a month after receiving the booster shot, when antibody levels were high, led to mice being 95% healthier after virus exposure than mice who got blood serum from nonvaccinated volunteers. Even the mice who received serum that was collected from vaccinated volunteers a year after the start of the trial were about 30% less sick. These results show that vaccination with a chimeric flu protein can provide long-lasting immunity to several different strains of the influenza virus. Scientists will need to continue optimizing this approach so it works for different types and strains of influenza. But the success of this first human trial means you may one day get a single shot and, at last, be free from the flu.

Here, we report structural details for heterosubtypic recognition of HA from circulating and emerging IAVs by the human antibody 3I14. Somatic hypermutations play a critical role in shaping the HCDR3, which alone and uniquely among VH3-30 derived antibodies, forms contacts with five sub-pockets within the HA-stem hydrophobic groove. 3I14 light-chain interactions are also key for binding HA and contribute a large buried surface area spanning two HA protomers. Comparison of 3I14 to bnAbs from several defined classes provide insights to the bias selection of VH3-30 antibodies and reveals that 3I14 represents a novel structural solution within the VH3-30 repertoire. The structures reported here improve our understanding of cross-group heterosubtypic binding activity, providing the basis for advancing immunogen designs aimed at eliciting a broadly protective response to IAV.

Despite such effort, seasonal influenza viruses cause significant global morbidity and mortality, as well as vast social and economic burdens. In addition, the threat of a pandemic strain arising is an endless concern because of large influenza reservoirs in swine and avian populations1. Several avian IAVs have caused sporadic human infections in the recent past, including H7N92, H5N13, and H9N24. The H5N1 virus infected over 800 people between 2003 and 2019 with a human fatality rate of ~53% (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/), whereas the H7N9 virus, which was first reported in China in 2013, has over 1500 confirmed cases and ~39% human fatality rate (https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-september-2018-ah7n9-china/en/).More recently, strains of H6N1 (A/Taiwan/2/2013) and H10N8 (A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013) have caused human infections5,6,7,8, and although no fatalities from the H6 infections were reported, the virus does have a slight preference for human receptors and therefore may represent an intermediate towards a complete human adaptation. Conversely, H10N8 has high genetic similarity with the deadly H7N9 viruses and two of the three reported H10N8 infections were fatal. Antiviral drugs can be used to treat early stages of infection in an effort to mitigate epidemics and pandemics; however, resistance has developed in most circulating viruses to the M2 ion channel blocker adamantane9,10 and many viruses also have resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors10,11. Thus, there is an urgent need to advance efforts towards a more universal solution for protection against IAV infections.The envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is the major target of the humoral immune response and is responsible for receptor attachment and entry of IAVs12. HA is synthesized in an inactive form (HA0) and then processed by intracellular proteases to an active state, which consists of an apical globular head domain (HA1) responsible for mediating receptor binding and a stem domain (HA2) that harbors the fusion machinery. HA1 and HA2 are linked by a single disulfide bond and assemble as trimers of heterodimers. The head domain is immunodominant13, but sequence diversity between IAVs and tolerance for antigenic changes make the antibodies elicited towards the head typically only viable towards highly related strains, although several receptor-binding site targeting antibodies capable of neutralizing diverse IAVs have been characterized14,15. The sequence diversity in IAV is exemplified by the presence of 18 HA serotypes, which can be further divided by phylogenetic relatedness into group 1 (including H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9) or group 2 (including H3, H7, and H10).Stem-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which are elicited by natural infection and vaccination, tend to have a wider breadth than head-directed antibodies and are often capable of protecting against entire subtypes, groups, or even types16,17,18,19. Stem-directed bnAbs prevent the release of viral contents into the host cell by locking HA in a prefusion state, thus inhibiting the structural rearrangement necessary to fuse to the host endosomal membrane20. The VH1-69 class of stem-directed bnAbs occurs frequently and many have been identified and structurally characterized21,22. With the exception of CR911418 and 27F323, which target both group 1 and group 2 IAVs, the majority of VH1-69 antibodies are specific for group 1. Germlines VH6-1, VH1-18, and VH3-3024,25,26 have also shown bias use for the production of stem-directed bnAbs and, unlike those derived from VH1-69, both heavy and light chains are used for binding HA, with some of these characterized antibodies capable of neutralizing both group 1 and group 2 IAVs.We recently reported on the discovery and in vivo efficacy of the VH3-30-derived bnAb 3I1427. MAb 3I14 was isolated from H3 (A/Brisbane/10/2007) reactive memory B cells, neutralizes group 1 and group 2 IAVs in cell culture models, and protects mice from viral challenge with lethal strains of H7N7-NL219, H7N9-AH13, H3N2-BR07-ma, and H5N1-VN04 viruses27. Similar to other stem-directed bnAbs, 3I14 prevents proteolytic cleavage of HA0, inhibits a pH-induced conformational change in HA and promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. A point mutation in the light variable domain, termed 3I14D93N (3I14D94N with prior numbering), was found to increase binding affinity and viral neutralization potential by approximately tenfold against H5, with no negative effect on binding or neutralization to H3.In this work, we elucidate the structural determents for cross-group binding of HA by 3I14 through solving the crystal structures of the 3I14 fragment antigen-binding region (Fab) complexed with HA from group 1 (H6) and group 2 (H3 and H10). We find that 3I14 uses a unique binding mechanism for recognition of the HA stem, whereby only HCDR3 residues make contacts within the hydrophobic groove, whereas the light chain provides a large footprint spanning two HA protomers. 3I14 is highly mutated and the location of these mutations in the heavy and light chains mold the HCDR3 into the shape needed for recognizing the HA stem. Structures of 3I14D93N bound to HA from group 1 and group 2 reveal the molecular basis for enhanced binding affinity towards H6. In addition, comparison of 3I14 with other VH3-30-derived bnAbs, as well as bnAbs from diverse germlines, reveals that 3I14 represents a unique example of a stem-directed bnAb. This work broadens our understanding of HA stem recognition by bnAbs and the structural diversity of bnAbs that can be generated by the VH3-30 scaffold.ResultsBinding of 3I14 to human infecting H6 and H10 HAsThe recent emergence into humans of avian H10N87 (A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013) (group 2) and H6N18 (A/Taiwan/2/2013) (group 1) infections led us to investigate whether mAbs 3I14 and 3I14D93N could bind HA from each virus with similar binding affinities as we observed with other HA strains27. Neither of these HAs were included in our original characterization of 3I14, although phylogenetically similar viruses to H6 (such as H1 and H5) and H10 (such as H7, and H9) were studied27. This strain of H6 has residue Glu39HA2, which in H5 led to the engineering of 3I14D93N and enhanced binding affinity; therefore, we hypothesized that 3I14D93N may also bind H6 with improved affinity. 3I14 and 3I14D93N bound H10 with a similar equilibrium binding constant (KD) of ~0.4 nM (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast and as predicted, the wild-type 3I14 lost approximately sixfold in the KD to H6, whereas 3I14D93N maintained this potent binding affinity to H6 (~3 nM for wild-type 3I14 and 0.4 nM for 3I14D93N) (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).Table 1 Binding data for 3I14 and 3I14D93N.Full size tableTo determine whether the improved binding affinity of the 3I14D93N mutant was a result of stabilization of the 3I14 IgG, we measured the melting temperatures (TM) for wild-type 3I14 and 3I14D93N IgG. We found that the TM was 78 °C in each case (Supplementary Fig. 2), signifying that the light-chain Asp93Asn mutation does not impact the IgG thermostability. Rather, a reduction in the antibody off-rate by approximately fivefold, with little change in the on-rate, suggests a direct role for this residue in binding HA.Structure of 3I14 Fab in complex with group 1 and 2 HAsTo investigate the structural basis for heterosubtypic recognition of IAV by 3I14, as well as confirm the molecular details for the enhanced binding affinity of 3I14D93N to H6, crystal structures for the 3I14 and 3I14D93N Fabs in complex with HAs from group 1, H6 (A/Taiwan/2/13), and group 2, H3 (A/Victoria/361/2011) and H10 (A/Jiangxi/IPB13/2013) were solved. A total of four complex structures permitted a thorough understanding of the 3I14- and 3I14D93N-binding modes: H3:3I14, H3:3I14D93N, H6:3I14D93N, and H10:3I14 at resolutions of 3.5 Å, 3.2 Å, 3.5 Å, and 4.2 Å, respectively (Table 2). The structures of the HA proteins in each complex are similar to those of the apo structures, which have been previously reported (Supplementary Fig. 3)28,29. The electron densities for the H3 and H6 complexes are clear and well-ordered at the HA:Fab interfaces, allowing for the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of 3I14 to be manually built into the H3 bound structure (Supplementary Fig. 4). The H10 structure has clear density for the C-α-backbone for both the HA and Fab portions; however, side-chain residues are not well resolved and some density is missing near the fusion peptide. Therefore, our description of the intermolecular contacts is based only on the H3 and H6 structures.Table 2 X-ray data collection and crystallographic refinement statistics.Full size table3I14 recognizes the stem of group 1 and 2 HAs in a manner consistent with findings that it prevents proteolytic cleavage of the HA precursor27 and in an overlapping region as other reported stem-directed bnAbs22,24,25,26,30,31,32 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 5). The 3I14 epitope spans to a second HA protomer, which results in a total buried interface area on HA of 980 Å2, consistent with the high binding affinity (Fig. 1b, c). Heavy-chain interactions occur solely through contacts with HCDR3, which buries a surface area of 481 Å2 in the hydrophobic groove, between the middle and lower portions of Helix A, the fusion peptide, and HA1.Fig. 1: 3I14 recognition of group 1 and group 2 HA proteins.a X-ray structure of H3 hemagglutinin bound by Fab 3I14.

A group 1-specific sugar on the second HA protomer, which interacts with 3I14 is labeled as NAG33*.Full size imageThe HCDR3 is 23 residues in length, with 5 residues (Tyr99, Tyr100, Trp100G, Val100H, and Ala100J) (Kabat numbering) making extensive van der Waals (vdW) and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. 2a, b). The reliance on HCDR3 for recognizing the hydrophobic groove is in contrast to other stem-directed bnAbs, which use a combination of heavy-chain or heavy- and light-chain CDRs for interacting with similar portions on HA18,22,23,24. The HCDR3 forms a six-residue loop extending away from the hydrophobic groove consisting of residues Phe100A through Val100F. At the center of the loop, Arg100D protrudes along the fusion peptide and can make polar interactions with the main-chain oxygen for either Val18 (group 2) or Ile18 (group 1). A contributing factor to the wide neutralization breadth of 3I14 is the ability to accommodate amino acid differences between group 1 and 2 HAs (Fig. 2a–d). For example, Tyr100HCDR3 makes vdWs interactions with Leu38HA2 (group 2) or the aliphatic side chain of Arg38HA2 (group 1) and Trp100GHCDR3 forms vdW contacts with Trp21HA2 and Ile45HA2 on helix A, as well as a hydrogen bond between the main-chain oxygen with either Asn49HA2 (group 2) or Thr49HA2 (group 1). Val100H makes vdW contacts with Ile48HA2 and Trp21HA2, whereas Ala100J makes vdW contacts with Leu52HA2 (group 2) or Val52HA2 (group 1). The main-chain oxygens for Ala100JHCDR3 and Ser97HCDR3 each make hydrogen bonds with the conserved residues Asn53 and Gln42, respectively. Another contributing factor to effectively neutralizing group 1 and group 2 viruses is the local flexibility of HCDR3 at Trp100G, which maintains an ~3–4 Å distance from the group-specific orientation of Trp21HA (Supplementary Fig. 6). Collectively, the HCDR3 accounts for six hydrogen-bonding interactions and similar vdW contacts in each complex.Fig. 2: Binding comparison of 3I14 and 3I14D93N with group 2 and group 1 HAs.a, b 3I14 HCDR3 interactions with either group 2 H3 (a) or group 1 H6 (b) HAs.

HA coloring and labels follow that of (a, b), except the group 1-specific glycan is shown as yellow sticks. Protomer 2, which is buried by FR3, is colored gray.Full size imageThe 3I14 light chain plays a prominent role in binding and buries over half of the total surface area on HA (499 Å2), making contacts through LCDR2, LCDR3, and LFR3. In particular, LFR3 is responsible for nearly half the light chain buried surface area by mediating contacts with the adjacent protomer (Fig. 2c, d). This large buried surface area of the light chain is uncommon, as typically the heavy chain contributes more to binding than the light-chain33. The 3I14 light chain is also able to accommodate amino acid substitutions between group 1 and 2 HAs, such as Arg54LCDR2, which forms a cross-protomer hydrogen bond with the side chain of either Asp32HA1 (group 2) or Lys32HA1 (group 1). In addition, Ser63LFR3 hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Gln33HA1 (group 2) or Asn33HA1 (group 1) on protomer 2 and Ser67LFR3 hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Glu35HA1 (group 2), whereas Ser65LFR3 can hydrogen bond with Gln25HA1 (group 1). Despite the long span of the 3I14 epitope, the serine residues along LFR3 are able to accommodate the group 1 glycan located on Asn33HA1 of the second HA protomer, whereas more bulky residues on LFR3 would likely result in a steric clash, preventing such extensive cross-protomer interactions, and possibly limiting the ability of 3I14 to bind.Role of somatic mutations in shaping HCDR33I14 is encoded by the IGHV3-30*18 and IGLV1-44*01 germline genes. The HCDR3 uses the IGHD3-22*01 DH segment flanked by large N-additions at both VH and IGHJ4*02 junctions27. We previously reported that germline reversions of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) for either the heavy chain (13 SHMs) or light chain (7 SHMs) resulted in a 2- to 7-fold reduction in binding affinity to H3 and H5, whereas simultaneous reversion of both chains to germline decreased binding affinities by approximately 14-fold in either case27. Six of the seven light-chain SHMs are in LCDR2 and LFR2, and mapping them on the structure showed that they cluster at the interface with the heavy chain (Fig. 3a, b). The exception is Gly30LCDR1, which is mutated from a serine in the germline and appears to prevent either a steric clash or the polar serine side chain from pointing towards the aliphatic side chain of Lys39HA2 (group 2) or Glu39HA2 (group 1) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Due to the location for majority of these SHMs, one possible consequence is the stabilization of the 3I14 heavy–light chain interface, which has been shown to be a critical feature in antibody affinity maturation34,35.Fig. 3: 3I14 Somatic hypermutations shape HCDR3.a Sequences for 3I14 heavy- and light-chain wild type and germline. Somatic hypermutations (SHMs) are in bold. b SHMs on the 3I14 heavy and light chains are shown as white sticks and labeled. c Zoomed in box from b showing the SHMs that surround the HCDR3 as white transparent surfaces and sticks. HCDR3 is shown as a cartoon and sticks. The HCDR3 is shaped by interactions with the SHMs, which surround it.Full size imageHeavy-chain SHMs are spread across HCDR1, HCDR2, FR3, and HCDR3 (Fig. 3a, b). Although HCDR1 and HCDR2 do not directly interact with HA, the SHMs occur at positions that seemingly “mold” the HCDR3 into the conformation needed to recognize the large area within the hydrophobic groove (Fig. 3c). When viewed along with the light-chain SHMs, the HCDR3 is sandwiched between seven total mutations, including a pocket formed by the light-chain somatically mutated residues His34LFR2 and Phe36LFR2, which may serve to anchor Pro96HCDR3. The large decrease in binding affinity obtained with either heavy- or light-chain germline-reverted mutants could therefore be due to plasticity of the HCDR3 that may result from the lack of some, or all, of these interactions.Molecular basis for improved binding affinity of 3I14D93N to H6The 3I14D93N mutant shows increased binding affinity towards recombinant H6, while retaining similar binding affinity towards H3 and H10, which was anticipated based on our previous studies27. In the H6-bound structure, the electron density around Asn93LCDR3 is well resolved and shows a hydrogen bond being formed with Arg38HA2 (Fig. 4a). The paratope–epitope surface potentials are each relatively neutral, with the local environment of 3I14D93N being slightly negative despite the positively charged Asn93 substitution (Fig. 4a). In addition, the residues on HA in close proximity to Arg38HA2, namely Glu39 and Asp37, diminish the positive charge that Arg38 would carry, thus facilitating better charge complementarity with 3I14D93N and explaining the improved binding characteristics.Fig. 4: 3I14 and 3I14D93N binding to H6 and H3 HAs.a H6-3I14D93N complex; b H3-3I14D93N complex; c H3-3I14 wild-type complex. Left panels show the LCDR3 as green cartoon and sticks, and HA shown as red cartoon and sticks. 1σ 2Fo–Fc electron densities are shown in blue. Hydrogen bonds are depicted as yellow dashed lines. Panel on the right is an electrostatic surface representation of the image from the left.Full size imageIn the H3-3I14D93N structure, the Asn93LCDR3 forms a hydrogen bond with Lys39HA, and consistent with the H6-3I14D93N structure, reveals a negatively charged contact surface for LCDR3, whereas in this case the H3 surface is positively charged (Fig. 4b). In the H3-3I14 wild-type structure, Asp93LCDR3 does not hydrogen bond with Lys39HA, evident by the clear electron density around each side chain (Fig. 4c). Rather, Lys39HA assumes an alternate rotamer with the side chain extending towards the 3I14 LCDR1 and forming a hydrogen bond with Asn32LCDR1. This orientation extends the Lys39HA side chain towards the center of the negative patch formed by Asp93LCDR3 and Asn31LCDR1. The ability for Lys39HA to adopt multiple rotamers and for 3I14 and 3I14D93N to retain a hydrogen bond interaction in either instance explains the similar binding affinities for each antibody towards group 2 HAs.Comparison of 3I14 binding with other VH3-30 derived bnAbs3I14 is the fourth bnAb to be structurally characterized which utilizes the VH3-30 germline gene, along with mAbs 3.1, 39.39, and FI6v3 (stabilized version of FI6)24,25,26. MAb 3.1, which was selected by phage display shows heterosubtypic neutralization against the H1a clade (H1, H2, H5, H6) and some H9 subtypes, whereas 39.39 and FI6v3 each neutralize group 1 and 2 viruses. To better understand how the developmental pathways for each of these VH3-30 bnAbs leads to broad HA recognition, the HCDR3 length, the percentage of residues in the heavy and light chains that undergo SHM, and the paratope buried surface areas were compared. This analysis revealed few distinguishing features other than 3I14, FI6v3, and 39.29 each contributing ~200–600 Å2 of paratope light-chain buried surface area (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the angle of approach for each antibody towards the HA stem differs. With respect to 3I14, the VH domains for 39.29, FI6v3, and 3.1 are rotated by ~42o, 49o, and 62o, respectively, with FI6v3 and 3.1 each rotating counterclockwise, and 39.29 rotating clockwise (Fig. 5a–d, top). In addition, FI6v3 approaches HA in a perpendicular manner, whereas each of the other antibodies is angled ~20–45o towards the HA head domain. The angles of approach result in distinct but overlapping footprints on the HA stem, covering regions of HA1 and HA2. MAb 39.29 buries ~1100 Å2 on HA, whereas FI6v3 buries ~820 Å2 and 3.1 buries ~920 Å2 (Fig. 5a–d, bottom). The angle taken by mAb 3.1 results in the HA buried surface being nearly evenly split between HA1 and HA2; however, a potential clash with the conserved group 2 glycan at Asn32 likely contributes to group 1 selectivity. FI6v3 makes contacts with an adjacent protomer, albeit to a lesser extent than seen with 3I14 (230 Å2 for 3I14 vs. 90 Å2 for FI6).Fig. 5: Angles of approach towards HA for VH3-30 BnAbs.a–d Top: angles of approach for each of the VH3-30 antibodies (H3-39.29, PDB 4KVN; H3-FI6v3, PDB 3ZTJ; H1-3.1, PDB 4PY8). HA is shown in surface representation with HA1 and HA2 from the primary protomer colored orange and red, respectively. Each Fab is shown in cartoon representation with 3I14 colored as in Fig. 4, and 39.29, FI6v3, and 3.1 colored according to the labels. The degrees shown in figures b–d is the rotation necessary to superimpose the VH domain of that antibody onto the VH domain of 3I14, as determined in Coot. Bottom: HA portion for each complex from the top panel, rotated ~45o. The buried surface area for each antibody is colored cyan on HA. The black arrows in a and c indicate cross-protomer interactions.Full size imageAlthough approaching from different angles, each antibody does make extensive contacts within the HA hydrophobic groove. These interactions can be summarized by contacts with five sub-pockets, numbered as one through five starting from the top of helix A, distal from the membrane proximal region (Fig. 6a–d). Of note, each antibody shares the same VH–JH gene segment usage (VH3-30, JH4)24,25,26 and variable DH segments, which results in HCDR3s that are utilized for binding pockets two and three, centering around contact with Trp21HA (Fig. 6e). Interactions with the remaining pockets are not conserved and take a variety of forms. For instance, 3I14 exclusively utilizes HCDR3 to interact with each of the five pockets, whereas FI6v3 and 39.39 incorporate light-chain CDRs and 3.1 engages HCDR1.Fig. 6: Structural comparison of VH3-30-derived bnAbs bound to HA.a H3-3I14; b H3-FI6v3; c H3-39.29; d H1-3.1. All VH3-30-derived antibodies recognize the hydrophobic groove between helix A and the fusion peptide. CDRs are shown as cartoons with residues interacting with sub-pockets (labeled as 1 through 5) shown as sticks. The fusion peptide is colored cyan with Trp21 shown as sticks; helix A is colored red and HA1 is colored orange. e Sequences for antibody CDRs, which have at least one residue that interacts with a sub-pocket. Highlighted residues coincide with which HA subpocket the interaction occurs: pocket 1-red; pocket 2-cyan; pocket 3-green; pocket 4-yellow; and pocket 5-purple.Full size imageAnother distinguishing feature for 3I14 is that the HCDR3 is flipped ~180o compared to the other VH3-30 antibodies, a reflection of the different approach angles (Fig. 6a). Although FI6v3 most closely resembles 3I14 by predominately utilizing HCDR3 (residues Arg99, Leu100A, Phe100D, and Trp100F) for pockets one through four, interaction with pocket five requires recruitment of the somatically mutated residue Arg93LCDR1 (Fig. 6b). An Arg93Ser germline-reverted mutant was shown to have a decrease in binding affinity to group 2 HAs by a factor of 44, thus demonstrating the importance for this specific interaction in the maturation of FI625.Comparison with stem-directed antibodies from other germlinesNext, the hydrophobic groove interactions between the VH3-30-derived antibodies with antibodies from germlines that fall into specific antibody classes were compared (Fig. 7a–d). VH1-69-derived antibodies, such as CR911418 and 27F323, contain an IFY motif consisting of an HCDR3 tyrosine (Y) located at position 98 or 99 coupled with HCDR2 residues Ile54 (I) and Phe55 (F) (Fig. 7b). As with all the stem-directed antibodies, which have been characterized from this class, CR9114 and 27F3 utilize HFR3 and HCDR2 for majority of the contacts within the hydrophobic groove and do not share extensive molecular similarities with any of the VH3-30 antibodies. The only similarity with 3I14 is the HCDR3 tyrosine used for binding pocket four.Fig. 7: Comparison of the 3I14 HA stem hydrophobic groove interactions with other stem-bound antibodies.a VH3-30 interactions with the hydrophobic groove are shown with heavy and light-chain CDRs colored as in Fig. 6. The HA stem is shown in surface representation and colored by electrostatic charge (red-negative, blue-positive, white-neutral). Residues interacting with pockets 1–5 are circled with a dotted line and labeled. b Antibodies CR9114 (PDB 4FQI) and 27F3 (PDB 5WKO) from the VH1-69 germline are shown. c Antibodies Medi8852 (PDB 5JW4) and 56.a.09 (PDB 5K9K) from the VH6-1 germline. d VH1-18 antibodies 31.b.09 (PDB 5K9O), S9-3-37 (PDB 6E3H), and 16.g.07 (PDB 5KAN). e The VH3-3 antibody 31.a.83 (PDB 5KAQ). For b–e, the heavy-chain CDRs are colored blue and the light-chain CDRs are colored green. The molecular signature is indicated below each figure or indicated as unique if no signature has been identified.Full size imageThe VH6-1- and VH1-18-derived antibodies, on the other hand, utilize molecular signatures, which are shared by 39.29 and FI6v3, respectively. Medi8852 and 56.a.09 are representative of the VH6-1 + HD3-3 class of antibodies that use the same FGV/I motif as 39.29, where an HD3-3 encoded phenylalanine recognizes pocket 2, and either a germline-encoded valine or the SHM-altered isoleucine binds pocket 3 (Fig. 7c). The VH1-18 germline contains multiple classes, including the HD3-9 class such as antibody S9-3-37, which harbors an LXYFXWL motif22 (Fig. 7d). FI6 falls into this class, which results in placement of Tyr and Phe into pockets two and three, respectively. Mab 3.1, although not strictly harboring this motif, does share the Tyr and Phe interactions. Antibody 31.b.09 (Fig. 7d) also utilizes the HD3-9 gene (translated in a different reading frame than S9-3-37 and FI6) and harbors an ILTG motif, which places Leu in pocket three rather than a Phe. Mab 16.g.07 (VH1-18, D2-15, JH2) is of a multi-donor class that shares a SHM-derived Thr52HCDR2 and an HCDR3 QXXV motif22 (Fig. 7d). The binding for 16.g.07 appears most similar to mAb 31.a.83 (VH3-23, D3-9, JH6) (Fig. 7e), which is currently characterized as a unique lineage22 and binds the hydrophobic groove primarily through HCDR3 (Fig. 7e).In summary, this comprehensive comparison reveals that the V(D)J arrangement for the VH3-30 antibodies can develop multiple signatures to target the HA stem. In some cases, these HCDR3 signatures converge on similar structural solutions that have been utilized by other VH germline segments. 3I14 is exclusive in the ability to solve this landscape problem by reverse orientation of the HCDR3 and in doing so makes contact with all five hydrophobic pockets. In addition, the 3I14 light chain promotes cross-protomer binding and proper positioning of the HCDR3 into the stem groove. At present, 3I14 falls into an uncharacterized class that represents a unique example among the VH3-30-derived bnAbs.DiscussionBroadly neutralizing human mAbs targeting the stem region of influenza HA provide opportunities for antibody-based therapeutics against yearly circulating IAV strains and treatment for novel emerging HA subtypes from zoonotic sources. Structural information obtained from antibody-HA complexes may also guide the rational design of a sought-after universal vaccine, which could protect across strains within an influenza subtype, across subtypes within IAV groups, or across all influenza A and B viruses.In this study, we elucidated the structural basis for heterosubtypic recognition of HA by the VH3-30-derived mAb 3I14, which was originally isolated from human memory B cells27. Structures of 3I14 in complex with group 1 H6 as well as group 2 H3 and H10 yielded the expected result in that 3I14 recognizes HAs from each strain in a highly similar manner, consistent with other antibodies targeting stem and non-stem epitopes that have been reported elsewhere22,25,30,36,37. The 3I14 heavy-chain interactions consist solely of HCDR3 contacts within five sub-pockets of the stem hydrophobic groove, whereas the light chain makes contacts on helix A and extensive cross-linking interactions on an adjacent HA protomer. Antibody CT149 has also been shown to bury ~250 Å2 of the same adjacent protomer32; however, compared with 3I14, CT149 has vast differences in overall HA recognition. CT149 approaches HA at a different angle, which permits light-chain contacts with HA1, whereas the heavy chain makes fewer contacts within the stem hydrophobic groove (Supplementary Fig. 9).An engineered LCDR3 point mutant, 3I14D93N, shows a sevenfold increase in binding affinity towards H6, while retaining binding to H10 and H3. A single hydrogen bond and better charge complementarity between 3I14 and H6 are the driving force for the improvement. Importantly, this mutation could be generated in somatic B cells in vivo by activation-induced deamination (AID) U:G mismatch repair38. Similar improved binding affinity for 3I14D93N to H5 (which is highly conserved with H6 at the 3I14 binding interface) also resulted in tenfold higher potency in a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay27. This correlation between binding and neutralization makes 3I14D93N a more attractive option for development as a therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment of severe IAV infection, as passive immunization with anti-HA antibodies has shown promising effects39. In addition, the 3I14 HCDR3 might be considered as a next-generation scaffold to produce small molecules with cross-group therapeutic potential, such as the cyclic peptidic fusion inhibitors recently reported40.Recognition of the HA stem hydrophobic groove by 3I14 is similar to group-specific and more broadly reactive antibodies from diverse germlines18,22,23,30, as well as that from the three other VH3-30-derived antibodies that have structures reported (FI6v3, 39.29, and 3.124,25,26). VH3-30 bnAbs do not interact with HA using HCDR2, whereas the use of HCDR2 can infer that a germline is inherently fit for pathogen interaction, such as the “IF” portion of the IFY motif in VH1-69-derived bnAbs21,41. Comparison of 3I14 with FI6v3, 39.29, and 3.1 complexes shows that they each have different HCDR3s and CDR-binding contributions to the hydrophobic groove, different light chains that contribute differently to binding, varying angles of approach, and distinct but overlapping footprints on HA. Despite different developmental pathways, a key similarity for the VH3-30-derived bnAbs is a shared VH–JH gene segment usage, which can combine with variable DH segments to produce HCDR3 peptides, which preferentially recognize pockets near Trp21. Notably, FI6v3 and 39.29 each contain HCDR3s with defined molecular signatures, grouping them with the FGV/I motif (VH1-18), and the LXYFXWL motif (VH6-1), respectively. The ability for VH3-30-derived bnAbs to develop a range of signatures that are shared with divergent germlines provides additional insights towards the plasticity of this V-segment scaffold.Similar to many stem-directed antibodies, 3I14 provides protection from influenza through Fab- and Fc-mediated interactions27. In a mouse model, Fc-mediated effector functions are required for protection from influenza by both stem- and head-directed antibodies42. However, not all antibodies providing a protective effect are found to neutralize the virus in vitro18,42, suggesting that screening based on heterotypic binding and in vitro neutralization may fail to identify antibodies providing the greatest protective effect. Shifting the focus from bnAbs to broadly protective antibodies will be important when evaluating the effectiveness of a vaccination strategy or to identify antibodies with therapeutic potential.Antibodies targeting conserved epitopes on the HA stem are an important part of the immune response to influenza infection and vaccination43,44. However, in either case, the immune system has a preference for non-stalk epitopes, thus posing an immunological obstacle towards universal vaccine efforts45,46. This might be overcome through thoughtful antigen design and heterologous prime boost vaccination strategies, such as the headless and chimeric HAs, which are showing promise in eliciting stem-specific immune responses in preclinical settings47,48,49,50,51,52,53. Another possibility might be germline-targeted immunogens, such as those being developed for HIV54,55,56, to activate germline precursors, which could then be expanded upon with subsequent vaccinations. The structural definition of the 3I14 epitope adds to the growing knowledge base of antigenic determinants necessary for eliciting antibodies, which have the ability to confer protection against circulating and emerging strains of IAV and should provide new insights to ongoing universal vaccine design efforts.MethodsFab expression and purification3I14 and 3I14D93N Fabs were individually cloned into pFastBac Dual vectors (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide fused to the light chain and a GP64 signal peptide fused to the heavy chain, along with a C-terminal His6-tag also fused to the heavy chain. Recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin II (Invitrogen). Fabs were expressed by infecting suspension cultures of High Five cells (Invitrogen) with baculovirus shaking at 110 r.p.m. for 72 h at 28 °C. The proteins were purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen), followed by gel filtration (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol.Expression and purification of HAs for crystallizationThe HA0’s from H3 (A/Victoria/361/2011), H6 (A/Taiwan/2/13), and H10 (A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013) were codon optimized and cloned into pFastBac vectors for expression in High Five insect cells. All constructs were fused with an N-terminal gp64 signal peptide, a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site, followed by a foldon trimerization sequence, and a His6-tag, as also described previously57. HA0s were purified via His-tag affinity chromatography, digested overnight with trypsin (New England Biolabs, 5 mU trypsin per mg HA, 16 h at room temperature) to remove the His-tagrimerization domain and ensure a uniform population of HA1/HA2. HAs were then run over a gel filtration column and found to be >95% pure by SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis.Crystallization and structural determination of HA-Fab complexesFor 3I14 Fab-HA or 3I14D93NFab-HA complex formation, Fab was added to HA in a molar ratio of 3.5 : 1, to achieve three Fabs per HA trimer, incubated at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C, and the complex was then purified from unbound Fab by gel filtration in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Protein complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and sitting drop vapor diffusion screens for all complexes were set up using a Phoenix liquid handler (Art Robbins Instruments) at a protein to buffer ratio of 1 : 1 and stored at 20 °C.H3-3I14 Fab crystals appeared within 3–5 days and were optimized via the hanging drop method in buffer containing 18–24% w/v PEG 3350, 0.2 M KCN, and 0.1 M Bis-Tris-Propane pH 7.5. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol, flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 3.7 Å resolution at the 19BM-D beamline (wavelength 0.97919 Å) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and were processed in space group P63 using XDS58. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser59, using the following search models: (i) a homology model of the variable region of 3I14 built using the PIGs server60, which had the HCDR3 removed; (ii) the Fab constant region from PDB 4PY8; and (iii) a single H3 protomer from PDB 4O58. One HA protomer (HA1/HA2) of the HA trimer was found in the asymmetric unit, along with one 3I14 Fab. After initial rounds of rigid body refinement with Phenix61, unbiased density from the Fo–Fc map was used to build the 3I14 Fab HCDR3, as well as for building of N-linked glycans to H3. The model was iteratively rebuilt for several more rounds using Coot62 and refined using Phenix, with final Rwork/Rfree values of 0.231/0.282, respectively.H3-3I14D93N Fab complex was found to crystalize in the same condition as native 3I14 Fab-H3 described above. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol, flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 3.3 Å resolution at the 19BM-D beamline (wavelength 0.97919 Å) at APS and were processed in space group P63 using XDS58. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser using the solved H3-3I14 structure as a search model, with the mutant D93N residue of 3I14 omitted. The model was refined with Phenix, and residue N93 and glycans were built using Coot. Iterative rounds of refinement resulted in Rwork/Rfree values of 0.232/0.281, respectively.H6-3I14D93N Fab complex crystals appeared in 3–5 days from a drop containing 0.1 M MIB Buffer (sodium malonate, imidazole, and boric acid in the molar ratios 2 : 3 : 3) pH 5.0 and 25% PEG 1500. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 3.8 Å resolution at the 19BM-D beamline (wavelength 0.97919 Å) at APS and were processed in space group R32 using XDS. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser, using a single protomer of H6 from PDB 4XKD, and the solved portion of 3I14D93NFab from the complex with H3. One HA protomer (HA1/HA2) of the HA trimer was found in the asymmetric unit, along with one 3I14D93NFab. Iterative rounds of reciprocal space and real-space refinement were carried out using Phenix and Coot, respectively, resulting in Rwork/Rfree values of 0.276/0.333, respectively.H10-3I14 Fab complex crystals appeared in 3–5 days from a drop containing 15% w/v PEG 4000, 0.15 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES pH 6. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 4.2 Å resolution at the 23ID-B beamline (wavelength 1.033202 Å) at APS and were processed in space group P321 using HKL300063. The structure was solved by molecular replacement in Phaser, using a single protomer of H10 from PDB 5TGV as one search model and the solved 3I14 Fab structure from the above H3 complex as the other search model. Real-space and reciprocal space refinement were carried out using Phenix and Coot, with final Rwork/Rfree values of 0.261/0.309, respectively.X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Structural illustrations were prepared using PyMol64. Antibody–antigen interface analysis was carried out using the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies software, PISA, obtained from the European Bioinformatics Institute65. Prism 7.0 was used for graphical representation to compare buried surface area, CDR lengths and SHMs.Expression and purification of 3I14 and 3I14D93N IgG antibodiesGene fragments for either 3I14 or 3I14D93N were separately subcloned into human IgG1 expression vector TCAE666. The IgG1s were expressed in 293F cells (ThermoFisher, catalog number R79007) by transient transfection and purified by protein A sepharose affinity chromatography followed by buffer exchange into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using amicon ultra centrifugal filters with a 50 K molecular weight cut-off.Biolayer interferometryKinetic analyses of 3I14 and 3I14D93N binding to recombinant HAs were performed on biolayer interferometry using an OctetRED96 instrument (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA) at 25 °C. The 3I14 and 3I14D93N IgG were diluted to 5 nM in Pierce protein-free blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20) and then captured onto anti-human IgG Fc (AHC) biosensors (Fortebio) for 180 s. Binding of recombinant full-length HAs were probed at seven concentrations that were serial diluted starting at 100 nM for H6 experiments and 50 nM for H10 experiments. All experiments contained an additional anti-human IgG Fc antibody biosensor that tested for potential nonspecific interactions between HAs and anti-human IgG Fc. For the measurement of the association rate constant (Kon), association of 3I14 was measured for 300 or 600 s, and for the measurement of Koff, dissociation of 3I14 IgG1 was measured for 700 or 1200 s. Data were reference-subtracted and aligned with each other in the Octet Data Analysis software v11.0 (FortéBio) using a 1 : 1 binding model. All binding traces and curves used for fitting are reported in Supplementary Fig. 1.Extrinsic fluorescence assayExperiments were carried out as described for high-throughput thermal scanning67. Specifically, SYPRO Orange dye (Invitrogen) was supplied in dimethylsulfoxide at 5000× the working concentration for PAGE staining. Samples of 20 μL per well were prepared by mixing 1 μL of 200× SYPRO Orange (final concentration 10×) with 19 μL of protein (0.1 mg/mL or 2.1 μM) in PBS. Spectra were obtained on a Bio-Rad CFX96 thermal cycler Real-Time Detection System. Thermal denaturation curves (ramp rate of 1 °C/min at 0.2 °C intervals with an equilibration of 5 s at each temperature before measurement) were acquired by measuring fluorescence intensities using the Förster resonance energy transferchannel with excitation from 450 to 490 nm and detection from 560 to 580 nm. Melting temperatures are reported as the average, ±SD from four independent measurements.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Many lines have been drawn to similarities between COVID-19 and the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic that swept across the United States. University of Colorado Denver Professor Blair Gifford Blair Gifford, a professor in the University of Colorado Denver Business School, recently published an article in Health Management, Policy, and Innovation on Chicago hospital responses to the 1918 influenza epidemic. Using unique archival historical data, Gifford studied what the city of Chicago changed to increase hospital function and accessibility. At its height, the city of Chicago saw over 600 deaths per day from the flu, and over 14,000 Chicagoans died between 1918 and 1920. Unlike COVID-19, which has hit older populations especially hard, the 1918 epidemic brought death to young adults. For example, 2,000 more U.S. soldiers returning from World War I battlefields in Europe died from the epidemic than from in battle. To combat the spread of this deadly illness, Chicago’s public health leaders closed down various businesses and facilities, but schools and churches remained open on reduced schedules. Spatial distancing was practiced and masks were worn, especially by health professionals. “Deciding between public health lockdowns and keeping the economy going was a primary consideration for government officials in 1918, just like it is today,” said Gifford. “Public health officials put policies in place for spatial distancing, mask wearing, and business and dance hall closures. Schools, churches, and taverns were allowed to stay open, but with much reduced hours.” As archival data shows, hospitals and health professionals responded with valiant efforts. According to Gifford’s research, Passavant Hospital recorded in their annual meeting that “all the physical parts of the hospital were overtaxed.” The meeting notes stated that there should be a budget deficit, and that a large one will be no surprise. All epidemic patients were admitted, regardless of their ability to pay. This is similar to how hospitals and health insurance companies are handling COVID-19. According to NPR, most health systems participate in a program through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in which “uninsured patients with COVID-19 have their bills covered.” This program was set up through the pandemic relief legislation, known as the CARES Act. Gifford found that most private hospitals had moved away from admitting contagious patients and those with chronic diseases in the early 1900s. These diseases included alcoholism, insanity, and sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea, as well as contagious diseases like tuberculosis, as they were not seen to be “worthy” due to social implications. However, the 1918 epidemic changed this as hospitals recognized that their communities needed all available help. Staff at private hospitals filled their rooms beyond capacity and made makeshift arrangements in hallways, while doctors and nurses worked around the clock. “A majority of charitable community hospitals had stopped caring for contagious patients in the 1910s, leaving them for quarantine in public hospitals,” according to Gifford. “However, as hospitals saw a surge of flu patients, they reaffirmed their community institutional role by admitting as many flu patients as they could, contagious or not.” Written by Meghan Azralon, University Communications Related News CU Denver’s Quantum Programs Featured in New Report on Preparing the Workforce of Tomorrow from CU Boulder CU Denver’s MARC U-STAR Scholarship Program Helps Support PhD Dreams CU Denver Research Focuses on Solutions for Climate Change and Affordable Housing in Urban Settings Related Topics Campus, Chicago, City Stories, COVID-19, pandemic, research, Spanish Flu, Business School Next Story Contact Us Submit Content Subscribe Media Relations Give Now Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Accessibility Privacy Policy Legal Notices Accreditation Website Feedback Employment © 2022 The Regents of the University of Colorado, a body corporate.

You may view it here. I had a little bird, Its name was Enza. I opened the window, And in-flu-enza. This was a popular playground rhyme recited by children during the influenza pandemic of 1918, which wreaked havoc throughout the world. It ultimately claimed 675,000 American lives. As schools continue to navigate the choppy waters roiled by COVID-19 even as we look forward to finally receiving a vaccine, it is important to remember that this isn’t an unprecedented crisis. History can be a helpful teacher, and an overview of how New Jersey dealt with its schools during those fraught months in 1918 and 1919 can be both enlightening and instructive. Despite the difference of 100 years, conflicting opinions stemming from a combination of science, politics and ethics over the question of school closures echo with a familiar resonance. The 1918 flu was spread widely and internationally by soldiers during World War I. The virus almost certainly did not originate in Spain, but it had a particularly high-profile lethality there, which gave it a dubious name: the Spanish flu. There were no tests or vaccines to help combat the virus at that time. Preventative measures such as practicing good hygiene, quarantining the infected and shutting down public spaces were the most common responses to its wrath. There were multiple waves of the disease between the spring of 1918 and the winter of 1919. The most virulent of those waves in the United States occurred during the fall of 1918. The flu takes hold in New Jersey Toward the end of September 1918, the massive risks posed by the pandemic were becoming apparent in New Jersey. Schools had already long been recognized as an efficient means by which to rapidly disseminate information. In Newark, 70,000 fliers reporting the imminent dangers of the virus were distributed to students to take home and share with their families. Newark teachers were given a speech to read to their classes about the mounting threat. The Sept. 27, 1918 edition of the Newark Evening News ran an excerpt of the prepared speech: “A few weeks ago, some cases of Spanish Influenza were reported to have been found on ships arriving in the port of New York. Since then many thousands of cases have been reported from Boston, and a number of deaths. Some of our army camps are already infected with this disease, and there is reason to suppose that our own city will not escape. We may, however, do much to prevent this influenza from spreading in our families and a little knowledge may help us to control the disease should it appear in our own families or in the families of neighbors.” (Source: Influenza Encyclopedia, “Talks Explaining Influenza Prepared for Schools.”) By the first week of October, with the threat swiftly becoming a reality, the New Jersey Board of Health ordered a mandatory statewide closing of most public establishments. Despite the evident warning signs, there were still those in the community who continued to minimize the gravity of the pandemic, not unlike those who believe COVID-19 is overblown. An Oct. 4, 1918 editorial in the Madison Eagle, a newspaper published in the borough of Madison, claimed the number of cases were being exaggerated, “Humankind are somewhat like sheep in that they flock in the same general direction and are unceremoniously scared by the same bugaboos. Fashions change in ailments as in clothes and books. Just now the Spanish influenza is the popular fad. It’s easy to get and very awful when one gets it, but a good many people who think they have it and so report are deluding themselves and causing epidemic lists to swell unnecessarily.” (Source: MorristownGreen.com, “Quarantine, medical care, community: How Morris County overcame the 1918 influenza pandemic.” ) Like today, school closures uneven A notable exception to the statewide public shutdown mandate in early October were the schools. Though schools were being vastly shuttered across the country, New Jersey handled it its own way. Much like Gov. Phil Murphy’s decision this past August to provide flexibility for local communities to determine whether they were prepared to start in-person instruction or continue with remote learning in the fall, in October of 1918 Wallace Evans Edge, New Jersey’s governor at the time, in conjunction with then State Health Director Jacob C. Price, granted local municipalities authority on whether to close their respective schools. As was reported in the Tuckerton Beacon on Oct. 17, 1918. “Owing to the epidemic which seems to have nearly every state in its grasp, the [New Jersey] State Board of Health on Monday of last week ordered all local boards to shut down the places where people congregate, such as churches, theaters, motion picture theaters, barrooms, soda fountains, lodge rooms, dance halls and pool rooms. This order was mandatory as to the above, but local boards were given discretion as to closing schools.” (Source: Begin With a Question, “How Did NJ Reopen Schools in 1918?” ) Many public officials and community members still felt that children, especially those in urban settings, were better off being in school rather than playing in the streets. (See this article.) Others disagreed citing the serious health concerns and debates inevitably persisted. Although the spirit of local decision-making regarding schools was upheld at the state level, the inexorable surge in illness and death over subsequent weeks was impossible to ignore and school districts across New Jersey were eventually left little choice but to join other public spheres and close their doors. It is not clear what the students of New Jersey did over the ensuing weeks and months. Their learning was undoubtedly disrupted. Students would have had minimal amounts of homework during that time, according to Debbie Schaefer-Jacobs, curator in the Division of Cultural and Community Life at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. Teachers very well may have sent reading assignments home and if students wanted to practice spelling, they would have used alphabet or speller boards, which were popular learning tools at that time—a far cry from today’s tablets, laptop computers and Google Classroom. New Jersey officially ended its statewide quarantine on Oct. 21, 1918. However, local school districts were still given latitude about whether to open back up or not. As was reported by the New Jersey Courier of Toms River on Oct. 25, 1918. “The reopening of the schools of New Jersey will not depend upon the lifting of the quarantine by the state board of health, but upon the conditions existing in the various municipalities. This statement was made on Thursday by [New Jersey] State Commissioner of Education [Calvin] Kendall. The erroneous impression had been gained that November 4 had been fixed for reopening of the schools. It is entirely a matter for the municipalities to decide, the commissioner said.” (See this post.) Flu resurgence foils reopening plans New Jersey wouldn’t be out of the woods yet. By the early weeks of November, for example, new infections seemed to have decreased to the point that the municipalities of Hanover and Dover considered lifting their closures of public schools. This plan was soon thwarted after 90 new cases emerged, 60 of which were schoolchildren. This prompted Dover’s Board of Health to again close all public facilities on Nov. 23. This pattern emerged throughout New Jersey, and there was another extended quarantine in many parts of the state that lasted into December. The final wave of the virus appeared in January 1919 and dissipated once and for all that spring. Estimates of total deaths in the state caused by the flu pandemic have ranged from 10,000 to 20,000. COVID-19 and the influenza of 1918 As of Jan. 12, 2021, there were 17,980 confirmed deaths in New Jersey caused by COVID-19 and an additional 2,059 in which COVID-19 was deemed the probable cause—a total of 20,039 residents. Today, New Jersey has a population of 9 million, compared to 3 million during the 1918 influenza pandemic. While the 1918 flu pandemic was a proportionally more devastating disease, the sporadic opening and closing of the schools imposed by that virus’s unpredictable course seems disconcertingly relatable to the state’s current plight. Like many other parts of the country, we have seen dizzying vacillations between opening back up to in-person instruction and closing back down after confirmation of positive cases within a given school community. As we eagerly await the distribution of the vaccine, the debates about how to handle the education of our students in light of COVID-19 will likely continue to rage between state officials, school boards, parents, and school staff. Nonetheless, one thing will remain certain: the imperative to learn from our history, lest we repeat it.

(Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker\UGA) State vaccination mandates can reduce the spread of flu in vulnerable patients Pneumonia and the flu kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, racking up billions of dollars in medical costs and even more in lost productivity. But new research from the University of Georgia shows that state laws promoting flu vaccinations for hospital workers can substantially reduce the number of influenza-related deaths. Spanning 23 years, the study looked at the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia during peak flu season (from December through March of each year), comparing changes in mortality over time in the 13 states and Washington, D.C., that adopted laws to the changes in mortality in states without laws. All states that passed laws require the flu vaccines to be offered to hospital employees. Eleven took it a step further by mandating that workers be vaccinated or required documentation of refusal, with three requiring unvaccinated employees to wear surgical masks during flu season. A pharmacy student prepares a vaccine at the mobile flu shot clinic in the Walker Room at Rusk Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) The findings align with previous research suggesting that hospital workers may serve as vectors of disease transmission within their hospitals and even in their communities. States that mandated hospital workers receive flu shots saw the biggest reduction in mortality from flu and pneumonia. On average, the adoption of a law promoting vaccination reduced mortality by about two deaths per 100,000 persons, with the reductions primarily occurring among older adult populations. “The elderly are extremely vulnerable to influenza and are also generally less responsive to the vaccine,” said Emily Lawler, corresponding author of the study and an assistant professor in UGA’s School of Public and International Affairs. “This study suggests that vaccinating hospital workers against influenza reduces influenza disease transmission and helps protect this vulnerable population.” A federal mandate requiring hospital workers to get an annual flu shot would likely further reduce influenza-related deaths. Implications for COVID-19 This study did not closely examine why some health care workers refuse vaccines. However, if the COVID-19 vaccines are proven to prevent disease transmission—so far they’ve only been proven to protect the vaccinated individual from disease—then vaccinating hospital workers could be integral to dramatically reducing transmission of COVID-19 and mortality in communities across the country. “Stricter policies result in higher vaccination rates among health care workers,” Lawler said. “Our results are consistent with the idea that these stronger laws result in a larger reduction in influenza-related mortality.” Mandatory vaccinations don’t come without some controversy, though. In some cases, health care workers refuse to get vaccinated. It’s an issue with the flu shot, which varies in efficacy each year due the limitation of vaccine developers only being able to include several strains of the virus in a given shot. But it’s also occurring with the new COVID-19 vaccines at a surprisingly high rate among health care professionals, nursing home workers and other frontline personnel. This study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Co-authors were Mariana Carrera, from Montana State University, and Corey White, from California Polytechnic State University.

pandemic Last updated 27 January 2021 The 1918 influenza pandemic - commonly known as 'Spanish flu' - is the most significant health event ever recorded. The British Red Cross's museum and archives curator Mehzebin Adam explains how we responded The 1918 outbreak of influenza, the deadliest global pandemic in history, killed between 50 and 100 million people worldwide. Around 250,000 people died in Britain, and a large number were young and healthy adults. The pandemic, which lasted from 1918 to 1920, killed more people than the First World War. It was first reported in Spain as the country was one of the few in Europe to remain neutral during the war, and therefore not subject to wartime censorship. Although the origins of the outbreak are uncertain, wartime conditions such as the mass movement of troops, and overcrowded trenches and hospitals, contributed to the rapid spread. Just as the British Red Cross is providing vital relief to people affected by Covid-19 today, we played an essential role in caring for those affected by the influenza pandemic over 100 years ago. A call for volunteers British Red Cross VADs (Voluntary Aid Detachments) were already very involved in caring for the sick and wounded during the First World War. At the start of the pandemic, a request was made for the recruitment and training of more volunteers: The British Red Cross's country director at the time, Lord Chilston, said: “In view of the possibility of an epidemic of influenza, it is suggested that county directors should ascertain through the commandants of the detachments, which of their members would be prepared to assist the medical officers and district nursing associations… It is important that members volunteering for work in an influenza epidemic should be inoculated beforehand.” A VAD recruitment poster from the early 20th century Joyce Sapwell, a British Red Cross VAD nurse during the First World War, wrote about her experiences working in a hospital in Aldershot as the Spanish flu of 1918 took hold. “About one-third of the staff were down with it, and the hospital was full. We had one hundred and eight deaths in eight weeks… I had not even one orderly to help. Several patients became delirious, and if they got out of bed they usually died. I had to go from one ward… to the other all night long…This was a very hectic time, on the go all night.” A tremendous sacrifice Many VADs caught the virus while nursing patients and obituaries in the British Red Cross journals highlight the tremendous sacrifices they made: The obituary of Miss Emma Long reads: “nursed through the war at the Esher Red Cross Hospital, where she never missed a day, and was the most devoted worker; this is in addition to domestic work at her home. On demobilisation, she went to nurse village families during the influenza epidemic, contracted the disease, and died on Easter Day.” VADs at an auxiliary hospital in Oxford, between 1914 and 1918 Although VAD nurses were most affected, other Red Cross members also lost their lives. The obituary of Mr E.A. Alley, assistant honorary secretary of the East Lancashire branch, reads: “was especially concerned with the work of the men’s detachments, in the unloading of ambulance trains coming into Manchester, provision of staff for military hospitals, and the recruiting of orderlies for abroad.” Supplying medical equipment to hospitals The British Red Cross stores department, which was under huge demand during the pandemic, distributed large numbers of medical supplies to hospitals across the country as well as overseas. There were few treatment options for patients with influenza in 1918. Most treatments were aimed at making patients as comfortable as possible by reducing fevers and alleviating pain. The British Red Cross museum collection holds examples of some of the medical equipment used to treat patients with respiratory illnesses. THERE WERE FEW TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH INFLUENZA IN 1918. Vaporisers, like this one made by the Vapo-Cresolene company, were a popular treatment for diseases of the throat and respiratory system. The makers of the Vapo-Cresolene lamp claimed it would cure or considerably alleviate symptoms of influenza, whooping cough, asthma, diphtheria, and scarlet fever. Dr Nelson’s Inhaler was first introduced in 1865 for the treatment of chest infections and diseases. The inhaler would be filled with boiling water and one of the several accepted treatments of the period, and the patient inhaled the steam directly as it emerged from the glass mouthpiece. Before the use of saline intravenous infusions became widespread, keeping patients hydrated was difficult. Feeding cups made it easier for VAD nurses to get fluids and nutrients into patients who were too weak to sit upright. In addition to water, these cups were used to feed patients milk and beef tea. Sending relief overseas During the autumn and winter of 1918, every French and Belgian medical unit in military rest stations was full of patients suffering from influenza. The British Red Cross received a request for 400 beds for a rest station in France. British Red Cross VADs working in hospitals in France were extremely busy treating patients with influenza as well as the large convoys of severely wounded men arriving from the front. In November 1918, there was a severe outbreak of influenza among Swiss soldiers. The British Red Cross assisted the Swiss hospitals as much as possible, giving 1,338 items, including towels and clothing, which were much appreciated. British Red Cross female ambulance drivers in Etaples, France, 1914-1918 Kindness will keep us together In 1919 the League of Red Cross Societies was formed. Now called the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, it widened the role of national Red Cross societies from their focus on wartime relief to peacetime work. The focus was not only on responding to health crises but also on preventing future ones by promoting health, hygiene and first aid. The British Red Cross received a Supplemental Charter that extended its original objectives to include the improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world. Since then, the British Red Cross has delivered a range of health and social care services and supported the NHS. The organisation provided vital relief during previous pandemics such as the 1957 influenza, 2009 swine flu, and the recent Ebola outbreak. Red Cross societies are at the forefront of the coronavirus response During the current global Covid-19 pandemic, Red Cross societies around the world are at the forefront of the emergency response. The British Red Cross is helping with the emergency across the UK, from giving useful health advice to mobilising volunteers to help vulnerable people in society. While people everywhere face challenges during this crisis, the British Red Cross is determined to show the human capacity to support one another and how kindness will keep us together.

Not in 2021.The flu season is far from over — it usually begins in the fall, and peaks between December and February.Francesco Carta fotografo / Getty Images stockJan. 27, 2021, 4:39 PM UTC / Source: TODAYBy A. PawlowskiAs the world focuses on COVID-19, influenza — that other contagious respiratory illness caused by a virus — seems to have all but disappeared.Flu activity is “unusually low” for this time of year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest weekly U.S. influenza surveillance report.“The CDC is being modest — influenza is at record-setting lows,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, told TODAY.“The flu virus is not circulating in our population the way it normally does.”He and his colleagues have been conducting flu surveillance since the 1990s and have never seen illness levels close to this low, Schaffner noted.Flu activity is “significantly down,” added Dr. Nisa Maruthur, a primary care physician and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.Some 136 people were hospitalized for the flu between Oct. 1, 2020, and Jan. 16, 2021, and there were 292 deaths involving influenza during that period, the CDC reported. One child has died.The flu season is far from over — it usually begins in the fall, and peaks between December and February.But in comparison, 400,000 people were hospitalized for the flu and 22,000 died, including 434 children, during the entire 2019–2020 season, which the CDC described as “severe” for kids 4 years old and younger, and for adults 18-49 years old.The flu activity maps look very different for the same week in January 2020, compared to 2021, with most states reporting minimal activity this year:CDCIn 2020, high or very high flu activity dominated the map:CDCThe change is not surprising since the flu virus spreads through respiratory droplets, similar to the new coronavirus, and people are wearing masks, social distancing and paying attention to hand hygiene to avoid COVID-19, said Dr. Waleed Javaid, director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York.“Fewer people are out and about, and people are even hopefully less likely to be out if they are symptomatic,” Maruthur added. “In normal years, people who are symptomatic do not typically feel the same need to stay home.”But the major contributor has to do with children, who are usually “the great distribution engine” for the flu, Schaffner noted. Kids are very contagious because they make more influenza virus than adults and they shed it for longer periods of time.But during the coronavirus epidemic, many children are either learning from home, or wearing masks and social distancing at school.“Children are not getting infected and not bringing the virus home to their elders,” Schaffner said.It’s the reason he thinks the incredibly low flu activity during the coronavirus crisis won’t be repeated in the years to come.Still, mask-wearing could outlast the epidemic, especially since it has become familiar to people in the last year, Javaid said“Would it be a best practice in winter seasons to wear a mask? I am inclined to say yes,” he noted. “I think we should seriously consider using masks to reduce the intensity of flu seasons.”That could lessen flu hospitalizations and deaths in years to come, but there won’t be an impact if only a few Americans keep wearing masks and social distancing in future flu seasons, the experts said.RelatedHealth & WellnessHealth & WellnessIs it a cold, the flu or COVID-19? How to tell the differenceSome people are already declaring they’ll keep the mask habit given that they haven’t had the sniffles or any other cold and flu symptoms since the coronavirus started.I haven’t had a cold or even sniffles in a year. I’m going to keep wearing a mask in crowds and on planes even after I get vaccinated. They WORK.— Susan Orlean (@susanorlean) January 24, 2021 Other lessons learned are that physical distancing, getting the flu shot and staying home if you are symptomatic are also very effective, Maruthur added. More than 193 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed​ as of mid-January, the CDC said.“We're all used to seeing people wear masks now — no big deal. I think we may see much more of that and more cautious behavior during influenza season,” Schaffner noted.“Wear your masks, social distance — do those sorts of things on an annual basis. I think we'll see much more of that messaging because it's now more socially acceptable and familiar to many people.”Does a lighter-than-normal flu season so far this year mean the next one will be more problematic? Flu is "very quirky" so there's no way to predict what will happen in 2022, said NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres. The main message is to get a flu shot in the fall, and still get one now if you haven't already in case flu activity picks up in the coming weeks.A. PawlowskiA.

Prev Next By: Karen Rodriguez , Carrie Cochran Posted and last updated From the moment the coronavirus started to take root in the U.S., then-President Donald Trump continually downplayed the disease — sometimes flat out lying. "Death is way down from where it was," then-President Donald Trump told Axios in an interviewin August of 2020. Many journalists called out the misinformation in an attempt to get the truth out to the public. But that wasn’t the case in the worst pandemic in U.S. history."The refusal to tell the truth killed people. That's the biggest single lesson coming out of 1918," said historian John Barry, author of "The Great Influenza."Between 1918 and 1919, an estimated 675,000 Americans died of influenza."The pandemic was minimized as much as it has been today," said Barry. "The motive back then, of course, was they were afraid that any negative news would hurt morale and damage the war effort."In 1918, the U.S. was in the last stretches of World War I. To President Woodrow Wilson, talk of the pandemic was a distraction. Patriotism at all costs was needed — to ask Americans to send their boys overseas. And to send their money. Wilson assembled a powerful propaganda machine. And it worked."Newspapers were entirely complicit. They were either intimidated or volunteered," said Barry. Some newspapers covered the war and barely mentioned the pandemic. Others didn’t push back when public officials called it "ordinary influenza.""This was no ordinary influenza by another name. People could die 12 hours after the first symptoms," said Barry. "Including bleeding – not only from the nose, but from the mouth, from the eyes, from the ears."On one day alone, the city of Philadelphia lost 769 people to the illness and was in the throes of a second deadly wave. Yet when the Philadelphia Inquirer came out the next day it reported: “Philadelphia will soon be out of the clutches of the epidemic influenza”"When they finally, belatedly closed theaters, restaurants, schools and so forth, one of the newspapers actually said this is not a public health measure, you have no cause for panic or alarm," said Barry. "People are dying all around you. I mean, really, how stupid do they think people were?"And the Sedition Act of 1918 helped newspapers fall in line with the president’s objectives. Now you could get 20 years in prison if you "willfully utter, print, write or publish" anything disloyal about the U.S. government. So when Halbert L. Hoard, publisher of the Jefferson County Union in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, wrote an editorial criticizing the military for not doing enough to save soldiers from dying from the disease, Barry said the Army started to prosecute him."As the pandemic proceeded, that prosecution was dropped," Barry said.The Act ended up getting repealed after the war. But the damage had already been done. More Americans died from the 1918 flu than from the war. In fact, there were more American deaths from the pandemic than in the battles from the Civil War both World Wars and Vietnam – combined."The whole point of the freedom of the press is the freedom to criticize people in power," said Barry.

Give Light and the People Will Find Their Own Way </htmlA Safer, Speedier Flu Clinic arcwatch A Safer, Speedier Flu Clinic The Carlton County, Minnesota, GIS Team Used Esri ArcGIS to Digitize the Drive-Through Clinic’s Administrative Process When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threw a wrench into plans to host traditional walk-in influenza vaccine clinics, Carlton County, Minnesota, officials decided to go the safer, socially distanced route: sponsor a drive-through flu clinic where people could get vaccinated in their vehicles. But one problem remained: flu vaccine consent and screening information forms needed to be filled out. This meant that in addition to those getting vaccinated, multiple people—from volunteers to nurses—would have to touch pens and paper forms as they were passed back and forth. When GIS technician Siona Roberts learned about this problem during a Carlton County Public Health & Human Services COVID-19 response team meeting, she thought that a GIS data collection app just might be the perfect solution. “A lightbulb went off,” Roberts said. “We could use ArcGIS Survey123 to do this.” A sample of the online registration form provided to the public. The consent and screening forms required by county public health staff were combined into one form using ArcGIS Survey123. Getting people to fill out the vaccination forms digitally, either before or during their visit to the drive-through clinic, would reduce the potential for COVID-19 being passed from one person to another. In addition to digital collection of information at the clinic, everyone there would wear masks and the staff administering the vaccines would wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The project was a collaborative effort. There was input from the Carlton County GIS Department, Public Health & Human Services, Sheriff’s Office, Land Department, Transportation Department, Building Maintenance Department, and Information Technology (IT) Department. Together the team members began creating location technology-based solutions that would eliminate concerns related to COVID-19 transmission, such as standing in line with others, sharing pens, and having multiple people touch paper forms. A man gets his vaccination at the drive-through flu clinic. Clinic Goes Digital Roberts recently began working with GIS coordinator Jared Hovi, who had been the lone GIS professional at the Carlton County Land Department since 2008. Together they have been using Esri ArcGIS to manage land records, help develop data for next generation 9-1-1 systems, and create a variety of new apps for the county. Hovi said Carlton County has an Esri Small Municipal and County Government Enterprise Agreement, which includes ArcGIS Online. ArcGIS Online comes with software such as ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Hub Basic, and ArcGIS Dashboards. All were eventually used for the drive-through flu clinic project. Because of the COVID-19 public health threat and the availability of GIS technology, Carlton County Public Health & Human Services—which serves 36,000 residents in northeastern Minnesota—decided to go all digital for its drive-through flu clinic in September 2020, except for the administration of the vaccines, of course. Last summer, when planning was under way for the flu clinic, the county was expecting a spike in COVID-19 cases that fall. (As of February 8, 2021, there were 2,515 confirmed and 425 probable COVID-19 cases in Carlton County and 43 deaths.) “We had a complex situation,” said Jenny Barta, a public health nurse specialist for Carlton County Public Health & Human Services and a registered nurse. “We thought, ‘We have to keep people separated and far apart.'” The clinic was scheduled for September 25 and 26, 2020, with preregistration starting a week earlier. So by August, Roberts and Hovi had begun to strategize and then configure and test the apps. The ArcGIS Survey123 forms would be the linchpin of this new flu clinic model and for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution process that would occur later in the year. (Read the Time magazine article that describes the use of Esri technology for the COVID-19 vaccinations in Carlton County). The signature portion of the on-site registration form within ArcGIS Survey123. By using the signature capability within Survey123, all screening and consent forms could be made completely digital. Online forms would make registration for the flu clinic faster and easier for the public and provide real-time statistics, enabling county officials to quickly analyze how many people were being vaccinated and how fast this was being done. Preregistration forms would also help the county determine clinic attendance as well as how many people would be needed to staff it. Important information about individuals receiving the flu vaccine—such as which type of vaccine they received—could be stored and accessed rapidly, and responses could be standardized to avoid data entry errors. The county’s IT staff also played a vital role in making plans, preparing Apple iPads, and ensuring that robust Wi-Fi coverage was in place. Hovi and Roberts used ArcGIS Hub to create the Carlton County Drive-Through Flu Vaccine Clinic site with basic details such as the dates and times of the event and contact information. (A link to that site was shared on the main Carlton County website, on the county’s Facebook page, and with local media). People could register for the flu clinic by visiting the site created using ArcGIS Hub. The Hub site also included a flu clinic registration icon. Clicking the icon opened an ArcGIS Survey123 form that needed to be filled out with all the pertinent personal and insurance- and health-related information that registrants were required to provide. The flu vaccine consent and screening questionnaire asked for each registrant’s name, address, insurance status, and telephone number and included questions such as whether they were currently ill and whether they had an allergy to eggs or a component of the influenza vaccine. Hovi and Roberts configured three additional ArcGIS Survey123 forms for the flu clinic: An on-site registration form—used for those who were unable to preregister, and completed by Carlton County staff with the use of iPads—that enabled participants to register as they waited in line in their cars to receive their vaccines A check-in form for providing information such as the participant’s name, date of birth, telephone number, and insurance status and, if applicable, the name of their insurance company A vaccine administration form, used to record critical details about the vaccine that the participant received Also, a QR Code was generated, which was displayed for vehicles entering the Carlton County Department of Transportation building in Carlton, Minnesota, where the drive-through clinic was held. By scanning the code using their smartphones, participants got easy access to the preregistration form. For the drive-through COVID-19 vaccination clinic held December 29, 2020, residents who qualified for the vaccine were emailed preregistration information that included a URL to the ArcGIS Survey123 form. If they didn’t preregister, they could access the form by scanning a QR code at the Carlton County Department of Transportation building when they arrived to get their vaccination. Seventy vaccine doses were administered on December 29. Dashboards were configured for the clinic’s registration and vaccination stations, providing real-time insight on the number of people registered, how many were vaccinated each day, and how many registered but were not yet vaccinated. Traffic flow was also reflected in the dashboard statistics; graphs showed, by time and date, how many people registered, and—by hour—how many participants came in. (The same type of dashboards were configured for the COVID-19 vaccination clinic in December.) For many of the clinic staff, the most valuable dashboard was the one that displayed ratings given by vaccine recipients who participated in a survey after their visit. Displayed on a 50-inch screen that could be easily seen by the staff at the building that hosted the drive-through event, the dashboard provided a barometer of success for the new clinic format, based on feedback from the public. The dashboard also showed comments submitted during the survey such as “quick” and “wonderful process” as well as “very well organized!” and “Do this for [COVID-19]!” What made the project interesting to Roberts was that there was no location data to work with. “When you think about GIS, you think about a spatial component,” she said. “There was no spatial component to the flu products.” That also made the project a challenge, according to Hovi. For example, the location of registrants wasn’t captured when they filled out the ArcGIS Survey123 forms, ensuring privacy. While ArcGIS Survey123 does generate a shape field (which contains the geometry of a feature), the GIS team ensured that registrants’ forms did not require a logged location by storing 0,0 in that field. “We took the geospatial component completely out of it and just worked with tabular data,” Hovi said. “It led to some creative thinking. We knew we could put it together and make it work.” A lot of work went into setting up some of the dashboards. For example, clinic staff used ArcGIS Dashboards to check people in to the clinic who had already registered. As people submitted their ArcGIS Survey123 forms online in the days leading up to the event, the information collected was fed into a secured feature class hosted on the county’s GIS server, which could then be accessed using ArcGIS Dashboards. Hovi said that during check-in, a volunteer with ArcGIS Dashboards on an iPad could just ask for a registrant’s telephone number, type that number in a search box, and retrieve that person’s registration information. Telephone numbers were used for searches because using a name, said Hovi, could turn up multiple people with the same name. With no spatial component to the data, dashboards were used to view the collected tabular data from the ArcGIS Survey123 forms. Flu clinic attendees were checked-in via search functions set up in a dashboard. Attendees could be searched for using their telephone number, name, and/or date of birth. Success with GIS Barta said that the flu clinic was wildly successful, with 711 people getting vaccinations out of the 771 people who had registered. Plus, the county finally made the switch to digital forms, something Barta said she knew needed to be done at some point in time. That digital process helped speed people through the clinic too. For the people who had preregistered, the average time for getting a vaccine—from the time they checked in up to the time they exited the garage—was only about five minutes, Barta said. “The turnout was excellent. This was by far the most people we have vaccinated [during the annual clinic],” said Barta, crediting both the smooth online registration process using GIS technology and the strong outreach to local media, school officials, and county employees. Perhaps an even greater long-term benefit was that the drive-through flu clinic marked the first time the Carlton County GIS team worked on a public health project, portending even more opportunities for collaboration in the future. Barta said the information about the project was shared with the Carlton County Board of Commissioners, who have been shown the dashboards and have seen “the ingenuity of our GIS team.” To learn more about the Carlton County flu clinic, view the ArcGIS StoryMaps story called A Flu Clinic for a New Era created by Carlton County with Esri partner Pro-West & Associates.

AlamyA recent Scientific American feature explores how the catastrophic 1918 influenza pandemic seemed to quickly slip from public discourse. The event killed more than 50 million people worldwide, yet it takes up comparatively little space in society’s “collective memory.” The article considers, by analogy, how the current COVID-19 pandemic might be remembered by future generations. Scientific American accompanied the feature with a call for letters telling the stories of families affected by the 1918 crisis. Below are some examples of what we received.Readers RespondFor what it’s worth, and because you asked for notes about this: my grandfather died in what I believe was the second wave of the pandemic on September 24, 1918. He was 26 and otherwise very healthy. He had two daughters, aged two and under one. The older daughter was my mother, and of course, she and her sister never knew their father in any real sense. My grandmother was deeply affected by his death, as you can imagine, and she always seemed to believe that he had caught a cold and that she could have done more to save him. This made her deeply anxious, more or less permanently, about the health of everyone in the family and especially me—I was named after my grandfather and was very close to her—and I always hid any cold that I had from her. In lots of ways, my grandfather’s death reverberated through the generations: it had a real effect on my mother and, eventually, me. His name was Samuel Rubinson, born August 15, 1892.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

It was the only family story ever told about her. Gone at 38, leaving five small children. My father was nine years old. In my book, Influenza and Inequality: One Town’s Tragic Response to the Great Epidemic of 1918, I wrote of this lack of memory. My book covers the epidemic, and epidemic behavior, in one small town—Norwood, Mass. I have dozens of personal stories in there, stories I heard from survivors, families and descendants. I believe that this lack of collective memory is linked in large part to the population of victims: the majority were young, foreign-born and poor. Influenza did not discriminate but, like today, those who could afford to stay home and avoid infection were the privileged. Then, as now, it was marginal communities—those who lived and worked in hazardous environments and lacked medical access—who were struck down. In 1918 Hispanics and Asians in California; Mexicans in New Mexico and Texas; Polish, Italian and Irish immigrants in northern cities; and, as always, Native Americans and Black individuals were the most severely affected. Children left orphaned were often adopted by others and never told of their history. And, of course, unlike today, the majority of victims were between 20 and 40 years old. Who was going to remember young, poor immigrants? Who was going to build a memorial or write a history for such outcasts? They were nameless, voiceless and, as one scholar noted, “rapidly replaced.” Another early historian of the 1918 epidemic wrote, “If the pandemic had killed one or more of the really famous figures of the nation or the world it would have been remembered.... Spanish influenza characteristically killed young adults and therefore rarely men in position of great authority.” That’s no defense. Hopefully, today’s victims will not be so invisible and easily forgotten.Patricia J. FanningProfessor emeritus of sociology, Bridgewater State UniversityFlu patients get treatment at an army ward in Kansas in 1918. Credit: Alamy I just read your article on the 1918 flu (the University of Washington sent it out on our daily newsletter because you interviewed a U.W. faculty member), and I noted the call for stories about ancestors at the end.It’s funny, that very “forgetting” rang true for me and my family, too. I just spoke with my 91-year-old grandmother about 10 days ago, and she told me that her father (my great-grandfather, Georg Monsen) survived the 1918 pandemic but that his older brother, the older brother's wife and their two kids all died of it. I’ve been alive for four decades and am close to my grandmother, but I never heard any of this history until now. Plus, she said that her father had hearing loss for the rest of his life because of the effects of that flu, as did other members of the family that had it but survived. This all took place in western Norway, where my grandmother is originally from.Tabitha Grace MalloryHenry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of WashingtonI’m 71 years old. During my college years, I’d stay at my grandmother’s house almost every weekend. Grandmother and her sister, Anita, shared the house. On Sunday, we’d all go to the local Methodist church that my dad had helped build when he was younger.One day, back home from church, my Great-Aunt Anita told me that after World War I, her whole family died from the 1918 flu: her husband and children. She believed, very strongly, that God had punished her, and she did not know why.She still went to church and prayed.She never talked about it again. If she’d told me how many children she’d had, I don’t remember.My Grandmother and Aunt Anita have since passed away.Steven Olivervia e-mailLung slides from the 1918 flu pandemic. Credit: Karen Kasmauski Alamy My great-grandfather, Navy Captain John King, made it through the Great War and died of influenza on a hospital ship off City Island in New York City. My grandmother (his daughter) used to take me to lunch on City Island. We always had to drive to the end of the avenue, where we could look across the Long Island Sound and East River to where the ship had been. Grandma would recall her mother asking to be driven there to remember—remember her husband coming home from war and then being on that ship and never coming home again. After this the family (mom and four kids) moved to Baltimore, and Great-Grandma became an expert seamstress to pay the bills.Karen Romano Youngvia e-mailAmong the 675,000 people in the U.S. who lost their lives 102 years ago were nearly all of my great-grandmother’s immediate family. Both of her parents and a brother died. Her first husband and their one-year-old daughter died the same day in October 1918 and were buried together in the same coffin. After losing them, she wrote a letter to the local newspaper thanking friends and neighbors for helping to see her through the devastation. At the age of only 22, she was pregnant with her second child, a son who would never know his father. She also had to raise her younger siblings who survived. Later, she remarried. I am descended from that second marriage.This happened in Oklahoma, a state that is currently dealing with spikes of COVID-19 and very sporadic mask compliance—with no statewide mandate in place. It’s demoralizing that a century after the 1918 pandemic, I have to ask: What have we learned? That those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.Shannon Leigh O’Neilvia e-mailTwo people wear masks in this photograph from 1918–1919. Credit: Alamy My dad would have been about 16 years old when the 1918 influenza both took his own father's life and sickened him. I was a child when he told me that, as the disease faded, “all [his] hair fell out.” It would be interesting to know if hair loss (head, body or both) was common in survivors of that disease. I’ve read it can follow high fevers.In 1920 my father—with, by then, an abundant resupply of hair—entered the U. S. Naval Academy. No doubt at least some of his classmates were also influenza survivors. I’m inclined to believe that in the process of bonding with one another, they would have shared their “collective memories” of experiencing “the flu.”It was routine, in this bonding process, for the men to confer on one another rather graphic or comic nicknames, which sometimes stuck with their recipients. I sometimes wonder whether a fellow survivor in my dad’s unit, being less blessed than my dad with an exuberant regrowth of hair, gave him the nickname that would follow him for the rest of his Navy career: “Woof.”At age 75, I’m at the tail end of those who were spared by vaccination from the terrible scourges of smallpox, tetanus and diphtheria. But we had to experience for ourselves—and risk the complications—of illnesses now rarely seen in the developed world: measles, rubella, chicken pox, mumps, polio. Such experiences have certainly generated moments of collective memory.It may not be like surviving the sinking of the Titanic—but each of these epidemics brought a potentially catastrophic aura, and each marked the families who suffered through them.Elizabeth R. HatcherTopeka, Kan.My paternal grandmother was born in 1900 in Conshohocken, just outside of Philadelphia, to immigrants from Molise, Italy. She was the fourth of 13 children. She was a strong women with few stories. Yet when I was a youngster in the 1960s, several times she told me a short one: “When I was 18 [years old], four of my younger [siblings] died during the [Great Influenza]. They were buried in a mass grave along the cemetery wall. My father died a few years later from a weakened heart.” I am a fairly good amateur family genealogist, having uncovered many family facts, but I have been unable to track this one down well. From the local newspaper and records from the area’s Catholic cemetery, I have confirmed a substantial two-week spike in deaths in Conshohocken shortly after the peak in Philadelphia in the fall. For those two weeks, the front page of the local newspaper was split vertically down the middle: one side covered the Great War, and the other side, the “Spanish flu.” My great-grandfather did indeed die in 1925. For the past five decades, family stories from remote relatives only know of nine children, not 13. Unfortunately, I don’t know the four other children’s names or genders, as I cannot find them in the 1910 census. And by 1920 they are dead—no death certificates. I need to keep working at it.Michael F.

Until very recently, smallpox vaccines were delivered using a technique known as skin scarification, in which the skin is repeatedly scratched with a needle before a solution of the vaccine is applied. Almost all other vaccines today are delivered via intramuscular injection, with a needle going directly into the muscle, or through subcutaneous injection to the layer of tissue beneath the skin. However, researchers have now suggested that vaccines delivered by skin scarification may offer better protection against respiratory diseases.According to a new pre-clinical study, conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, US, skin scarification may help generate lung T cells and provide protection against infectious diseases, with implications for prevention of COVID-19.“We have known for years that this technique was a good way to generate T cells that would home to the skin, but our study shows that skin scarification is also an effective way to generate T cells that home to the lungs,” said Dr Thomas Kupper, lead researcher of the study. “Vaccine development today is focused on selecting the best antigen(s) for T cells and B cells. However, for a vaccine to work to its full potential, it also needs to direct T cells to where they are needed most. For respiratory pathogens, that means getting T cells to the lungs.”Historically, smallpox vaccines used live vaccinia virus (VACV). More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), a modern alternative that lacks about 10 percent of the parent genome and cannot replicate in human cells. MVA, as a smallpox vaccine, is injected subcutaneously.Kupper and colleagues investigated if the skin scarification route of immunisation with MVA could provoke a more effective T-cell response than other routes of immunisation. The team inoculated mice using either skin scarification, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intradermal injection. Skin scarification generated more T cells, produced greater numbers of lung-specific T cells and provided superior protection against lethal viral doses than the others.“We used to think that lung-homing T cells could only be generated by direct lung infection, but here we find overlap between T cells appearing after lung infection and T cells generated through skin scarification,” said Kupper.The work has now spurred the Kupper lab to explore the potential for using the MVA vector and skin scarification technique to develop more powerful and potentially universal vaccines against other infectious illnesses such as influenza and coronaviruses.The study was published in Npj vaccines.

The creepy, bird-like dolls were inspired by In Flew Enza, a children's rhyme sung during the Spanish flu pandemic from 1918 to 1920.Bird named Enza became touchstone for Charlotte Sigurdson's new workCarmen Ponto · for CBC News · Posted: Jan 24, 2021 7:00 AM EST | Last Updated: January 24, 2021Artist creates COVID-19 bird dolls based on children's chant from Spanish Flu4 years agoDuration 4:32Pandemic history and 'In Flew Enza' rhyme inspiration behind Charlotte Sigurdson's new art. Film by Tyler Funk and Carmen Ponto.Social SharingCharlotte Sigurdson has always turned to history to make sense of the present."There's a human instinct to look back at how things have been handled in the past," she said.While living through the current pandemic, the Winnipeg artist started learning about a past one: the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918.And inspiration struck.While listening to a history podcast, she heard a children's chant from that period. It featured a bird named Enza who brought sickness wherever he went. I had a little bird His name was Enza I opened the door And in-flu-enza!Winnipegger Charlotte Sigurdson was a lawyer before shifting to a life as an artist. (Tyler Funk and Carmen Ponto)During the Spanish Flu, children chanted the verse as many of the young adults around them — their parents, teachers and neighbours — became the primary victims of influenza and often died.A mother herself, Sigurdson was deeply moved by what she learned and began to create.The result? Intricate and detailed art dolls, carefully crafted from clay and textiles, featuring Enza the bird."The idea of the flu, and contagious diseases in general, in my mind started to take the shape of this bird," she said."They could be anywhere. This innocuous thing … bringing this great sorrow. It just felt really right." Sigurdson's story is also the focus of a new short film by Winnipeg filmmakers Tyler Funk and Carmen Ponto for CBC Manitoba's Creator Network.A handmade doll, inspired by a Spanish flu children's song, is dressed in vintage lace. Winnipeg artist Charlotte Sigurdson has been creating new dolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tyler Funk and Carmen Ponto)The art dolls have delicately painted faces and are dressed in 1900s-style formal wear. A gentleman doll has the face of a bird while another doll is a melancholy woman holding a bird's head. The dolls are a new endeavour for Sigurdson, who started her professional life as a lawyer.Winnipeg artist Charlotte Sigurdson sews clothes for her handmade dolls. She was inspired to create the hybrid bird and human dolls after discovering the children's song In Flew Enza, which is about the Spanish flu. (Tyler Funk and Carmen Ponto)Deciding law wasn't for her, she launched a bath and body products business before landing where she feels most at home: motherhood and full-time art.Sigurdson began making children's dolls in 2017 before graduating to the more intricate art dolls she creates now. "I didn't really understand the depths of humanity until I became a mother," she said."Once that happened, it was a very natural thing to start expressing myself through my art.… It's just sort of evolved into what it is now." While navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, Winnipeg artist Charlotte Sigurdson drew from history and the Spanish flu of 1918 to create her new dolls. (Tyler Funk )Sigurdson now creates art whenever she has a spare moment, and says doing so has become a necessary aspect of her identity; she finds catharsis both in researching and creating her pandemic-inspired pieces.Her followup art involves themes of isolation and prairie-wind-induced madness.Sigurdson's work can be seen on Instagram @charlotte_sigurdson_studio.ABOUT THE AUTHORCarmen PontoFilmmaker, writer, producerCarmen Ponto is a freelance journalist and filmmaker from Winnipeg.

The FSSAI has urged the food business operators (FBOs) and consumers not to panic and ensure proper handling and cooking of poultry meat and eggs for their safe consumption. As on January 23, outbreaks of avian Influenza (Bird flu) have been confirmed in nine states (Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab) for poultry birds and in 12 States (Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab). FSSAI has also issued a guidance document on safe handling, processing and consumption of poultry meat and eggs during bird flu pandemic for creating awareness among the FBOs and consumers.Poultry meat and eggs from the areas affected by the outbreak of bird flu should not be consumed raw or partially cooked, it warned. "However, to date, no evidence indicates that anyone has become infected following the consumption of properly cooked poultry or poultry products, even if these foods were contaminated with the avian influenza virus," FSSAI said.The World Health Organization (WHO) also states that it is safe to consume poultry meat and eggs. According to the WHO official website, there is no epidemiological data which suggests that the disease can be transmitted to humans through cooked food.The major Do's and Don'ts suggested are -- do not eat half-boiled eggs, do not eat undercooked chicken, avoid direct contact with birds in the infected areas, avoid touching dead birds with bare hands, do not keep raw meat in the open, no direct contact with raw meat, use mask and gloves at the time of handling raw chicken, wash hands frequently, maintain the cleanliness of surroundings and eat chicken, eggs and their products after cooking.The virus is destroyed at a temperature of 70-degree Celsius if held for about three seconds. Also, properly cooking meat or eggs to achieve a temperature of 74-degree Celsius in eggs or all parts of meat will inactivate the virus.Although sick birds will normally stop producing eggs, eggs laid in the early phase of the disease could contain the virus in the egg-white and yolk as well as on the surface of the shell. Proper cooking inactivates the virus present inside the meat and eggs, the FSSAI said.HealthRelated StoriesNo stories found. © thenewsminute 2024Powered by Quintype The News Minute www.thenewsminute.com INSTALL APPThe Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Confirmed Bird Flu Has Been Reported in Poultry Birds From 9 States & Wild Birds From 12 States Become a MemberDark ModeBecome a MemberNaukri CrisisUncovering HateMaharashtra ElectionManipur ConflictClimate ChangeMembers OnlyWebQoofMy ReportBrand StudioFITGenderOpinionVideosEntertainmentSportsWorldExplainersMorePodcastsPoliticsThe Quint LabGraphic NovelsLawEducationMembers' OpinionSouth AsiansNEONDark ModeBecome a MemberHomeNaukri CrisisUncovering HateMaharashtra ElectionAbout UsT&CPrivacy PolicyBECOME A MEMBERCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019FOLLOW US ONAbout UsContact UsPrivacy Policy ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE ADCentre Confirms Bird Flu Outbreak in 13 States Bird flu outbreak has been confirmed in nine states for poultry birds and 12 states for crow/migratory/wild birds.IANSUpdated: 24 Jan 2021, 7:36 PM ISTIndiaiAaAaSmallAaMediumAaLargeCases of bird flu have been confirmed in 13 states so far, of which avian influenza has been reported in poultry birds from nine states, and in wild birds from 12 states, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying confirmed on Saturday.As of 23 January, outbreaks of avian influenza (bird flu) have been confirmed in nine states (Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab) for poultry birds and in 12 states (Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, and Punjab) for crow/migratory/wild birds, said the ministry in a statement.Also ReadBird Flu Outbreak: Is It Safe to Eat Chicken?

C. GrimesUpdated: Jan. 29, 2021 4:03 pm EST Shutterstock Medical historian Joseph Waring called the 1918 flu "the greatest medical holocaust in history," according to the Spokesman-Review. Between 1918 and 1919, the illness infected an estimated 500 million people, roughly one third of the world's population, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The flu proved deadlier than WWI, killing at least 50 million people, compared to an estimated 7 million civilians and 9 million soldiers killed by the conflict. Some estimates of the pandemic's death toll top 100 million people. Advertisement This pathogenic juggernaut swept the world in three waves, the first of which occurred in the spring of 1918. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the initial bout proved so mild that some physicians concluded it wasn't actually influenza. Then came the second wave, which caused the overwhelming majority of mortalities. Death rates were all over the place, and isolated populations suffered the worst. The NAS writes that "in the Fiji islands, it killed 14 percent of the entire population in 16 days. In Labrador and Alaska, it killed at least one-third of the entire native population." What changed? How did the flu pandemic's second wave become an ocean of death? Nations were ill-equipped to fight the flu and ill-inclined to tell the truth Shutterstock Back in 1918, the world was ill-equipped to combat a flu pandemic, and military combat exacerbated matters. The first modern flu vaccine didn't exist until 1938, according to Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and the National Academy of Sciences notes that the 1919 strain of the flu had highly unusual symptoms, causing doctors to misdiagnose it as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. Meanwhile, WWI turned the world into a pathogenic powder keg. Advertisement In an interview with PBS NewsHour, author Kenneth Davis argued, "Because military men were sent overseas, or sailors were sent from one port to another, the flu quickly spread across the U.S," where 675,000 Americans died of the virus. In his book, More Deadly Than War, Davis also asserts that a massive influx of refugees in cities, poor nutrition, and a dearth of nurses, doctors, and medications all contributed to the lethality of the pandemic. Warring nations worsened the situation by hiding information about the less severe first wave of influenza, the rationale being that divulging the truth would ruin morale about the war. The U.S. even passed legislation outlawing speech that disparaged the federal government. So officials simply downplayed outbreaks, essentially telling people not to sweat it. That misinformation helped spread illness and devastation on a historic scale. Advertisement Recommended Advertisement
