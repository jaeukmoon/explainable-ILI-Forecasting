On March 29, MDARD announced the state’s first HPAI-positive dairy herd located in Montcalm County. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed these detections late in the evening on April 11. "What is happening with HPAI in Michigan, mirrors what is happening in states across the country. This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert. This news is unfortunate and upsetting for our poultry and dairy farming families and communities," said Boring. "Experts from across the nation continue to assess this situation and provide insights into the role of HPAI in the affected livestock as they become aware. MDARD continues working with our federal, state, and local partners to respond robustly to this disease. Thanks to recent budget investments, MDARD is well poised to properly engage in this response. If you believe your livestock are showing clinical signs, contact your veterinarian immediately. We're all on the same team as we combat HPAI." According to the USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease and Prevention, the commercial milk supply remains safe due to federal animal health requirements and pasteurization. Federal experts continue to stress there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses any increased risk to consumer health. Analysis of the virus from this case and the other cases of affected cattle has not shown any significant new adaptation to make the virus more transmissible between mammals. Therefore, the public health risk associated with HPAI remains low. In Michigan, state law requires pasteurization for any milk sold in stores. Pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. “HPAI doesn’t affect dairy cows the same way as it does with poultry. With proper veterinary care, cows are recovering. Biosecurity is the best line of defense. Still, we want to stress working with your veterinarian is fundamental for the recovery of affected dairy cows,” said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland, DVM, MS, DACVPM. “It continues to be vitally important for producers to work with their veterinarian, minimize the number of visitors to their farms, prevent contact between their animals and wildlife, and continue to monitor the health of animals vigilantly.” Dairies continue to be strongly encouraged to implement enhanced biosecurity measures to help prevent the spread of disease. It is recommended to limit persons coming onto dairies to employees and essential personnel only and to follow best management practices, including washing hands often. Additional biosecurity resources are available through Secure Milk Supply. HPAI is a highly contagious virus in birds and poultry that can be spread directly by infected wild birds or animals or indirectly through any item that has been exposed to the virus, such as equipment, feed, or the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The virus has been detected in various species of mammals, presumably after the animals come into contact with infected birds. The affected premises voluntarily stopped movement to limit the spread of the disease. Producers who have concerns about their animals' health and/or questions regarding how to improve the measures they take to protect animal health on their farm should contact their veterinarian. If anyone suspects the presence of HPAI or any other reportable animal disease in their domestic animals, contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after-hours). For more information on the detections of HPAI in cattle, please visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website.

At this time, there is no indication that this human infection with A(H9N2) virus in Vietnam is causing person-to-person spread or poses a threat to the U.S. public. CDC is following the H9N2 situation closely and coordinating with domestic and international partners. CDC Update April 12, 2024 — Vietnam has reported the country's first human infection with a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H9N2) virus. This is a different subtype of avian influenza than the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus that is most commonly reported globally and which is causing outbreaks in poultry and cattle in the U.S. currently. Wild water birds are hosts to avian influenza viruses, and infected birds shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces. Rare human infections with avian influenza viruses can happen when virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. Sporadic human infections with avian influenza viruses are not surprising in people with direct or close unprotected exposures to sick or dead birds or other animals in areas with endemic spread among wild birds or other animals. At this time, there is no indication that this human infection with A(H9N2) virus in Vietnam is causing person-to-person spread or poses a threat to the U.S. public. Human infections with A(H9N2) viruses have been reported sporadically in more than 100 people since 1998 in China, and in Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Oman, Pakistan, and Senegal. Although a small number of deaths have been reported, infections with (H9N2) avian influenza viruses have mostly resulted in mild upper respiratory tract illness symptoms. All A(H9) viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses and cause few signs of disease in infected wild birds. A(H9N2) viruses have been detected in bird populations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and notably, A(H9N2) viruses are the most commonly identified avian influenza viruses in Vietnam, representing more than 50% of all subtyped detections from live bird markets in that country. Antibodies to H9 viruses have also been previously reported in Vietnamese poultry workers. The infection in Vietnam occurred in an adult with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized on March 16, 2024, and the patient remains hospitalized for monitoring and treatment. On March 23, 2024, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases supported by the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) sequenced a portion of the genome with results similar to earlier influenza A(H9) viruses. An original sample from March 23 was sent to Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh (PI-HCM) on April 1, and PI-HCM also detected influenza A(H9) viruses. CDC is following the H9N2 situation closely and coordinating with domestic and international partners.

In this exploratory study, we use serum from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination in children (NCT00792051) conducted at the onset of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) and monitored for infection. We found that seasonal vaccination increases pH1N1 specific antibodies and FcR effector functions. Furthermore, prospective baseline antibody profiles after seasonal vaccination, prior to pH1N1 infection, show that unvaccinated uninfected children have elevated ADCC effector function, FcγR3a and FcγR2a binding antibodies to multiple pH1N1 proteins, past seasonal and avian (H5, H7 and H9) strains. Whereas, children that became pH1N1 infected after seasonal vaccination have antibodies focussed to seasonal strains without FcR functions, and greater aggregated HA-specific profiles for IgM and IgG3. Modeling to predict infection susceptibility, ranked baseline hemagglutination antibody inhibition as the highest contributor to lack of pH1N1 infection, in combination with features that include pH1-IgG1, H1-stem responses and FcR binding to seasonal vaccine and pH1 proteins. Thus, seasonal vaccination can have benefits against pandemic influenza viruses, and some children already have broadly reactive antibodies with Fc potential without vaccination and may be considered ‘elite influenza controllers’.

Children are particularly susceptible to influenza virus infection and represent the highest number of hospital admissions during seasonal epidemics, whilst individuals with comorbidities and older adults have higher mortality. Seasonal influenza vaccines have limited protection against pandemic virus infection, yet in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, seasonal vaccine efficacy from infection in children was 47% which is higher than expected1, whilst adults over 45 years of age also had higher than expected protection2. This may be due to cross-reactive antibody responses despite a lack of neutralization function providing some residual protection from infection and subsequent disease, which could be harnessed for universal vaccine development. Identification of immune correlates of protection is fundamental for next-generation vaccine design, and alternate approaches for assessing the contribution of non-neutralizing antibodies to limit infection are needed according to the framework for universal vaccine development3.Children need a higher level of HAI antibodies, estimated at 1:110 for 50% protection against infection4, compared to the WHO accepted standard of 1:36 from adults for 50% protection5, which only provides 22% protection in children. This has been attributed to additional immune correlates in adults, such as non-neutralizing antibody functions and T-cell responses, lowering the protective antibody threshold in adults due to the co-contribution of different immune factors. In a previous household study of pH1N1 infection, HA-stem-specific antibodies played an important role in protection6 and may mediate their action through the Fc Receptor (FcR) function.Some antibodies can cross-react between seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza viruses and may have a protective role against limiting the acquisition or severity of influenza virus infection. Serum antibodies, typically IgG, can mediate effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), directing immune cells to kill infected cells or engulf them by antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), which are respectively mediated by antibody cross-linking of activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) 3a and FcγR2a engagement on Natural Killer (NK) cells and Macrophages. ADCC antibodies can be highly cross-reactive for different strains and even subtypes of influenza, whereby ADCC antibodies towards the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), highly pathogenic avian H7N9, and H5N1 influenza A viruses have been found from the blood of healthy unexposed adults7. There is an age-related accumulation of ADCC-mediating H7N9 specific antibodies, and individuals with ADCC cross-reactivity to group 1 HA (e.g., H5N1) also have high ADCC antibodies to group 2 (H7N9) viruses8. pH1N1 infection significantly boosted ADCC responses in children, which was less evident in adults9. Therefore, cross-reactive ADCC antibodies may target conserved viral regions of the HA, such as the HA-stem10, or internal proteins, such as the Nucleoprotein (NP)11 and Matrix 1 (M1), facilitating FcR-binding antibodies to have greater subtype cross-reactivity than conventional neutralizing antibodies8,11. Indeed, influenza A viruses can be phylogenetically distinguished based on HA groups 1 and 2, which have distinct HA-stems12. ADCP similarly has a high level of cross-reactivity but uses a different FcR, FcγR2a, expressed by B cells and Macrophages13. IgG3 antibodies typically have the highest affinity for FcγR3a and FcγR2a, but IgG3 has a relatively short half-life compared to the highly abundant IgG1, which has an estimated half-life that is 4 times longer. Therefore competition can occur between IgG1 and IgG3 responses for FcR receptors with time since exposure14. Whilst other antibody isotypes, IgA and IgM, bind to different FcR receptors and components at their tissue sites to mediate immune regulation and pathogen clearance15,16,17.In this study, we aimed to assess influenza-specific antibody breadth and function between sH1N1 vaccination and pH1N1 infection using archived samples from a randomized placebo control trial (RCT) of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines in school-aged children that were collected at the onset of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We measured antibody responses by their isotype and subclass, FcγR3a and FcγR2a, binding against diverse HA, NA, or conserved NP and M1 proteins before and after seasonal vaccination, over time, and during the 2009 pandemic for acquisition of pH1N1 infection. We also explore features of antibodies that may correlate with reduced pH1N1 infection. This current study selected samples to address research gaps in antibody effector functions: (i) to determine vaccine-induced ADCC changes, (ii) longitudinal durability of vaccine-induced antibody FcR binding and isotype changes, (iii) differences in baseline FcR binding and isotype with the acquisition of pH1N1 infection, and (iv) the diversification of HA-specific antibody responses with vaccination and infection.ResultsStudy background and sample selectionWe leveraged an existing biobank of immune sera from a randomized vaccine placebo-controlled trial (RCT) established before and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to assess antibody breadth and effector functions as immune correlates from pandemic infection. The trial was established to assess seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy in school-aged children, 6–17 years old, initially from 119 households, including 71 households in which a child received influenza vaccination, in November 2008 in Hong Kong18, and expanded in 2009 to 796 households, including 479 households in which a child received influenza vaccination and monitored for the following 6 years for infection outcomes (NCT00792051)1. Children were monitored for serologically confirmed acquisition of influenza infection (S1) by yearly post-epidemic/season sampling for standard haemagglutinin antibody inhibition (HAI) and infection was inferred by >4-fold rise in HAI response or inferred as uninfected children who remained seronegative (S0). Where influenza-like illness was reported, daily symptom diaries were recorded, and nasal swabs were collected for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sampling to determine viral loads.In this current study, participants were selected (Table 1) from this initial larger RCT study from various timepoints on the basis of seasonal vaccination (V1) or placebo (V0) and pH1N1 infection inferred by sero-conversion (S1) or no seroconversion (S0) against pH1N1 by HAI (>4 fold rise) within the first year of the study. There were 4 possible types of samples used, V1S1 (vaccinated infected), V1S0 (vaccinated uninfected), V0S1 (unvaccinated infected), and V0S0 (unvaccinated uninfected), at timepoints of either pre-vaccination (day 0), post-vaccination pre-infection (day 30), and post-infection (1 year and subsequent years). Children were selected for 4 different sub-studies for antibody studies (Table 1), (i) to determine vaccine-induced ADCC changes (Fig. 1), (ii) longitudinal stability of vaccine-induced antibody FcR binding and isotype changes (Fig. 2), (iii) differences baseline FcR binding and isotype with acquisition of pH1N1 infection (Figs. 3 and 4), and (iv) the diversification of HA-specific antibody responses with vaccination and infection (Fig. 5). The group size, age and gender were comparable between sub-studies, as uninfected controls were selected to match infected children. The majority of vaccinated children seroconverted (by HAI for >4 fold rise) to sH1 (55–90% of each sub-study V1 group) but not pH1 (0–17% of each sub-study V1 group), whilst fewer placebo children seroconverted to sH1 (0–12% of each sub-study V0 group) and pH1 (6–20% of each sub-study V0 group) (Table 1), consistent with previous reports of the larger cohort1. Whilst the frequency of participants that had high baseline (>40 HAI titer) (after vaccination, pre-infection) pH1 responses trended to be lower in V1S1 and V0S1 groups but were comparable for sH1 across the four groups (Table 1). Thus, differences in baseline HAI exist in the cohort that are related to infection outcomes and determining these in finer detail are the focus of this study.Table 1 Participant characteristics of sub-studies and HAI responses at placebo or vaccination timepointsFull size tableFig. 1: Seasonal vaccination results in seasonal HAI-based seroconversion and pH1N1-specific ADCC.Sub-study (i), a Children were vaccinated with seasonal Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV, V1, n = 30) containing H1N1 A/Brisbane/2007 (sH1N1) or placebo (V0, n = 30), which assessed HAI titers b for sH1N1 and pandemic A/California/2009 (pH1N1). c Representative FACS plots of cellular function for ADCC activity by CD107a degranulation of NK92 cells for antibody binding to nonspecific protein (negative), CD16 (positive), or influenza proteins of interest (pH1). b, d Serum paired samples for pre (day 0) versus post (day 30) vaccination (V1) or placebo controls (V0) were tested in the functional NK92 cellular ADCC assay d for pH1, sH1, pN1, and NP proteins.

Significant correlations were measured using Spearman’s correlation with the r and p values shown. Statistical significance is shown.Full size imageFig. 2: Antibody durability post-vaccination.Sub-study (ii), children were sampled pre (day 0) versus day 30 (2009) or yearly sampling over 5 years (2010–2014) for vaccinated (V1, n = 8) or placebo children (V0, n = 6) (a). Selected children had no further influenza vaccination or infection during this time. b HAI responses to sH1N1 and pH1N1 were assessed, data presented as individual values, mean and SD, significance by two-tailed Wilcoxon test. Antibodies were measured by multiplex bead assay for pre-vaccination responses (day 0) versus day 30 (labeled as 2009), 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 samples. c–l Data represents the fold change (from day 0 baseline) in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). The experiment was repeated twice. Graphs are shown for proteins and detectors that had significant increases at 2 or more timepoints. Significant differences were identified for sH1-IgG (c), sH3 IgG (d), pH1 IgG (e), NP IgG (f), pN1 IgG (g), H1stem IgG (h), M1 IgG (i), pH1 IgG1 (j), pH1 IgG3 (k), pH1 FcγR2a (l). Data represents individual values and line represent group means, and dotted lines represent SD. Statistically significant differences shown above (by a mixed linear model with Tukey’s test correcting for multiple comparisons, between years with p values colored for comparison group V1 or V0, two-tailed) and in tables below versus V0 group (by a mixed linear model with Tukey’s test correcting for multiple comparisons, two-tailed) or theoretical value of 1 (for no fold change, by one sample Wilcoxon test, two-tailed). Log-transformed z-scored fold-change data, including non-significant longitudinal responses, are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 as a heat map.Full size imageFig. 3: Antibody function for NK cell activation with vaccination and pandemic infection.Sub-study (iii), (a) Selected samples day 30 post-vaccination pre-infection sampling timepoint for vaccinated uninfected (V1S0, n = 27), vaccinated infected (V1S1, n = 30), unvaccinated uninfected (V0S0, n = 25) and unvaccinated infected (V0S1, n = 32), were assessed for pH1N1 and sH1N1 HAI (b) and magnitude of ADCC antibodies in a NK cellular assay for sH1 (c), pH1 (d), pN1 (e) and NP proteins (f). b–f Data presented as individual values, mean and SD. The correlation between ADCC responses and age in each vaccine group against (g) pH1, (h) pN1, and (i) NP proteins is shown as simple linear regression, with Spearman’s correlation assessing statistical significance shown within graphs where significant. The experiment was repeated twice. Comparisons between groups were performed using Kruskall–Wallis with Dunns multiple comparisons test, and statistical significance as shown by p values above data.Full size imageFig. 4: Antibody features with vaccination and pandemic infection.Sub-study (iii), Selected samples post vaccination pre-infection sampling timepoint (from a) for vaccinated uninfected (V1S0, n = 27), vaccinated infected (V1S1, n = 30), unvaccinated uninfected (V0S0, n = 25) and unvaccinated infected (V0S1, n = 32) (described Table 1), were assessed for antibody features by multiplex bead-based assay for pH1 IgG1 responses (a), data presented as individual values with mean and SD. Multiplex was performed for sH1, pH1, sH3, H1-stem, sN2, pN1, NP and M1 proteins for IgG1 (b), and FcγR3a (c) binding. Data presented as individual values, mean and SD. Experiment was repeated twice. Comparisons between groups were performed using Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test and statistical significance as shown by p values above graphs. The ratio of MFI for FcγR3a and IgG responses from the same individual and response is shown (d), with a statistically significant difference from the theoretical value of 1 noted above by one sample t. Data for all antibody detectors are shown in heatmap representation (e). Experiment was performed in duplicate. The MFI of responses is shown as a heatmap (e), and the mean difference (FDR rate for multiple comparisons, q-value 1.3 as a dotted line for significant results by Mann–Whitney test) as a volcano plot analysis for V1S1 vs. V1S0 (f), V0S0 vs. V1S0 (g), and V0S0 vs. V0S1 (h).Full size imageFig. 5: HA antibody diversity with vaccination and pandemic infection.Sub-study (iv) samples (a) for vaccinated uninfected (V1S0, n = 9 day 0, n = 9 day 30), vaccinated infected (V1S1, n = 13 day 0, n = 7 day 30, n = 14 1 year), unvaccinated uninfected (V0S0, n = 13, day 30) and unvaccinated infected (V0S1, n = 7 day 30, n = 17 1 year), were assessed for antibody features by multiplex bead-based assay for 19 different HA proteins of interest representing viruses from the seasonal vaccine, pandemic virus, related seasonal viruses and avian influenza viruses (Supplementary Table 1). The IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgA1, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a response for each group and protein is shown (b). Data were log-transformed and z-scored prior to analysis. Experiment was performed in duplicate and twice for IgG. c Antibody profiles by principal component analysis combined from all groups at day 30 post-vaccination, pre-infection samples. d Correlation network analysis with selected variables (showing features selected by Elastic Net with frequency >80% in 2000 iterations are highlighted in red). Only variables with Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8 with at least one selected variable are shown, variables that are highly correlated are clustered together. The transparency of the path represents the strength of the correlation (less transparent, more solid = stronger correlation). e To measure π HA cross reactivity antibody features, a 2-D representation of HA diversity (π) for individual antibody features for average MFI of HA proteins for the average difference versus unvaccinated infected subjects (V0S1) at day 30 (post-vaccination, pre-infection) timepoint samples (shown in red) were used as the basis of comparison for other groups. Data represents the mean (colored symbol) and 95% confidence interval (colored lines).Full size imageCellular NK cell effector functions correlate with FcγR3a binding assays and are increased by seasonal vaccinationIn sub-study (i), paired pre-post vaccination serum samples (n = 30 per group) (Fig. 1a) showed that seasonal TIV vaccination resulted in significant (p < 0.0001) rises in sH1N1 HAI responses in vaccinated children, but not towards pH1N1, or in unvaccinated children (V0) (Fig. 1b).To assess pH1N1 HA-specific ADCC effector functions, CD107a degranulation by protein-specific antibody cross-linking was assessed using an NK cell line (Fig. 1c), which is stably transfected with FcγR3a. Seasonal vaccination (V1) increased NK cell ADCC responses for pN1 (p = 0.008) and pH1 (p = 0.02) (Fig. 1d) at day 30 from day 0 responses, whilst there was no difference in functional ADCC responses between V1 and V0 groups at day 0. These vaccine-boosted responses that elicit NK cell degranulation strongly correlated with FcγR3a dimer binding for antibodies against pH1 (Fig. 1e, r = 0.7450, p < 0.0001) and NP proteins (Fig. 1f, r = 0.6028, p < 0.0001). Therefore, due to limited serum volumes collected nearly 15 years ago from a pediatric cohort and confirmation of the correlation between FcR dimer binding to NK cellular functional degranulation13, multiplex assays using FcR dimers were used to evaluate multiple responses in further samples.Durability of antibody responses by vaccinationWe aimed to measure antibody durability to determine if antibody responses were maintained long-term post-vaccination, with yearly sampling for 5 years. In sub-study (ii), to assess the durability (versus day 0 baseline, day 30 (post-vaccination, 2009) at 1 year follow up in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) of seasonal vaccine stimulated antibody responses (IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgA, FcγR3a and FcγR2a as detectors) for seasonal and influenza proteins (H1 (sH1), pH1, sH3, H1-stem, pN1, sN1, M1 and NP) by multiplex approach. Children were also selected based on the criteria of no further vaccination or infection (by seroconversion) during the subsequent 5 years (Fig. 2a), resulting in a limited sample size of V1 (n = 8) and V0 (n = 6) due to stringent criteria, which precludes strong conclusions in antibody durability. We are unable to exclude the possibility of infection occurring between monitoring periods that was asymptomatic and resulted in less than a 4-fold HAI response; however, this remains unlikely based on baseline HAI titers and GMT rises (Table 1) and no changes in NP-specific antibody responses. Again, vaccinated children had significant rises in sH1N1 HAI responses (p = 0.002) but not pH1N1 virus (Fig. 2b).Significant fold change increases (versus the theoretical value of 1) were observed shortly after vaccination (day 30, as 2009) for sH1-IgG, sH3-IgG, pH1-IgG, pH1-IgG1 and pH1-FcγR2a (Fig. 2b–l), but each returned to baseline within one year at 2010 (ns), and were not elevated compared to unvaccinated children. Other responses were analyzed but were not significantly increased by vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 1). Significant waning (by mixed effects model) of responses in unvaccinated (V0) children is evident across a number of antibody measures between 2009 to later years for pH1-IgG (Fig. 2e), pH1-IgG1 (Fig. 2j), pH1-FcγR2a (Fig. 2l), pN1-IgG (Fig. 2g), H1stem-IgG (Fig. 2h), and M1-IgG (Fig. 2i).Features of antibody responses prospective to pandemic infectionIn sub-study (iii), to assess prospectively for antibody correlates prior to infection, we selected children (n = 25–30, Table 1) known seroconvert (S1) to pH1N1 in the next year or not (S0) and used their day 30 post-vaccination pre-infection timepoint serum samples (Fig. 3a). Children were initially randomized for vaccination, and uninfected children were selected to age and gender match infected children. Differences in HAI responses at the day 30 post-vaccination pre-infection timepoint were evident (Fig. 3b), with vaccination leading to significantly higher (p < 0.0001) sH1N1 HAI responses than pH1N1 responses. Furthermore, S1 children had significantly lower pH1N1 HAI responses than S0 children in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (p < 0.0001).These prospective (baseline to infection) samples were assessed in an NK cellular function assay for ADCC responses against pH1N1 and seasonal vaccine representative proteins (Fig. 3). There was no difference in baseline sH1 ADCC responses between the 4 groups, vaccinated uninfected (V1S0), vaccinated infected (V1S1), unvaccinated (placebo) uninfected (V0S0) and unvaccinated infected (V0S1) (Fig. 3c). Whilst, significantly higher responses in V0S0 children compared to V0S1 were found for pH1 (p = 0.0373, Fig. 3d) and pN1 (p = 0.0034, Fig. 3e) ADCC antibodies. Furthermore, the NP-ADCC response in V0S0 children was also significantly higher than in V1S0 children (Fig. 3f, p = 0.0367).However, there was no difference (by Chi-square test) in the sH1N1 baseline HAI positivity rate (a HAI titer of ≥1:40) of the groups between V1S0 and V0S0 groups (Table 1), at post-vaccination/pre-infection, with 92% of V1S0 children versus 64% of V0S0 children being HAI+ to sH1N1. Whilst the pH1N1 HAI+ rate was also similar, at 60% of V0S0 children versus 44% of V1S0 children. However, children who became pH1N1 infected (S1) groups had lower pH1N1 HAI+ rates at baseline, with 0% of the V1S1 being HAI+ for pH1N1 and 6% of the V0S1 group. There was no significant GMT rise in pH1N1 HAI responses or reported ILI in V0S0 or V1S0 groups from initial study recruitment, thus they were accounted for as pH1N1 infection naïve for sub-study (iii) and sub-study (iv) samples.Correlation of age and ADCC antibody responses (Fig. 3f–h) showed an age-related increase in pN1 ADCC responses, with older ‘vaccine failure’ children (V1S1) having the lowest pN1 ADCC responses (Fig. 3g, r = −0.492, p = 0.0058), whereas no significant differences by exposure type were observed for pH1 (Fig. 3g) and NP (Fig. 3i) ADCC responses.In the same sub-study (iii), the Multiplex assay was utilized to expand our analysis from the pre-exposure baseline to measure both binding (isotype/subclass) and functional binding antibodies against the pandemic, seasonal, and cross-reactive proteins (Fig. 4) for the same cohort of children and samples (as Fig. 3) (Table 1). Vaccinated children had significantly higher levels of IgG1 antibodies for the majority of seasonal vaccine and pandemic proteins (Fig. 4a and b), whereas no differences for IgG3 were detected (Fig. 4c). However, FcγR3a showed patterns related to infected S1 groups (Fig. 4d), whereby V0S0 children had elevated pH1-FcγR3a responses compared to V0S1, and V1S0 children had elevated sH3-FcγR3a responses compared to V0S0, and sN2-FcγR3a responses were higher in V1S1 children compared to V0S1.Whilst NP-IgG1 was elevated in vaccinated children (Fig. 4b), there was no difference in NP-specific FcγR3a binding (Fig. 4c), despite our earlier finding that V0S0 children had increased NP-specific ADCC cellular responses (Fig. 3e). Therefore, to assess the proportion of IgGs that may engage FcγR3a to mediate ADCC, we compared of the ratio of IgG of different subclasses (IgG, IgG1 and IgG3) to FcγR3a binding for pH1 and NP proteins (Fig. 4d). This showed an enrichment of pH1-FcγR3a to IgG3 detection, especially in the V1S0 group (p = 0.03) (Fig. 4d), thus seasonal vaccination likely increases pH1-specific IgG3 capable of binding FcγR3a. This is as expected as IgG3 has the highest avidity for FcγR3a to drive pH1-specific ADCC effector functions and is the first antibody developed upon protein antigen exposure (IgG3, IgG1, IgG2, then IgG4) (Fig. 4d).A heatmap overview of log-transformed z-scored multiplex data highlights antibody features detected (Fig. 4e). Comparison of infected and uninfected vaccinated children showed that V1S0 children had significantly increased sH3-specific IgG3 and reduced sN2-IgA1 (Fig. 4f). Further, comparison of uninfected children for vaccinated versus unvaccinated showed vaccination significantly elevated IgG1 responses for NP (q < 0.000001), sH3 (and sH3-IgG3), sH1, sN2, pH1 and pN1 proteins, and sH1 FcγR3a the last parameter reaching significance (q = 0.028), with no increased pH1N1 FcR binding detected (Fig. 4g). Whilst uninfected unvaccinated children (V0S0) utilized pH1N1 reactive FcR effector functions for pH1 IgG, FcγR3a, IgG1 and FcγR2a-binding, which were all significantly increased (q = 0.043–0.048) compared to infected unvaccinated children (V0S1) (Fig. 4h).These relative differences between antibody profiles of groups are reflected further in principal component analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Fig. 2), V0 children have a greater correlation of IgGs and FcRs in the same direction, whereas V1 children had an obvious separation between IgG and FcR at the y-axis dimension. Vaccine-driven antibody responses may not effectively acquire FcR functions, and thus the immune responses that contribute to lack of infection in V1S0 versus V0S0 children may be different.In a separate set of children’s samples in sub-study (iv) (Fig. 5a, Table 1), including samples pre/post-vaccination, and pre/post-infection, we increased our protein panel to 19 seasonal and avian influenza HA proteins (Supplementary table 1) to determine antibody binding breadth (for IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgA1, IgM, FcγR3a and FcγR2a binding). Seasonal HA proteins were selected based on strains circulating during the children’s lifetime. Heatmap analysis of log-transformed z-scored data (Fig. 5b) showed a trend for S0 children to have higher responses than S1 children, especially for IgG, IgG1, and IgG3, which were increased by vaccination. V1S1 children tended to have lower responses across most proteins and antibody features, excluding post-vaccination IgG3 responses to seasonal H1 and H3 HA proteins, which were not maintained post-infection, whilst elevated pH1-IgA1 was prominent. This was also reflected in changes in the PCA (Supplementary Fig. 3).To break down antibody specificities for significant differences from the heat map, the mean difference between groups and detectors of interest was visualized by volcano plot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Vaccinated infected children, V1S1, had minimal differences to V1S0 children for IgG1 responses, with only seas. H1-1999 being significantly elevated (q = 0.04) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Whilst naturally protected children (V0S0) compared to unvaccinated infected children (V0S1), had significantly reduced IgA1 to seasonal H3-HA’s (q = 0.042, Supplementary Fig. 4b), and increased IgG1 to group 1 HAs of seasonal H1 (q = 0.001 and 0.002), pH1(q = 0.01) and avian H5 HA’s (q = 0.01 and 0.03) (Supplementary Fig. 4c). As many permutations of comparisons are possible, PCA was used to gather an overview of children’s groups. A combined PCA of post-vaccination pre-infection samples, i.e., day 30 timepoint (Fig. 4c), which captured the total variance of the data (Dim. 1: 24% and Dim. 2: 18%), showed that H1-HA, influenza B, and avian (H5 and H9) antibody responses PC was not likely to be correlated to H3-HA responses. Correlation network analysis with Feature selection by Elastic Net of selected variables (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 4e) showed pH1 antibody features clustered with avian H5-specific IgG and FcγR2a and FcγR3a, separate from seasonal H1-HA’s or HA-stem responses. Red labels correspond to the important variables selected by elastic net with frequency >70% of the total 2000 iterations as the important variables in terms of predicting infection.From our heatmap and PCA analysis, disparities were apparent in the breadth of HA-specific antibody responses by vaccination and infection between groups. Therefore, a 2-D representation was created of responses of different groups and timepoints to compress for HA cross-reactivity (measured by π) versus V0S1 pre-infection samples (day 30 post-vaccination, pre-infection timepoint, selected as the most susceptible group to infection) (Fig. 5e). The y-axis represents the diversity of the HA response, and the x-axis represents the magnitude difference from V0S1 day 30 of other timepoints or groups responses. For the detectors of IgG1, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a, the V0S0 group had the most diverse antibody response with the highest cross-reactivity score (π) and a response magnitude that was significantly above V0S1 pre-infection responses. The V1S0 post-vaccination samples showed similar patterns to V0S0, with the additional feature of significantly increased IgA1 magnitude. Whereas breakthrough infections, i.e., V1S1 children, had the largest IgM and IgG3 responses of the study, and the magnitude and diversity of these responses were increased by vaccination (day 0 versus day 30) and were reduced following infection (1 year). Whilst V0S1 children at post-infection (1 year) acquired increased FcγR2a to a greater extent than FcγR3a responses compared to their pre-infection (day 30) responses, which may provide future breadth of immunity.Predictive antibody features as immune correlates against pandemic infectionTo assess antibody features that protected from acquisition of pH1N1 infection, logistic regression models with stepwise variable selection by AIC were built for shared data from sub-study (iii) (Fig. 4) and sub-study (iv) (Fig. 5) samples, which included 4 proteins (i.e., sH1-2007, pH1, sH3-2007 and H1-stem) and 6 antibody features (i.e., IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgA1, FcγR3a, and FcγR2a) (Supplementary Table 1), resulting in the comparison of 24 variables. To avoid overfitting and overparameterization, we input the top 10 most important variables shared for the sub-study (iii) and sub-study (iv) data by Elastic Net with PLSDA (determined from Supplementary Fig. 5d, see the “Methods” section). All input antibody responses are at post-vaccination pre-infection timepoints the output value is whether they become infected (S1 or S0 group), and we trained the model with sub-study (iii) data (n = 115 samples) and tested the model with sub-study (iv) data (n = 36 samples, day 30 post-vaccination, pre-infection timepoint) where there is no sample overlap. Three models were built, Model 1: antibody features (Supplementary Fig. 5a); Model 2: antibody features and HAI status to sH1 and pH1 (Supplementary Fig. 5b); or Model 3: HAI status to sH1 and pH1 only. Model 1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a) showed that sH3-2007-IgG1 and IgG3, followed by vaxx sH1-2007-FcγR3a, pH1-FcγR3a, H1stem-IgG, pH1-IgG1 and IgG3 as antibody features were significant to predict pH1N1 infection, whilst Model 2 ranked HAI titers to pH1 and sH3-2007-IgG1 first, followed by H1Stem-IgG1 and sH3-2007-IgG3. (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Three antibody features were selected in both sub-study (iii) (Fig. 4) and sub-study (iv) (Fig. 5) data by Elastic Net and prediction using PLSDA (Supplementary Fig. 5d), i.e., H1stem-IgG1, sH3-2007-IgG1 and sH3-2007-IgG3, which were selected in >50% replicates in both data, whilst FcR binding was not prominent. When using sub-study (iii) data as the training set (from Fig. 4), Model 1 had 75% accuracy on sub-study (iii) data and 36% accuracy on sub-study (iv) data (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Whilst for Model 2, adding HAI status slightly improved the accuracy (76%), and specificity (94%), It is notable that model 2 achieved similar fitting accuracy by using only four variables (selected by AIC), compared to seven variables in model 1. Both models had no sensitivity against sub-study (iv) sample data (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Thus, the performance of prediction is not high, however, input of more shared antibody features may improve the model. As a reference, model 3 using only HAI data can attain similar performance (Supplementary Fig. 5c); therefore, additional antibody features may contribute to protection from infection, or a larger sample size is needed to outperform traditional HAI measures.DiscussionCorrelates of protection aid vaccine development, vaccine reformulation, clinical trial endpoints, and next-generation vaccine design. Seasonal influenza vaccination has variable vaccine efficacy depending on the age group, vaccine match, and year, with a reported efficacy of 10–60%19. Current influenza vaccines are under scrutiny for improved protection and there has been a call for the development of universal influenza vaccines to increase coverage for coverage to pandemic viruses. Non-neutralizing antibody functions can be highly cross-reactive between different influenza strains and subtypes and could be used as a target for broadly reactive vaccines that reduce the incidence and severity of pandemic infection. Assays to measure other antibody functions beyond HAI are needed for next-generation vaccines whose protection is not HAI-dependent. Seasonal influenza vaccination provided 47% vaccine efficacy from H1N1 pandemic infection in children1. Our study utilized an archived biobank from a randomized control trial as a prospective 2009 pandemic ‘time capsule’ to determine serological correlates of protection from pandemic infection; thus our data assess prospectively for correlates prior to infection among cohorts that would seroconvert to pH1N1 in the next year.While schools were closed in April 2009 for two months to slow the spread of H1N1, ultimately, when schools restarted in September 2009, it was estimated that more than 50% of children were infected within a few months, and this is the period covered by our study. Monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine became available in January 2010 with a very low community uptake1,20. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the contribution of prospective serological responses that were associated with the lack of pandemic H1N1 infection.Immune correlates can contribute to reduced acquisition of infection, viral shedding for transmission, or severity of infection (reviewed in ref. 21). Different immune variables will contribute at each level to a different but not exclusive extent, with mucosal antibodies providing a barrier defense or reduced onwards viral shedding (reviewed in ref. 22) and HAI antibodies contributing to blocking infection (reviewed in ref. 23). Whilst cross-reactive memory T cells are reported to contribute to protection from symptomatic infection24, and can be boosted in children by live attenuated influenza vaccines25. The recruitment kinetics of T, B, and NK cells determining patient outcomes and can be critical for survival from novel subtypes26. As our study used samples that were from community-acquired pH1N1 infection and no reported hospitalization, our study is of immune correlates of protection from acquisition of infection, not disease severity.Antibody waning is a natural feature of plasmablast B cell response contractions to form a stable B cell memory pool, and the half-life of different antibody subclasses varies substantially. Previous exposure to seasonal H1N1 viruses in older adults was attributed to reduced severity of pH1N12, and there is an age-related accumulation of ADCC responses8. Seasonal vaccination increases Fc effector functions of pH1N1 specific HA, NA, and NP antibodies; however, this appears to be short term and wanes within 1 year post-vaccination; however, greater waning rates were seen in unvaccinated children. Seasonal vaccination did not bolster FcR effector functions to corresponding seasonal-specific antibody responses, which may be due to maximized FcR functions from previous encounters with related seasonal H1N1 strains. Whilst gains in pandemic-reactive FcR function maybe attributable to vaccination briefly increasing different B cell sources. These features could be deciphered at the clonal level if cells were available.Unvaccinated uninfected (V0S0) children also had increased FcR-mediated effector functions of pandemic-specific HA, NA, and NP antibodies. Furthermore, in V0S0 children, increased antibodies for NK cell function were consistent with increased pH1-specific IgG1, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a binding and further translated to these responses having increased HA-diversity compared to other groups. pH1 antibody features clustered separately to H3-HA responses (by PCA) and were related to cross-reactive avian H5-specific IgG, IgG1, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a responses (by correlation network analysis), suggesting these cross-reactive responses are less focussed and not trained by seasonal virus exposure of other groups. Particular immune or genotype features of V0S0 children should be further studied, similar to studies of HIV elite controllers, that may enable their immune capacity to pre-empt viral diversity.Considering the 2D representation of responses, the magnitude and diversity of IgG1, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a responses were highest in V0S0 children than in other groups suggesting features of their antibody profile are more cross-reactive and with effector functions. Antibody responses in V1S0 children post-vaccination attained some of these functions and levels but not to the same extent as V0S0 children; however, they also had the highest IgA1 responses, which may contribute to their lack of pH1N1 infection. Whilst V1S1 children at post-vaccination pre-infection timepoint samples had elevated IgG3 and IgM responses, which compete with IgG1 for Fc receptors, and IgM points to a less differentiated response with lower class switching. Whilst IgG3 and IgM in V1S1 children decreased post-infection, there was not an accompanying increase in HA-diverse IgG1 or FcγR2a and FcγR3a binding responses but rather a reduction, suggesting that V1S1 children did not become V0S0-like in their responses post-infection and remain unable to fully maximize antibody effector functions. Thus, vaccination and prior infection cannot account for the lack of infection in V0S0 children or susceptibility of V1S1 children, and further host factors (reviewed in ref. 27) such as genotype for key immune pathways (e.g., IFTIM3, CD55, IL28B) or antigenic gaps in prior immunity (no previous or recent H1N1 exposure) should be investigated28.The logistic regression model and volcano plots of heatmap analysis showed that group 2 H3 HA-specific IgG3 antibodies were a negative predictor of infection, whilst seasonal H1 and pH1-IgG3 antibodies at pre-infection timepoints were positively associated, thus protective from infection. Similarly, other studies have also seen negative impacts of other elevated antibodies to other influenza subtypes, i.e., a New Zealand study for symptomatic influenza infection found elevated influenza B Yamagata responses29 were associated with an increased risk of symptomatic influenza A infection. Whilst, in a Nicaraguan household study using protein microarrays, most children under 6 years of age had narrow HA-specific antibody responses, some children showed back boosting of H3N2-specific antibodies by pH1N1 infection, and pre-existing antibody breadth was associated with protection30. Whilst the combined logistic regression model had non-significant results for FcR contributions, results from the V0S0 group throughout point to the importance of elevated pH1N1-reactive IgG1, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a in this group as protective from pH1N1 infection that may extend to other avian H5 viruses based on antibody correlation networks.Our study has some limitations, mainly that PBMC isolation was not performed; thus, no cellular assays were performed for participant NK cell or macrophage function, nor other immune correlates such as memory T and B cell responses, thus our data is all based on serological functions and binding to recombinant proteins. Furthermore, due to limited archival sample volume, we were unable to explore the role of glycans on the Fc region on specific antibodies that can modulate FcR interactions31. The prediction model for antibody functions could be improved by greater sample size and overlap of parameters between the study groups, as set 1 (Fig. 3) measured 56 antibody parameters and set 2 (Figs. 4 and 5) measured 133 antibody parameters, there were only 24 overlapping proteins and antibody features tested. Nevertheless, as our main outcome was pH1N1 infection, relevant parameters were included in both aims, but these antibody features did not surpass the contribution and accuracy of baseline HAI infection for pH1N1 infection susceptibility. However, as year 1 post-vaccination/placebo pH1N1 HAI seroconversion and ILI reporting was the selecting factor of our samples as S1 or S0 groups, it is not surprising that from children that can seroconvert, their HAI baseline titers are major predictors of infection. Further studies of participants that do not seroconvert, i.e., “vaccine or infection failures”32, are needed to determine immunity in these groups that are not HAI dependent. On the other hand, while the selection of infected and uninfected individuals was matched by age and sex, comparison of their pre-infection antibody responses was conducted through prediction models based on machine learning33 and only included different antibody responses as input variables; thus, interpretation of the importance of the antibody responses identified to be predictive in the present study should be cautious due to potential confounding by other factors (such as social contact pattern) that were unadjusted for in our models.In HIV34 and SARS-CoV-2 studies (reviewed in35), FcR effector functions are longer lived than neutralizing antibodies and can have therapeutic importance by modulating disease severity and viral loads. Furthermore, in HIV infection, ADCC mediating antibodies have been attributed to being moderately protective in the absence of broadly neutralizing Abs36 and are correlated with ADCC and IgG334,37. Furthermore, high FcR responses can be enriched in pediatric HIV non-progressors38. Whilst vaccine antibody breadth is associated with infection-free time from SARS-CoV-2 variants39, similar to pre-existing antibodies pandemic and avian influenza found here. Therefore, FcR effector functions and antibody breadth are attractive features for immune correlates of universal vaccine design.MethodsStudy participants and selection for serum panelsTo assess antibody features from seasonal vaccination that may contribute to reduced or delayed acquisition of pandemic H1N1 infection in our exploratory study, we selected archived samples (Table 1) from a randomized placebo-controlled trial (NCT00792051) and the subsequent follow-up previously conducted by our group in school-aged children (6–17 years of age) which reported Hemagglutinin antibody inhibition (HAI) titers1,18. In the original trial, which aimed to study the direct1 and indirect benefits40 of vaccinating children in households, households with at least one child aged 6–17 years were enrolled, and one eligible child from each household was randomly assigned to receive either a seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or placebo at enrollment. Participant gender was comparable across groups (Table 1). The 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 TIV used in our study included the influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (VaxiGrip, Sanofi Pasteur), i.e. it included a seasonal H1N1 (sH1N1) virus strain that circulated before and was antigenically different from the H1N1 virus (pH1N1) that caused the 2009 influenza pandemic. Sera were collected from both children receiving the randomized study vaccination and their household members. In Year 1, most serum was collected from study subjects at baseline (day 0) before vaccination (August 2009 through February 2010) (“Pre vaxx”), 1 month after vaccination (day 30) (“Post vaxx”, also referred to as “Pre inf”), and at the end of the follow-up period as postseason sampling (August to December 2010). Participants were subsequently followed for 5 years until the end of 2014 (Years 2–5), with the collection of (post-epidemic) sera and other information, including self-reported vaccination status between October to December each year in all participants (“Post epidemic”). Serologically confirmed infection in Year 1 is defined as a≥4-fold GMT rise in HAI titer between day 30 and post-season sampling, and in Years 2–5 (2010-2014), as ≥4-fold GMT rise in HAI titer between two consecutive post-epidemic sera. Virologically confirmed infection is defined as PCR-positive in respiratory swabs collected during acute illness.For the present study, we selected subsets of children 6-17 years of age who had received any influenza vaccination in Year 1 (“vaccinated”/“V1”) or not (“unvaccinated”/“V0”) for secondary analyses to study the effect of vaccination on short-term and long-term serologic responses in children who had (“infected”/“S1”) or had not (“uninfected”/“S0”) pH1N1 infection in Year 1 (Table 1). In sub-study (i), to study the effect of vaccination on cellular ADCC, we randomly selected 10 children from three age groups (≤8 years, 9-11 years, ≥12 years old) in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and tested their pre- and post-vaccination sera. In sub-study (ii), to study the longitudinal stability of vaccine antibodies, separately, we randomly selected 10 children each from vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, among children who did not have any influenza vaccination, nor any virologically or serologically confirmed infection by influenza A/sH1N1, A/pH1N1, A/H3, and B viruses, in subsequent years of follow-up until Year 5, and tested their pre-/ post-vaccination and five post-epidemic sera. In sub-study (iii), to study the protection against pH1N1 infection by vaccination, due to limited sample size, we selected all children with serologically confirmed pH1N1 infection in year 1 whether they were vaccinated or not, and randomly selected 10 children without serologically confirmed pH1N1 infection in year 1 from each of the three age groups in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, and tested their Pre inf (equivalent to Post vaxx) sera. Lastly, in sub-study (iv), to study the diversity of antibody responses after a combination of vaccination and infection, we randomly selected 5 children from each of the three age groups in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, in both uninfected and infected children with serologically confirmed pH1N1 infection in year 1. Overall, we studied the vaccine-induced short-term cellular ADCC, long-term cellular ADCC, IgG, IgA, and FcγR against multiple viral proteins, homologous (sH1N1) and cross-reactive (pH1N1) antibody response, cross-reactive response (IgG, IgA and FcγR) against infection by pH1N1, and breadth (IgG, IgM, IgA, and FcγR) of response against multiple H1 and H3 virus strains by vaccination or infection (Supplementary Table 1).Proxy written informed consent was obtained for all participants from one parent or legal guardians, with additional written assent from those ≥8 years of age. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hong Kong University (UW 08-008).FcR protein expression and biotinylationpCR3 plasmids encoding for dimeric high-affinity FcγR2a-H131 and FcγR3a-V158 with a C-terminal hexahistidine (His)-tag, and Avitag were kindly provided by Bruce Wines and Mark Hogarth (Burnet Institute, Australia). FcR dimer proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells and purified by TALON chromatography. Purified Avi-tagged proteins were biotinylated using a BirA 5000 biotin-protein ligase kit (Avidity) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the reaction was performed overnight at 4 °C.Multiplex bead array for antibody specificity and FcR bindingTo study antibody binding, we adopted a customized multiplex assay, adapted from Mclean et al.13. This assay has the capacity to simultaneously detect antibodies that react to multiple proteins in a single well for a single antibody detector. For each study aim, a panel of influenza proteins (Supplementary Table 2) was individually conjugated to beads of different regions as below and measured for different antibody detectors as listed. Recombinant full-length monomer-form HA, NA, and NP proteins (Supplementary Table 2) were purchased from Sinobiological, MyBiosource, Sigma Aldrich, Merck, and BEI resources. Custom headless HA-trimer ministem proteins for HA-stem proteins (from Raghavan Varadajaran, Indian Institute of Science)41.For the preparation of 1000 reactions, 100 μl of Bioplex nonmagnetic carboxylated beads (BioRad) were centrifuged at maximal speed for 3 min and resuspended in 80 μl bead activation buffer (0.1 M NaH2PO4 in ddH2O, pH 6.2), and activated with 10 μl Sulfo_NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, 50 mg/ml, ThermoScientific) and 10 μl EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide, Hydrochloride, 50 mg/ml, Invitrogen) within 10 min. After incubation for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature (RT), beads were washed with coupling buffer (0.05 M MES in ddH2O, pH 5.0) twice and resuspended with coupling buffer and 0.05 mM of protein of interest to the activated beads for 2–3 h, (RT), with the final volume being up to 250 μl with coupling buffer. Beads were washed with 500 μl assay buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4) and blocked with 500 μl blocking buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.02% TWEEN-20, 0.05% Azide in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min on a rotator. Then beads were washed with 500 μl of storage buffer (0.05% sodium azide in PBS), and the beads were resuspended in 125 μl of storage buffer. All assays were run on the same conjugation round within 1 month.For the detection of protein-specific antibodies, coupled beads of different bead regions were mixed to a final concentration of 20 beads/μl for each kind of protein of interest in the assay buffer. A mixture of 1:1 beads was incubated with a 1:100 diluted plasma sample in duplicate on a plate shaker overnight. Beads were washed and incubated with anti-human detector-PE antibody or biotinylated FcγR for 2 h. For the detection of biotinylated FcγR, samples were incubated for an additional 30 min with 1 μg/ml streptavidin-PE (Biolegend). Samples were then washed with 150 μl assay buffer twice and resuspended in 100 μl of sheath fluid for detection. Multiplex bead assays were acquired using the MAGPIX system (Luminex, array reader v2.6.1, microplate platform v2.1.15, Bio-Plex manager software v6.2.0.175 from BioRad) following the manufacturer’s instruction to detect the microspheres and binding of PE fluorescence to calculate a median fluorescence intensity (MFI). Background signal, defined as the average MFI observed for each microsphere set when incubated with the PE-conjugated detection reagent in the absence of a plasma sample, was subtracted from the MFI for each sample. A pool of 10 blood donors’ sera was used to normalize data across plates as an internal control between assay runs, and total IgG and tetanus protein as positive control per sample per detector. Serum samples were run in duplicate. All assays were run on the same conjugation round within 1 month, with no degradation evident due to covalent linkages of proteins and beads. Protein conjugation efficiency was confirmed by anti-His-PE detection42, and the MFI was confirmed by pooled buffy pack serum in the expected range. Proteins that had both lower than 40% coupling efficiency and 20% MFI relative to pH1 across a range of detectors were excluded (data from one protein HA B/Vic-2008 was excluded). Due to differences in protein quality, and conjugation efficiency, no direct comparisons are made between protein-specific responses, and data is log-transformed then z-scored for heat map, PCA, and combined data analysis.Protein-specific NK cell-mediated ADCC functional responsesA protein plate-bound NK ADCC assay was adopted from Jegaskanda et al.7. The assay measures degranulation (CD107a) human NK cells (NK-92-FcγR3a-bearing cell line, provided by Fox Chase Cancer Center) due to crosslinking of influenza-specific IgG in donor sera. Briefly, U-bottom ELISA plates (Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp, NUNC) were coated overnight at 4 °C with recombinant influenza proteins (Supplementary Table 2). Cells were verified as NK cells by CD56 staining for FACS analysis.Background ADCC activity by NK cells was determined by paired serum with plate-bound non-specific protein (FBS block). Positive controls include purified CD16 (1:100, clone: 3G8, Biolegend) for coating and pooled human sera (n = 10 donors pooled) tested against each protein included in each experiment as internal controls. Responses were normalized to % of maximum CD107a+ of CD16 stimulated positive controls, and the background of negative controls was subtracted from each sample.Serum was heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C and was typically tested at 1:20 dilution. Protein-bound plates were thoroughly washed with PBS and heat-inactivated immune plasma bound for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were then further washed and incubated with NK92 cells (2 × 105 cells per well). After 5 h, cells were stained with anti-human CD107a-APC (1:50, clone: H4A3) and CD56-PE (1:200, clone: 5.1H11) (both Biolegend) in FACs buffer (PBS with 1% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide). Cells were then fixed (BD Cytoperm/cytofix buffer), washed, acquired by Flow Cytometry (Attune NxT, Invitrogen), and analyzed by FlowJo software (v10).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v9 and Excel 16.7 software. To assess vaccine immunogenicity, χ2 tests were used to compare the proportions of subjects with antibody titers ≥1:40 before and after vaccination between children who received TIV and those who received placebo, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare ratios of pre- to postvaccination titers. Statistically significant differences in paired pre- versus post-vaccine responses were determined by determined by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. For comparisons between vaccine groups and infection outcomes, a Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunns multiple comparisons was used. Outliers within longitudinal antibody analysis were excluded by the ROUT method and Q = 1% with the number of excluded outliers shown in figure legends. Longitudinal data is shown as individual fold change data with group mean fold change versus day 0 year 1 pre-vaccination response, and SD is shown (dotted lines), with statistically significant differences between V0 and V1 and between timepoints by the linear mixed model with Tukey’s multiple comparison test, or V1 versus the theoretical value of 1 noted below figure plots by one sample Wilcoxon test. Correlations between NK92 cellular ADCC and FcγR3a binding and between ADCC and age were analyzed using Spearman’s nonparametric correlation. For heatmap analysis of MFI (Figs. 4 and 5), upon log transformation, the data were further normalized by mean centering and variance scaling each feature using the z-score function in Matlab. Log-transformed and z-scored data were used in PCA, cluster analysis, and logistic regression models. For longitudinal fold change analysis (Fig. 2), day 30 or subsequent year samples were divided by day 0 as the baseline, and fold changes are shown as a heatmap in Supplementary Fig. 1.Statistical significance as shown by: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, ns = not significant. For volcano plot analysis, the mean difference between vaccine groups or timepoints was compared, including correction for multiple comparisons false discovery rate (FDR), and a q-value greater than −log101.3 was considered significant, as indicated by a dotted line for significant results by Mann-Whitney test.Principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple factor analysis (MFA)PCA analysis is based on log-transformed (\({y}=\log ({x}+1)\)) and scaled input data (antibody response). The values of different antibody responses were scaled with unit variance (using pcaMethods (version 1.84.0)43 prior to PCA analysis. The PCA results were extracted and visualized using factoextra (version 1.0.7)44 and a self-developed R script.MFA is a multivariate statistical technique that extends PCA and multiple correspondence analysis to simultaneously handle mixed data types. In the present study, MFA was employed to analyze the dataset containing both numerical (antibody responses and age) and categorical variables (Gender, pre-infection HAI response, and post-vaccination GMT response). Similar to the PCA analysis, the input antibody responses are log-transformed (\({y}=\log ({x}+1)\)) and scaled. The analysis was carried out using R software, specifically utilizing the FactoMineR and factoextra packages via a self-developed R script.Similar to PCA, with the primary objective of reducing dimensionality while preserving the maximal possible variation within the data, MFA identified the optimal number of retained dimensions. Subsequently, the results were plotted as scatterplots, displaying the relationships between individual observations and the newly formed factor space.HA cross-reactivityWe measured the breadth of antibody responses against different HAs by calculating the HA cross-reactivity (\(\pi\)) in this study. The concept of HA cross-reactivity (\(\pi\)) is borrowed from nucleotide diversity (\(\pi\)), which provides an unbiased estimate of diversity among groups45. Specifically, we used the V0S1 pre-infection samples as the control group. The frequencies of positive HA responses (determined by whether the average responses are at least 20% higher than the average response of the V0S1 pre-infection samples) were summarized for each HA/group, and all the negative responses were characterized in a negative group. The difference values here are shown as average difference values in the x-axis of the Fig. 5e.Then for every group where \({n}_{i}\) samples of RBDegative responses \(i\) are observed, RBD cross-reactivity (\(\pi\)) can be calculated based on pairwise difference between antigens (RBDegative groups) as$$\pi=\frac{{\sum }_{i\ne j}{n}_{i}{n}_{j}}{\frac{1}{2}N\left(N-1\right)}$$ (1) where \(N\) is the total number of all responses. We also calculated the classic Shannon entropy for comparison, and the results are comparable, detailed implementation of the diversity measurement can be found in codes below.Feature selection with Elastic Net and prediction using PLSDASimilar to Selva et al.46, Elastic Net was used to select the minimal set of features needed to predict infection outcomes (Supplementary Fig. 5d). The input data is 26 shared variables of 24 antibody responses and 2 types of HAI titer at pre-infection timepoints. The 24 antibody responses included four proteins (i.e., sH1-2007, pH1, sH3-2007, and H1-stem) and six antibody features (i.e., IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgA1, FcγR3a, and FcγR2a) (Supplementary Table 2), resulting in the comparison of 24 variables. Parameters used for the model are 2000 iterations, alpha = 0.5, 10-fold cross-validation, and detailed codes are available.Correlation network analysis with Feature selection by Elastic NetAll antibody features (Supplementary Table 1) at timepoint 2 of samples from sub-study (iii) or sub-study (iv) (Table 1) were assessed, and the top 11 selected variables (selected by Elastic Net, frequency >80% in 2000 iterations) to visualize their correlation with other variables as networks have done. As there are >100 different antibody variables in the data, only variables with Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8 with at least one selected variable were shown. The selected variables were highlighted in red (Fig. 5d).Logistic regressionLogistic regression models for the prediction of infection were built using sub-study (iii) data (n = 115 samples) as training sets and sub-study (iv) data (n = 36 samples) as validation sets. The input variables of the predictive model are the 10 variables at post-vaccination pre-infection timepoints, the output value is whether they become infected (S1 or S0 group, infection as 1 and non-infection as 0). We choose the 10 input variables by choosing the top 10 shared variables between sub-study (iii) data and sub-study (iv) data, in terms of their ranking in the Elastic Net with PLSDA feature selection results. Specifically, each ranked list contains 24 variables (above-mentioned in the Feature selection with Elastic Net and prediction using the PLSDA section). In each round (done sequentially from rank 1 to rank 24), we compared the same-ranked variables from both lists. If they match, the variable is selected. If not, the variables are added to a waiting list. In subsequent rounds, new variables are compared to each other and those on the waiting list. Once a match is found, the variable is selected. This process continues until 10 variables are selected. Details and modeling R scripts are available.The formula to calculate accuracy (2) is$${{{{\rm{Accuracy}}}}}= ({{{{\rm{True}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Positives}}}}}+{{{{\rm{True}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Negatives}}}}})/({{{{\rm{True}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Positives}}}}} \\ +{{{{\rm{True}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Negatives}}}}}+{{{{\rm{False}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Positives}}}}}+{{{{\rm{False}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Negatives}}}}})$$ (2) The formula to calculate sensitivity (3) is$${{{{\rm{Sensitivity}}}}}={{{{{\rm{True}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Positives}}}}}}/({{{{{\rm{True}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Positives}}}}}}+{{{{{\rm{False}}}}}\; {{{{\rm{Negatives}}}}}})$$ (3) Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is a disease that is highly contagious and often deadly in poultry, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5) and A (H7) viruses; it is also known as bird or avian flu. HPAI viruses can be transmitted by wild birds to domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Although bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans, sporadic human infections have occurred. It is important to note that “highly pathogenic” refers to severe impact in birds, not necessarily in humans. In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) confirmed the detection of HPAI in commercial table egg layer flocks in Michigan and Texas. Are eggs in the retail market safe to eat? Yes. The likelihood that eggs from infected poultry are found in the retail market is low and proper storage and preparation further reduce the risk. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) participated in a joint risk assessment with the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to examine the human health impact of HPAI in poultry, shell eggs, and egg products. The risk assessment determined that the risk of humans becoming infected with HPAI through the consumption of contaminated shell eggs is low. For instance, when a case of HPAI is detected in the US, the chance of infected poultry or eggs entering the food chain is low because of the rapid onset of symptoms in poultry as well as the safeguards in place, which include testing of flocks and federal inspection programs. Additionally, when food is properly prepared and stored, the risk of consumers becoming infected with HPAI is reduced even further. For more information of HPAI and human health visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. Do I need to make changes to my food preparation? There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared food. Safe food handling and preparation is always important. Cooking poultry, eggs, and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked food are the keys to prevent any food safety hazard. To this end, the FDA’s Food Code provides guidelines on proper preparation of foods to retail establishments; moreover, the FDA has published several fact sheets, pamphlets, flyers, and videos on proper preparation of foods for both consumers and retail food establishments. For more information on proper egg handling and cooking: What You Need to Know About Egg Safety. What federal agencies are responsible for ensuring the safety of eggs? The FDA and USDA-FSIS share regulatory authority over egg safety. In addition, the USDA-APHIS conducts a control program that certifies poultry breeding stock and hatcheries as Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) - free and the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) conducts a surveillance program to ensure proper disposition of restricted shell eggs (i.e., eggs that cannot be marketed as table eggs). Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (FFDCA) the FDA protects consumers against impure, unsafe, and fraudulently labeled food, which includes shell eggs. The FDA has regulations in place that govern proper production, transportation, and storage of shell eggs. The USDA has primary responsibility for implementing the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA). Under the EPIA, FSIS has primary responsibility for the inspection of processed egg products to prevent the distribution of adulterated or misbranded liquid, frozen and dried egg products. Is the FDA taking steps to prevent the spread of HPAI on farm visits during egg inspections? Following the 2014-2015 avian flu outbreak, the FDA updated its biosecurity protocols for on-farm visits to prevent the spread of HPAI during egg farm inspections. Before initiating an egg farm inspection, the FDA: Uses a HPAI risk-based classification system to determine the order in which egg farms are inspected, Contacts the State Veterinarian/State Animal Health Official before initiating inspections to ensure there are no quarantines or other reasons investigators should not visit a specific farm, Conducts a check of the most up-to-date information on USDA’s HPAI reporting website for any detection in close proximity to the intended inspection, Follows the mandatory waiting periods between inspections and uses multiple inspection teams, Thoroughly washes the vehicles used during inspection before and after every inspection and at the end of every day on multiday inspections. This is followed by sanitation of the floor mats, the wheel wells and undercarriage of the vehicle with appropriate disinfectants. When outbreaks like this occur, the FDA evaluates its other inspection programs that may contain an on-farm component and considers adjustments to those programs. We do retain the ability to respond to emergencies or other events as necessary, however, while following appropriate biosecurity practices. Should farmers who have biosecurity plans in place be concerned about HPAI? Farmers who continuously follow the biosecurity requirements in 21 CFR 118.4(b) will reduce the potential risk of HPAI infection in birds on the farm. The biosecurity requirements of this regulation, which are aimed at preventing the introduction or transfer of Salmonella Enteritidis onto a farm, also serve to reduce the risk of HPAI contaminating the farm. Since wild birds and migratory waterfowl can be carriers of HPAI, the requirement to prevent wild birds, cats, stray poultry, and other animals from entering poultry houses also serves to protect against HPAI. Are there additional biosecurity measures farmers can implement to further protect their farms from HPAI? The USDA’s APHIS works to defend America’s animal and plant resources from agricultural pests and diseases. APHIS has developed biosecurity measures for poultry which are available at their website: Defend the Flock - Biosecurity 101. For more information on Avian Influenza.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will not be issuing federal quarantine orders at this time, nor is the agency recommending any state quarantines or official hold orders on cattle, the agency announced April 2. “However, we strongly recommend minimizing movement of cattle as much as possible, with special attention to evaluating risk and factoring that risk into movement decisions. Do not move sick or exposed animals.” Because of the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, the World Health Organization and other animal health organizations continue to stress the importance of surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health. If cattle must be moved, then APHIS strongly encourages “extreme diligence” by producers, veterinarians, and animal health officials to ensure only healthy cattle are moving and to ensure the validity of interstate health certificates. WOAH, WHO, and CDC announcements The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly the OIE) said in an April 5 announcement that the ongoing spread of HPAI in different regions of the world, alongside the recent detections of cases in cattle, is raising concerns within the international community that such infections in cattle could indicate an increased risk of H5N1 viruses becoming better adapted to mammals, and potentially spilling over to humans and other livestock. “Initial investigations so far have revealed no specific adaptation to either humans or mammals,” the announcement states. “Regardless, several studies are being carried out to further explore the virulence and transmissibility of these viruses, including among cattle, and to assess the risk of transmission to animals and humans, which is currently considered very low.” Yet, WOAH stopped short of endorsing restrictions on the movement of healthy cattle and their products, saying this is not recommended unless justified by an import risk analysis conducted according to WOAH guidelines. Rather, the international animal health organization shared the following recommendations: Maintain enhanced avian influenza surveillance in domestic and wild birds. Monitor and investigate the cases in nonavian species, including cattle and other livestock populations showing clinical signs compatible with avian influenza. Report cases of HPAI in all species, including unusual hosts, to WOAH through its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). Genetic sequences of avian influenza viruses should be shared in publicly available databases. Prevent the introduction and spread of the disease by implementing strict biosecurity measures in livestock holdings and employing good production practices when handling animal products such as raw milk and meat from suspected or confirmed cases. Protect humans in close contact with or handling sick cattle or other sick livestock and their products. Exposed humans should always take precautionary measures, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and implementing standard food safety measures when handling animal products from exposed livestock. Avoid implementing unjustified trade restrictions. Import risk management measures should be scientifically justified and in line with the WOAH International Standards. On the same day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a series of public health recommendations in light of the recent HPAI activity. The guidance covers several areas, including preventing exposures to HPAI viruses, the use of PPE, antiviral treatment, patient investigations, and use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis of exposed persons. Previously, the CDC reported that a farm worker on a commercial dairy farm in Texas had developed conjunctivitis around March 27, and subsequently tested positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. HPAI A(H5N1) viruses have been reported in the area’s dairy cattle and wild birds. There have been no previous reports of the spread of HPAI viruses from cows to humans. As of April 15, the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) says that HPAI has been confirmed in dairy cattle in eight states: 11 herds in Texas, six in New Mexico, five in Michigan, three in Kansas, and one each in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Dakota. The affected Ohio dairy operation is known to have received cows from a Texas herd later confirmed to be infected with HPAI. And while the Michigan and Idaho dairy herds received cows from states with HPAI-infected cattle, it was not yet known whether these imported cattle originated from infected herds. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in an April 9 statement that people should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, as well as with animal feces, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. In addition, the WHO information states, “People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk, or raw cheeses, from animals with suspected or confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection (avian influenza or bird flu).” Bovine influenza A virus Meanwhile, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) announced April 7 that it will call this disease bovine influenza A virus (BIAV) to better distinguish the disease syndrome in cattle from the pathogenesis observed in birds. “The virus isolated from affected animals in herds matching the clinical syndrome has been identified as avian influenza virus Type A H5N1. This virus causes Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in birds, however the disease syndrome in cattle does not cause high morbidity and mortality as it does in birds. The AABP does not believe that this disease should be referenced as ‘HPAI in cattle’ or ‘bird flu in cattle’ due to these differences,” according to the press release. The AABP has created a working group of its members that, together with AVMA, is communicating with federal officials and working on additional biosecurity guidance.

Charlie Neibergall/AP hide caption toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP With diary cows getting bird flu, researchers are trying to figure out what mutations could make the virus a threat to humans. Charlie Neibergall/AP The outbreak of bird flu in dairy cattle is still unfolding. Both North Carolina and South Dakota have detected the virus in dairy herds, bringing the total number of states affected to eight. The unlikely spread among cattle and one dairy worker has scientists looking through the data to better understand this spillover. They say the risk to humans hinges on whether the virus can evolve in key ways to better infect mammals. So far, there's some reassuring news: At a recent meeting, scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the virus is not presenting like a respiratory illness in cattle – meaning the animals don't appear to be shedding large amounts of virus from their nose or mouths. Sponsor Message Instead, federal health officials investigating the outbreak suspect some form of "mechanical transmission" is responsible for spreading the virus within the herd. This may be happening during the process of milking the cows, a theory supported by the fact that high concentrations of virus are being found in the milk. "I want to emphasize really how unusual this is," says Thijs Kuiken, a professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus Medical Center. "In other mammalian species with influenza viruses, it's primarily a respiratory disease, which doesn't seem to be the case in these cattle." The samples collected from infected animals and shared publicly do not suggest the virus has undergone radical changes that would be cause for alarm. But there are certain signs of trouble in the genome of the virus that scientists are looking out for as it finds a way into more mammals. "We really need to keep on top of this, because I think we are at a bit of a precipice where something interesting or unfortunate could happen," says Michelle Wille, a senior research fellow at the Center for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne.

VW Pics/VWPics/Universal Images Group vi hide caption toggle caption VW Pics/VWPics/Universal Images Group vi With bird flu spreading among cows, scientists are concerned about potential future risks to humans. VW Pics/VWPics/Universal Images Group vi What to watch out for: A virus evolving to infect humans Genetic sequencing of the virus in the​​ Texas dairy worker showed it had undergone a mutation in a gene, PB2, that commonly gets affected when the virus infects mammals. Sponsor Message This is a clue that the virus is evolving to better replicate inside a mammal, but it's not sufficient to make the virus transmit more easily between humans, says Nichola Hill, a disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. "Sometimes we see these early markers of adaptation," she says, "It needs a handful [of markers] coordinated across multiple different gene segments for it to really be this breakthrough and the next pandemic." And it would need to become better at transmitting through the air, like the seasonal influenza viruses that humans tend to catch. Currently most cases of bird flu in people are linked to direct contact with an infected animal, oftentime when a chicken is being slaughtered, says David Swayne, a poultry veterinarian who used to work for the USDA. "It takes a very, very high dose," he says, "It's probably not just exposure to infected poultry – it's exposure to processes that aerosolized the virus." But the fear is that could change as the virus spends more time in mammals: Specifically, the protein that the virus uses to bind to cells could evolve to lock onto the receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans. This would allow it to easily gain access and churn out copies of itself. "That's considered basically a main barrier that prevents this from becoming a virus that could spread efficiently between people," says Darwyn Kobasa, head of high containment respiratory viruses at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory. When the virus has spilled into mammals, scientists have not seen a lot of evolution in this function over the last few years, says Anice Lowen, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University. Lowen says previous research has shown the protein on the virus would not only need to recognize the human receptors in our upper airways but also become more stable, presumably so it doesn't fall apart during transmission through the air. Sponsor Message These two changes – plus mutations in the PB2 gene to support replication – would all need to come together to support efficient spread in mammals, she says. Of course, she adds, "there's potentially other factors that we don't yet understand." There are still big questions about exactly how bird flu plays out in cattle, since it's only now being followed closely. "There certainly are many mutations that occurred with this jump from wild birds into cattle and we don't necessarily understand what they mean," says Hill. How mammals may spread it among themselves: Clues from ferrets With millions of birds infected all over the globe, it's likely that many mammals are being infected through consuming dead birds or being exposed to feces. Wille says the virus may have been introduced into dairy cattle in a similar way, perhaps infected birds somehow got into their feed. "It's not that hard to imagine that we have a sort of contaminated feed situation," she says But this kind of reasoning may not fully explain mass infection events in some mammals, including "unprecedented" die-offs of seals and sea lions in South America and an outbreak on a mink farm in Spain. It's still not clear what's driving transmission in those instances, maybe animals were spreading it to each other, says Wille. Experiments done in labs offer some clues. They have shown mammals can pass on this version of H5N1, and even offer some preliminary evidence suggesting limited airborne transmission. In one recent study, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed how an isolate of the virus taken from a severe human case in Chile spread among ferrets. They found that variant had a "high capacity to cause fatal disease" among the animals and that it showed enhanced ability to replicate in human cells cultured in the lab, but "did not exhibit productive transmission in respiratory droplets" or via contaminated surfaces when tested in animals. Sponsor Message A separate study by scientists at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory infected ferrets in the lab with samples of the virus collected from wild animals. Those experiments found a particular version of the virus, taken from a hawk, could transmit very rapidly from ferret to ferret through direct contact and cause lethal infection in the originally uninfected animals, says Kobasa, senior author of the study which has not yet been published. They also found evidence the virus had spread through the air between ferrets in different cages, but they didn't see severe illness in the animals who were infected in this way. It's possible there wasn't enough virus being transmitted to "overcome the immune barriers that would prevent infection," he says. The results are "very preliminary" and what happens under controlled lab conditions isn't necessarily indicative of what can happen in the wild, he says. "We certainly don't see any changes that would suggest that there's any way to support efficient airborne transmission." While helpful, Lowen says experiments on ferrets need to be interpreted with caution, especially in the context of humans. She says overall there's still very limited evidence for transmission through the air: "The fact that ferrets transmit pretty consistently in contact exposure is a bit concerning, but these results don't throw up a lot of red flags for me."

Published April 08, 2024 By Public Health On Call Environment Health Security Infectious Diseases Editor’s note: This article was updated on April 10, 2024. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza—commonly known as bird flu—has been circulating among wild migratory birds for the past two years, with substantial spillover into poultry farms. But what's sparking concern among scientists and public health officials alike is the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows and the subsequent infection of a dairy farm employee—the second person in America ever documented to be infected with H5N1. The virus has now spread to 16 herds in six states according to the USDA, fueling concerns about potential further transmission to humans. In this Q&A, adapted from the April 8 episode of Public Health On Call, Stephanie Desmon speaks with Meghan Davis, DVM, PhD ’12, MPH ’08, associate professor in Environmental Health and Engineering, and Andrew Pekosz, PhD, professor in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, about H5N1’s jump between species, what that means for the virus’s pandemic potential, and what the appearance of the virus in dairy means for consumers. What’s going on with the avian flu? AP: This virus has been around for over 20 years. It's been mutating over time, and something happened in the last couple of years to cause an explosion of cases in wild birds. Not surprisingly, that's led to spillover infections in some poultry farms. There's also been an increase in mammals that have been infected, such as skunks, bears, and foxes, presumably from feeding on dead infected birds. And recently, we've seen spillover of this virus into dairy cows. Cattle have not been reported to be infected with any of the influenza A viruses—human or animal—to date. Anytime this virus enters a new host, we set off some alarm bells in the scientific community to see what's going on. Can we expect to see more cases in humans? AP: I expect that over the next few weeks, we're going to be seeing more cases in cows and humans, because humans are in close contact with cows during many dairy processes. Hopefully, this will not be a large outbreak, but we certainly expect to see more cases. Were you surprised by this outbreak? MD: I am surprised that it's in dairy cows, because when we think about animal models for influenza, we think about mustelids, like ferrets or mink. We have also seen a number of sick farm cats that tested positive. What is most interesting about seeing [H5N1] in dairy is that researchers haven't been focusing on biosecurity and biocontainment for things like avian influenza—which is typically transmitted from a bird reservoir. Dairy farms are often quite open to the air—birds might spend time in areas where the cows eat, for example. One of the other things we are seeing is some symptoms of disease in the cows. I've not heard of high mortality yet, but they have been showing fairly nonspecific signs, like not eating or milking well. Most of these tend to be somewhat older cows because adult cows who are lactating are in a different category of susceptibility than young calves. What we don't know yet is if perhaps the virus is in all the populations within the farm, and only some of them are showing symptoms. Is the milk they produce safe for consumption? MD: For the average person buying commercial milk, we don't have any evidence that would suggest concern. If you buy pasteurized milk from a commercial dairy processor, the risk is extremely low. Pasteurization, which involves temperature and pressure and time, is designed to inactivate microbes to make the milk safer to consume and to give it longer shelf life. I strongly advise against consuming raw milk products, no matter where you live, because there are other risks, not just avian influenza. What can the surveillance data from infected cows tell us? AP: Two things are really important. One is: The virus has gone from the respiratory tract through lots of different organs, through the blood, and made it all the way to the milk. In humans, the influenza virus stays within the respiratory tract. We have seen H5N1 move out of the respiratory tract in other animals, but usually that's associated with a really fast mortality. As soon as the virus leaves the lungs, the animals are so sick that they die. We're seeing a case here where the animals don't seem to be really sick, but the virus is making it to other parts of the animal. That's going to tell us something perhaps unique about the H5N1 virus compared to seasonal human viruses. The second critical thing is: If there is spread of this virus from cow to cow, is the virus changing and getting better adapted to replicating or spreading in cows? Bird flu jumping to mammals is important because anything that allows the virus to adapt to a mammal has the potential for making it better able to infect humans. Understanding what happens now with the spread of the virus and how the sequence of the virus changes is going to be critically important. The first sequences [from cows] look like the virus is almost identical to the bird virus. But we haven't really sampled animals that presumably acquired the infection from other cows. If it's spreading from cow to cow, is that a wholly different problem? MD: There is a lot of swapping of cows in the dairy industry, and there is a diverse population of farmers, each of them has their own way of doing things. And that means that we may need to educate farmers about perhaps restricting certain sales or trade of dairy cows if evidence shows that you could introduce avian flu through a cow brought in from outside the farm. The USDA has released recommendations for state animal health officials, veterinarians, and producers, including trying to exclude birds and cats from areas where livestock are kept, not moving sick or exposed cows, using PPE among workers with exposure to dairy cows, and other measures. Something I'm very interested in is: Where were each of these cows exposed? To what degree was this one event that is now spreading through these networks of sale and trade and movement of dairy cows? Or is this multiple events in which you've had an introduction [of the virus] from birds? Because that also changes the dynamics as we think about genetics and the potential for evolution. AP: It’s also clear that the USDA has not ruled out that spread from cow to cow is happening via contaminated milking equipment because the amount of virus in the milk is much greater than what is found in the nose of infected cows. If this is contributing to virus spread, it should be straightforward to institute equipment disinfection protocols that could slow or stop virus spread. Is H5N1 considered a major threat at this time? AP: H5N1 registers as what we call “a virus with pandemic potential.” Humans presumably all have some immunity to H1 and H3 influenza viruses, which can cause seasonal epidemics, but they can't cause pandemics at the level of what we saw with COVID because there's just too much immunity in the population that limits the spread and dampens down disease severity. However, the human population is essentially completely naive—has no preexisting immunity—to H5 viruses. Therefore, similar to what we saw with COVID, in the worst case scenario, if this virus enters humans and starts to spread, all of us are susceptible, and we could see massive increases in numbers of cases. H5 viruses are rather deadly in poultry. They're not so deadly in wild birds, but they seem to be deadly in mammals, and we don't know what they'll do in humans. MD: Right now, the average person should just be aware and avoid things like raw milk products. However, because we are seeing the potential for disease in cats, and we don't know yet if that came from cows or birds or some other pathway—it's a good idea to prevent your cats from having contact with wild birds. If they're indoors, keep them indoors, and if they become ill, consult your veterinarian.

Read more Flu vaccine coverage in the U.S. 2014-2023, by age Published by Preeti Vankar, Apr 8, 2024 In the United States, influenza vaccination rates differ greatly by age. For example, during the 2022-2023 flu season, around 70 percent of those aged 65 years and older received an influenza vaccination, compared to just 35 percent of those aged 18 to 49 years. The CDC recommends that everyone six months and older in the United States should get vaccinated against influenza every year, with a few exceptions. Although influenza is mild for most people it can lead to hospitalization and even death, especially among the young, the old, and those with certain preexisting conditions. The impact of flu vaccinations Flu vaccinations are safe and effective, preventing thousands of illnesses, medical visits, and deaths every year. However, the effectiveness of flu vaccines varies each year depending on what flu viruses are circulating that season and the age and health status of the person receiving the vaccination. During the 2022-2023 flu season it was estimated that influenza vaccination prevented almost 31 thousand hospitalizations among those aged 65 years and older. In addition, flu vaccinations prevented 2,479 deaths among those aged 65 years and older as well as 63 deaths among children six months to four years. The burden of influenza The impact of influenza is different from season to season. However, during the 2022-2023 flu season there were around 31 million cases of influenza in the United States. Furthermore, there were around 21,000 deaths due to influenza, an increase from the previous year but significantly fewer than in 2017-2018 when influenza contributed to 51,000 deaths. Most of these deaths are among the elderly. In 2022-2023 the death rate due to influenza among those aged 65 years and older was around 26.6 per 100,000 population. In comparison, those aged 18 to 49 years had an influenza death rate of just .7 per 100,000 population.

Dairy cow feed includes corn, grains and supplements, which attract the hungry birds.“Avian influenza is everywhere,” said Amber Itle, veterinarian for the Washington State Department of Agriculture. “Because it’s ubiquitous, we need to be considering the fact that the risk is in our backyard right now, always, everyday.”Itle said birds will really start moving in the next few months. She said now is the time for farmers to further tighten biosecurity.Cattle health and biosecuritySo far, bird flu has sickened about 10% of the dairy cattle in the herds that have gotten avian influenza across the United States. Experts say most cattle make a full recovery. In poultry, this same virus causes high mortality rates, but in dairy cattle that is not being reported.Federal recommendations for biosecurity include: trying to deter birds from getting into barns or areas where there are cattle, managing the movements of cattle and isolating new animals for 21 days upon arrival, keeping all species of animals, such as poultry, pigs, cattle separate, and keeping cats, dogs and wildlife out of barns.Related: What to know about the risks of a bird flu outbreakBird flu in cattle backgroundSo far, highly pathogenic avian influenza has sickened cattle in Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, Kansas, Ohio and Michigan. There have been no reports of sick cattle with bird flu in Washington or Oregon, those state agriculture officials said.The U.S. Department of Agriculture and state officials are working together in several groups to better understand the disease transfer from birds to cattle and from cattle to people.Much of the disease appears to be infecting the animals’ udders, with calves and male cattle not contracting the disease because they don’t have developed udders, Itle said.Just one person in Texas has been confirmed to have gotten sick from cattle infected with the disease. One man's eyes got red after he was exposed to sick cattle. This is only the second known case of the virus transferring to humans, according to National Public Radio.Still, much is unknown about the avian flu in cattle, how the disease is being transferred from bovine to bovine, and how it’s being spread to people.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorIn Texas, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said they are finding bird flu and dead grackles, blackbirds and pigeons, which are difficult to keep out of dairy barns.Bird flu also has sickened a lot of other animals across the world, including marine mammals in South America, and there is a reported mink farm outbreak in Europe, according to NPR.What about the milk?It’s standard practice to remove sick animals from the milking string in the nation’s dairies, Itle said. Sick animals tend not to give much milk anyway, she said.The virus can be found in the milk of sick cows but the sick animals’ milk is disposed of. In addition, pasteurizing milk kills viruses and bacteria, making commercial milk safe to consume at this time, according to the USDA.Related: As bird flu spreads among dairy cows across the US, Oregon keeps a close eyeNorthwest dairy industryAvian flu in cattle is definitely concerning to the dairy industry across the Northwest and United States.Steve Seppi is the executive director of the Dairy Farmers of Washington, a quasi-state commodity commission. He said the milk production from an infected animal drops significantly for nearly three weeks. The animals tend to produce thick colostrum-type milk that’s very concentrated. This not only hurts herd health but also farmers’ profitability.“Dairy farmers operate on pretty thin margins, especially in the last couple years with inflation and high input costs, especially feed costs,” he said. “Farmers are taking it seriously. They are taking precautions, biosecurity cautions and moving cattle precautions to keep this disease out of their herds.”Seppi also said milk prices are down from 2022. Washington farmers export almost half of what's in the state, much of it powdered, to top markets such as Mexico, Indonesia and Japan.“Everything is a little more expensive these days, and prices aren’t keeping up,” Seppi said.Seppi added that many farms are upping their requirements on hand washing, boot washing, and other biosecurity measures. Some farmers are even putting up speakers in barns with hawk calls to scare away birds or using dummies of coyotes or wolves in fields to keep waterfowl at bay.“The last couple of years have been tough for our farmers,” Seppi said. “The last thing they are looking for right now, is added economic pressure of something like a drop in production for something like avian influenza. They’re taking it seriously.”Related: For the first time, U.S. dairy cows have tested positive for bird fluHuman mental health also a worryNorthwest dairies are already hurting from low milk prices, Itle said. So those operators can’t likely afford a highly-pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in their cattle. In the Northwest so far, one dairy in Idaho has a confirmed case of bird flu in cattle, according to the USDA.Itle said she also worries about the mental health of dairy farmers and dairy workers, especially if bird flu were to become more of a problem in Northwest cattle.“They truly care about their animals,” Itle said of farmers. “They really care about the environment and trying to be sustainable. They have all these pressures and regulatory burdens they have to overcome. Something like this, that has that uncertainty, can be enough to push someone over the edge.”THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

Necroptosis is an attractive entry point for therapeutic intervention in ARDS and related inflammatory conditions because it drives pathogenic lung inflammation and lethality during severe IAV infection6,7,8 and can potentially be targeted by receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) inhibitors. Here we show that a newly developed RIPK3 inhibitor, UH15-38, potently and selectively blocked IAV-triggered necroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells in vivo. UH15-38 ameliorated lung inflammation and prevented mortality following infection with laboratory-adapted and pandemic strains of IAV, without compromising antiviral adaptive immune responses or impeding viral clearance. UH15-38 displayed robust therapeutic efficacy even when administered late in the course of infection, suggesting that RIPK3 blockade may provide clinical benefit in patients with IAV-driven ARDS and other hyper-inflammatory pathologies.

Influenza pandemics have killed millions in the past and could do so again. In contrast to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, some influenza strains have proved to be particularly lethal to younger, ostensibly healthy adults, possibly because they provoked such a strong inflammatory response in that group. Writing in Nature, Gautam et al.1 show that by inhibiting a cell-death response called necroptosis — an important innate antiviral strategy — the strength of the inflammatory response in an animal model of severe influenza infection is reduced, substantially reducing mortality.

It facilitates viral co-infection, further burdens the already over-stretched healthcare systems. Racing to find co-infection-associated efficacy therapeutic agents need to be rapidly established. However, it has encountered numerous challenges that necessitate careful investigation. Here, we introduce a potential recombinant minibody-associated treatment, 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv), which has been developed as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that acts via its nucleic acid catalytic and cell penetration abilities. In this research, we demonstrated that 3D8 scFv exerted antiviral activity simultaneously against both influenza A viruses (IAVs) and coronaviruses in three established co-infection models comprising two types of coronaviruses [beta coronavirus—human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43) and alpha coronavirus—porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)] in Vero E6 cells, two IAVs [A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (H1N1/PR8) and A/X-31 (H3N2/X-31)] in MDCK cells, and a combination of coronavirus and IAV (hCoV-OC43 and adapted-H1N1) in Vero E6 cells by a statistically significant reduction in viral gene expression, proteins level, and approximately around 85%, 65%, and 80% of the progeny of ‘hCoV-OC43–PEDV’, ‘H1N1/PR8–H3N2/X-31’, and ‘hCoV-OC43–adapted-H1N1’, respectively, were decimated in the presence of 3D8 scFv. Taken together, we propose that 3D8 scFv is a promising broad-spectrum drug for treatment against RNA viruses in co-infection.

During the 2020–2021 flu season, co-infection did not occur, possibly owing to the decreasing number of flu cases as a result of the large-scale implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-191,2. However, along with Omicron surge and the resurgence of influenza virus in 2022 (cdc.gov/flu), an increase in flurona cases has been predicted, and it will undoubtedly put additional strain on healthcare providers already overloaded in response to COVID-19 pandemic. In recent studies, co-infection with influenza A virus (IAV) enhances the infectivity of SARS-COV-2, resulting in severe and prolonged pneumonia in hamsters and mice3,4. Since 2020, numerous articles have reported co-infection studies with diverse topics ranging from statistical reports to virus–virus and virus–host interactions, viral immunology, computational investigation of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus5,6, along with in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-OC43, IAVs, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)3,4,7,8,9,10,11,12, and clinical studies13,14. Although no evidence of flurona causing the formation of hybrid viral particles exists, co-infection with strains or variants belonging to the same genus may easily occur, such as co-infection with two strains of influenza viruses or coronaviruses or two SARS-CoV-2 variants15,16,17. However, a 2022 report has described the formation of hybrid viral particles during co-infection with IAV and RSV11. In addition, to effectively mitigate and prevent the exacerbation of disease in co-infection, it is recommended to concurrently administer specific vaccines and antiviral drugs that target the coexisting viral pathogens within the host18,19,20. Nevertheless, drug resistance due to evolution of viruses and emergence of new viruses are challenges that constantly need to be addressed. Drug repurposing to treat other viruses has increasingly become attractive, although some obstacles remain to be overcome18.Nowadays, the field of genetically engineered antibody technology has driven progress in the production of recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments, which play a vital role in research, diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies21. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv), which is one of the most popular types of engineered antibodies, is generated by fusing a variable heavy chain (VH) with a variable light chain (VL) via a flexible polypeptide linker21,22. In comparison to monoclonal antibodies, scFv exhibits several advantages, such as smaller size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid circulation in the bloodstream, decreased retention in the kidney, low immunogenicity, high specificity, accomplished through bacterial expression systems, and facilitating large-scale manufacturing21,23. Numerous scFv variants have demonstrated substantial potential in diverse fields, including medical therapies and diagnostic applications. Several scFvs have been engineered to combat viral infections, such as those targeting chicken infectious bursal disease virus, human influenza virus H5N1, H1N1, and the phosphoprotein of Newcastle disease virus, PEDV23,24,25,26,27,28. Therefore, scFv represents a promising tool for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases. 3D8 scFv, a recombinant single-chain mini antibody (~ 28 kDa) was developed from autoimmune-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice29,30. It has been shown to exert a broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo against many types of DNA and RNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, pseudorabies virus 31,32, influenza viruses33,34, classical swine fever virus35, Newcastle disease virus29,30,36, and even the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus37.In this investigation, a greater multiplicity of infection (MOI) of viruses, higher concentration of 3D8 scFv, and later treatment timing, were utilized in comparison to prior single infection studies. We established that 3D8 scFv possessed antiviral effects against not only single infections of coronaviruses or IAVs but also co-infections of both viruses in three co-infection models: (1) coronaviruses (hCoV-OC43 and PEDV); (2) IAVs (H1N1/PR8 and H3N2/X-31); (3) coronavirus–influenza virus (hCoV-OC43 and adapted-H1N1). Our findings indicated that 3D8 scFv reduced viral genome levels, viral proteins, and progeny viruses by impeding the viral replication cycle, thus exerting antiviral activity in various cell line models utilizing an in vitro system.ResultsInhibition of 3D8 scFv toward different virusesThe broad-spectrum antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA viruses was investigated (Fig. 1a). Firstly, the expression of S and N genes of hCoV-OC43 and PEDV were strongly suppressed by up to 80% and 65%, respectively, in the 3D8 scFv-treated cells compared with those in untreated cells (Fig. 1b,c). Similarly, the viral protein level declined by 70% for hCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein and 50% for PEDV spike protein (Fig. 1d,e). Furthermore, the supernatants were harvested and subjected to plaque reduction assay, and the results showed that the progeny of PEDV and hCoV-OC43 was decreased by 89% and 66%, respectively (Fig. 1f and S3a).Figure 13D8 scFv protected cells from single infection with cytoplasmic or nuclear RNA viruses. (a) Scheme of the experimental procedure. Coronaviruses or IAVs were inoculated to Vero E6 or MDCK cells for 6 h. The cells and supernatants were collected at 24 or 48 h after treatment with 10 µM 3D8 scFv. One-step RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of the S and N genes of (b) hCoV-OC43 and (c) PEDV at 54 hpi. Simultaneously, the cells were lysed using RIPA buffer in order to check (d) the protein level of nucleoprotein (N) of hCoV-OC43 and spike protein (S) of PEDV via western blotting assay, (e) the percentage of band intensity was calculated based on normalizing viral protein intensity to GAPDH intensity. The supernatants from the 3D8-treated cells were harvested, and a plaque reduction assay was performed to observe the infectious viral titer, and percent plaque reduction of (f) coronaviruses hCoV-OC43 and PEDV. Similarly, HA and NA genes of (g) H1N1/PR8 and (h) adapted-H1N1 at 30 hpi, (i) HA and NP genes of H3N2/X-31 at 30 hpi were indicated by RT-qPCR. (j) The hemagglutinin (HA) protein levels of IAVs were tested, and (k) the percentage of band intensity was calculated based on normalizing viral protein intensity to GAPDH intensity. The percent plaque reduction of (l) influenza viruses H1N1/PR8, H3N2/X-31, and adapted-H1N1 was observed. All assays were in triplicates. The significant difference was determined by unpaired t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). The original western blots are presented in Fig. S4.Full size imageNext, we investigated the antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv against H1N1/PR8, H3N2/X-31, and adapted-H1N1 in a single infection. The viral gene expression of IAVs declined by over 60% in 3D8-treated samples (Fig. 1 g,h,i), and similar results were observed for the viral protein level expression (Fig. 1j,k). Plaque reduction assay revealed that the progeny numbers of H3N2/X-31, adapted-H1N1, and H1N1/PR8 were decreased by 82%, 73%, and 54%, respectively (Fig. 1l and S3b). These results indicated that 3D8 scFv protected cells from virus in single infection models.Antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv against co-infection with coronaviruses or IAVsIn the coronaviruses co-infection model, Vero E6 cells were challenged with both PEDV and hCoV-OC43 simultaneously (Fig. 2a). We assessed the inhibitory activity of 3D8 scFv against infection with two coronaviruses by evaluating the expression of the S and N genes of both viruses using western blotting and by assessing plaque reduction. Treatment with 3D8 scFv reduced the viral gene expression by 55% for hCoV-OC43 and 70% for PEDV (Fig. 2b,c and S2a). Only 25–30% of hCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein and PEDV spike protein were detected in 3D8 scFv-treated cells compared with those in the untreated cells (Fig. 2d,e). Furthermore, plaque reduction assay revealed that the generation of new virions in the co-infection model were markedly decreased by approximately 85% in the presence of 3D8 scFv (Fig. 2f and S3c).Figure 2Antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against co-infection with coronaviruses. (a) Diagram of procedure of co-infection with coronaviruses. 3D8 scFv (10 µM) was treated to Vero E6 cells co-infected with coronaviruses hCoV-OC43 (MOI 0.1) and PEDV (MOI 0.02). At 54 h after coronaviruses infection, the cells and supernatants were harvested to check S and N gene expression level of (b) hCoV-OC43 and (c) PEDV using one-step RT-qPCR, (d) determine viral protein level using western blotting, (e) the relative band intensity of hCoV-OC43 N protein and PEDV S protein was normalized to GAPDH intensity. The total viral titer of the two coronaviruses was detected using plaque reduction assay, the plaques were counted and (f) the percentage of plaque reduction was calculated. All assays were conducted in triplicates. Significant differences were determined using unpaired t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). The original western blots are presented in Fig. S4.Full size imageTo evaluate the ability of 3D8 scFv in blocking IAVs replication under co-infection, MDCK cells were simultaneously exposed to H1N1/PR8 and H3N2/X-31 for 6 h and then treated with 10 µM 3D8 scFv for 30 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (Fig. 3a). We found that the administration of 3D8 scFv inhibited viral gene expression following infection at high MOIs (H1N1/PR8, MOI 1; H3N2/X-31, MOI 2) (Fig. 3b,c and S2b). Western blotting showed consistent results, indicating that the expression of HA protein of both IAVs was greatly reduced by approximately 60% (Fig. 3d,e). The virus titer after 3D8 scFv treatment was detected in the supernatants, and the results showed a 65% decrease in total IAVs (Fig. 3f and S3d).Figure 3Antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv against co-infection with IAVs. (a) Diagram of procedure of co-infection with IAVs. MDCK cells were simultaneously inoculated with H1N1/PR8 (MOI 1) and H3N2/X-31 (MOI 2) at 37 °C. At 6 hpi, the cells were treated with 10 µM 3D8 scFv in MEM supplemented with 1 µg/mL TPCK, after which the cells were incubated for a total duration of 30 h. (b) HA and NA genes of H1N1/PR8 as well as the (c) HA and NP genes of H3N2/X-31 expression level in 3D8 scFv-treated and untreated cells were assessed using one-step RT-qPCR. In addition, (d) 3D8-treated cells were collected for western blotting assay using influenza HA primary antibody; (e) the viral protein expression was normalized to GAPDH expression. (f) Plaque reduction assay was conducted; the total progeny of IAVs in the co-infection model was quantified, and the percentage reduction was calculated. All assays were conducted in triplicates. Significant differences were determined using unpaired t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). The original western blots are presented in Fig S4.Full size image3D8 scFv protected Vero E6 cells against co-infection with two types of respiratory virus–coronavirus (hCoV-OC43) and influenza virus (adapted-H1N1)Our results revealed that 3D8 scFv protected host cells against co-infection with two cytoplasmic RNA viruses or two nuclear RNA viruses, which led us to a hypothesis that 3D8 scFv could block both hCoV-OC43 and adapted-H1N1 under co-infection. First, to establish a co-infection model comprising two different viruses in a single cell, the ability of both IAV and hCoV-OC43 to propagate in a single cell was confirmed (Fig. 4a). Next, Vero E6 cells were infected simultaneously with coronavirus and IAV as described in Fig. 4b. After 6 h of co-infection, 3D8 scFv was added at 10 µM to the cells. Our findings showed that the expression of HA and NA genes of adapted-H1N1 decreased by approximately 70%, whereas that of hCoV-OC43 S and N genes was reduced by 40% (initial MOI: 1 for adapted-H1N1 and 0.1 for hCoV-OC43) (Fig. 4c,d and S2c). Moreover, adapted-H1N1 HA protein and hCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein were detected in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells, as assessed using western blotting. Approximately 50% of HA protein (adapted-H1N1) and 30% of N protein (hCoV-OC43) were detected in 3D8 scFv-treated cells (Fig. 4e,f). The number of progenies of adapted-H1N1 and hCoV-OC43 was approximately 3.7 × 107 and 3.7 × 105 progeny virions per milliliter, respectively, in Vero E6 cells without 3D8 scFv treatment (Fig. S3e). In contrast, in the presence of 3D8 scFv, the replication of adapted-H1N1 and hCoV-OC43 notably decreased by 80% and 50%, respectively (Fig. 4g). In comparison, oseltamivir-treated cells showed a similar percentage of IAV reduction, but chloroquine reduced hCoV-OC43 virion production by 77% (Fig. 4g). In addition, immunocytochemistry showed the intensity of coronavirus and IAV in the 3D8 scFv-treated cells was reduced by 67% and 54%, respectively, compared with that in untreated cells (Fig. 4h and i). Furthermore, we examined the expression of a host gene, TLR7, which is an innate immune receptor for viral ssRNA and plays an important role in host response to virus invasion38,39. TLR-7 mRNA was upregulated under co-infection with adapted-H1N1 and hCoV-OC43 in Vero E6 cells with or without any treatments (Fig. 4j). However, 3D8 scFv-, chloroquine-, and oseltamivir-treated cells exhibited a notably decrease in TLR-7 gene expression compared to the untreated cells (Fig. 4j). Considering that Vero E6 cells lack genes encoding type I interferons (IFNs), which play a role in the host innate immune system, our findings suggested that the antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv maybe not related to host antiviral immune responses during virus infection.Figure 43D8 scFv suppressed co-infection with influenza virus and coronavirus. (a) Simultaneous infection of adapted-H1N1 (A-H1N1) and coronavirus (hCoV-OC43) was detected in infected Vero E6 cells using immunocytochemistry at 30 hpi. (b) Diagram of influenza virus (adapted-H1N1) and coronavirus (hCoV-OC43) co-infection procedure. Vero E6 cells were co-infected with adapted-H1N1 and hCoV-OC43 (MOI: 1 and 0.1, respectively). After 6 h of co-infection, the cells were treated with 10 µM of 3D8 scFv, oseltamivir (positive control), chloroquine (positive control), or DPBS (negative control) in DMEM supplemented with 1 µg/ml TPCK. (c) The HA and NA genes of adapted-H1N1 and (d) the S and N genes of hCoV-OC43 were quantified using one-step RT-qPCR. (e) The influenza HA protein and hCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein were examined via western blotting using the appropriate specific primary antibodies, in which (f) the relative band intensity of both viral proteins was normalized to GAPDH intensity. The supernatants were collected for progeny virus quantification using plaque reduction assay; plaques of adapted-H1N1 and hCoV-OC43 were separately counted, then (g) the plaque reductions for all treatments were combined in one graph to obtain the full view of plaque reduction under co-infection. (h) Antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against adapted-H1N1 and hCoV-OC43 under co-infection in Vero E6 cells was measured using immunofluorescence, in which (i) the viral protein signal was converted to relative intensity percentages using CellProfiler 4.2.1, and the viral protein intensity was normalized to DAPI intensity. (j) TLR7 expression level in treated and untreated cells. All assays were conducted in triplicates. Significant differences were determined via unpaired t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). The original western blots are presented in Fig. S4.Full size imageDiscussionWe recently reported that 3D8 scFv exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses37. In addition, a prophylactic and therapeutic effect of 3D8 scFv against H1N1/pdm09 has been indicated34. It showed that 10 µM 3D8 scFv strongly reduced the gene expression of hCoV-OC43 and PEDV by approximately 100%, whereas 3 µM 3D8 scFv decreased IAV gene expression by approximately 50%34,37. As of the previous studies, our experiments showed similar results with reductions in viral gene levels, viral proteins, and progeny viruses. This finding suggested that 3D8 scFv exerted antiviral effects against two main RNA virus types, namely cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA viruses, which exhibit different replication cycles, in a single infection setting dependent on the MOI, protein concentration, and treatment timing after viral challenge. Besides, several studies have utilized single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies to effectively neutralize the surface proteins of H1N1 and PEDV, thereby impeding viral replication in in vitro tests. Notably, recombinant engineered scFv NVLM10 and bivalent single-domain NVL2M10, which target the M2 protein, exhibited a remarkable 80%-90% inhibition of H1N1/PR8 infection28. E. coli expressing scFvs against PEDV showed a 94% reduction in viral foci compared to the positive infection control40. However, these findings highlight the significant potential of scFv in blocking the virus propagation by effectively neutralizing the target viral surface proteins as a prophylactic approach, our study revealed that 3D8 scFv has been a promising therapeutic approach as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent in viral disease prevention.In an effort to mitigate the risk of co-infection and overcome drug resistance, 3D8 scFv was introduced as an antiviral drug capable of combating a broad range of viruses by directly targeting the viral genome to block viral replication. Influenza A virus is nuclear RNA virus, which means its replication occurs in the nucleus. 3D8 scFv has been shown to hydrolyze different types of IAV RNAs (vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA) at different infection stages: viral entry, viral protein synthesis, and viral exit to the cytoplasm34 (Fig. 5). hCoV-OC43 is a cytoplasmic RNA virus, and all of its replication steps occur in the cytoplasm, where 3D8 scFv is localized. Our study demonstrated that both the N and S genes of hCoV-OC43 were decreased by 3D8 scFv under both single infection and co-infection (Figs. 1b, 4d). We propose that 3D8 scFv targets coronavirus RNA in different stages of the viral life cycle. Thus, under co-infection with coronavirus and IAV, 3D8 scFv may act as a hunter, catching all types of viral RNA leading to reduction in viral proteins and new particle virions (Fig. 5). Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug available for the treatment of co-infection involving multiple viruses. Limited studies have been conducted on broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting different viruses in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Recently, a study highlighted the potential of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + ATPase pump, in inducing a host antiviral response that effectively inhibits co-infection with coronaviruses and IAVs7,41. Although the mechanisms of action and treatment approaches differ, both TG and 3D8 scFv demonstrated comparable efficacy. Notably, TG pretreatment exhibited a robust suppression of hCoV-OC43 progeny, reducing it by over 90% compared to the post-treatment approach using 3D8 scFv (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, 3D8 scFv demonstrated a substantial reduction in IAV progeny, inhibiting it by nearly 80% (Fig. 4g), surpassing the efficacy achieved by TG in the co-infection. Simultaneously, TG targets RSV and hCoV-OC43 at different stages of viral replication and also targets IAV at the post-translational stage7. We propose that 3D8 scFv targets the genomes of coronaviruses and IAVs at all stages of the viral life cycle. However, while TG was unable to prevent viral replication in cell lines that lack the type I IFN system, such as Vero E6 cells7, 3D8 scFv successfully exerted antiviral activity in both MDCK and Vero E6 cells in in vitro study.Figure 5Proposed mode of action of 3D8 scFv against co-infection with coronavirus and influenza virus. Upon cell entry, 3D8 scFv localizes in the cytosol, where it binds to the viral nucleic acid (regardless of coronavirus or IAV) and viral mRNA and then degrades them via nuclease activity. As 3D8 scFv can hydrolyze all types of viral RNA in both viruses at different periods of viral life cycles, 3D8 scFv can inhibit viral propagation. Created with BioRender.com.Full size imageFurthermore, TLR7, located on the X-chromosome, is an intracellular TLR that recognize single-stranded RNA and expressed in endosomes, lysosomes, and endolysosomes38,39,42. The primary role of TLR7 is conferring immunity against viral pathogens38,42. Upon recognizing viral ssRNA, TLR7 triggers several factors associated with the NF-kB pathway and inflammatory cytokine production and activates the expression of type I IFNs38,39. In our study, TLR-7 expression was lower in the 3D8 scFv-treated cells than that in the untreated cells (Fig. 4j). Moreover, viral load declined after 3D8 scFv treatment (Fig. S3e), which may cause a decrease in the detection of viral ssRNA in endosomes and result in the downregulation of TLR-7 compared with that in untreated cells, leading to the reduction in type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression level. Additionally, the lack of genes encoding type I IFNs in Vero E6 cells validated the idea that 3D8 scFv was mainly responsible for the antiviral activity observed in this study.Taken together, 3D8 scFv performed efficient antiviral activity against different strains, types, and subtypes of viruses in co-infection. With the notable efficacy of 3D8 scFv, which might directly target RNA viral genomes, it highlighted promising potential as a therapeutic drug against two different types of RNA virus not only in a single infection setting but also under co-infection. Furthermore, 3D8 scFv may have important implications for emerging or re-emerging RNA viruses-associated treatment in the future. We support the antiviral effect evaluation of 3D8 scFv against viral co-infection in vivo.Materials and methodsCell linesMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) (ATCC CCL-34) cells were maintained in complete Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) (Hyclone, USA). Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were grown in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Hyclone, USA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The complete media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, USA) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA).VirusesIAV strains A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 and H3N2/A/X-31, which were kindly provided by Prof. Dae-Hyuk Kweon (Sungkyunkwan University, Republic of Korea), were propagated in the allantoic fluid of 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C. The viruses were then collected and purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Vero E6 cell-adapted H1N1 (adapted-H1N1) was successfully generated from H1N1/PR8 as parental virus via virus adaptation method and propagated in Vero E6 cells. hCoV-OC43 (KBPV-VR-8) and PEDV (CV777), which were kindly provided by Novelgen research center (Suwon, Republic of Korea), were propagated in Vero E6 cells. All viral titers were determined by plaque assays.Preparation of 3D8 scFv3D8 scFv gene was constructed in pIg20-3D8 plasmid (Fig. S1a), and expressed via the addition of 1 mM isopropyl 1-thiol-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysE strain in Luria–Bertani broth enriched with 100 g/mL ampicillin and 25 g/mL chloramphenicol for 18 h at 26 °C. The cell culture supernatant was obtained using centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and then filtered through a 0.22-mm filter. Next, 3D8 scFv was purified from the supernatant using an IgG Sepharose 6 fast-flow affinity column (GE Healthcare, USA). 3D8 scFv was then eluted with acetic acid (0.1 M, pH 3.4), and neutralized with a 0.1 volume of 1 M Tris–HCl (pH 9.0). The purity of the eluted protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie-blue staining. All its key features were checked before being used for further experiments (Fig. S1b, c and d).Nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFvIn order to confirm nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFv, several types of substrates were used including pUC19 vector, ribosomal RNA, and viral RNA as double-stranded DNA, RNA substrates, respectively. The substrates (1 µg) were incubated with 0.5 µg of 3D8 scFv in 1X tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 mM MgCl2 at 37 °C for 0-15-30–-0 min, then analyzed using electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines by using TRI reagent (MRC, USA), and viral RNA was synthesized using HiScribe T7 high yield RNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, USA) according to the manufacturing protocol.In vitro antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv Three models of co-infection were established: (1) two coronaviruses [hCoV-OC43 (MOI 0.1) and PEDV (MOI 0.02)], (2) two IAVs [H1N1/PR8 (MOI 1) and H3N2/X-31(MOI 2)], and (3) coronavirus and influenza virus [hCoV-OC43 [MOI 0.1 and adapted-H1N1 (MOI 1)]. For model (2), the two IAVs were inoculated simultaneously to MDCK cells (1 × 105 cells/well) seeded on a 24-well plate (SPL Life Sciences, Republic of Korea) for 1 h. After that, the infection medium was removed and serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA and 1 µg/mL TPCK was then added to the virus-infected cells. At 6 h post-infection (hpi), 10 µM of 3D8 scFv was added to the cells, followed by incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. For model (1) and (3), Vero E6 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded on a 24-well plate, washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and challenged with different pairs of viruses in serum-free media. Following 1 h of absorption, the infection medium was removed and replaced with complete DMEM for model (1) and DMEM including 0.2% BSA and 1 µg/mL TPCK for model (3). At 6 hpi, the cells were treated with 3D8 scFv. After that, supernatants and cells were collected at 54 hpi for model (1) and at 30 hpi for model (2) and (3), followed by storage at − 80 °C for further experiments. In which, cells were harvested using TRI reagent (MRC, USA) and RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) for RNA and protein extraction, respectively.RNA extraction and one-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR)Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (MRC, USA), a final RNA concentration of 10 ng/μL was used. One-step RT-qPCR was performed using AccuPower GreenStar RT-qPCR Premix and Master mix (Bioneer, Republic of Korea) and Rotor-Gene Q system (Qiagen, German) with 50 ng of RNA template. Influenza virus genes (HA and NA), coronavirus genes (N and S), a toll-like receptor gene (TLR-7) were amplified using the primers listed in Table S1.Plaque assay and plaque reduction assayMDCK and Vero E6 cells were seeded at 7 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates to 90–100% confluency. The supernatants harvested in the antiviral tests were serially diluted tenfold, and 1 mL of the diluted viral suspension was inoculated to DPBS-washed cells. Following 1 h of incubation, the cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 1% SeaPlaque agarose (Lonza, USA) with 1 μg/mL TPCK for model (2) and (3) or without TPCK for model (1). Plaque formation was observed for 3 and 4 days of incubation for influenza virus and coronavirus, respectively. Plaques were counted, and the percentage of plaque reduction was calculated.Immunoblot assayCells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) to extract the protein. Next, 20 μg of the protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membranes after being transferred from gels were incubated with primary antibodies—monoclonal antibody to PEDV nucleoprotein protein (clone 3F12, 9191, Median Diagnostics, Republic of Korea), monoclonal antibody to hCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein (clone 542-7D, LS-C79764, LS-bio, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody to IAV (including H1N1 and H3N2) (PA5-349291, Invitrogen, USA), and polyclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (ab9485, Abcam, UK). After that, membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (G-21040 Invitrogen, USA), and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (A21020, Abbkine, USA). The membranes were added with Enhanced chemiluminescence (W3652-050, DawinBio, Republic of Korea) and exposed the film to observe the results. To analyze samples of viral co-infection, samples were divided into separated sets and then SDS-PAGEs were performed and transferred onto separated membranes. Each membrane was treated with different primary antibodies and secondary antibodies.ImmunocytochemistryVero E6 cells (2 × 104) were cultured in 8-well chamber slides. The hCoV-OC43 and adapted-H1N1 co-infection and 3D8 scFv treatment were performed as described above. The slides were fixed with cold-methanol and permeabilized with an Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer (Biolegend, USA) for 15 min each. Following blocking with PBS with 0.1% tween 20 containing 1% BSA and glycine for 1 h, the cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody (PA5-349291, Invitrogen, USA), monoclonal anti-coronavirus antibody (OC43 strain, clone 541-8F, MAB9012, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and anti-3D8 antibody (humanized antibody, clone 1D7, Bioneer, Republic of Korea) at 1:1000 dilution for 24 h at 4 °C. After that, goat anti-human IgG Alexa fluor 488 (A-11013, Invitrogen, USA), donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor 555 (ab150074, Abcam, UK), and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor 647 (ab1500115, Abcam, UK) were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. The nucleus was stained with VECTASHIELD Antifade mounting medium containing DAPI (LSbio, USA) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope (Zeiss, German). The viral protein signals were converted to relative intensity percentages using CellProfiler 4.2.1, and the viral protein intensity was normalized to DAPI intensity.Statistical analysisAll data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, USA) was used to analyze the data. Two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed to compare the means of two groups. Differences of *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, or ****P < 0.0001 were considered significant.

This problem is augmented by the fact that the percentage of the population intending to take the yearly seasonal influenza vaccine is relatively low. The purpose of this study is to assess if vaccine knowledge and just-world beliefs have an impact on willingness to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. The methodology relies on a multivariable logistic regression analysis establishing predictors of vaccine intake intent and parametric tests comparing variables across gender and ethnicity. Results come out showing that vaccine knowledge is not a significant predictor of seasonal influenza vaccine intake intent. However, general belief in the just world is a significant predictor of vaccine intake intent. This has important implications for the role of religion in curbing seasonal influenza vaccine hesitancy in the UAE. Given that just-world beliefs are linked to religiosity, public health authorities need to consider relying on religious leaders to exhort the faithful to take the vaccines by framing their exhortations in the context of just-world beliefs.

The problem is expressed in Epicurus’ well-known paradox: “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?” (Shen, 2014).Many responses have been provided to this ancient problem from different religious traditions (Adams and Adams, 1990; Gellmann, 1992; Kaufman, 2005; Peterson, 1983; Saeedimehr, 2010; Tooley, 2019; Van Inwagen, 2006). But while many of these responses have been philosophically sophisticated, many people adhere to a rather rudimentary religious understanding: evil in the world is simply a punishment for sins (Harris et al., 2018; Stump, 1985). This corresponds with the concept of immanent justice: evil deeds are immanently punished (Maes, 1994).While most religious doctrinal systems do not formally adhere to this understanding of the world, it can still be found in certain aspects of religious traditions. For example, karma in Dharmic religions refers to the connection between actions and results. While this doctrine typically appeals to deeds in previous lives to account for the circumstances of current life, it also has immanent applications, i.e., suffering is explained by actions done in this life (Harvey and Callan, 2014; Taylor et al., 2022).In the Abrahamic religions, similar concepts of immanent justice are also occasionally found (Norenzayan, 2016; White et al., 2021). In Biblical literature, for example, it is stated that “the person who sins will die… the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself” (Ezekiel 18:20). Some Muslims interpret this verse from the Qur’an as conveying a similar message: “Allah confounds whom He will, and guides to the Right Way whom He pleases” (6:39). While theologians of these religious traditions typically emphasize that justice will be served in the afterlife (either through divine judgment or through the reincarnation cycle) (Hafer and Rubel, 2015), many adherents to these religious traditions believe that outcomes in life neatly reflect actions.This corresponds to what psychologists call the “just world hypothesis.” As per Melvin Lerner’s (1980) definition in his seminal study of this topic, “the “belief in a just world” is an attempt to capture in a phrase one of the ways, if not the way, that people come to terms with-make sense out of-find meaning in, their experiences. We do not believe that things just happen in our world; there is a pattern to events that convey not only a sense of orderliness or predictability but also the compelling experience of appropriateness expressed in the typically implicit judgment, Yes, that is the way it should be.”Lerner was quite aware of the strong connection between religion and the just world hypothesis. As he explains, “the Western religions stress the relation between sin, doing harm to others, and suffering. Although the ultimate accounting is expected to take place in the next world and for eternity, there are strong themes running through the Judeo-Christian tradition which link signs of one’s fate on earth with virtue and a state of grace” (Lerner, 1980). Similar themes are present in Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism (Furnham and Procter, 1989). Unsurprisingly, previous research has found associations between adherence to just-world beliefs and religiosity (Kaplan, 2012; Rubin and Peplau, 1975; Zweigenhaft, 1985).The just world hypothesis has been associated with various negative traits and behaviors. For example, studies have indicated that it is related to victim blaming (Van den Bos and Maas, 2009), especially in rape situations (Hayes et al., 2013; Pedersen and Strömwall, 2013; Strömwall et al., 2013; Valor-Segura et al., 2011). Other studies have shown associations between authoritarianism (Connors and Heaven, 1987; Lambert et al., 1999) and demeaning attitudes towards the poor. In the realm of health, the just world hypothesis has also been associated with the stigma of cancer patients (Stahly, 1988), as well as STDs (Anderson, 1992; Furnhaml and Procter, 1992).However, the just world hypothesis has also been associated with positive health effects. For example, one study found that belief in the just world is a buffer against anger (Dalbert, 2002a). Some research indicates that belief in the just world served as a protection against hopelessness in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic (Kiral Ucar et al., 2022). Very few studies have been done on the possible association between belief in the just world and intent to take vaccines.In this endeavor, it is also important to consider some background on the psychology and sociology of vaccine hesitancy as a general phenomenon. Vaccine hesitancy is a multidimensional phenomenon, but prior multi-national research suggests that there are particular axes that have an effect on people’s hesitancy to receive vaccines. For example, various media studies report that in the age of social media, misinformation can spread rapidly; false claims and misconceptions about vaccines, their ingredients, and potential side effects can contribute to hesitancy (Garett and Young, 2021; Neely et al., 2022; Puri et al., 2020). Likewise, other studies indicate that some individuals may struggle to discern reliable sources from unreliable ones, leading them to believe inaccurate information about how vaccines work (Austin et al., 2023; Biasio, 2017; Melki et al., 2023).Psychological research also suggests that people may perceive the risk of vaccination as greater than the risk of the disease itself, especially if the disease is rare or not well understood, and in turn, this may enhance vaccine hesitancy (Caserotti et al., 2021; Du et al., 2021; Martinelli and Veltri, 2021). It must also be admitted that in recent times transparency has been affected in some areas of the world, and in turn, distrust in government agencies and pharmaceutical companies can contribute to vaccine hesitancy; concerns about profit motives, lack of transparency, and perceived conflicts of interest can erode trust in the scientific community and the health care system (Goldenberg, 2021; Jennings, Stoker, Bunting et al., 2021; Jennings, Stoker, Willis et al., 2021; Trent et al., 2022). This mistrust frequently extends to medical professionals, and consequently, this affects the perceived credibility of vaccination recommendations (Lalumera, 2018; Nowak et al., 2021).Some studies also document an interesting paradox: success in reducing or eliminating certain diseases through vaccination can lead to complacency; if a disease is no longer prevalent, individuals may underestimate its severity and the importance of vaccination (Barglow, 2021; Lu and Sun, 2022; Walsh et al., 2022). Furthermore, some individuals prefer to rely on natural immunity, believing that exposure to a disease is a more effective and safer way to build immunity (Ebrahimi et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2016; Perry et al., 2020; Smith, 2017) These trends may be compounded by certain religious beliefs, as misinterpretations of religious doctrines or concerns about vaccine ingredients may contribute to hesitancy (Ladini and Vezzoni, 2022; Trangerud, 2023).Research also suggests that limited access to healthcare services, including vaccination clinics, can contribute to hesitancy; socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and lack of education, may also play a role (M. S. Khan et al., 2021; McElfish et al., 2023; Paterson et al., 2016). Studies likewise indicate that some individuals may prioritize alternative or holistic health practices over conventional medicine; this can lead to resistance to vaccines perceived as artificial or unnecessary (Attwell et al., 2018; Fasce et al., 2023).The problem to be approached in this study is whether the belief in the just world may be associated with the decision to receive the yearly seasonal influenza shot in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In recent times, the UAE has made significant strides in healthcare and public health over the years, focusing on both preventive measures and advanced medical services (Al Hubaishi and Ali, 2022; M. Khan et al., 2018; M. Khan et al., 2018). The UAE has a modern healthcare system with state-of-the-art facilities, hospitals, and clinics; both public and private healthcare sectors contribute to the overall healthcare services in the country (Aljasmi et al., 2022; Jabnoun and Juma AL Rasasi, 2005; Mahmood et al., 2016). Likewise, the UAE government has launched several initiatives to enhance public health; these include campaigns for preventive care, vaccination drives, and awareness programs on lifestyle diseases (Hamidi, 2015; Khansaheb et al., 2016). As part of its public health policy, the UAE has implemented mandatory health insurance for all residents; this has helped in ensuring that individuals have access to medical services when needed and has contributed to the overall improvement of public health (Harichandran, 2023; E. Koornneef et al., 2017; E. J. Koornneef et al., 2012).However, as with many other countries, the UAE has faced some problems in getting its population to fully receive vaccine shots as per the schedules recommended by the World Health Organization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UAE launched an extensive vaccination drive, aiming to achieve high vaccination coverage to protect its population. The government, along with healthcare authorities, has been actively promoting vaccination through awareness campaigns, public communications, and outreach efforts. These governmental efforts have been very efficient, but the greater challenge in terms of vaccine hesitancy may be the public’s general attitude and some cultural constraints.Due to the rise of conspiracy-mongering and misinformation in recent times, most governments approach the problem of vaccine hesitancy through education. The rationale is that knowledge of how vaccines work predicts their intake intent in the population. The research question of the study is as follows: does belief in the just world serve as a predictor of seasonal influenza vaccine intake intent? It is important to point out that while some people may intend to take the vaccine, that is not necessarily the same as accepting it because some professions are required to take the vaccine, and in that case, they intend to take it (strictly to meet some job requirements) but do not necessarily accept it. Secondary research questions are: (a) Are there gender differences in adherence to the just world hypothesis in the UAE? (b) are there ethnic differences in adherence to the just world hypothesis in the UAE?If belief in the just world is indeed a predictive factor of seasonal influenza vaccine intake, then authorities must reconsider some of their strategies concerning vaccination efforts to focus not only on the dissemination of vaccine knowledge but also on cultivating particular attitudes that appeal to just-world beliefs. In this endeavor, religion may play an important role.MethodsParticipantsResearch protocols were approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Because of guidelines provided by authorities in the UAE, the IRB strongly discouraged directly asking participants about religious beliefs or religious adherence. This decision is on the grounds that the UAE pursues a program of religious tolerance because of its heterogenous population, and asking religious questions is deemed too sensitive. Nevertheless, participants could be asked about just world beliefs.Sampling was non-probabilistic, based on the willingness and availability to answer a survey. Participants were told their responses would be anonymous and were informed they could refuse to answer at any time. They were then asked to give informed consent.The present study’s inclusion criteria were confirmed by people over 18 years of age in the UAE of any religion or nationality, and consequently, it was expected that some participants would deem questions about religiosity too sensitive. For that reason, we opted to ask about issues that have a relationship with religious beliefs (such as the just world hypothesis) but not religion itself. Given the sensitive nature of religion in the UAE—and following the guidelines provided by the Institutional Review Board that assessed the survey—we took special care not to include questions related to religious issues. It is important to emphasize that religious issues are generally treated with sensitivity in the UAE, as it is a country that values religious tolerance and diversity (Lootah, 2021); research in this nation suggests that there are certain boundaries and regulations in place to maintain social harmony, and religious discussions are better circumvented by investigating topics that may be related, but not explicitly religious.Exclusion criteria were not being a resident of the UAE and not being proficient in English. Responses were collected using three methods: direct link, QR codes, and face-to-face interaction. Responses were stored in Microsoft Forms. Admittedly, the choice of language may constitute a limitation of the present study. Proficiency in English in the UAE may align with liberal values, and this may have had a confounding effect. However, it is important to consider that the present study reaches out to all ethnic and national groups of residents in the UAE, and there is a very high level of linguistic diversity amongst such groups. Therefore, in order to reach all of them, the use of a lingua franca was necessary. Although Arabic is the official language of the UAE, English serves more as a lingua franca to the extent that it enables communication of all groups speaking other languages (Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Tagalog, Pashtu, Malayalam, etc.). Consequently, while the use of English in the present study may have been a limitation given its potential confounding effect in regard to adherence to liberal values, it also provided the opportunity to cover wider segments of the UAE population.MeasuresThe survey was composed of four parts. First, demographic information was collected: age, gender, ethnicity, and educational level.Gender was obtained by asking participants, “What is your gender?” with “Male/Female” alternatives. A binary model was preserved, given that the cultural context of the Arab region does not fit well into nonbinary alternatives, and the IRB advised against using a nonbinary alternative in this question.Ethnicity was obtained by asking the participants, “Are you an Arab?” with “Yes/No” alternatives. As in many other ethnicities, it is not altogether clear who counts as an Arab. Occasionally, researchers use a religious criterion, mistakenly conflating Muslims and Arabs; this is clearly problematic, as there are plenty of non-Muslim Arabs and Non-Arab Muslims. More plausibly, researchers use a national criterion, assuming that people from Arab countries are Arabs. But this is also not satisfactory, as Arab countries may have non-Arab (Kurds, Berbers, etc.) populations, and many Arabs are now citizens of European and North American nations. Sometimes a linguistic criterion is also used, assuming that people whose first language is Arabic can be considered Arabs; but again, this is not entirely satisfactory, as in North Africa, there are people whose first language is Arabic yet belong to other ethnicities, and in Europe, North America and the Gulf region there may be people who are considered Arab, yet do not have Arabic as their first language. Ultimately, in this study, we have decided to use self-identification, acknowledging that although it is probably the best criterion, it still has limitations.Educational level was structured along a scale (1 = None; 2 = Primary school; 3 = Secondary School; 4 = College (undergraduate); 5 = College (graduate). The following question was also asked: “Have you taken the seasonal influenza vaccine in the last 6 months, or do you intend to take it in the next 6 months?” with “Yes/No” as option for the “Vaccine Intake Intent” variable.Second, a vaccine knowledge scale devised by Zingg and Siegrist (2012) was included. This is an instrument composed of 9 items, which assess subjects’ knowledge about how vaccines work. Items are arranged on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), presenting true statements (e.g., “The immune system of children is not overloaded through many vaccinations”) and false statements (e.g., “Many vaccinations are administered too early so that the body’s own immune system has no possibility to develop”); false statements were scored reversely (1 = strongly agree; 5 = strongly disagree). The scale includes false statements, and those statements are reversely scored, as this is a relatively common procedure to ensure that participants are responding meaningfully.Higher scores indicate a higher level of knowledge of how vaccines work. This scale has been validated in previous applications and is considered to have acceptable reliability (Andrade et al., 2022). In the present study, Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.70. Cronbach’s alpha indicates the internal reliability of a questionnaire (i.e., how closely related a set of items are as a group), and a level above 0.70 is considered good reliability.Third, the survey included the General Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJWS) (Dalbert et al., 1987). This is an instrument that assesses individuals’ attitudes towards justice in the world and the extent to which people deserve what they get. It includes 6 items (e.g., “I think basically the world is a just place”, “I think people try to be fair when making important decisions”). Subjects express their agreement with these statements on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). No reversed items were included in this part of the survey, as the original validated scale did not include them in its design. Higher scores indicate a stronger general belief in a just world. The GBJWS has been validated in various cultural contexts (Dalbert, 1999), and it is considered to have acceptable reliability (Öcel, 2012). In the present study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.75.Fourth, the survey included the Personal Belief in a Just World Scale (PBJWS). This instrument assesses individuals’ attitudes toward their own situation vis-à-vis what they believe they deserve (Dalbert, 2009). It includes 7 items (e.g., “I believe that most of the things that happen in my life are fair”, “I think that important decisions that are made concerning me are usually just”). Subjects express their agreement with these statements on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). No reversed items were included in this part of the survey, as the original validated scale did not include them in its design. Higher scores indicate a stronger personal belief in a just world. The PBJWS has been validated in various cultural contexts (Dalbert, 2002b), and it is considered to have acceptable reliability (De Caroli and Sagone, 2014). In the present study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.77.Statistical analysesIndependent, two-tailed Student’s t-test analyses were done with Vaccine Intake Intent as the grouping variable and Vaccine Knowledge, GBJWS, PBJWS, educational level, and age as dependent variables. Given the large sample size (n = 401), normality assumptions were not necessary; homogeneity of variance assumptions was met (Levene’s test was calculated for each variable, and all p-values were above 0.05). Effect size (Cohen’s d) was also calculated.χ2 (Chi-square) analyses examining the independence between vaccine intake intent and ethnicity; and vaccine intake intent and gender were done.In order to check for possible confounding factors, a multivariable logistic regression model was done with Vaccine Intake Intent as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, Vaccine Knowledge, GBJWS, PBJWS. Odds Ratio (OR) was calculated for each predictor.Independent, two-tailed Student’s t-test analyses were done with ethnicity as the grouping variable and Vaccine Knowledge, GBJWS, and PBJWS as dependent variables. Given the large sample size (n = 401), normality assumptions were not necessary; homogeneity of variance assumptions was met (Levene’s test was calculated for each variable, and all p-values were above 0.05). Effect size (Cohen’s d) was also calculated.Independent, two-tailed Student’s t-test analyses were done with gender as the grouping variable and Vaccine Knowledge, GBJWS, and PBJWS as dependent variables. Given the large sample size (n = 401), normality assumptions were not necessary; homogeneity of variance assumptions was met (Levene’s test was calculated for each variable, and all p-values were above 0.05). Effect size (Cohen’s d) was also calculated.Spearman’s coefficient matrix was calculated for correlations across these variables: GBJWS, PBJWS, age, Vaccine Knowledge, and educational level. Spearman’s coefficient was selected over Pearson’s given that two of the variables assessed (GBJWS, PBJWS) are based on Likert scales, and as per the recommendations of most statisticians, correlations for variables with Likert scales should be calculated with Spearman’s coefficient (Murray, 2013; Norman, 2010), given that it is an interval level of measurement. The only assumption required of Spearman’s test is a monotonic relation. This assumption was verified by graphing the correlation plot; the assumption was met.Power analysis was done to calculate the minimum sampling size for t-tests and Spearman’s correlation coefficients. Assuming a minimally interesting effect size of δ > 0.5, minimum desired power of 0.8, and α < 0.05, power analysis revealed that each group (gender; Vaccine Intake Intent: Yes/No) should consist of at least 64. 482 participants were approached. 401 returned complete answers, so the response rate was 83%. Of the 401, 114 reported vaccine intake intent, 281 were female, and 290 were Arabs. For Spearman’s correlations, assuming a minimally interesting effect size of δ > 0.3, minimum desired power of 0.8, and α < 0.05, power analysis revealed that the whole sample should consist of at least 84. Consequently, sampling size surpassed the recommended minimum as per power analyses. The probability of committing a type-II error was kept under 0.2.Statistical significance was placed at p < 0.05. Analyses were done with Jamovi software.ResultsDescriptive results (N, mean, standard deviation) are presented in Table 1. Results are split on the basis of nominal variables (gender, ethnicity, Vaccine Intake Intent). Descriptive plot for Vaccine Intake Intent is presented in Fig. 1. Sample size was 401, 281 were women, and 290 were Arabs. 114 (28.4%) responded “Yes” in Vaccine Intake Intent. Descriptive plots split by ethnicity and gender for GBJWS and PBJWS are presented in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.Table 1 Descriptive results.Full size tableFig. 1: Descriptive plot.Vaccine intake intent.Full size imageFig. 2: Descriptive plot.GBJWS, split by ethnicity and gender.Full size imageFig. 3: Descriptive plot.PBJWS, split by ethnicity and gender.Full size imageStudent’s t-tests (and Cohen’s d) with Vaccine Intake Intent as grouping variable are presented in Table 2.

Ethnicity is also a statistically significant predictor of Vaccine Knowledge (Non-Arabs have a higher score), with a small effect size (Cohen’s d = −0.404).Table 5 Independent, two-tailed Student’s t-test.Full size tableSpearman’s correlation matrix is presented in Table 5. There is a moderate correlation between CBJWS and PBJWS, a weak negative correlation between Vaccine Knowledge and PBJWS, and a moderate correlation between educational knowledge and age.DiscussionSeasonal influenza vaccine hesitancy in the UAE as compared to other nationsAccording to some reports, it is estimated that 3–5 million people are afflicted with a serious variant of seasonal influenza (Vincent et al., 2014). While it is not a major concern in the UAE, there are still public health reasons to address this problem, especially considering that at the end of summer, influenza outbreaks are reported (Saeed, 2022). As per guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), the best preventive measure is effective vaccination programs (Medlock and Galvani, 2009), which should be administered on a yearly basis, given that the immune system needs a constant boost, in anticipation of the risks brought forth by the seasonal changes (Dos Santos, 2019).In this study, results come out showing that vaccination rates in the UAE are not at a sufficiently optimal level. Only 28% of respondents reported intent to take the vaccine jab. This number is still problematic, given that it may be below the needed threshold for herd immunity.There is, therefore a need to address this issue in the UAE. This is especially concerning for patients with diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases in the UAE. It is well-established that such conditions compromise immune responses, and therefore, those individuals are in special need of vaccination (Diepersloot et al., 1990; Dos Santos et al., 2018; Goeijenbier et al., 2017). Prevalence of diabetes mellitus is a major epidemiological concern in the UAE (Alsafar et al., 2012; Baglar, 2013; Elemam et al., 2021; Razzak et al., 2018; Saadi et al., 2007), and consequently, any attempt to curb seasonal influenza in the UAE will ultimately have a major beneficial impact on the treatment of diabetes mellitus.It is important to place these results in the wider context of how other Muslim countries face the problem of vaccine hesitancy. By and large, the situation in the UAE is similar to those of other nations where Islam is the predominant religion. For example, one study in Malaysia concludes that “appropriate steps that increase vaccine acceptance… are needed to address this issue and to foster more positive attitudes toward vaccination” (Lee et al., 2023).The comparison with Malaysia is interesting to the extent that this nation has also had dramatic changes as a result of rapid industrialization and public health improvement in recent years, and it has also implemented an elaborate immunization program (Jafar et al., 2022a). It is important to consider how vulnerable groups in both nations are susceptible to greater vaccine hesitancy. For example, another study in Malaysia reports that “specific groups tend to become vaccine hesitancy such as unemployed, self-employed, students, male, single, level of education, and Muslim” (Jafar et al., 2022b), and other studies in the same nation indicate that vaccine hesitancy (particularly of COVID-19) have increased mortality rates (Ahmad et al., 2021). While these exact variables were not assessed in the present study, we can ascertain that those who are most vulnerable in societies are more likely to resist vaccine jabs, as indeed, the results of the present study indicate in the UAE.It is also important to compare how vaccine hesitancy in the UAE compares to other nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) area, as most of the policies are framed in that cultural context. One study informs that “vaccine hesitancy is prevalent among the public and healthcare workers in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. There is a need to continually monitor perceptions and knowledge about vaccines and vaccination in these countries to better inform interventions to improve vaccine uptake in the sub-region” (Algabbani et al., 2023). Although the UAE tends to be at the higher end in markers of social progress amongst GCC nations, this is still reason for concern, as the GCC block as a whole (a set of countries that is very close to the UAE in terms of religion and culture) still needs improvement.Research in GCC countries documents that there are various cultural factors at play that ultimately impact vaccine hesitancy (Andrade et al., 2022). While Islamic scholars generally support vaccination, misconceptions about vaccine ingredients, including concerns about porcine-derived gelatin or alcohol content, may lead to hesitancy (Alsuwaidi et al., 2023).It must also be noted that trust in government and healthcare authorities varies across GCC countries and the Arab world at large (Albaity et al., 2023; Peretti‐Watel et al., 2019); historical events, political instability, or corruption may contribute to skepticism regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Furthermore, Arab media has not fully addressed the spread of fake news and misinformation, and this has contributed to vaccine hesitancy in the region (Biswas et al., 2022). It has also been established that in some Arab communities, there may be a preference for traditional or alternative medicine over Western medical practices, leading to skepticism about vaccines (Albaity et al., 2023; Elbarazi et al., 2021; Sallam et al., 2021).Likewise, Arab societies are often characterized by strong social networks, and this is especially the case in GCC nations, given the legacies of tribal structures in the region. Peer influence and community opinions can significantly impact individual decisions (Hajje, 2022; Moore et al., 2022; Turner et al., 2021). In this context, it is important to consider how fear of social stigma or rejection can influence vaccine decisions. Research shows that in the GCC context, individuals may hesitate to go against the prevailing views within their peer group, even if they have positive attitudes toward vaccination (Bizri et al., 2023; Jairoun et al., 2022). The desire to fit in and avoid judgment can contribute to vaccine hesitancy.Indeed, the perception of what the majority within a peer group believes can impact individual decisions. If there is a perceived consensus within the peer network that questions the necessity or safety of vaccines, individuals may be more likely to adopt similar views. Religious authorities in GCC countries have great leverage on the population’s habits, and research suggests that if someone considered knowledgeable within a peer group expresses doubts about vaccines, others may be influenced by this perceived expertise, contributing to vaccine hesitancy (Bonnevie et al., 2021; Haensch et al., 2022). Peer groups are often integral to one’s sense of identity. If vaccine hesitancy becomes associated with a particular community or identity, individuals may be more likely to adopt hesitant attitudes to maintain a sense of belonging.Furthermore, given the large influx of migrant workers coming from the wider MENA region, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Philippines, it is also important to consider the state of vaccine hesitancy in those regions, given that ultimately, those cultural patterns will also be partly incorporated to UAE national life due to migratory influx. Current research shows that in those countries show that efforts are being made to address vaccine hesitancy, especially in the context of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns; countries from the Arab world, South Asia, Africa, and the Philippines have been working on public health campaigns to promote vaccine acceptance; however, challenges such as misinformation, cultural beliefs, and access to healthcare resources could contribute to hesitancy in certain communities (Aborode et al., 2021; Ackah et al., 2022; Afolabi and Ilesanmi, 2021; Alam et al., 2023; Brackstone et al., 2022; Caple et al., 2021; Ennab et al., 2022; Hawlader et al., 2022; Mutombo et al., 2022; Qunaibi et al., 2021).On the basis of the COVID-19 pandemic experience, previous research has focused on the conspiratorial aspects of vaccine hesitancy. In one systematic review, Pertwee et al. (2022) point out that major factors, “such as anxieties around the pace of technological change or feelings of political disempowerment, are not within the control of the medical community.” Therefore, even if significant steps are taken toward the development of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy still remains a larger psychosocial obstacle. Research suggests that the rise of populist politics in various regions of the world has facilitated the spread of conspiracy theories regarding vaccines (Bergmann, 2018). In the UAE, vaccine hesitancy is still a problem (Andrade et al., 2022), although not much attention has been paid to how conspiratorial thinking influences decisions to receive vaccines in the UAE.Traditionally, the problem of vaccine hesitancy has been tackled via education, given that it is largely a disinformation problem. Prior research suggests that increased educational levels are related to greater intent of taking vaccine jabs (Navin et al., 2019). This also pertains to specific knowledge about vaccines (Montagni et al., 2020), and consequently, many governments throughout the world have embraced an educational effort in order to increase vaccination rates (Burke et al., 2019; Kernéis et al., 2017; Ropeik, 2013). This has been especially the case in the UAE (Ahamed et al., 2021; Nizam et al., 2022; Ortashi et al., 2013).However, the results of this study suggest that in the UAE, technical education about how vaccines work is not a predictor of vaccine intake intent for seasonal influenza. No statistically significant correlation was found between vaccine knowledge or educational level and vaccine intake intent.A tentative explanation for these findings is that in the decision to get vaccinated, cognitive factors may not be very relevant. Prior work on conspiracy theories suggests that people embrace conspiratorial narratives largely due to emotional and situational factors (Douglas et al., 2020; Van Prooijen and Douglas, 2017) and not necessarily due to cognitive factors alone. For example, powerlessness and perceived discrimination are strong predictors of conspiratorial thinking (especially in relation to vaccines) (Coelho et al., 2022), regardless of actual technical knowledge about facts. Consequently, it is possible that the decision to get vaccinated against seasonal influenza may be influenced by specific social conditions in the UAE instead of knowledge about how vaccines work.Interestingly, various studies have been done on vaccine hesitancy in other Middle Eastern nations (Galal et al., 2022; Sallam, 2021), and some studies have also assessed the level of vaccine knowledge in such populations (Alotaibi et al., n.d.; Gamaoun, 2018), but no substantial study has been done on the relationship between both variables in such nations. The results of the present study suggest that in the UAE, there is no significant relation, and future research ought to explore if such a relationship exists in other Middle Eastern nations.Vaccine hesitancy and just-world beliefsPrior research shows that the relationship between religion and vaccine hesitancy is complex. Some research suggests that rigid literalist traditions in various faiths incentivize vaccine hesitancy in many countries (Kanozia and Arya, 2021). This problem is made worse when particular religious groups seek exemption from vaccines due to their religious beliefs (Keshet and Popper-Giveon, 2021; Williams et al., 2021). Furthermore, when nationalist narratives are intertwined with religious concepts, vaccine hesitancy also increases (Corcoran et al., 2021).However, research also shows that religious leaders play a key role in persuading communities to receive vaccination shots, and in that regard, so long as such leaders deliver the right message, religiosity can serve the purpose of curbing vaccine hesitancy. Indeed, in some cases, religious leaders have met that goal (Viskupič and Wiltse, 2022).The results of the present study suggest that religiosity may play an unsuspected role in curbing vaccine hesitancy in the UAE. As mentioned above, the belief in the just world is firmly intertwined with religiosity. In turn, the present study shows that general belief in the just world is a significant predictor of seasonal influenza vaccine uptake, and this is further confirmed after controlling for possible confounding effects as per the multivariable logistic regression model.A plausible theoretical explanation for this association is that to the extent that subjects accept that the world is a just place, well-being relies on a collective effort. Therefore, given that they perceive the world as just, they feel the duty to give back in return. Previous research shows that belief in the just world predicts harsh judgment on the poor and dispossessed (Sutton and Douglas, 2005; Verhaagen, 2022). But when it comes to vaccination, belief in the just world provides a different rationale: the subject is happy to contribute to herd immunity, given that in so doing, it is expected that the fairness of the universe will protect him or her in turn. The decision to receive the vaccine therefore operates under a conception of immanent justice, in which it is expected that the act of receiving the shot provides immediate assurance that the individual will be safe from the disease.This may have the flip side of harshly judging those who do not receive the vaccine. There is evidence that belief in the just world primes individuals to blame COVID-19 patients for their own condition (Chung et al., 2023; Murakami et al., 2022). This is even more the case in discriminatory attitudes towards the unvaccinated (Bor et al., 2022).Authoritarianism as a personality trait may also be at play. Reliance on authoritarian figures is associated with both religiosity (Lambert et al., 1999; Martin and Nichols, 1962) and belief in the just world (Lambert et al., 1998; Newton, 2012). Although conspiracy-mongering regarding vaccines has been rampant amongst some populist politicians (Kennedy, 2019), most governments have understood the need to properly administer vaccines and therefore have urged their constituents to take vaccines. Consequently, to the extent that those who uphold the just world hypothesis are more likely to accept commands from their leaders, they are also more likely to receive the vaccine if their leaders urge them to do so.Ethnic differencesThe present study indicates that in the UAE, Arabs have a stronger adherence to the just world hypothesis than non-Arabs, although the effect is small. This may be explained on account of the societal structure of the UAE. While many labor reforms have been in place, and significant government efforts have been made towards equality and integration of all ethnicities in this nation, it is still a fact that socio-economic positions reflect ethnic differences, with Arabs enjoying better positions than other ethnicities (Pasha-Zaidi, 2015; Vora, 2008; Warner and Moonesar, 2019; Zachariah et al., 2004). The bulk of the non-Arab population is made up of migrant workers from South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Philippines, and these residents usually do jobs with less privileged positions. Given their perceived position in society, it is expected that they are less likely to accept the just world hypothesis to the extent that they believe they are not fully comfortable with the status they have been allotted in the social system. Other studies have also found that belief in the just world is lower amongst people who occupy lower positions in socio-economic hierarchies, whether on account of ethnicity (Davies, 1993; Furnham, 1985; Harding et al., 2020) or even physical attractiveness (Westfall et al., 2019).However, although there are ethnic differences in the level of acceptance of the just world hypothesis and belief in the just world is a predictive factor of seasonal influenza vaccine intake intent, the results of the present study indicate that there are no statistically significant differences between ethnic groups, when it comes to intent to take the seasonal influenza vaccine. This suggests that in the decision to receive the vaccine, various other factors are at play, and they need to be explored in future studies (Table 6).Table 6 Spearman’s correlation matrix.Full size tableAge and gender considerationsThe just world hypothesis is closely related to concepts of immanent injustice. Extensive research shows that notions of immanent justice are strongly present in the early phases of psychological development (Freeman and Daly, 1984; Jose, 1990; Karniol, 1980; Kister and Patterson, 1980; Medinnus, 1959), and consequently, age may be a predictive factor of belief in the just world. However, no such relationships are found in this study. A plausible explanation for this may be that age and belief in the just world are correlated, but only when children are considered. After the completion of the initial stages of psychological development (late adolescence), concepts of immanent justice and belief in the just world remain stable. Given that this study did not include children under 16, age does not come out as a predictive factor of belief in the just world.In terms of gender, there is a statistically significant difference between men and women when it comes to PBJWS, but the effect is small. This is somewhat expected, as despite significant government efforts, some gender gap remains (Miller et al., 2017; Patterson et al., 2021). Very much as with ethnicity, groups with perceived lower positions tend to have weaker adherence to the just world hypothesis (Furnham and Procter, 1989; Saroglou and Pichon, 2009), and this applies to women. Indeed, similar results have been found in other studies. For example, in one of the first applications of belief in just world scales, Whatley (1993) reports that “there was a gender difference in the total scale scores, with men scoring significantly higher than women”, and this finding is also present in other studies (Ambrosio and Sheehan, 1990).Nevertheless, it is important to note that while belief in the just world is lower amongst women, it bears no relation to their decision to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine shot. This may also account for the lack of any significant result when testing for any correlation between gender and intent to take the vaccine shot. To some extent, these are encouraging news, as it shows that in the UAE, women are not at a particularly higher risk of vaccine hesitancy. This may reflect the initiative of UAE authorities to narrow the gender gap across many dimensions, even if women still perceive the world to be less just than men do.LimitationsAlthough this study’s sample size met the minimum stipulations of the a-priori power analysis (and results yielded some significant correlations), future studies assessing correlations between vaccine intake intent and just world beliefs ought to include larger samples. Likewise, future studies ought to rely on stratified sampling making sure that representatives of all seven emirates in the UAE are included in order to arrive at more robust conclusions. The exclusion criteria as not having English proficiency may have had a confounding effect in regard to adherence to liberal values; future studies focusing on particular linguistic groups (in order to not rely on English as a lingua franca) ought to be done in order to overcome this limitation.There was also an important limitation in the present study: the lack of direct assessment of religiosity and religious differences as variables in relationship to both just world beliefs and seasonal influenza vaccine intake intent. In part, this was due to the guidelines provided by the IRB (as the UAE authorities strongly discourage asking people about their religion), but future studies may need to attempt to circumvent this limitation.ConclusionWhile seasonal influenza vaccine hesitancy is not a prime public health concern in the UAE, some improvement is needed. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made evident worldwide, the problem of vaccine hesitancy is related to conspiratorial thinking, misinformation, and lack of proper knowledge.However, in the specific case of the UAE, the results of this study suggest that vaccine knowledge or even educational level are not significant predictors of seasonal influenza vaccine intake intent. This has important policy implications, as UAE authorities could consider that investing additional resources in these areas may not be necessary, especially if such resources can be directed towards more significant factors.The present study shows that just world beliefs are one such factor. Greater adherence to just-world beliefs (especially on a general level) predicts greater willingness to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine shot. This is the case amongst both Arabs and non-Arabs, but the effect is more pronounced amongst the latter.This finding has relevant implications, both for policy and for the general assessment of religion’s role in curbing vaccine hesitancy. Given that the belief in the just world has long been associated with religiosity (on account of solutions to the philosophical problem of evil), one plausible indirect way of ultimately increasing seasonal influenza vaccine intake intent in the UAE is by relying on religious leaders to preach about the importance of receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine shot, and framing that rationale in connection to just world beliefs, as taught by the doctrines of the faiths they represent. Since the effect is more pronounced amongst non-Arabs, health authorities may focus their efforts on religious leaders who preach to non-Arab congregants.This may ultimately also have effects on conditions that go beyond seasonal influenza. As mentioned above, patients with diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of immunosuppression and, therefore, are in greater need of vaccination shots. Previous research has shown that in many cultural contexts, religion can play a positive role in helping diabetic patients cope with their conditions; religion can also serve the purpose of instilling healthy behaviors among such patients (Amadi et al., 2016; Darvyri et al., 2018; Dewi et al., 2022; Sridhar, 2013). The role of religion in helping patients cope with diabetes can be further expanded in the UAE if religious leaders also use the rationale of just world beliefs in order to increase vaccine intake intent.

Report: Drivers for a pandemic due to avian influenza and options for One Health mitigation measures. Image Credit: Pordee_Aomboon / Shutterstock Current avian influenza virus status Wild bird populations in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Union (EU) are known to have a high prevalence of avian influenza viruses that cause significant disease and mortality. Outbreaks have also been reported from fur animal farms, where the avian influenza viruses are thought to have been transmitted from birds to mammals. These infections among fur animals are believed to be due to transmission of the virus from birds to various mammalian species and possibly also because of transmission between mammalian species. Although cases of transmission of these viruses from birds to humans have not been widely reported, the evolution of avian influenza viruses and the dispersal of the virus through migratory wild birds could result in the selection of viruses that can infect humans. Given that humans do not yet have robust immune defenses against avian influenza viruses, the emergence of a virus capable of infecting and rapidly spreading among humans poses the risk of a potential pandemic. Examining the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers that can facilitate the evolution of avian influenza viruses to infect humans and to develop effective mitigation measures is imperative. Intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of viral evolution Factors such as susceptibility of the host and viral characteristics, known as intrinsic drivers, and extrinsic drivers, such as environmental factors, human activities, and climate, can facilitate the emergence of avian influenza viruses that carry mutations that allow them to infect mammals. Viral characteristics such as the reassortment propensity can drive the avian influenza virus to adapt to mammalian hosts. The hemagglutinin 5 neuraminidase 1 (H5N1) or avian influenza A virus, which contains the 2.3.4.4b clade that is currently circulating, has displayed evolutionary changes that could allow it to infect mammals and reassort. Furthermore, the global prevalence of the H5N1 virus in birds, including heterogenous poultry livestock, could result in the accumulation of various mutations that enable the virus to infect mammals, especially humans. Reassortment can also lead to rapid genetic shifts that allow the virus to infect and replicate in humans and transmit among human populations. Coinfection of mammals with seasonal influenza and avian influenza virus could also increase the probability of reassortment events. Related StoriesNew CDC report highlights disparities in flu hospitalization and vaccinationH5N1 bird flu is mutating fast and jumping to mammals - could the next pandemic be here?Review highlights failures in global control strategies for bird flu transmissionFurthermore, fur animals such as foxes and minks are highly susceptible to influenza viruses, and the exposure of these mammals to highly pathogenic strains of the avian influenza virus through contaminated feed could drive the virus's adaptation to mammals. Outdoor production farms and those with proximity to areas rich in water birds provide more opportunities for the virus to be introduced into farms. Peri-urban and synanthropic wild animals could also facilitate the spread of the virus from wild birds to humans and animals. Habitat destruction, extreme climatic events, and weather conditions can also impact the demography and ecology of these wild bird populations, acting as extrinsic drivers of the evolution of the avian influenza virus. Mitigation measures Risk mitigation measures included in the One Health approach suggested surveillance among target animal and human populations along with the generation and sharing of genomic data. Target animals included wild and captive birds, poultry, susceptible domestic mammals such as fur animals, cats, pigs, and peri-domestic and peri-urban mammals. The measures also comprised development and access to sustainable, rapid diagnostic methods using genomic data to screen for avian influenza virus in relevant populations. An additional critical area for risk mitigation was occupational safety in areas where humans interact closely with target animals. Furthermore, reassortment risk can be reduced by vaccinating individuals with a higher probability of occupational exposure to avian influenza against the seasonal influenza virus. The scientific report also discussed other areas, such as improving the veterinary infrastructure, biosecurity, communicating the risk to various audiences, and vaccinating animals, which could help mitigate the risk of the avian influenza virus adapting to humans and animals. Conclusions In summary, this report by the EFSA provided a detailed discussion of various intrinsic and extrinsic drivers, such as viral characteristics, factors that increase the susceptibility of animals, and environmental factors that could accelerate the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammalian hosts. The scientists also expanded on various mitigation measures, at individual and community levels, that could be followed to reduce the risk of adaptation and transmission of the avian influenza virus among animal and human populations.

Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. CNN — A worker on a dairy farm in Texas tested positive for the avian flu, only the second case of a person in the United States who has contracted the H5N1 influenza strain. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the person was diagnosed with the H5N1 virus and was recovering with mild symptoms. The first case, in 2022, was diagnosed in a Colorado man who was directly exposed to poultry.

CDC Related article Response to bird flu outbreak is ‘robust,’ CDC says, although risk to public remains low The risk to the public remains low, according to the CDC, but I still have questions. What exactly is the avian flu, and how is it transmitted? What symptoms do infected people experience, and what treatments exist? Is there a vaccine? Should people avoid eating poultry and drinking milk? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: What exactly is the bird flu? Dr. Leana Wen: Bird flu, also called avian flu or avian influenza, refers to infections caused by the avian influenza Type A viruses. These viruses generally spread among wild birds, especially wild aquatic birds such as ducks and geese. They can also infect domestic poultry and other animals. Avian influenza A viruses are divided into two categories: low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses and high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A viruses. Most LPAI viruses cause no signs of disease or mild disease in birds, but HPAI viruses can cause severe disease and are associated with high mortality. Some subtypes, for instance, have as high mortality rates as 90% to 100% in chickens. In addition, some LPAI viruses can mutate into HPAI variants. CNN: How is bird flu transmitted? Wen: By far, the most common form of transmission is from bird-to-bird. Infected birds can shed the virus through bodily fluids from their nose, mouth and feces. Other birds can become infected through direct contact with the virus particles, or through contact with surfaces contaminated with viruses from infected birds. The H5N1 avian flu virus has been causing outbreaks among poultry in the US, with 48 states and over 85 million poultry now affected. This virus is highly contagious among domestic poultry and can spread through an entire flock within a matter of days. CNN: Can bird flu be transmitted to other animals, including humans? Wen: Yes, some forms of bird flu can be transmitted to other animals. Since 2022 in the US, the avian flu H5N1 virus has been detected in more than 200 mammals. In March 2024, a multistate outbreak of this virus was reported in dairy cattle. The person in Texas who was just diagnosed with it presumably contracted it through exposure.

FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images Related article Bird flu isn’t a direct threat to humans yet, experts say, but they’re keeping a close eye on the virus In this case, the cattle are what is known as the intermediate host since the virus passed from birds to cattle and then to humans. It is also possible for humans to contract the virus directly from infected birds. Direct infection can occur if the virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth. It can also occur if the virus is inhaled or if a person touches a surface that has the virus on it and then touches their nose, mouth or eyes. However, such transmission is rare and is primarily to be a risk for people who have close and prolonged contact with infected birds and their environments. The individual who was infected in Colorado in 2022, for instance, had direct exposure to birds and to culling poultry. CNN: Can bird flu be transmitted from person to person? Wen: There have been instances of people infected with bird flu transmitting it to other human beings, but this is rare and sporadic. Most such cases have involved family members with prolonged close household exposure to a symptomatic person. There have also been a few cases of human-to-human transmission in hospital settings after unprotected exposure. This picture shows a Falkland Skua. Kneonlight/iStockphoto/Getty Images Related article Bird flu detected in Antarctic for the first time, British Antarctic Survey says With the current H5N1 spread among cattle and in poultry, “there is no sign of person-to-person spread of this virus at this time,” according to the CDC. CNN: What symptoms do infected people experience? Wen: Symptoms can range from mild, such as runny nose, sore throat, eye redness and headache, to severe disease-causing pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The person in Texas who was just diagnosed with H5N1 is reportedly only having conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as his only symptoms. The person in Colorado predominantly had fatigue. CNN: What treatments exist? Wen: There are a variety of antiviral drugs approved to treat influenza. These include forms that can be taken as pills by mouth. They reduce the likelihood of developing severe illness once someone is infected. Some antivirals are also approved for post-exposure prophylaxis, meaning that they are given to people who have not yet developed the illness but have had exposure to the virus. CNN: Is there a vaccine against the bird flu? Wen: There are vaccines that target H5N1, but they are not yet produced in large quantities and are not currently commercially available. The seasonal flu vaccine does not protect people against infection from the avian flu. However, the seasonal flu vaccine does reduce the risk of becoming ill with human and bird flu viruses at the same time, and is recommended for everyone 6 months and above, especially those who have exposure to birds. CNN: Is it safe to eat chicken and chicken eggs and to drink milk? Wen: It is safe to drink milk that has been pasteurized. The process of pasteurization kills bacteria and viruses, including any influenza viruses that may be present in the milk. Similarly, it is safe to eat poultry, including chicken and eggs, that have been properly handled and cooked. yipengge/iStockphoto/Getty Images Related article Egg prices are rising again. An outbreak of bird flu could make things worse CNN: Can my pet bird get bird flu? Wen: It’s possible, if your pet bird comes into contact with an infected animal. But if your bird is an indoor bird and has no contact with wild birds or other animals that are exposed to avian flu, your pet bird will not contract the virus. CNN: Are there specific preventive measures that people should take? Wen: The CDC has a list of measures that people can take. Most of them involve precautions to be undertaken by workers who are around poultry and people who have backyard bird flocks. They should use a few preventive steps, such as personal protective equipment when interacting with animals known to be or suspected to be infected with the avian flu. In general, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them at a distance, not up close. They should also avoid contact with birds that look sick or have died. They should avoid touching surfaces where there are likely to be bird droppings. When traveling, they should stay away from bird markets and poultry farms and avoid eating raw or undercooked poultry products.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health alert after the first case of H5N1 avian influenza, or bird flu, seemingly spread from a cow to a human. A farm worker in Texas contracted the virus amid an outbreak in dairy cattle. This is the second human case in the US; a poultry worker tested positive in Colorado in 2022. The virus strain identified in the Texan farm worker is not readily transmissible between humans and therefore not a pandemic threat. But it’s a significant development nonetheless. Some background on bird flu There are two types of avian influenza: highly pathogenic or low pathogenic, based on the level of disease the strain causes in birds. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza. H5N1 first emerged in 1997 in Hong Kong and then China in 2003, spreading through wild bird migration and poultry trading. It has caused periodic epidemics in poultry farms, with occasional human cases. Influenza A viruses such as H5N1 are further divided into variants, called clades. The unique variant causing the current epidemic is H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, which emerged in late 2020 and is now widespread globally, especially in the Americas. In the past, outbreaks could be controlled by culling of infected birds, and H5N1 would die down for a while. But this has become increasingly difficult due to escalating outbreaks since 2021. Read more: When should we worry about bird flu making us sick? When we see human-to-human transmission – and there's no evidence of that yet Wild animals are now in the mix Waterfowl (ducks, swans and geese) are the main global spreaders of avian flu, as they migrate across the world via specific routes that bypass Australia. The main hub for waterfowl to migrate around the world is Quinghai lake in China. But there’s been an increasing number of infected non-waterfowl birds, such as true thrushes and raptors, which use different flyways. Worryingly, the infection has spread to Antarctica too, which means Australia is now at risk from different bird species which fly here. H5N1 has escalated in an unprecedented fashion since 2021, and an increasing number of mammals including sea lions, goats, red foxes, coyotes, even domestic dogs and cats have become infected around the world. Wild animals like red foxes which live in peri-urban areas are a possible new route of spread to farms, domestic pets and humans. Dairy cows and goats have now become infected with H5N1 in at least 17 farms across seven US states. What are the symptoms? Globally, there have been 14 cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus in humans, and 889 H5N1 human cases overall since 2003. Previous human cases have presented with a severe respiratory illness, but H5N1 2.3.4.4b is causing illness affecting other organs too, like the brain, eyes and liver. For example, more recent cases have developed neurological complications including seizures, organ failure and stroke. It’s been estimated that around half of people infected with H5N1 will die. The case in the Texan farm worker appears to be mild. This person presented with conjunctivitis, which is unusual. Food safety Contact with sick poultry is a key risk factor for human infection. Likewise, the farm worker in Texas was likely in close contact with the infected cattle. The CDC advises pasteurised milk and well cooked eggs are safe. However, handling of infected meat or eggs in the process of cooking, or drinking unpasteurised milk, may pose a risk. Although there’s no H5N1 in Australian poultry or cattle, hygienic food practices are always a good idea, as raw milk or poorly cooked meat, eggs or poultry can be contaminated with microbes such as salmonella and E Coli. If it’s not a pandemic, why are we worried? Scientists have feared avian influenza may cause a pandemic since about 2005. Avian flu viruses don’t easily spread in humans. But if an avian virus mutates to spread in humans, it can cause a pandemic. One concern is if birds were to infect an animal like a pig, this acts as a genetic mixing vessel. In areas where humans and livestock exist in close proximity, for example farms, markets or even in homes with backyard poultry, the probability of bird and human flu strains mixing and mutating to cause a new pandemic strain is higher. There are a number of potential pathways to a pandemic caused by influenza. Author provided The cows infected in Texas were tested because farmers noticed they were producing less milk. If beef cattle are similarly affected, it may not be as easily identified, and the economic loss to farmers may be a disincentive to test or report infections. How can we prevent a pandemic? For now there is no spread of H5N1 between humans, so there’s no immediate risk of a pandemic. However, we now have unprecedented and persistent infection with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in farms, wild animals and a wider range of wild birds than ever before, creating more chances for H5N1 to mutate and cause a pandemic. Unlike the previous epidemiology of avian flu, where hot spots were in Asia, the new hot spots (and likely sites of emergence of a pandemic) are in the Americas, Europe or in Africa. Pandemics grow exponentially, so early warnings for animal and human outbreaks are crucial. We can monitor infections using surveillance tools such as our EPIWATCH platform. This map shows avian flu reports on EPIWATCH. EPIWATCH/author provided The earlier epidemics can be detected, the better the chance of stamping them out and rapidly developing vaccines. Although there is a vaccine for birds, it has been largely avoided until recently because it’s only partially effective and can mask outbreaks. But it’s no longer feasible to control an outbreak by culling infected birds, so some countries like France began vaccinating poultry in 2023. Read more: Migrating birds could bring lethal avian flu to Australia's vulnerable birds For humans, seasonal flu vaccines may provide a small amount of cross-protection, but for the best protection, vaccines need to be matched exactly to the pandemic strain, and this takes time. The 2009 flu pandemic started in May in Australia, but the vaccines were available in September, after the pandemic peak. To reduce the risk of a pandemic, we must identify how H5N1 is spreading to so many mammalian species, what new wild bird pathways pose a risk, and monitor for early signs of outbreaks and illness in animals, birds and humans. Economic compensation for farmers is also crucial to ensure we detect all outbreaks and avoid compromising the food supply.

It comes as officials say the risk to the public remains low.Fox - 26 HoustonThe South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources is reporting avian influenza, or bird flu, was detected in a South Dakota dairy cattle herd.DANR and the state Animal Industry Board, a board assigned to the state ag agency, announced Thursday the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed a positive detection of the virus in the herd April 9. This is the first confirmed case of bird flu in a dairy farm in South Dakota.Beth Thompson, South Dakota state veterinarian and head of the AIB, told the Argus Leader on Thursday positive samples were taken from more than one cow.Unlike avian influenza tracking within U.S. poultry, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a sub-agency of USDA, has not revealed which county the positive tests originated from."We're only going down as far as the state, mainly because we all want to protect the farmers and ranchers out there because there are fewer dairies that sit in some of these states," Thompson said. "This is going to be 'South Dakota 001.'"According to APHIS, dairy herds in eight states have tested positive for the virus. As of Thursday, this list includes one Idaho herd, three Kansas herds, two Michigan herds, five New Mexico herds, one North Carolina herd, one Ohio herd, one South Dakota herd and 10 Texas herds.Thompson said avian influenza has managed to afflict a number of other mammals, such as bears, seals and skunks, which points to its notorious ability to evolve and affect other species.South Dakota's poultry facilities have been hard-hit by the virus, which the USDA designates among meat and egg birds as highly pathogenic — near 100% death rates. Of the more than 82 million commercial birds culled due to avian influenza since February 2022, about 5.37 million of those birds were from South Dakota's turkey, egg laying and even some upland game farms.The spread of this strain of avian flu has been attributed to migratory wild birds, Thompson said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces."We've got birds flying over us right now, and it's hard to say where they're stopping and dropping off their contaminants," Thompson said. "It's concerning. Our dairies tend to be fairly open air."Still, Thompson found it "a little surprising" the virus has been discovered in cattle."There's all of this evidence from the last two years of what this virus can do," Thompson said. "We hope that this migratory season and whatever happened that some of this virus spilled over into cattle is a one-time event. But we can't say that for sure."Because cows have not been widely dying off from the disease, avian influenza in dairy cattle is not considered highly pathogenic, Thompson said.But the symptoms of the virus are still apparent, she added."The really big indicator is milk production drops completely," Thompson said. "Feed consumption goes down, and I think water consumption has also been going down too. Of course, if those two things go down, you get a little bit different manure consistency."There's also herd-wide impacts to consider. The state veterinarian said she's heard of affected dairies temporarily losing milk production from 10% to 12% of their milk cows."These cows allegedly go back into milk and they go back into the the producing part of the herd, but I don't know if they go back in producing the same amount of milk as they did before they were infected with the virus," Thompson said.More: Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread.Producers are encouraged to enforce their biosecurity plans such as limiting visitors, separating new animals and sick animals, and cleaning pens, equipment, vehicles, clothing, footwear, and hands, the release states.Dairies are required to ensure only milk from healthy animals enter the food supply chain. Additionally, anything labeled as "milk" must go through the pasteurization process, which includes heating the contents to a high temperature to kill harmful germs and pathogens.“South Dakota Dairy Producers encourages all dairy producers to closely monitor their herd and contact their herd veterinarian immediately if cattle appear symptomatic,” Marv Post, Chairman of South Dakota Dairy Producers, stated in DANR and AIB's joint Thursday press release. “USDA continues to emphasize that pasteurization kills the virus and that milk and dairy products are safe to consume.” Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Bovine Influenza A Virus Recommended as New Name for Recent Illness in Dairy Cows DTN.COM Contact DTN FAQs Resources Log in or Join our community P[T1] D[728x90] M[320x50] OOP[F] ADUNIT[] T[] Markets News News World & Policy Business & Inputs Farm Life World & Policy View World & Policy DTN Weekly Oil Update Oil Slides on US Dollar Strength, Chinese Demand Woes 11/11/2024 | 9:22 AM CST Oil futures closest to expiration on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Brent crude on the Intercontinental Exchange extended their decline...

(DTN/Progressive Farmer file photo by Chris Clayton) REDFIELD, Iowa (DTN) -- The American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) is recommending a new name for the illness that has been making dairy cows sick in several states: Bovine Influenza A Virus (BIAV). In a letter written by AABP's Executive Director Fred Gingrich and President Michael Capel, both veterinarians, they stated the illness seen recently in dairy cows should be called BIAV instead of how it has been called Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)or bird flu in cattle. "While the virus is the same, it has different symptoms in cattle and thus we want to be sure the name reflects this virus in cattle," Gingrich told DTN. The virus isolated from the affected dairy cows has been identified as avian influenza virus Type A H5N1. While this virus causes high morbidity and mortality in birds, it does not have the same effect on cattle. P[L1] D[0x0] M[300x250] OOP[F] ADUNIT[] T[] More Recommended for You Recommended for You The AABP doesn't believe that this illness should be referred to as "HPAI in cattle" or "bird flu in cattle" due to these differences. While for now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, APHIS, and other organizations are still referring to the illness officially as HPAI, AABP said it will refer to the disease as BIAV in all its messaging. AABP is encouraging other organizations, state animal health officials, diagnostic labs and state and federal agencies to use this name as well. The organization said this will make the messaging more consistent and better distinguish the disease syndrome in cattle from that observed in birds. The AABP explained it is important for the public to understand the difference between the avian flu in birds and the illness in cattle, and what is being done to help livestock. This helps maintain confidence in the safety and accessibility of dairy and beef products for consumers. Gingrich stressed the importance of good biosecurity measures on dairy farms to help slow or prevent any further spreading of the disease. He said the milk and meat supplies remain safe for consumers. The virus is killed with heat, thus why milk is safe due to the pasteurization process.

Hundreds of dead penguins were also found, although the presence of the virus in the bodies has not been confirmedScientists Antonio Alcamí and Begoña Aguado in the Weddell Sea in Antarctica.Antonio AlcamíManuel AnsedeApr 09, 2024 - 11:56CESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkThe lethal bird flu virus that has already killed hundreds of millions of birds around the world is spreading through Antarctica, according to a warning issued by an international expedition. Researchers aboard a vessel named the Australis traveled through the Weddell Sea for a month, collecting corpses of Antarctic skuas, migratory scavenging seabirds similar to seagulls. These were infected with influenza in four of the 10 areas that were analyzed. One of the researchers, Antonio Alcamí of Spain’s National Research Council (CSIC), explained by telephone that on Beak Island they witnessed “a massive outbreak” in a colony of skuas. “We saw 80 of them alive and 50 dead. That’s crazy,” warned the virologist, who works at the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center in Madrid.The finding adds to what already amounts to the worst avian flu crisis on record. A new subtype of the virus, called H5N1 2.3.4.4b, emerged in 2021 and has since led to the culling of hundreds of millions of farm birds and the deaths of millions of wild birds. The disease had spread across five continents and conservationists were holding their breath at the possibility that it might extend to Antarctica. On February 24, Alcamí and his colleague Ángela Vázquez confirmed the presence of the virus in Antarctica, in two dead skuas found by Argentine scientists and analyzed at the Spanish Antarctic base Gabriel de Castilla, on Deception Island.The 'Australis' facing a penguin breeding area that was analyzed for the virus. Antonio AlcamíAlcamí spent two months on a national mission and a month ago he joined an international expedition led by Australian scientist Meagan Dewar, of the SCAR Antarctic Wildlife Health Network. He and the biologist Begoña Aguado installed their diagnostic laboratory on the sailboat Australis in order to analyze the samples. “This had never been done before. We have shown that it can be done,” said Alcamí. The expedition, made up of 11 people, found skua carcasses in Hope Bay and on Devil’s and Paulet Islands, in addition to the 50 observed in the massive outbreak on Beak Island. Researchers tested 10 of the 50 samples and all of them were positive. Scientists from the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) also announced on March 14 that they had detected the virus in five skuas on Ross Island.The sailboat also explored Heroína Island, inhabited by a colony of Adélie penguins, which owe their name to Adèle Pépin, wife of the French explorer Jules Dumont d’Urville, who discovered these birds in 1840. The Alcamí and Aguado expedition found “a massive mortality” among these penguins. “We counted 500 bodies and stopped counting after that,” said the virologist, who estimates that there could be thousands of dead penguins. His team, however, did not immediately detect traces of the highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, despite analyzing the brains and lungs of the dead penguins.Hundreds of sea lions with H5N1 flu, either dead or dying, began to show up on the beaches of Peru in January 2023, triggering fears that the virus would learn to jump from mammal to mammal. That terrifying possibility has not come true, at least for now. The pathogen still jumps easily from bird to bird, but when it reaches a mammal it is usually a dead end. The epidemiologist Vijay Dhanasekaran, from the University of Hong Kong, explained to this newspaper in October that humans must nevertheless remain alert. “There is a perpetual threat of the virus jumping to humans. This is mainly due to the virus’ ability to evolve rapidly. It can acquire mutations that help it adhere better to the receptors of human cells, or it can acquire the ability to be transmitted by aerosols,” warned Dhanasekaran. Alcamí and Aguado have analyzed sea lions and elephant seals, without finding any positive cases.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Moving forward, CFA will improve, create, and continue to share our tools, so decision-makers can quickly respond to public health emergencies. Message from Dylan George, CFA Director Low Resolution Video Introduction The Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA or Center) is working to make infectious disease outbreak forecasting as routine as weather forecasting. This includes creating new capabilities to forecast the behavior of infectious disease outbreaks and share information with government and public health leaders at all levels, empowering people to save lives and protect communities from health threats. View LargerDownload CFA's vision and mission statements, along with the four goals. In 2023, CFA established four goals to guide the organization towards becoming a trusted, go-to source for information during disease outbreaks: PREDICT: Deliver actionable analysis and response-ready modeling tools. INFORM: Generate practical decision support products. INNOVATE: Drive technological and analytic innovation. ADVANCE: Build a world-class forecasting and outbreak analytics organization. These goals focus on establishing and sustaining new public health and national security capabilities. They also guide the establishment of early-warning and forecasting systems that will bolster the nation's ability to respond to infectious disease threats. This report provides an update on CFA's progress in implementing these goals—creating models, forecasts, and tools and driving the kind of technological and analytic innovation the nation needs for better public health response. Goal 1 - Predict CFA is improving the nation’s ability to predict the path of disease outbreaks by creating actionable forecasts and analyses to support public health preparedness and response. CFA is delivering analyses and response-ready modeling tools by: Building, testing, and improving open-source models and tools Collaborating with CDC programs to put models in routine practice Providing analyses for emergent responses Growing a seasonal influenza forecasting capability - In 2023, CFA began releasing bi-weekly national and state-level forecasts for seasonal influenza. Previously, the CDC relied on models created by researchers outside of the agency to do this. Now, CFA is providing internal capabilities for CDC to produce high-performing disease forecasts during outbreaks. View LargerDownload Reported and forecasted national influenza hospital admissions as of Dec 1, 2023 Estimating how fast pandemic-prone diseases are spreading – CFA worked with CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) to create the agency's first state-level disease growth estimates for COVID-19 and influenza. These models show public health decision-makers whether infections are increasing or decreasing, so they can plan and prepare healthcare systems for seasonal changes or surges in hospitalizations. View LargerDownload Example COVID-19 epidemic growth status, as of January 27, 2024 Improving the efficiency of CDC COVID-19 forecasting – CFA reconfigured COVID-19 ensemble forecasts, making them more robust, efficient, and adaptable. Now the modeling tools run ten times faster, automatically scan each input for quality and completeness, and can be accessed by multiple analysts at once. These improvements mean that CDC can get better, faster forecasts to public health leaders, so they can respond more quickly. New sources of data to create better forecasts - CFA is working to improve disease forecasting capability by incorporating new data sources into forecasting tools. For example, wastewater monitoring data has great potential to provide data on disease activity in near real-time. CFA is working to incorporate wastewater data into state-level COVID-19 forecasts, having shown that it makes them more accurate and robust. The new forecasts give public health leaders a clearer picture of possible surges in hospitalizations before they happen, so they can protect the public against respiratory diseases and strengthen infrastructure to save lives and prevent infections. View LargerDownload Comparison of COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts between baseline and wastewater informed models for Massachusetts, Oct-Dec 2022. Partnership in practice‎ CFA is collaborating across the CDC, working with the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) to co-lead the respiratory virus modeling task force. The team is providing best-in-class disease forecasts and crucial coordination to protect national public health. Goal 2 - Inform CFA is focused on developing, testing, and sharing decision support tools and tailored communication strategies for leaders during emergencies. CFA is generating practical decision support products by: Developing products with actionable insights for decision-makers Translating and disseminating CFA-developed analytics Establishing & maintaining collaborations to create and improve CFA products Fall and winter respiratory disease season outlook - CFA used data for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV to create CDC's first respiratory disease season outlook. The outlook predicted a similar number of total hospitalizations in the fall and winter of 2023 compared to the previous season. CFA developed the outlook to support public health decision-makers, empowering them with a model of the future that integrates multiple insights together. View LargerDownload Combined peak burden of COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV. Even moderate COVID-19 + Flu + RSV waves this season could cause more hospitalizations than a severe pre-pandemic season. Improved scientific communication - Disease modeling can be difficult to understand. In 2023, CFA launched online resources to explain how the Center uses data science to drive analytic work. Readers can learn about how CFA uses data and data science to make predictions. CFA will continue developing resources like this as new disease forecasting tools come online, covering topics like real-time disease modeling, and incorporating wastewater data into disease forecasting. Improved forecasting capability through partner engagement‎ CFA partnered with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to conduct a state and local public health needs assessment. The team conducted more than 25 listening sessions, focus groups, workshops, and regional meetings to understand what information public health leaders need to make decisions during outbreaks. Several new capabilities, such as state-level disease growth estimates, were previewed with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments, then adapted based on their feedback. This commitment to ongoing partnership engagement is improving the quality and utility of the Center's work. Goal 3 - Innovate CFA is collaborating across sectors to drive technological advances and broaden outbreak modeling, forecasting and analytic capabilities beyond anything the CDC has done before. CFA is driving technological and analytic innovation by: Transforming infectious disease forecasting, advanced analytics, and communication by engaging public, academic and private sector performers Advancing leading edge technology architecture for CFA and our partners Establishing technical specifications to support the flow of data and methods between CFA and collaborators First outbreak analytics and disease forecasting network - In 2023, CFA launched Insight Net, the first national network for outbreak and disease modeling, made up of private, public and academic partners. The network will expand the CDC's capacity to support state and local public health leaders to detect, respond to, and mitigate future public health emergencies. Comprised of 13 primary awardees and more than 100 total network participants, Insight Net spans 24 states and 35 public health departments. Many critical public health decisions are made at the state and local levels. The creation of Insight Net extends CFA's impact through a more comprehensive approach that reaches state and local levels. The impact of Insight Net goes far beyond the 13 awardees by leveraging connections with state, local, private, public, and academic partners to create a consortium of collaborators. The output of the network will be better forecasting data and analytics to share with public health decision-makers, especially at the state and local level. It will also empower the American public, so they can make informed decisions to protect their communities, families, and themselves during public health emergencies.

The Virtual Analyst Platform is a network of secure analytic workspaces, making it possible for modelers to connect data sources together and collaborate in real time. It is currently accessible within the federal government. In the next year, CFA plans to expand the platform by creating custom analytic products for state and local jurisdictions to support real-time code sharing and modeling at the state and local levels. Goal 4 - Advance CFA is in a transformative phase, building our team and diverse network of partnerships to make CFA a trusted, innovative leader in outbreak response. CFA is building a world-class forecasting and outbreak analytics organization by: Recruiting and growing a technically proficient and diverse workforce Fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, transparency, and trust Recruiting the right team to meet the mission - CFA is focused on recruiting and growing a technically skilled and diverse workforce by fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, transparency, and trust. CFA's unique topics create opportunities for data scientists, information technologists, health communicators, epidemiologists, and fellows. By the end of 2023, CFA has filled 59% of the Center's total positions. Thinking local, acting global – While CFA is laser focused on the mission to provide decision support at the state and local level, the Center is also partnering to support the emerging field of data-driven outbreak forecasting. In 2023, CFA joined the Public Health Agency of Canada, the UK Health Security Agency, the World Health Organization, and other international partners in sharing approaches for developing and using risk assessments and other forecasting tools. Prioritizing partnerships – CFA is building diverse partnerships across the public, academic and private sectors, to develop innovative approaches and access new science, technology, ideas, and resources. CFA co-sponsored an Industry Information and Collaboration Day to forge private sector partnerships. More than 1,600 participants listened, learned, and shared exciting ideas about the future of public health data. Looking ahead in 2024 CFA is working to build a national public health capacity for disease forecasting and advanced analytics. The Center is committed to becoming the trusted, go-to source for public health decision-makers. To get there, CFA is creating powerful tools, making them more widely available, and is building strong collaborations to drive innovation and support public health partners at all levels. In 2024, CFA will focus on integrating new data sources into modeling tools. The Center showed that adding wastewater data into COVID-19 forecasts made them more accurate and better at detecting possible surges. Now, CFA is thinking bigger – building a framework to combine more data streams and creating even more resilient models. These efforts will make the Center’s work more adaptable and holds promise to enhance the nation’s disease forecasting capability. CFA will continue a “public first approach”, sharing as much of the Center’s analytic work as possible for review and use by public health professionals, data scientists, and disease modelers, as quickly as possible. By building and moving CFA code into shared spaces, other disease modelers can immediately review, enhance, and use CFA’s work. CFA will also expand access to collaborators through the Virtual Analyst Platform, including modelers and data scientists outside of the federal government. In 2024, the platform will enable more real-time collaboration with key response partners. CFA will drive innovation by continuing to support Insight Net to develop, test, and implement new modeling and analytic tools to state and local public health partners. Through Insight Net, CFA is accelerating innovation to support US biosecurity and enhance national capabilities for outbreak response and preparedness. Better and more accessible data science tools can lead to a future where public health leaders can make informed, localized, and precise decisions to address the specific challenges faced by their community. CFA will continue to work towards our goals – predict, inform, innovate, and advance, to propel the nation towards a future where disease forecasting is as common as weather reporting. CFA and our partners are focused on a future where modeling, forecasting, and advanced analytics tools are at the ready for decision-makers and, indeed all Americans, before the next public health emergency.

Rules vary by state.Avian influenza has been confirmed in dairy cows in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas.Restrictions on moving healthy cattle and their products are not recommended unless justified by an import risk analysis, the World Organisation for Animal Health told its member nations April 5.Maryland's movement order is below. Download PDF Maryland Department of Agriculture Issues Order Restricting Movement of Dairy Cattle Into the State Maryland Farmers Encouraged to Continue Biosecurity Practices ANNAPOLIS, MD (April 10, 2024) - The Maryland Department of Agriculture today issued an order restricting movement of dairy cattle into Maryland from states with confirmed outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in their herds. Last week, USDA announced detections of HPAI in dairy cattle herds in several states including Texas, Kansas, Michigan, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina and New Mexico following increased illness and lower milk production rates among herds. USDA National Veterinary Laboratory Services confirmed the strain is H5N1, which has been circulating in the wild bird population for the last several years and appears to have been introduced to these herds by wild birds. Although there have been no detections of HPAI in cattle in Maryland, producers are reminded to practice strong biosecurity. Cattle owners should minimize animal movements and isolate sick cattle. New animals should be quarantined for a minimum of two weeks before introducing them to an established herd. Maryland Department of Agriculture Newsletter Success!

This strategy can be an important red flag that something is wrong; however, if one cell death response, called necroptosis, continues unchecked, it can cause life-threatening injury to lung tissue. Now, a team of researchers from multiple institutions has developed a compound capable of reversing the course of infection in mice by blocking necroptosis. The researchers say the compound not only fills a currently unmet need by addressing the most severe flu infections, but it could also work with other viruses that trigger severe respiratory symptoms. “While the worst of COVID-19 may be behind us, the credible expectation is that there will be another pandemic that’s going to happen and we need something that is going to protect the host independent of how the host is infected,” said co-corresponding author Alexei Degterev, associate professor of developmental, molecular and chemical biology at Tufts University School of Medicine. “This work highlights the possibility of achieving such a goal and renews interest in how cell death shapes infection.” In a paper published in Nature, the researchers showed that the drug UH15-38 protected mouse models from similar amounts of influenza that humans experience, even at low doses. Additionally, the team found that a high drug dose could fully protect against an infection with a substantial amount of virus, which would usually be deadly. “Infected lung cells create inflammation that alerts the immune system that there's a problem, but too much of it generates runaway inflammation that can cause major problems,” said co-corresponding author Paul Thomas, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions. “We need to strike a delicate balance between maintaining enough of these processes to get rid of the virus, but not so much that you're getting this runaway inflammation.” The scientists achieved this Goldilocks amount of inflammation using clever chemistry. UH15-38 inhibited one part of a major inflammation protein in immune cells—receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). RIPK3 controls two cell death pathways in response to infection: apoptosis and necroptosis. Necroptosis is highly inflammatory, but apoptosis is not. Both pathways are used in the antiviral response. UH15-38 was designed to prevent RIPK3 from starting necroptosis while maintaining its pro-apoptotic properties. “Knocking out RIPK3 entirely is not great because then the immune system can’t clear the virus,” Thomas said. “When we knocked out just necroptosis, the animals did better because they still had apoptosis and could still get rid of infected cells, but it wasn’t as inflammatory.” The researchers found that the mice were protected even if they received a dose days after infection, a difficult achievement for an influenza therapeutic. Typically, patients with severe disease have been infected for several days by the time they get to a doctor. The breakthrough results from understanding how influenza and the immune system interact to cause lung injury. The collaborators are now pursuing the second generation of inhibitors. They are also continuing to test how UH15-38 and related compounds can protect against other respiratory diseases. “Often the worst part of influenza illness happens after the virus is controlled when runaway inflammation destroys lung cells,” Thomas said. “UH15-38 can dampen that influenza-caused inflammation while leaving viral clearance and the other functions of the immune and tissue responses intact. That makes it a promising candidate to move forward toward the clinic.” Subscribe to our e-Newsletters Stay up to date with the latest news, articles, and products for the lab.

(USDA map) OMAHA (DTN) -- Confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at North Carolina and South Dakota dairy farms now bring the total to eight states and 24 farms where a dairy herd has contracted H5N1 avian influenza. State officials in at least four states -- North Carolina, Michigan, Idaho and Ohio -- have also said the infections in their states link back to their farms recently bringing in cows from Texas dairy herds. Steve Troxler, North Carolina's agriculture commissioner, issued a statement that the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) had detected HPAI in a North Carolina herd. "This is an evolving situation, and we are waiting for more diagnostics from NVSL and will work collaboratively with our federal partners and dairy farmers in North Carolina," Troxler said. "We have spent years developing methods to handle HPAI in poultry, but this is new and we are working with our state and federal partners to develop protocols to handle this situation. It is important to note the FDA has no concern about the safety or availability of pasteurized milk products nationwide." South Dakota officials stated the NVSL had detected HPAI in a dairy herd in that state as well. "South Dakota Dairy Producers encourages all dairy producers to closely monitor their herd and contact their herd veterinarian immediately if cattle appear symptomatic," said Marv Post, Chairman of South Dakota Dairy Producers. "USDA continues to emphasize that pasteurization kills the virus and that milk and dairy products are safe to consume." SOME STATES SAY LINKED TO TEXAS Following a question from DTN, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services stated the infected herd is linked back to a Texas dairy herd that also was infected with H5N1. State officials in Idaho, Michigan and Ohio also noted infected herds in their states had recently received dairy cattle from Texas dairy farms. A spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Agriculture told DTN, "Our infections did not come from sick cattle being shipped in from Texas." The virus was first detected in the Texas Panhandle. The impacted herds in New Mexico are located fairly close to the Texas-New Mexico state line, said Shelton Dodson, director of public affairs for the New Mexico Department of Agriculture. Kansas has reported infected herds, but officials have not confirmed how its cattle became infected. P[L1] D[0x0] M[300x250] OOP[F] ADUNIT[] T[] More Recommended for You Recommended for You Texas officials initially reported the cows showing symptoms "were primarily older dairy cows," but North Carolina officials stated the cows that tested positive there were younger cows. Beth Thompson, South Dakota's chief veterinarian, said in an email to DTN that the South Dakota Animal Industry Board is working with the affected dairy as part of its investigation to determine recent animal movements that may have occurred. "This work has just begun," she replied. TEXAS SITUATION In response to some questions from DTN, The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) on Friday responded that 11 dairy herds in the Texas Panhandle have confirmed cases of HPAI. The total number of cattle infected "is still being characterized as the epidemiologic assessment unfolds." The TAHC added, "Additionally, the TAHC cannot provide information related to results on individual dairies, to protect the privacy of the owners and their business." Impacted herds have reported older cows in mid-lactation to be more severely impacted than younger cows and fresh cows or heifers, the TAHC stated. "To the best of our knowledge, the Texas cattle (1st lactation heifers) shipped to NC (North Carolina) did not show clinical signs consistent with affected cattle." In terms of connecting the infections between states, the TAHC responded, "The TAHC, USDA, and other federal, state, university, and industry partners and subject matter experts are all actively working to collect and share epidemiology information, discuss diagnostic information updates, and work together to further characterize the full scope of the incident." CONFIRMED HERDS BY STATE USDA officials confirmed the infection of the North Carolina and South Dakota herds by updating a map. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service website shows 24 herds nationally have been infected since the first case began. USDA is not listing the number of cattle confirmed as ill. USDA also is not listing the number of cattle confirmed as ill. The first cases of HPAI in cattle were confirmed March 25 by USDA, though Texas officials indicated cows at a pair of dairy farms were showing signs of illness earlier in the month. Several other states also have banned or restricted the movement of dairy cattle. North Carolina and Tennessee suspended movement of cattle from affected herds in other states. Nebraska issued a restriction requiring a temporary permit for all breeding female dairy cattle from other states. MILD SYMPTOMS OF ILLNESS According to USDA, dairy cattle so far that have been infected with the virus have shown mild symptoms and recovered. South Dakota officials noted symptoms are mostly restricted to late-stage lactating cows and include a drop in milk production, loss of appetite, and changes in manure consistency. Producers are encouraged to enforce their biosecurity plans such as limiting visitors, separating new animals and sick animals, and cleaning pens, equipment, vehicles, clothing, footwear, and hands. At least one person in Texas who worked on a dairy farm also was confirmed to have contracted H5N1 after showing signs of conjunctivitis. NO IMPACT ON FOOD SUPPLY Officials stress that HPAI infections in dairy herds do not impact the food supply. Dairies are required to ensure only milk from healthy animals enters the food supply chain. Additionally, the pasteurization process of heating milk to a high temperature ensures milk and dairy products can be safely consumed, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or risk to consumer health. In line with long-standing policy, the CDC does not recommend consuming unpasteurized milk or raw milk. Pasteurization has continually proven to successfully inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk.

The person’s primary symptom has been conjunctivitis and is being treated with an antiviral. The person was told to isolate while in recovery. As of today, there is just 1 isolated case in Texas.It remains unclear as to how the Texas case happened. Richard Webby, PhD, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds and Department of Host-Microbe Interactions, Division of Virology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, says that if you make the assumption there were sick birds nearby, somehow cows got infected and then likely passed the virus along to the person in Texas.Overall these are wild, migratory birds that might be traveling great distances and could be infected from hosts thousands of miles away.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the general public should avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cattle), as well as with animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infection.3,4People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk, or products made from raw milk such as cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infection.Webby has been involved in research around avian influenza ecology, influenza vaccination, and influenza virus pathogenicity. He explains transmission is a 2-step process where it goes first from birds to humans, and then from human to human. It is the latter that is the more serious, concerning threat.“When we think about this from a virus perspective, there does seem to be 2 different barriers to this virus, getting into humans—that’s first,” Webby stated. “So, bird to human is a little bit lower [transmission] than that second, which is the human-to-human transmission. But now, that's why we get a little bit worried when we see mammals infected with this virus…In that environment, that's where we think the virus is going to get the most chances to make the changes, it needs to successfully go human to human.”And when the jump goes from zoonotic then to human-to-human transmission there are mutations involved in the virus possibly making it more transmissible and vulnerable to a pandemic scenario, says Webby.Colorized transmission electron micrograph of Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses (seen in gold) grown in MDCK cells (seen in green).Photo Credit: Cynthia Goldsmith Content Providers: CDC/ Courtesy of Cynthia Goldsmith; Jacqueline Katz; Sherif R. ZakiVaccines and TreatmentHe notes some H5N1 vaccines are being stockpiled by the US government in case of a human outbreak.“The absolute use of those would be detailed in pandemic plans, but you can imagine if this virus started to go human-to-human, I think the first line responders and healthcare workers might be first in line to receive this,” Webby said. “I mean, if this virus continues to circulate in cows, maybe you can make an argument for people in close contact with those infected herds as well. But I think that's a little less likely. The risk is still very low.”“We [have] got to put all of this into a little bit of perspective. We are seeing a lot of activity of this particular virus in animal populations, but it is still low risk to humans.”And for those who do become infected with H5N1, some of the existing influenza therapies including oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) are efficacious against the virus, explains Webby.He says timing is important as an earlier intervention will help with optimal outcomes and the quicker alleviation of symptoms.“I think the most important message is anyone who thinks perhaps, ‘I've been exposed to this virus, and I started to come down with symptoms,’ whether that be respiratory symptoms, or maybe with this virus, even conjunctivitis, go and see a doctor really early on because that's the best chance you've got for those medications to actually work.”References1.

Please also consider subscribing to WIREDLast Friday, a health alert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pinged its way across the inboxes of clinicians and state health departments all over the US. The message described how a dairy farm worker in Texas had contracted H5N1, the highly infectious strain of avian influenza, or bird flu, that’s currently circling worldwide. The dairy worker had caught the virus, apparently, from cattle.The CDC’s alert urged doctors to be vigilant and consider H5N1 a possibility in any patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms or sore eyes who had recently been in contact with animals.Around the world, virologists responded to the news with varying degrees of alarm. While this is the second confirmed human case of H5N1 infection in the US in the past two years—in 2022, a worker at a poultry farm in Colorado contracted it from infected birds—it appears to be the first known case of the virus jumping from another mammal to humans.According to Raina MacIntyre, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute in Sydney, the biggest concern is that as the virus adapts more and more to mammalian species, it will gain mutations that make it better equipped to spread between humans. So far, the public health threat from H5N1 has been minimal because it cannot easily enter the cells of the human nose and mouth, though when the virus does infect people, it can be deadly.“The virus is not one that can transmit easily between humans,” says MacIntyre. “The key event that could result in a human pandemic is a mutation that switched the affinity of the virus to certain receptors in the human respiratory tract.”H5N1 is not a new virus. It was first detected in chickens in Scotland way back in 1959, and between January 2003 and December 2023, 882 human cases were reported across 23 countries, with a case fatality rate of 52 percent. The subtype that infected the Texan farm worker, known as 2.3.4.4b, has been spreading in the wild on an unprecedented scale over the past four years. Reports suggest that it has killed hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds since 2020, while at least 48 mammal species across 26 countries have also perished from the virus. This strain of H5N1 has already spread so far and wide that it has even reached Antarctica and infected species ranging from foxes to polar bears.Most PopularSecurityThe AI Machine Gun of the Future Is Already HereBy Jared KellerCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezScienceThe Incredible Power of Quantum MemoryBy Lakshmi ChandrasekaranMacIntyre describes the spiraling infections in animals as being “unprecedented” and says that urgent surveillance is needed to monitor whether H5N1 begins spreading between pigs or ferrets, animals which have a similar receptor profile to humans.“I have been following H5N1 since 1997, and the current situation is extremely worrying,” MacIntyre says. “In the past, H5N1 epidemics in birds were sporadic and would die down after culling of infected poultry. Since 2021 the pattern has changed, and it has not gone away but steadily increased.” In this time, many new mammalian species have been infected. “Some may be suitable genetic mixing vessels to create a human pandemic strain,” she says.In recent weeks, health officials in the US have detected the presence of H5N1 in cows from 16 herds across six states, the biggest known outbreak in cattle. Research currently suggests, however, that the viral load is greatest in the animals’ milk, hinting that H5N1 may be spreading through contaminated equipment, such as milking machines, rather than through the air, a transmission pathway which would be harder to stop.“I don’t think we need to panic; I think we just need to be alert,” says Nadav Davidovitz, an epidemiologist and public health expert at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. “We need to invest in more routine animal surveillance and create a system of sharing data about this virus. But one of the problems is that there’s a lot of pandemic fatigue.”If there is a human outbreak, MacIntyre says, the public health systems around the world are much better prepared to cope compared with a more novel virus, like SARS-CoV-2 was when it emerged. This is because influenza has been subject to decades of intensive research. The World Health Organization has a list of potential candidate vaccines for various subtypes of H5N1 that could be mass produced at short notice. The CDC has revealed that the strain isolated in the Texan farm worker is closely related to two H5N1 strains that can be targeted by existing vaccine candidates.“The last human influenza pandemic was in 2009, and vaccines were available six months after the first cases,” says MacIntyre. “We now have many new vaccine technologies that can be made faster. We also have antivirals which work against all flu strains and do not need to be matched. Getting your seasonal flu shot can also confer a small amount of cross-protection.”Most PopularSecurityThe AI Machine Gun of the Future Is Already HereBy Jared KellerCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezScienceThe Incredible Power of Quantum MemoryBy Lakshmi ChandrasekaranOther researchers point out that H5N1 remains a virus that is best adapted to birds, and the isolated infections of farm workers do not suggest that it will suddenly acquire the ability to spread rapidly between humans or even cows. “The virus sequence data still shows that the virus is an avian virus, so the likelihood of it persisting [long-term] in cattle will be low,” says Munir Iqbal, who leads an avian influenza research group at the Pirbright Institute in the UK.Instead, a more pressing concern may be the impact H5N1 is already having on food security. Maurice Pitesky, a researcher at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told WIRED that in the past week, two of the biggest commercial poultry facilities in the US have reported an H5N1 outbreak, resulting in the euthanasia of nearly 4 million laying hens. Last year, similar outbreaks cost the US government half a billion dollars in compensation payouts to poultry producers and caused a surge in the price of eggs.“The impact on commercial poultry from a welfare, economic, and food security perspective is unprecedented,” says Pitesky. “We can’t seem to get this under control, and we’re kind of teetering a little in terms of how far this could potentially propagate and continue to spread in farm animals throughout the world.”As a recent example of what may ensue, Pitesky points to the repeated African swine fever outbreaks across various Asian countries in the past decade, which decimated the pig farming industry to the extent that pork was briefly usurped by poultry as the most widely consumed animal protein on the planet. Pitesky argues, however, that the current model of governments heavily compensating farmers for their livestock losses in the wake of a viral outbreak is financially unsustainable, and more investment needs to be diverted toward AI-driven technologies that can prevent these infections in the first place.“I work on predictive models, using a combination of weather radar, satellite imagery, and machine learning, to understand how waterfowl behavior around different farms is changing,” says Pitesky. “We can use this information to understand which of the 50,000 to 60,000 commercial poultry facilities in the US are at most risk, and form strategies to protect all the birds in those facilities.”Most PopularSecurityThe AI Machine Gun of the Future Is Already HereBy Jared KellerCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezScienceThe Incredible Power of Quantum MemoryBy Lakshmi ChandrasekaranTechnology may ultimately offer a path toward eliminating the virus in commercial poultry. In October, a team of researchers in the UK published a study in the journal Nature Communications demonstrating that it is possible to use the gene-editing tool Crispr to make chickens resistant to avian influenza. This was done through editing genes that make the proteins ANP32A, ANP32B, and ANP32E in chickens, which the virus uses to gain access to chicken cells.Crispr has been shown to be capable of making livestock resistant to other infections such as the cancer-causing viral disease avian leukosis and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, which is responsible for widespread economic losses in pig farms.“The currently available methods are the use of strict farm biosecurity, poultry vaccinations in some countries, and massive depopulation of infected or exposed chicken flocks,” says Alewo Idoko-Akoh at the University of Bristol, the lead researcher on the Nature Communications study. “These methods have been partially successful but have so far failed to stop recurrent bird flu outbreaks around the world. Gene editing of chickens to introduce disease resistance should be considered as an additional tool for preventing or limiting the spread of bird flu.”Pitesky described the paper as “really interesting” but pointed out that it would require widespread public acceptance toward consuming gene-edited chicken for it to become commercially viable. “I think that those technological solutions have a lot of potential, but the issue more than anything, especially in the United States, is sentiment toward chickens that have been genetically modified,” he says.For now, Iqbal says that the best chance of keeping avian influenza under control is more active surveillance efforts in animal populations around the world, to understand how and where the H5N1 is spreading.“The surveillance system has been improved, and any infection that appears unusual is thoroughly investigated,” he says of the situation in the US. “This has helped to identify unusual outbreaks, such as infections in goats and cattle.” However, he says, much more work is needed to detect the virus in animals that don’t show signs of disease.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every dayMeet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scamsDeep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

It's proven effective in mice even days after infection. If you’ve ever caught the flu, you’ve more than likely been infected with the Influenza A virus (IAV). Compared to the Influenza B virus, infection with the A type often produces more severe symptoms. But, while many of us have experienced the fever and chills, headache and muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat and cough of a run-of-the-mill flu, severe infection with IAV is a different, potentially life-threatening beast.Severe IAV infection triggers a specific type of cell death, necroptosis, in infected cells. While it’s a natural process designed to limit viral spread by actively eliminating infected cells and mobilizing the immune system to respond, necroptosis can activate a hyper-inflammatory response, causing collateral lung damage that’s potentially lethal. Other than managing its symptoms, few therapeutic options are available to treat severe flu.In a new study, researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine, St Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, University of Houston, and Fox Chase Cancer Center worked together to test a drug named UH15-38 that prevented this flu-related lung injury in mice while still allowing the immune system to fight the virus.“Our drug significantly increased survival and lowered symptoms of influenza virus infection,” said Paul Thomas, co-corresponding author and St Jude’s Host-Microbe Interactions faculty member. “It dampened dangerous inflammation and even seemed to improve the adaptive response against the virus.” A colorized transmission electron micrograph (TEM) image of an influenza virus particle, or 'virion'CDC/Erskine Palmer, ML Martin Achieving the drug’s ‘Goldilocks effect’ on inflammation required the researchers to employ some clever chemistry combined with a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underpinning necroptosis.Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is an essential part of the necroptotic cell death pathway but also controls another cell death pathway: apoptosis. Both types of cell death produce opposing immune responses. Apoptotic death usually leads to immunologically silent responses, whereas necroptosis releases molecules that promote inflammation. UH15-38 was designed to prevent RIPK3 from triggering the necroptotic pathway – and, therefore, runaway inflammation – while still allowing apoptotic cell death, removing infected cells in a less inflammatory way.“If you remove necroptosis, you still get restriction of the viral replication without causing the massive damage to the lungs,” said Alexei Degterev, associate professor of developmental, molecular and chemical biology at Tufts University School of Medicine and co-corresponding author of the study. “Necroptosis does not appear to be necessary for restricting a viral activity, so if we can block it, we will be able to protect the host by reducing inflammation in the lungs.”The researchers tested UH15-38 on mouse models and found that a high dose of the drug protected against a dose of IAV that would ordinarily be fatal. And, at low doses, UH15-38 protected the mice from similar amounts of influenza that humans experience. Notably, the mice were protected even if they received the drug days after infection with IAV.“This drug can … do something we’ve never seen before,” Thomas said. “We’re able to start five days after the initial infection and show that we’re still providing some benefit. Knocking out RIPK3 entirely is not great because then the immune system can’t clear the virus. When we knocked out just necroptosis, the animals did better because they still had apoptosis and could still get rid of infected cells, but it wasn’t as inflammatory.” When the lung's air sacs (alveoli) are damaged, it impedes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxideDepositphotos UH15-38 improved survivability by preventing necroptosis’ collateral damage to type 1 alveolar epithelial cells, a specific cell type in the lungs that facilitates gas exchange. Damage to these cells can make it difficult to get oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of it, producing symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing and chest tightness. The drug also reduced the number of inflammation-related immune cells, such as neutrophils, in the mice.“Often, the worst part of influenza illness happens after the virus is controlled when runaway inflammation destroys lung cells,” said Thomas. “UH15-38 can dampen that influenza-caused inflammation while leaving viral clearance and the other functions of the immune and tissue responses intact. That makes it a promising candidate to move forward toward the clinic.”Safely tolerated by the mice, the next step is further preclinical and human trials of UH15-38. The researchers are testing whether UH15-38 is effective in treating other respiratory diseases while working on the second generation of RIPK3 inhibitors. Tufts University’s Office for Tech Transfer and Industry Collaboration is managing the commercialization of UH15-38.“While the worst of COVID-19 may be behind us, the credible expectation is that there will be another pandemic that’s going to happen, and we need something that is going to protect the host independent of how the host is infected,” said Degterev. “This work highlights the possibility of achieving such a goal and renews interest in how cell death shapes infections.”The study was published in the journal Nature.Sources: Tufts University School of Medicine, St Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital via EurekAlert!

Newsroom Bird Flu Blog MDA Blog Pending Regulations for Public Comments Press Releases MDA Public Meetings Calendar Bird Flu Blog Updates About High Path Avian Influenza in Maryland Click here for background information about HPAI. Follow #HPAI on Twitter @MdBirdFlu April 10, 2024 Maryland Department of Agriculture Issues Order Restricting Movement of Dairy Cattle Into the State Maryland Farmers Encouraged to Continue Biosecurity Practices ANNAPOLIS, MD (April 10, 2024) – The Maryland Department of Agriculture today issued an order restricting movement of dairy cattle into Maryland from states with confirmed outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in their herds. Last week, USDA announced detections of HPAI in dairy cattle herds in several states including Texas, Kansas, Michigan, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina and New Mexico following increased illness and lower milk production rates among herds. USDA National Veterinary Laboratory Services confirmed the strain is H5N1, which has been circulating in the wild bird population for the last several years and appears to have been introduced to these herds by wild birds. Although there have been no detections of HPAI in cattle in Maryland, producers are reminded to practice strong biosecurity. Cattle owners should minimize animal movements and isolate sick cattle. New animals should be quarantined for a minimum of two weeks before introducing them to an established herd. “Maryland is home to a robust dairy and cattle genetics industry. The Maryland Department of Agriculture, in collaboration with state and federal partners, is actively monitoring and responding to this situation,” said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks. “This order acts as another layer of protection for our Maryland farmers and ag industry partners.” In addition to the confirmed detections in dairy herds, on April 1 a case of HPAI in a human was reported in Texas and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This isolated case does not alter the overall human health risk assessment for H5N1 bird flu in the United States, as the CDC considers the risk to the general public to be low. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated there is no concern about the safety of the milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health because products are pasteurized before entering the market. Additionally, dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. If milk from cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to those infected with avian influenza is intended to be used to feed calves or other animals, the FDA strongly encourages that it be pasteurized or otherwise heat treated to kill harmful bacteria or viruses, such as influenza, before calf feeding. Avian influenza, commonly referred to as “bird flu,” is a respiratory illness caused by an Influenza A virus in birds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that the risk of transmission of avian influenza between birds or cattle and the general public remains low. To prevent the spread of avian influenza, the Maryland Department of Agriculture advises poultry and livestock owners to adopt the following biosecurity measures: 1. Make biosecurity a daily practice to safeguard your agricultural animals. 2. Stay vigilant for signs of illness and be familiar with the symptoms of infectious diseases. 3. Report any suspected agricultural animals to the Maryland Department of Agriculture by calling 410-841-5810. 4. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can seek guidance by emailing their questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.

State Department of Agriculture officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system. Confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days. “The latest non-negative result should serve as a reminder for all poultry growers, operators, and backyard flock owners to remain vigilant when it comes to the threat of HPAI, especially as the spring migratory season begins,” said Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks. “Regardless of flock size, biosecurity remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of this disease among poultry.” Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors. According to the Maryland Department of Health, the risk of transmission between birds and the general public is low. The Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends the following common-sense biosecurity steps if HPAI is suspected on personal property, wild birds, or in a commercial operation. Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases. Report suspected sick birds: To report a possible case of HPAI call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov. Key biosecurity practices: Clean and disinfect transportation. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wild fowl such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station. Remove loose feed. Don’t give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch. Remove spilled or uneaten feed right away, and make sure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI. Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles. Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt. Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean. Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds, and shower and/or change clothes when leaving the facility. Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment—including egg flats and cases that have come in contact with birds or their droppings—to exit the property, make sure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected—such as cardboard egg flats.

Following an investigation by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from a Washington County farm has tested positive for HPAI. State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds or poultry products from affected flocks will not enter the food supply chain. “Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle. All poultry growers, operators, and owners, including those who manage backyard flocks, must remain vigilant,” said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Joe Bartenfelder. “MDA, USDA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address and localize the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks.” Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chicken, and turkey, along with some wild bird species such as duck, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.

(May 11, 2022)—Federal laboratory testing confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in samples taken from black vultures initially found sick and dead on April 22 in Harford County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Maryland Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MDA, DNR) and the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed samples submitted from the dead birds tested positive for HPAI. These detections mark the Delmarva region’s first confirmation of HPAI in wild birds since February 17, when the virus was found through wildlife surveillance in a Canada goose in Kent County, Delaware. HPAI is known to be carried by wild birds, especially waterfowl, raptors, and vultures. Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. As scavengers, vultures will feed on dead wildlife, including other wild birds. If they ingest the virus, they can get sick and die. It is believed the vultures contracted the virus from eating infected migratory bird species. Even with the ongoing detections of HPAI in poultry and wild birds in the United States, continuing testing of people in close contact with infected poultry indicates a low risk to the general public’s health. This H5N1 virus has not shown an ability to infect and be transmitted between people. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill viruses or bacteria. Since the initial detection in Harford County, more than 100 black vultures have died from the disease. A total count cannot be confirmed because wild birds often get sick and die where people cannot see them. Black vultures are also known to fly long distances, which means infected vultures may die in other locations and transmit the virus to other birds, including poultry. Six farms on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and Delaware were identified as impacted by HPAI between February 23 and March 18, 2022. With the first confirmation in a commercial poultry farm, a state-federal response was initiated between the Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA), MDA, and USDA. Considering the ongoing detections in the black vulture population, all poultry owners need to continue with increased vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza. Follow these steps to help manage wildlife and keep avian influenza off your farm: Cover waste. Keep mortality and compost piles covered at all times. The recommendation is one part mortalities to two parts litter, with birds in layers no more than 5 inches deep and not placed next to sidewalls. Cover mortalities daily with litter. If vultures are still an issue, cover the bins with netting or a screen. Remove standing water adjacent to poultry houses. Grade property to avoid pooling water. Fill or grade areas where water stands for more than 48 hours after heavy rainfall. Don’t walk or move equipment through or near standing water – this could track wildlife fecal matter or other contaminants with the virus into your barns. Never use untreated surface water for watering birds, cleaning poultry barns, or other facilities. Manage ponds and basins on poultry farms. Prune or remove plants from banks of artificial water structures. Use wire grids, predator decoys, and scare devices to keep waterfowl away. Use fencing to separate natural ponds from the active area around barns. Secure buildings. Regularly check and repair damaged screens on windows and doors and holes in barn walls. Install netting or screens and use repellent gel or bird spikes to deter perching. Wash away or remove old nests before each nesting season. It is unlawful to remove nests with eggs or young birds in them. Reduce food sources. Don’t feed wildlife. Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI. Use decoys. Install decoys and scare devices and move them often so wildlife doesn’t get used to them. If you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock: Commercial poultry producers should contact the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease. Backyard flock owners who notice any signs of HPAI in their flock should contact: In Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at poultry.health@delaware.gov or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns. In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to Birdflu@maryland.gov. If you see sick or dead wild birds, do not handle or move them. Report any sick wild birds. For assistance in Maryland, call toll-free 1-877-463-6497.

Following an investigation by the Delaware and Maryland Departments of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from these farms have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI). These avian influenza findings follow previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County, Delaware, and Cecil County, Maryland. Following these cases, federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system. Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors. Considering these new cases and the prevalence of the virus in the wild bird population, all poultry owners need to increase their vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza. Key biosecurity practices: Clean and disinfect vehicles. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock.

Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. When handling birds, visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear. Shower out and change clothes when leaving the facility. Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment (e.g., egg flats and cases) that have come in contact with birds or their droppings to exit the property, ensure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected, such as cardboard egg flats. Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases. If You Have Sick Poultry or Experience Increased Mortality in Your Flock: Commercial poultry producers should follow the procedures of contacting the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease. Backyard flock owners who notice any of the signs of HPAI in their flock should contact: In Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at health@delaware.gov or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns. In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to Birdflu@maryland.gov. Additional Information: For all media requests about HPAI, email: JIC@delaware.gov Due to biosecurity concerns, no on-site interviews, photos, or videos are allowed.

Following an investigation by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed a Cecil County sample tested positive for HPAI. The Maryland case comes one week after a HPAI positive in Delaware. Following the Delaware case, Maryland and its federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. To prevent the spread of the virus, depopulation of the affected birds has begun in Cecil County; nothing from the facility will enter the supply chain. The index farm is under a strict quarantine; only authorized personnel will be allowed on the premise. “Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle. All poultry growers, operators, and owners, including those who manage backyard flocks, must remain vigilant,” said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Joe Bartenfelder. “MDA, USDA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address and localize the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks.” Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors. It has appeared sporadically over the last several decades in bird populations throughout the globe. Wild birds can carry the virus without becoming sick, while domesticated birds can become very sick. HPAI is not a public health concern. Maryland growers should take the following precautions to protect their flocks: Restrict access to poultry by posting “Restricted Access” signage, securing the area with a locked gate, or both. Ensure that contaminated materials on the ground are not transported into the poultry growing house or area. Provide the following items to anyone entering or leaving any area where poultry are kept: Footbaths and foot mats with disinfectant; Boot washing and disinfectant station; and Footwear change or foot covers. Cover and secure feed to prevent wild birds, rodents, or other animals from accessing it. Cover and properly contain used litter, or other disease-containing organic materials to prevent wild birds, rodents, or other animals from accessing them, and keep them from being blown around by the wind. Allow MDA to enter the premises during normal working hours to inspect your biosecurity and sanitation practices. Maintain a log of those who access egg and poultry houses. Report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810 or 410-841-5971. Also contact the USDA at 866-536-7593. Read up about HPAI and biosecurity measures on the MDA website. Commercial chicken growers, backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov. In addition, the USDA’s Defend the Flock website has information on ways to help mitigate the risk of avian influenza, including instructional videos, additional biosecurity measures, and photos that show the signs of illness.

It is critical that everyone takes proper steps to isolate their birds and wild waterfowl migrating along the Atlantic flyway.” During this time of year, migratory waterfowl moving through Maryland present a heightened risk for HPAI, which is a potentially devastating disease for poultry operations. HPAI is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quails, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. Growers are urged to follow these minimum guidelines to maintain a sanitary, biosecure premise: Restrict access to poultry by posting “Restricted Access” signage, securing the area with a gate, or both. Take steps to ensure that contaminated materials on the ground are not transported into the poultry growing house or area. Provide the following items to anyone entering or leaving any area where poultry are kept: Footbaths and foot mats with disinfectant; Boot washing and disinfectant station; Footwear change or foot covers. Cover and secure feed to prevent wild birds, rodents or other animals from accessing it. Cover and properly contain carcasses, used litter, or other disease-containing organic materials to prevent wild birds, rodents or other animals from accessing them and to keep them from being blown around by wind. Allow MDA to enter the premises during normal working hours to inspect your biosecurity and sanitation practices. Report any unusual bird deaths or sudden increases in very sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810 or after-hours to 410-841-5971. Also contact the USDA at 866-536-7593. Read up about HPAI and biosecurity measures on the MDA website. USDA APHIS’ website for its Defend the Flock program has many valuable resources available for poultry owners, including a variety of instructional videos, to help mitigate the risk of HPAI on their operation.

Additional testing from the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed negative test results for the suspect flock and screening of nearby farms were also all negative. Out of an abundance of caution following the inconclusive result, the decision was made to depopulate the suspect flock. Avian influenza is not a food safety or human health concern, but it is a very serious issue for the poultry business because of its impact on bird health. “We are all relieved by the negative test result, and I am proud of the rapid and collaborative response to this event,” said Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Joe Bartenfelder. “This has demonstrated that our department is prepared to work with federal, state and industry partners to protect the chicken industry, which is a vital part of Delmarva’s economy.” For more information on avian influenza, visit Maryland Department of Agriculture’s website. # # # Follow Maryland Department of Agriculture on Twitter @MdAgDept January 9, 2017 State Agriculture Department Renews High Path Avian Influenza Emergency Orders Poultry Entering State Must be Tested or Certified Healthy, Poultry Flocks Must Maintain Biosecurity ANNAPOLIS, MD – The Maryland Secretary of Agriculture has extended Emergency Orders to prevent High Path Avian Influenza from infecting Maryland poultry flocks.

Russo explained why on April 5, while speaking during the webinar, “Managing Novel Disease Introduction and Biosecuity Practices to Protect Herd Health.”“In my opinion, the disease in cattle at this point should not be referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza,” said Russo. “I believe it can no longer be considered highly pathogenic avian influenza, given its low mortality, and the fact that it was isolated from a bovine source. It should simply be referred to as either H5N1, or perhaps low pathogenic bovine influenza, at this point in time.”As the technical services manager, dairy and poultry for Novonesis, Russo has animal health expertise with both species, but she pointed out that the opinions shared by her during the webinar were hers and didn’t necessarily reflect those of Novonesis.Highly pathogenic versus low pathogenicPathogenicity is defined by what a specific virus does to the animals it infects, Russo explained. This is also referred to as the virus “pathotype”.When it comes to H5N1 in birds, there are both highly pathogenic strains and low pathogenic strains.She showed a picture of poults that had been infected with a low pathogenic strain. Russo pointed out that the birds in the picture were still “up and around” and some were “puffed out a little bit.” One bird, with its mouth open, may have been experiencing some respiratory distress.“They’re probably not feeling the best, but by and large, they’re still standing there and they’re looking at you,” she said.Then she showed a picture of a turkey house that had been infected with a highly pathogenic strain, and birds in that picture exhibited high mortality levels.In poultry, with low pathogenic strains, the virus is really restricted to the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract, Russo said. The viral proteins in a low pathogenic strain in poultry are cleaved by enzymes primarily in the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract, restricting infection to those sites. However, with highly pathogenic variants, the viral proteins are cleaved by enzymes throughout the body, allowing the virus to infect cells in multiple organ systems, which ultimately causes systemic disease and can be fatal.Based on those definitions, the bovine cases of H5N1 would more accurately be defined as a low pathogenic pathotype.While it may be the case that up to 10% of the cattle in the herds are being infected, the affected cattle are not showing significant mortality, she said.Pathogenicity varies by speciesEvery time influenza infects a new host, it can mutate. If allowed to infect new hosts freely, virus mutations may eventually render it more pathogenic to cattle. This has been seen previously with low pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks that were less intensively controlled. This is why it will be essential to manage the susceptible populations in the herds to reduce viral cycling and mutation. Russo cautions that while this strain may be classified as low pathogenic in cattle, it is still highly pathogenic in poultry. Because of this, she urges all dairy producers to be considerate of poultry producers. “When considering moving cattle and the shedding of the virus, we need to keep our neighbors in mind. We need to allow them to keep their flocks safe, too,” she said. “The poultry people and the cattle people need to come to the same table and decide how to navigate this going forward.”View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

(DTN/Progressive Farmer file photo by Jennifer Carrico) REDFIELD, Iowa (DTN) -- As the influenza virus is found in more dairy herds in several states, veterinarians and researchers continue to find out more about the illness. So far, no cows have died, but the virus already has caused about 20% income loss in affected operations. "I hate to compare this to COVID, but as we find out new things every day, I feel like it's the same thing we heard during the pandemic," said Fred Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. "We are finding out new things daily about this virus and how it's affecting infected dairy cows. We didn't know anything about this until now." Gingrich said influenza in animals is treated the same as it is in people, with supportive care. There's no real treatment since it is a virus. Instead, cows are given extra fluids, offered proper nutrition, and given anti-inflammatory medicines if a secondary infection is found such as mastitis or pneumonia. "I think the poultry people would really prefer we don't call it 'highly pathogenic avian influenza' because HPAI is killing a lot of birds, and what we are seeing in dairy cows is not doing this," Gingrich said. "These cows are positive for influenza A, which is what they are being tested for." Affected dairy cows are reported as being off feed, which is likely the first indication of sickness. Their milk is thick, and thus, they are getting pulled from the milking herd and usually tested first for mastitis. Their manure appears tacky during this sickness. "Cows are pulled on day two to five and put in the hospital pen for surveillance and treatment. It seems to be affecting about 10% of the herd, and by day 14 to 21, the cows have recovered," he added. "A decrease in milk production is a big effect on these herds. We will see up to a 20-pound loss in production per cow, which, in the end, is a 20% loss in income for these producers." TESTING FOR INFLUENZA Drew Magstadt, clinical associate professor at Iowa State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said samples have been sent to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames to be screened for influenza A, which is also common in poultry and hogs. "We can test serum samples, blood samples, or nasal samples. Since we also run these tests on poultry and hogs, we run the tests more often than some other labs," Magstadt said. "We are looking for influenza antibodies in these samples, and once we have the results, that is reported back to the submitting veterinarian." He said they continue to ask for samples from herds that have been affected to determine how many cows are infected. These results can help to determine routes of transmission. "We would like the test results to be able to help the herd veterinarians determine if all the cows affected are in one pen or if they are randomly around the barn," Magstadt said. "Knowing what age of cows are showing the symptoms is important also. The results can help us know if there is any kind of cow-to-cow transmission or if it is strictly a bird-to-cow transmission." P[L1] D[0x0] M[300x250] OOP[F] ADUNIT[] T[] More Recommended for You Recommended for You The Ames lab is only one of several labs performing the tests. Magstadt said there is a network where information is shared on what is being found and communication between labs has been helpful for all the researchers. WORKING WITH HERD VETERINARIANS Milk from cows with any kind of sickness is diverted from the milk sold for commercial use. Gingrich said producers have their own protocols they follow to deal with waste milk. This could be by either dumping the milk with none of it being used at all or pasteurizing the milk to be fed to calves. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer for the National Milk Producers Federation, said there continues to be no concern about the safety of the milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health because products are pasteurized before entering the market, per the Food and Drug Administration. "Pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, including influenza in milk," he said. "All dairy cattle are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act and must be slaughtered and processed under inspection by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, ensuring that all meat entering the food supply has been inspected and approved for human consumption." No cows have died from being affected by influenza A, and no herds have been depopulated as has happened with HPAI in the poultry flocks due to spreading and death in the birds. Gingrich stressed the importance for all dairy producers to work with their herd veterinarian on buttoning up biosecurity. A bird deterrent plan is important, and feed should be covered to prevent virus contamination. "Producers need to look at everything that is coming into their operation -- people, feed trucks, milk trucks, and breeders. A disinfection protocol should be in place for all those who need to come in. Nonessential people need to just stay out right now," he said. "Herd purchases should be put on hold, if possible, until we know how this virus is transmitted." Gingrich said that while there haven't been any cases found in the beef herd, it is important to have continued surveillance of these animals. If several cattle in feedlots are being pulled to the hospital pen because of a decrease in feed intake, he suggests performing influenza tests. Cow-calf herd producers should look for indications of decreased milk production through observing hungry or sick calves. "We really don't know if we will see it in the beef herd, but it never hurts to be on the alert," he added. IMPORTANT LESSONS ARE BEING LEARNED Gingrich said there is a lot of fear in the industry. He suggests dairy producers don't try to hide any health problems they may be dealing with, as the more samples achieved from cows with symptoms, the more that will be learned about the epidemiology of the virus. "If we can't learn something from this influenza virus in our cows, then what are we going to do if a worse disease hits the herd?" he stressed. It's also important for farmers and the public to realize this virus is easy to kill. "There's a low risk for people to get this virus, but it can happen, and dairy farm workers should take precautions by using gloves and eye protection, as well as cleaning their hands often," he said. Another important factor is to refrain from consuming or selling unpasteurized milk. Calves should only be fed pasteurized milk as well. The virus is destroyed by heat. Jonker said federal and state animal health officials are diligently working with private veterinarians and dairy farmers to investigate influenza on dairy farms. "The collaboration is ensuring a coordinated response fielding valuable information about the disease etiology and biosecurity measures dairy farmers can take to reduce the risk for their herds," he said. Information is learned daily from the data being collected and analyzed with hopes of knowing more about transmission and how mammals are affected. "So much with something like this is unknown. This is so different than anything we've dealt with before and we are learning a lot each day," Magstadt said.

(Reuters: Ronen Zvulun)abc.net.auews/can-avian-influenza-bird-flu-affect-humans/103684660Link copiedShareShare articleViruses are tricky things. They are incredible at mutating to find new hosts in animal and human bodies.They can adapt to unlock, enter and infect a cell, and can change over and over again.The bird flu that is sweeping the world has now infected hundreds of species of animals.Scientists say we are living through a panzootic — that's an animal pandemic. What is bird flu?Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a highly contagious virus that affects bird species and can spread to other species, including humans.Just like human influenza, there are many types of bird flu and they can all have different effects on wild birds, poultry and other animals.Avian influenza viruses can be classed as high or low pathogenicity, a reference to their potential to kill chickens, not how infectious they are.H5N1 virus particles (gold in colour) as seen through an electron microscope. (Supplied: CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith)What is high pathogenicity avian influenza H5N1?This is the type of bird flu that has caused so many problems around the world in recent years.It's not new: highly pathogenic bird flu H5N1 was discovered more than 20 years ago and there have been outbreaks in different parts of the world.However the global spread has deepened since 2020, and the virus is now in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America and South America.It has even been found in Antarctica.Millions of poultry have died worldwide; in 2022 more than 131 million domestic poultry with H5N1 died or were culled across 67 countries on five continents.Wild bird communities have also been devastated, with an unprecedented number of deaths among some species, including endangered species. H5N1 has also spread to other wild animals — everything from foxes to seals, porpoises, bottlenose dolphins and grizzly bears have been affected — and farmed animals such as minks and dairy cows. Bird flu could wipe out black swans, gene study revealsPhoto shows Close up of a black swanThe graceful black swan is a familiar sight in waterways across Australia, but it could disappear if avian flu ever takes hold here.How has bird flu spread to cows?In March, scientists discovered that a dairy herd in Texas had been infected with H5N1 after its milk production had dropped.A dead farm cat and an unusually high number of dead pigeons were clues that suggested the cows had bird flu — domestic cats in the United States were known to have contracted H5N1.Within a week, three other dairy herds in separate states were also diagnosed with avian influenza.Wild birds are thought to be the primary source of the outbreak, but US scientists are investigating if cow-to-cow transmission is already occurring.Four dairy herds in the US are reported to have cattle infected with H5N1. (File photo) (ABC News)Can humans get bird flu?One dairy worker in the United States has tested positive; they had conjunctivitis-like symptoms and was treated with anti-viral medication.Symptoms can range from mild (conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms) to severe or critical disease leading to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, sepsis and death.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has asked state health officials to prepare for further human cases while saying the risk to the public remains low.H5N1 strain detected on mainland AntarcticaPhoto shows A brown bird is airborne just off the ground facing off with a small penguin in a larger colonyThe arrival of a devastating strain of avian influenza, which has killed millions of animals globally, to the Antarctic mainland makes Australia the last continent free of the virus.Since H5N1 was discovered in the late 1990s, there have been about 900 confirmed human cases across 23 countries, mostly among livestock workers. More than half of people who contract H5N1 die with the disease.However human cases have dropped substantially since around 2015, with only a handful reported worldwide since 2022 and human-to-human transmission is not believed to have occurred.Despite this, health authorities worldwide are not taking bird flu lightly.Zoonotic diseases — those that can jump from animals to humans — are increasing around the world and scientists are alert to potential pandemic-causing viruses.Evidence suggests COVID-19 was introduced to humans through animals, though it has not been confirmed. Bird flu infections in people are rare but possible. (Supplied: CDC)Are there any vaccines for bird flu?There are avian influenza vaccines for poultry but they are not used in every country, largely because they are considered ineffective.No vaccines have been developed to immunise other livestock, such as cows, against bird flu.And while humans don't yet have a bird flu vaccine, the research community's rapid COVID vaccine development has shown how quickly they can be produced.It has led to CEPI (formerly the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) setting a 100-day target to produce a safe, effective vaccine for the next global disease outbreak.What are the symptoms of bird flu in poultry?Sudden deathDifficulty breathing, such as coughing, sneezing, or raspingSwelling and purple discolouration of the head, comb, wattles and neckRapid drop in eating, drinking and egg productionRuffled feathers, dopiness, closed eyesDiarrhoeaWill Australia be affected by the H5N1 bird flu outbreak?For now, Australia remains one of the last places on Earth where this type of bird flu has not been found. This is thanks mainly to its isolated geographic location, which is outside many bird migration routes.But it's inevitable that H5N1 will reach Australia, scientists say. Spring is the highest risk time, when migratory birds are returning from their summer in the Northern Hemisphere.An Australian government assessment says there is an increasing risk of a bird flu outbreak, and the country's chief vet, Beth Cookson, says authorities are closely watching global developments. A review of the global H5N1 control and prevention strategy from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health is expected in May. Australia is not immune to zoonotic disease outbreaks; a domestic bird flu detection in Victoria in 2020 resulted in almost 500,000 birds being destroyed and international trade of poultry halted.ABC Rural news dailyKey stories of the day for Australian primary producers, delivered each weekday afternoon.ABC Rural Weekday NewsABC Rural Weekly NewsYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Thu 11 Apr 2024 at 7:44pmThursday 11 Apr 2024 at 7:44pmThu 11 Apr 2024 at 7:44pm, updated Mon 15 Apr 2024 at 11:47pmMonday 15 Apr 2024 at 11:47pmMon 15 Apr 2024 at 11:47pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter) News in LanguageListen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and KriolListenTop StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

The measles cases in Michigan stress the importance of vaccination against this highly contagious, potentially serious virus. Vaccination is free and readily available at doctors’ offices, health departments, drug stores and other locations. Also, with the weather improving, we need to be thinking about the importance of sunscreen. UV light gets stronger, we’re out in the sun more as the days get longer and we’re not as covered when it’s warm.”Levi Launder -- Clinical nurse manager, Emergency Center, Corewell Health Hospital Taylor“Our physicians and nurses report seeing an increase in flu and upper respiratory infections, but not much COVID anymore.”OAKLAND COUNTY – Strep throat, seasonal allergies, stomach viruses, influenza, respiratory viruses, croup.Dr. Steve McGraw -- Director of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Southfield and Novi Campuses“I’m seeing a lot of patients with strep throat and seasonal allergies in the emergency department. For people who suffer from allergies it’s important to learn which seasonal allergies affect you. Know what type of pollen gets you sneezing and if you’re unsure ask your doctor for an allergy test to find out. I’m also seeing quite a bit of viral stomach infections, such as enteroviruses and noroviruses. Everyone should stay home if they are sick and wash their hands frequently.”Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“This week I am seeing quite a few cases of strep throat. Patients with sore throats should be aware. A quick rapid test with their provider and antibiotics can clear this up. It is contagious so reminder to those with symptoms to stay home from school or work to recover.”Dr. Whitney Minnock -- Pediatric Chief of Emergency, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital in Royal Oak“We are still seeing a lot of influenza. Several other respiratory viruses are circulating and a GI bug. We’ve seen an increase in croup as well.”Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We’ve been seeing a lot of abdominal pain and kidney stones. We still have respiratory issues as well. "Washtenaw County – Stomach viruses, norovirus, upper respiratory infections, asthma & COPD flare-ups, seasonal allergies, influenza.Dr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“Just lots of vomiting and diarrhea! Norovirus is not always killed by hand sanitizer, so hand washing is really important.”Dr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Much more nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea on the adult side this week. Some URIs still, but even many of them have GI symptoms too. Those with COPD or asthma are also flaring a bit this week, probably a combined effect of weather, seasonal allergies, and URIs.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels, but appear to be decreasing. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Stomach viruses, strep throat, influenza, falls.ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“We are seeing a lot of nausea/vomiting symptoms, strep, influenza A and B, and a high number of falls.”Macomb County – Upper respiratory viruses, stomach viruses, influenza, Covid, strep throat, sore throats.Dr. Matthew Steck -- Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb“Viral upper respiratory infections continue to be treated in high volumes, with patients presenting with persistent cough, congestion, runny nose, and fever. Viral gastroenteritis symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) have also been presenting in patients with a viral upper respiratory infection. While patients continue to contract and test positive for influenza, there are signs that cases are tapering off.”Dr. Maria Samuel -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Sterling Heights“We’re seeing COVID-19, influenza and other viral pharyngitis. Strep throat is still going around also.”Dr. Dhairya Kiri -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Richmond“We have seen quite a few patients with rashes in the clinic this week.”Livingston County -- Respiratory viruses, mononucleosis, stomach viruses, influenza.Copyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Newsroom Bird Flu Blog MDA Blog Pending Regulations for Public Comments Press Releases MDA Public Meetings Calendar Maryland Department of Agriculture Issues Order Restricting Movement of Dairy Cattle Into the State April 10, 2024 Maryland Farmers Encouraged to Continue Biosecurity Practices ANNAPOLIS, MD (April 10, 2024) – The Maryland Department of Agriculture today issued an order restricting movement of dairy cattle into Maryland from states with confirmed outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in their herds. Last week, USDA announced detections of HPAI in dairy cattle herds in several states including Texas, Kansas, Michigan, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina and New Mexico following increased illness and lower milk production rates among herds. USDA National Veterinary Laboratory Services confirmed the strain is H5N1, which has been circulating in the wild bird population for the last several years and appears to have been introduced to these herds by wild birds. Although there have been no detections of HPAI in cattle in Maryland, producers are reminded to practice strong biosecurity. Cattle owners should minimize animal movements and isolate sick cattle. New animals should be quarantined for a minimum of two weeks before introducing them to an established herd. “Maryland is home to a robust dairy and cattle genetics industry. The Maryland Department of Agriculture, in collaboration with state and federal partners, is actively monitoring and responding to this situation,” said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks. “This order acts as another layer of protection for our Maryland farmers and ag industry partners.” In addition to the confirmed detections in dairy herds, on April 1 a case of HPAI in a human was reported in Texas and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This isolated case does not alter the overall human health risk assessment for H5N1 bird flu in the United States, as the CDC considers the risk to the general public to be low. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated there is no concern about the safety of the milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health because products are pasteurized before entering the market. Additionally, dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. If milk from cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to those infected with avian influenza is intended to be used to feed calves or other animals, the FDA strongly encourages that it be pasteurized or otherwise heat treated to kill harmful bacteria or viruses, such as influenza, before calf feeding. Avian influenza, commonly referred to as “bird flu,” is a respiratory illness caused by an Influenza A virus in birds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that the risk of transmission of avian influenza between birds or cattle and the general public remains low. To prevent the spread of avian influenza, the Maryland Department of Agriculture advises poultry and livestock owners to adopt the following biosecurity measures: 1. Make biosecurity a daily practice to safeguard your agricultural animals. 2. Stay vigilant for signs of illness and be familiar with the symptoms of infectious diseases. 3. Report any suspected agricultural animals to the Maryland Department of Agriculture by calling 410-841-5810. 4. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can seek guidance by emailing their questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.

As of April 11, 2024, a strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 24 dairy cow herds in eight U.S. states: Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Idaho, Michigan and North Carolina and South Dakota. (AP Photo/Charlie Litchfield, File) By JONEL ALECCIA Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print A bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows has grown to affect more than two dozen herds in eight states, just weeks after the nation’s largest egg producer found the virus in its chickens. Health officials stress that the risk to the public is low and that the U.S. food supply remains safe and stable. “At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.Here’s what you need to know about bird flu and food:WHICH STATES HAVE FOUND BIRD FLU IN DAIRY COWS?As of Friday, the strain of bird flu that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 26 dairy herds in eight U.S. states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and South Dakota. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals over the last few years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies. Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Read more What to know about the latest bird flu outbreak in the US The largest fresh egg producer in the US has found bird flu in chickens at a Texas plant Person is diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows in Texas HOW IS BIRD FLU AFFECTING FOOD PRODUCTION? Agriculture officials in at least 17 states have restricted imports of dairy cattle from states where the virus has been detected, but, so far, government agencies say it’s had little effect on commercial milk production. Officials believe cows likely have been infected by exposure to wild birds, but said cow-to-cow spread “cannot be ruled out.” Farmers are testing cows that show symptoms of infection, including sharply reduced milk supply and lethargy. Animals that show signs or test positive for illness are being separated from other animals on the farms. The animals appear to recover within two weeks. U.S. egg producers are watching the situation closely after bird flu was detected in chickens in Texas and Michigan. Millions of birds have been killed, but the FDA said the risk of affected eggs getting into the retail market or causing infections in humans is low because of federal inspections and other safeguards. DOES PASTEURIZATION KILL BIRD FLU?Scientists say there’s no evidence to suggest that people can contract the virus by consuming food that’s been pasteurized, or heat-treated — or properly cooked.“It’s not a food safety concern,” said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University.Two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu to date. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.IS GROCERY STORE MILK SAFE FROM BIRD FLU?Yes, according to food safety experts and government officials.U.S. producers are barred from selling milk from sick cows and must divert and destroy it. In addition, milk sold across state lines is required to be pasteurized, or heat-treated using a process that kills bacteria and viruses, including influenza.“We firmly believe that pasteurization provides a safe milk supply,” Tracey Forfa, director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine told a webinar audience this week. IS RAW MILK SAFE FROM BIRD FLU?The FDA and the CDC are less certain about unpasteurized, or raw, milk sold in many states, saying there’s limited information about the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus in such products.So far, no herds linked to raw milk providers have reported cows infected with bird flu, but the agencies recommend that the industry not make or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows that show symptoms — or are exposed to infected cows.U.S. health officials have long warned against the risk of foodborne illness tied to raw milk, which the CDC said caused more than 200 outbreaks that sickened more than 2,600 people between 1998 and 2018.Still, raw milk proponents like Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm USA in Fresno, Calif., said the outbreak of H5N1 in commercial cows appears to have spurred higher sales of the products, despite federal warnings. CAN YOU CATCH BIRD FLU FROM EGGS OR MEAT?Only dairy cows, not beef cattle, have been infected or shown signs of illness to date, agriculture officials said.The largest egg producer in the U.S. temporarily halted operations on April 2 after finding bird flu in its chickens. Cal-Maine Foods culled about 1.6 million laying hens and another 337,000 pullets, or young hens, after the detection.The company said there was no risk to eggs in the market and that no eggs had been recalled.Eggs that are handled properly and cooked thoroughly are safe to eat, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University.“A lot of people like runny eggs. Personally, if I eat an egg, it’s very well cooked,” she said. Still, Kowalcyk and others cautioned that the situation could change.“This is an emerging issue and clearly this pathogen is evolving and there’s a lot that we don’t know,” she said. “I do think that everybody is trying to figure it out as quickly as possible.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Back to Healio A second person has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1), after being exposed to dairy cattle that were presumably infected with the virus. The CDC considers the risk to the general public to be low, and USDA officials reported that testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories revealed no changes that would make the virus more transmissible to humans. A person in Texas tested positive for influenza A(H5N1) after exposure to sick cattle. This is the second U.S. case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Source: Adobe Image. Richard Webby, PhD, a faculty member in the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told Healio, “It’s really difficult to know what this means in terms of human risk. People obviously have more exposure to cows than we do to wild mammals, but so far, there isn’t any evidence that the virus in cows is any more infectious to humans than the viruses in birds.” It was the top story in infectious disease last week. In another top story, the FDA approved the antibiotic ceftobiprole — marketed in the U.S. as Zevtera by Basilea Pharmaceutica — for staph bloodstream infections, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia. A request for the approval was first submitted 17 years ago.

How safe is it to eat eggs? What we know now about bird flu after it spreads to a second person in America.Officials are continuing to investigate a recent bird flu outbreak following reports of one human case and infections in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas.In late March, officials reported cows infected with bird flu, or avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, in the two states. The following week, Texas confirmed the state's first known infection in a person.The April 1 announcement from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the only symptom the Texas patient experienced was conjunctivitis, or pink eye. The CDC still has the current health risk of bird flu listed as "low." Researchers investigating the dairy farm infections in Texas did discover, however, that cows and one human were not the only mammalian victims of the recent outbreak: three cats found dead at the facilities prompted some further investigation into the spread.Can cats contract bird flu and is your beloved pet at risk? Here's what to know.Virus spreading: Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread.Can cats get bird flu?The short answer? Yes, cats can contract bird flu if they interact with infected birds.Bird flu is primarily considered a transmission risk between wild birds and domestic birds; the recent presence of bird flu in dairy cows in Kansas and Texas is believed to be a first for the species.Researchers at Cornell University believe the affected Texas dairy cows were infected via water and food sources contaminated by wild birds migrating through the area. It was then likely spread between cows in close quarters, though that's not yet a definitive conclusion.Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, was called to the affected dairy farm in March to investigate the deaths of cows, birds and cats at the facility. Frye determined the presence of the illness in the cows using milk samples, manure and nasal swabs.Testing was also done on dead birds found on the farm, as well as one of three cats found dead at the facilities around the same time. All the tests turned up evidence of the presence of bird flu."It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together," Frye previously told USA TODAY. "The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness."Have cats been affected by bird flu in the past?The CDC has records of sporadic mammalian outbreaks of the bird flu in the past, impacting both wild animals like foxes and bears, as well as pets like dogs and cats. Officials believe these cases are caused by the animals consuming infected birds and poultry.In 2004, an outbreak in domestic animals including cats and dogs was reported in Thailand, and another outbreak impacting pets occurred in Germany and North America in 2006. The organization says humans contracting the virus from their pets is very rare and unlikely but has happened as a result of prolonged, unprotected exposure.In 2016, a veterinarian in New York City contracted bird flu from repeated exposure to sick cats without protective gear. The vet suffered mild flu symptoms.Signs your pet may be sickThe likelihood of your cat contracting bird flu is minimal. However, it can happen if your cat is often outside and ends up eating or getting too cozy with an infected bird, or hangs out in a contaminated environment.If you suspect people or animals in your home have been around a sick or dead bird, you should monitor them closely for these signs:Fever or feeling feverish/chillsCoughSore throatDifficulty breathing/shortness of breathConjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye)HeadachesRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesDiarrheaHow to prevent the spread of bird fluAvoiding exposure in the first place is the most effective way to stop the spread, says the CDC.Avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe wild birds only from a distance, whenever possible.Avoid contact between pets (e.g., pet birds, dogs and cats) with wild birdsDon’t touch sick or dead birds, their feces or litter or any surface or water source (e.g., ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs) that might be contaminated with their saliva, feces, or any other bodily fluids without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes after contact with birds or surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds.Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds or other sick animals.Change your clothes after contact with wild birds, poultry and sick animals.

Photograph: Robin Utrecht/ShutterstockUS news This article is more than 6 months oldBird flu detected among chickens in Texas and MichiganThis article is more than 6 months oldCa-Maine Foods, largest fresh egg producer in US, temporarily halts production at one Texas facility after discovering virusMelody SchreiberFri 12 Apr 2024 12.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 12 Apr 2024 12.16 BSTShareAvian influenza has been detected among chickens in Texas and Michigan, following news of the virus infecting livestock and then a person for the first time in the US and potentially leading to supply chain issues.The developments have led to a heightened focus on the potential risks of the virus, especially in the wake of the devastating coronavirus pandemic. But experts are saying that there is little chance of transmission between humans at this point.Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer of fresh eggs in the US, has temporarily halted production at one Texas facility and is killing 1.6 million hens and 337,000 chicks – 3.6% of its entire flock – after discovering the highly pathogenic virus among its domesticated birds.“These are hard times for dairies and the poultry folks,” said Lewis R “Bud” Dinges, Texas state veterinarian and executive director of the Texas animal health commission.Outbreaks like these may have repercussions on the price of poultry and eggs, particularly if the virus keeps spreading in domesticated flocks – much like the 2022-23 outbreak that raised the price of eggs by 70%. Continued spread among chickens could also threaten the production of the flu vaccine, which relies on 140m eggs a year to incubate inoculations.The CDC released a health advisory notice last Friday, recommending that doctors keep a lookout for possible avian flu among patients, especially those who frequently come into close contact with birds and animals.Anyone in contact with birds and livestock, including agricultural workers, hunters, and backyard farmers, should wear protective gear and follow strict hygiene standards. They “just need to pay extra attention to biosecurity and cleaning and disinfecting”, Dinges said. “Make sure they wash their hands and wear protective clothing and leave their clothing at the facility where they work – clothing and footwear if at all possible.”An inmate who was culling infected flocks in Colorado became the first person in the US with a known bird flu infection in 2022.On 20 March, Minnesota reported that baby goats were sickened by bird flu, marking the first time the virus had been discovered in livestock. Days later, the virus was also discovered among cows. Cows in North Carolina tested positive for bird flu on Wednesday, bringing the affected count up to 21 herds in seven states.Genomic sequencing revealed that the spillover to cows did not seem to make the virus more transmissible to humans this time, so the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is still low, said Seema Lakdawala, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine.“Transmission of influenza viruses in humans requires lots of different variables to align just right, and the current H5N1 viruses do not have all the correct parameters for spreading between humans,” she wrote in an email.“However, the more the virus spills from birds into other hosts like cattle, foxes, seals, etc the more likely the virus is to change and gain properties that could lead to successful human-to-human transmission.”Avian influenza is “an emerging disease” among livestock, Dinges said, “and there’s a lot that we don’t know about the pathogenesis in the cow itself. We’re still kind of learning as we go here.”It’s not clear how the herds encountered the virus, but the genomic sequences are very similar – pointing to a single introduction, probably from a dead bird, that spread within the herds rather than several introductions over time.The outbreak among dairy cows could lead to local shortages, but for now it’s unlikely to create national or regional shortages or price increases, said Tinglong Dai, professor of business at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School. That’s because the US is in its high season for milk production.“In the spring and summer, usually, you have higher yields than during the winter,” he said. “Suppose this happened in the fall or in the winter: the supply chain impact would have been much bigger.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the meantime, affected cows are being isolated until their illnesses pass.Chickens, on the other hand, usually die from the virus, so producers cull them as soon as the virus is detected.“The most effective way to stop the spread is to kill the chickens,” Dai said. That means prices for poultry and eggs could be more affected by this outbreak than for milk and cheese.The manufacturing process for flu shots also relies heavily on eggs, and egg shortages in the past have led to vaccine shortages. So far, no vaccine makers have reported shortages.“It’s just if the situation keeps going – if infection spreads, again, we need to monitor very, very closely,” Dai said. “This also depends on how this is going to evolve in the coming days.”Scientists are sounding the alarm in order to keep farmers and other agricultural workers safe, and to continue monitoring the spread of the virus.For example, it’s not clear how common it is for avian influenza to spill over from birds to animals, Lakdawala said. “Currently, in the US, most of this surveillance is from examination of animals that are found sick or died.”If the virus has been quietly spilling over into other animal hosts that don’t get very sick or die – as with white-tailed deer and Covid – scientists don’t know about it. That’s why they need more funding for monitoring concerning viruses like the flu, Lakdawala said.“This is a gap we need to try to fill, but is hard to do without more resources and investment into large-scale surveillance programs.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsBird fluTexasMichigannewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Was it the first global pandemic of modern times?Apr 7, 2024 • By Aaron Stoyack, BA History, Museum Studies Minor Spanish Influenza was a widespread pandemic from 1918 to 1919. The highly infectious and fatal virus took millions of lives across the globe. Its death toll was enhanced by modern transportation but mitigated by modern medicine. Also known as the Spanish Flu, responses to this outbreak drew on centuries of public health measures. Analyzing its impacts unearths an infectious question: Was Spanish Influenza the first “modern” or “global” pandemic? Overview and Virology of Spanish Influenza Electron micrograph of a recreated 1918 influenza virus, photographed by Cynthia Goldsmith, 2005. Source: Public Health Image Library, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Over the course of two years, Spanish Influenza infected roughly 500 million people, one-third of the global population. Death toll estimates vary from twenty-one to one hundred million, with modern scholarship proposing a total greater than fifty million. At the time, many people lived in densely populated, unclean environments, especially the militaries fighting the First World War. Doctors often accompanied the armies, creating shortages of medical professionals on the homefront. Spanish Flu was caused by a type A form of the H1N1 virus. Influenza types A and B cause annual flu epidemics, but type A is the only variety to spur global contagions. Flu viruses undergo frequent mutations, which are slight enough that immunity from past infections will provide protection. But roughly every forty years, a significant change in the virus’s makeup ignites a pandemic. Major influenza outbreaks have occurred since at least 1500, perhaps much earlier. Aquatic birds are carriers of influenza A viruses and may be the source of their presence in humans. Spanish Flu is theorized to have begun in birds before transmitting to mammals. This could have occurred through mutation or from pigs. Pig cells have receptors vulnerable to both bird and human flu viruses. Respiratory disease in American pig herds coincided with Spanish Influenza but could just as likely have been passed to pigs by humans.

Spanish Flu advertisement for Minard’s Liniment, by Minard’s Liniment Co., ca. 1918. Source: Nova Scotia Museum, Halifax Spain was neutral during World War I and did not have strict controls on its press as wartime nations did. These belligerent countries suppressed reports of the outbreak, not wishing to alert their adversaries to their losses. Spanish publications documented cases freely, so other countries called the disease Spanish Influenza, or Spanish Flu. There are several theories on the origin point of Spanish Influenza. The speed of transmission pushed the limits of contemporary transit to the extent that some suggest the virus arose as early as 1916, spreading quietly and gradually. Outbreaks at two British Army camps in France in 1916 and 1917 exhibited comparable symptoms and rates of infection and death. Influenza outbreaks in China in early 1918 have also been proposed as the source. The United States had one of the first recorded cases at Fort Riley, Kansas on March 11, 1918. Unlike suggestions of an earlier patient zero, transmission can be traced from this individual across the globe. The cramped nature of the military outpost caused the disease to spread rapidly. In a short time, additional cases struck military personnel on both coasts. Initially, the American public had little exposure to the virus, and the military largely ignored its spread, which was overshadowed by the war effort. Spanish Influenza fizzled out in the United States in May 1918, but by August, it returned after planting its roots virtually everywhere else. Spanish Flu Spreads Around the World Map showing the worldwide transmission of Spanish Flu. Source: Institute for Public Health, Washington University in St. Louis Spanish Influenza killed 100,000 soldiers, but whether it affected the outcome of the war is debatable. Naval blockades and unrestricted submarine warfare threatened and substantially reduced commercial shipping and oceanic travel during the conflict. The end of the war brought a hasty return of troops, often welcomed back to their homes with celebratory events. Mechanized transportation and the growing interconnectedness of the world allowed the virus to traverse rapidly across great distances. The flu struck India and North Africa by May, China by June, and Australia by July. A second, more fatal wave of the virus began in August, transmitting to the rest of Africa, Central and South America, and Europe. In December, countries began to recover and loosen restrictions before a third wave hit, ending for most in May 1919 and dissipating almost completely in 1920. The Victims and Symptoms of Infection Plate 2, The clinical features of the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 by Herbert French, 1920. Source: University of Missouri Special Collections and Archives, Columbia With most flu viruses, young children and the elderly are the most susceptible, but Spanish Flu was also extremely dangerous to healthy adults. In a reversal of course from every other influenza virus, half of all fatalities were from those aged 20-40, and 99% of victims were less than sixty-five years old. The death rate of 2.5% far exceeded the 0.1% of most influenza viruses. Symptoms included a high fever, fatigue, dry cough, aches, and chills. Red spots formed on the cheeks before a blue hue took over one’s face from lack of oxygen. The disease ravaged the patient’s respiratory tract within hours. In time, the lungs filled with fluid, in which victims drowned. It was not uncommon for victims to perish the same day symptoms appeared. Complications such as pneumonia often killed patients if the virus did not claim their lives first. Medical Treatments Were Largely Ineffective State Gymnasium serving as a temporary hospital for soldiers ill with the Spanish influenza, 1918. Source: Iowa State University Special Collections Medicine in 1918 was closer to modern practices than to the pre-industrial era. Notions of health, sanitation, and disease prevention were relatively adequate. However, no viral test could detect the Spanish Flu, and there were no effective medicines to treat infection. Medical professionals used technology such as X-rays and basic diagnostic methods to identify infection. Drug manufacturers attempted to create a vaccine but were far off from a successful product. The first step, isolating the virus, may have been completed by scientists in Japan and Tunisia, but they could not preserve the specimen. Blood transfusions from recovering patients showed promise in treating the illness and saw experimental administration in flu epidemics since, although their effectiveness is unclear. Easing symptoms proved to be the most reliable and accessible means of treatment. Nurses, mostly women with little to no previous experience, provided active care in medical facilities and in the community. The nursing profession expanded during the First World War, and their continued service for the pandemic proved essential. What Was Done to Stop the Flu? Policemen in Seattle wearing masks made by the Red Cross, during the influenza epidemic, December 1918. Source: National Archives Governments mobilized to initiate measures aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus and its effects. Responses varied at the national, regional, and local levels. Municipalities prohibited public functions, sometimes even extending the bans to schools and churches. Law enforcement officers were empowered to fine people for spitting or to arrest people for sneezing or coughing outside. Public health organizations issued guidance and dictated policy. War news and propaganda made citizens accustomed to reading informational posters and newspapers. The Red Cross campaigned for every person to wear a mask in public. Individuals donned face coverings of varying styles and efficacy to guard against airborne contagion, although many resisted recommendations and mandates. Comparable Pandemics of Pre-Modern Times The plague of Florence in 1348, as described in Boccaccio’s Decameron by Luigi Sabatelli. Source: Wellcome Collection The Plague of Justinian spread across trading routes as far as Western Europe, Britain, Africa, and Central Asia from 541 to 590. Estimates state it wiped out 40% of the Byzantine Empire’s population, or 25 to 100 million worldwide. Citizens of Constantinople ran out of room to bury bodies, so they placed the dead in guard towers, covering corpses in quicklime to hasten decay. The Black Death, the most notorious historical pandemic, claimed 100 to 150 million lives. The plague originated in China in 1334, traveling along the Silk Road to reach Europe by 1347. By 1352, it spread to Russia and the Middle East. Those fearing the Bubonic Plague practiced self-quarantine and avoided public gatherings, as no treatments were effective against the contagion. The Black Death affected localities differently, sometimes sparing sparsely settled agrarian regions while killing fifty to sixty percent of a city’s population. Ports barred entry to ships, and militaries closed off roadways. Despite the high death tolls, the absence of contact with the Western Hemisphere bars them from being considered global pandemics. Was it the First Modern Global Pandemic? Model – Cholera, Vibrio Cholerae (Spirillaceae) photographed by Rodney Start. Source: Museums Victoria, Melbourne An influenza pandemic in 1557 spread across Asia, turning west to Constantinople and Europe. Its presence may have been recorded in Central America, presumably ferried aboard Spanish ships. The flu ravaged the entirety of Spain almost simultaneously, making transmission plausible, but documentation of its presence in Spain’s colonies is lacking. Another outbreak in 1580 is more widely accepted to have spread across the entire known world. Slow transportation methods still hindered the transmission of these influenza contagions. Cholera is a bacterial illness that inhabits the digestive system, contributing to an expulsion of fluids that causes dehydration and death. Seven distinct cholera pandemics have transpired since 1817. The disease spread first from India to neighboring regions, then to other continents and the Americas. As with the Black Death, official quarantines were imposed upon visitors from areas with known cholera infections. Love Field, Dallas, Texas.

Cholera receives comparatively less attention than other infectious diseases, although it continues to take 21,000 to 143,000 lives each year. The bacteria cannot be eliminated because they thrive in water sources, but illness can be prevented with access to clean water and sanitation. As the first outbreak to spread to every inhabited continent in recent history, it is fair to call cholera the first modern global pandemic. Spanish Influenza’s Decline & Lasting Effects Cartoon in the Wichita Daily Eagle, October 11, 1918. Source: Newton Public Library Worldwide populations that were still reeling from history’s deadliest war to that point were punished by history’s second deadliest pandemic. Most communities experienced the illness as a time of rapid death and panic, which mercifully ended within a short time. The Great War contributed to developments in transportation and mobilization, which spread the disease, as well as media and medicine, by which officials could attempt to contain and treat it. Death rates dropped dramatically throughout the next decade as people gained immunity from past infections. The H1N1 family continued to circulate until 1957, when it was replaced by H2N2, reemerging in 1977 and continuing to the present.

As of Thursday, this list includes one Idaho herd, three Kansas herds, two Michigan herds, five New Mexico herds, one Ohio herd, and 10 Texas herds, Added to the list are one South Dakota herd and one North Carolina herd.News of the virus first infecting dairy cattle was confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on March 25 that for the first time, influenza A had been reported in ruminants.The South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources reported its first avian influenza, or bird flu, was detected in a South Dakota dairy cattle herd.DANR and the state Animal Industry Board, a board assigned to the state ag agency, announced Thursday the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed a positive detection of the virus in the herd April 9. This is the first confirmed case of bird flu in a dairy farm in South Dakota, Argus Leader reported.The virus was also detected in a dairy herd in North Carolina, said Steve Troxler, North Carolina's agriculture commissioner in a statement.Virus linked back to Texas outbreak?State officials in at least four states ‒ North Carolina, Michigan, Idaho and Ohio ‒ reported that infections in dairy cows from their states traced back to Texas dairy herds. Owners of infected cows in those states said they unknowingly introduced the virus into their herds after purchasing cows from farms involved in the Texas outbreak.While previous outbreaks reported that the virus had struck older cows in mid-lactation, DTN reports that North Carolina officials stated the cows that tested positive were younger cows.Animal health officials stress that the outbreak is evolving as they search for answers. Here is a timeline of events.April 9, 2024U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed a positive detection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in a dairy herd in South Dakota and North Carolina on April 9. This is the first confirmed case of bird flu in a dairy farm in either state. .April 4, 2024The Ohio Department of Agriculture receives confirmation from the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in a Wood County dairy cattle herd in Ohio. Officials say the Ohio farm introduced cows into the herd from a Texas dairy on March 8.April 1, 2024The CDC reports that a Texas farmworker having direct contact with infected cows has tested positive for the HPAI virus. The employ is being treated with an antiviral drug and has exhibited only symptoms of pink eye. CDC and USDA officials stress that the risk to the public remains low.April 1, 2024Within days, highly pathogenic avian flu is identified in two dairy herds from New Mexico and an additional herd in Kansas. The disease is also confirmed for the first time in the state of Idaho in a herd located on the Canadian border.March 29, 2024USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has now also confirmed the presence of HPAI in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas.March 27, 2024Samples collected from three additional herds in the Texas panhandle test positive for HPAI.March 25, 2024Tests on raw milk and nasal swabs from sick cows from two dairy farms in Kansas and two in Texas test positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Based on findings from Texas, the detections appear to have been introduced by wild birds.March 22, 2024American officials published an urgent announcement that dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico were falling sick. Animal health officials noted that the cows had low appetites, and produced less milk than normal. Some farms also discovered wild bird carcasses on their grounds.March 20, 2024Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) reported that a juvenile goat on a Minnesota farm tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). This marks the first U.S. case of the virus in a domestic ruminant. Poultry on the Stevens County property, including chickens and ducks, was quarantined from a previous HPAI detection.MORE: Navigating bird flu in cows: What Wisconsin dairy farmers need to know Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024A human bird flu case was detected in Texas.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, file) Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... The U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Friday issued a health alert for bird flu after a Texas dairy cow worker tested positive for the virus earlier this week.Your questions, answered What is bird flu? How does bird flu spread to humans? Can you get bird flu from eggs? What are symptoms of bird flu? The worker’s infection marked the second recorded case among humans of avian influenza, or A(H5N1), in the U.S., according to experts, and comes amid a spike in recorded cases in dairy cattle and chickens.

Sign Up For Free Days after the largest U.S. producer of fresh eggs paused production and slaughtered nearly 2 million birds after detecting the virus in its flock, experts from Texas’s top public health agency and the University of Texas’s Health Science Center spoke with the Landing about the state of the outbreak (spoiler: no cause for alarm just yet, Houston). Check out their responses to Houston’s most urgent bird flu questions: What is bird flu? H5N1, The current strain of avian influenza spreading among dairy cattle and poultry, is a common virus that spreads easily among other non-human animals. “H5N1 has actually been detected in all kinds of random animals,” said Dr. Michael Chang, an infectious disease specialist at the UT Health Science Center in Houston. “A lot of migratory birds like ducks and geese carry it and don’t get as sick. But when a chicken gets it, it gets really sick.”Eggs are cleaned and disinfected at the Sunrise Farms processing plant in Petaluma, Calif., on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, which had seen an outbreak of avian flu. Egg prices are at near-historic highs in many parts of the world as the spring holidays approach, reflecting a market scrambled by disease, high demand and growing costs for farmers. (AP Photo / Terry Chea)How does bird flu spread to humans? The only two recorded human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. were detected among dairy and poultry workers in close contact with infected animals. The average Houstonian probably does not have to worry about catching bird flu, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Chris Van Deusen explained. For the rest of us, the probability of transmission is very low, Van Deusen said. His advice? “Avoid dead birds, especially ducks or geese, or other migratory birds.” “Luckily, there’s no mutation that seems to make [H5N1] more transmissible amongst humans,” Chang echoed. “In both the samples that have come from cows and from the human cases, there has not been an adaptation or a mutation in the virus that would lead it to be more likely to spread among people,” he explained. “So during this outbreak specifically, it doesn’t appear that there’s a big risk for rapid human transmission.” Can you get bird flu from eggs? Technically, yes. But your chances are extremely low, especially if you don’t like runny yolks. “The response to avian flu in general and the food chain of production, like infrastructure for chickens, is really rapid. So there’s a low probability that a chicken contaminated with the virus will get into the food supply chain,” Chang said. Milk from dairy cows is still safe to drink, too. “The milk we have in the U.S. that you can buy in a store is all pasteurized and pasteurization will kill the flu virus,” Chang said.What are symptoms of bird flu? Texas DSHS said in an April 1 release that patients presenting with eye redness, fever, cough, sore throat, or other symptoms associated with the typical flu after a confirmed close contact with a potentially infected animal should be screened for the virus. “The symptoms in people are not always consistent,” Chang warned. “So we don’t always know.” Why we did this story Recorded cases of bird flu in dairy cattle and chickens have spiked across the U.S. in recent weeks. One of the two human bird flu cases was detected in Texas. The largest fresh egg producer in the U.S. paused production at one of its Texas facilities and slaughtered nearly 2 million chickens after detecting the virus in the flock. Infectious disease experts say the virus is not showing signs of mutations that would lead to rapid spread from animals to humans, or from one human to another. But they’re still keeping a close eye on the outbreak among livestock. Our reporting wouldn’t be possible without you. Learn more about how we are funded here.

What to know about the risk to humans Avian influenza, aka bird flu, has spread to dairy cows in multiple states and one person in Texas. What to know about transmission, symptoms and food risks. By Caroline Kee | TODAY • Published April 12, 2024 Earlier this month, a dairy worker in Texas tested positive for bird flu, aka avian influenza, amid an outbreak of the virus among dairy cattle. It's the first time this virulent strain of bird flu — referred to as highly pathogenic H5N1 — has been detected in cows and the first documented cow-to-human transmission of an avian influenza virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's also only the second case of bird flu in a human in the United States. Free 24/7 Connecticut news stream: Watch NBC CT wherever you are Is bird flu a problem now? The multi-state bird flu outbreak is affecting cows in over a dozen dairy farms across the country. Although health officials are on high alert, the current risk to the general public is low, experts say. Get top local stories in Connecticut delivered to you every morning.

While the thought of "bird flu" may sound alarming and stoke COVID-19 pandemic fears, influenza among birds is not new. “The current bird flu strain that we’re concerned with, H5N1, has actually been circulating around the world for quite some time,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, tells TODAY.com. What is bird flu? U.S. & World Decision 2024 9 mins ago Democrat Ruben Gallego defeats Kari Lake to become Arizona's first Latino senator Crime and Courts 3 hours ago Man arrested in killing that was falsely blamed on bear Bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza type A viruses. Avian influenza A viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, such as geese, ducks and swans, says Schaffner, but they can also circulate among domestic poultry. “Bird flu viruses occasionally get into other mammalian species (like pigs). We’ve all heard of swine flu,” Schaffner says. Avian influenza A viruses can also infect horses, bats and dogs, per the CDC — rarely, they spread to humans. "More recently, we have seen an increase of infections in cattle," Dr. Hilary M. Babcock, infectious disease specialist at Washington University of St. Louis and BJC Healthcare, tells TODAY.com. This is the first time the avian influenza strain of highly pathogenic H5N1, which causes severe and often fatal disease in birds, has been found in cows. “That’s pretty unusual,” says Schaffner. However, this H5N1 strain does not seem to be making cows very sick, he adds. What states have bird flu? Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (which include the strain of H5N1 that’s currently spreading) have been detected in the U.S. in wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks beginning in January 2022, according to the CDC. Overall, 48 states have reported cases of highly pathogenic H5N1. The current outbreak of H5N1 affecting cows has spread to eight states so far, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of April 11, cases have been reported among dairy herds in: Texas Kansas Michigan New Mexico Idaho Ohio North Carolina South Dakota Currently, only one human in Texas is known to have contracted H5N1 in this outbreak, the experts say. There have been only two human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. ever, says Babcock — the first case was detected in Colorado in 2022 in a person who had direct contact with infected poultry. As H5N1 surveillance increases, experts anticipate the number of cases among cows to increase. "We’re looking harder now and finding more cases (among cattle) that even 10 years ago would have gone undetected," says Schaffner. The risk to the general public in the U.S. is low, the experts say. For people exposed due to their line of work, the risk is considered “low-to-moderate,” the World Health Organizagtion said in a statement. How does the bird flu spread to humans? "Every once in a while, a bird flu virus can get into a human, but that's rare," says Schaffner. Avian influenza viruses can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways, according to the CDC: Directly from an infected bird From environments contaminated with avian influenza virus Through an intermediate host, such as an animal Infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces. People can become infected when a large enough amount of the virus gets into the mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled, says Schaffner. Transmission to humans typically occurs through close contact with infected birds without protective gear. It can also occur if a person touches contaminated surfaces and puts their hands in their eyes or mouth, or if they breathe in droplets from the air, per the CDC. It is not immediately clear how the dairy cow infected the person in Texas, the experts note. The only other person who contracted H5N1 in the U.S. was directly involved in the culling of birds presumed to be infected with H5N1, says Babcock. Sporadic cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported around the world, often in rural areas where people live closely with poultry or other birds. According to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries. Once the bird flu gets into a human, “it is almost never spread to anyone else,” says Schaffner. However, “there are ultra-rare instances of transmission from a person very sick with bird flu to a family member or caregiver.” When does happen, it does not lead to continued spread between people "because the virus doesn’t have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,” says Schaffner. “This strain of bird flu has been around for about a decade and it still has not picked up this capacity to spread readily from person to person, thankfully. ... That should be a matter of reassurance, but also keep us in public health on alert,” says Schaffner. No human-to-human spread has occurred with the contemporary H5N1 viruses currently spreading in birds, the CDC said. Can you get bird flu through eggs? There is no evidence that people can get bird flu from food that’s been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to eat eggs, chicken and beef, and drink pasteurized milk, the experts say. "We have not seen cases that have been from ingesting animal products or animals that may have been infected," says Babcock. The infected dairy cow herds that have been detected are in quarantine and their milk is being destroyed, says Schaffner. In a statement, the USDA said the commercial milk supply in the U.S. remains safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it does not currently have concerns about the safety of pasteurized milk products, including pasteurized cheese. “The pasteurization process in the U.S. keeps our milk supply very safe,” says Babcock. Pasteurization heats the milk to a high enough temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, including influenza. Drinking unpasteurized or "raw" milk, which is increasingly trendy, is associated with various infectious disease hazards, says Schaffner. "I discourage people from drinking raw milk,” he adds. The risk of humans becoming infected by eating eggs from poultry with H5N1 is low, says the FDA, and there safeguards in place to identify infected poultry and remove their eggs from the market. It's possible for products from infected animals to end up in the food supply, says Babcock, but the risk to humans is still very low. Properly storing and cooking food further reduces that risk. Although beef cattle are not involved in this outbreak, Schaffner recommends cooking beef to a safe internal temperature. The FDA recommends cooking eggs until the white and yolk are firm. “There are other reasons that you shouldn’t eat raw eggs (or meat), because these can carry lots of different pathogens," says Babcock. What happens if a human gets the bird flu? Bird flu infections in humans can range in severity, the experts note. Some people have zero or only mild symptoms, while others develop severe disease, according to the CDC. "It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,” says Schaffner. The Texas patient had a mild infection, with eye redness as the only symptom, the CDC said. "It was not even a respiratory infection. It was ... conjunctivitis or pink eye," Schaffner notes. The patient was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. "We have antiviral medications, the same ones we use to treat regular flu, that work against this avian influenza strain," Schaffner says. The other human case of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2022 was a mild infection as well, Babcock adds. Symptoms of bird flu in humans According to the CDC and experts, the reported signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans include: Fever Cough Runny nose Muscle or body aches Headache Fatigue Shortness of breath Eye redness or inflammation (conjunctivitis) Diarrhea Nausea Bird flu in humans may look similar to a regular flu or upper respiratory infection, says Babcock, or a person may have no obvious symptoms. It can also lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications. "There's a full range," she adds. There is no way to diagnose an infection with bird flu by symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required. Can you recover from bird flu? Yes, you can recover from bird flu. The human recently infected in Texas was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. The Colorado patient infected in 2022 also recovered. Globally, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, resulting in death in some cases, according to the CDC. How to prevent spread of bird flu Although the risk of getting bird flu is low, the CDC recommends the following protective actions: Avoid visiting poultry farms if possible If visiting poultry farms, wear a mask and avoid touching birds Avoid sick or dead birds Maintain good hand hygiene Do not eat raw or undercooked poultry Visit a doctor if you become sick after contact with birds This story first appeared on TODAY.com.

News Everything You Need to Know About Keeping Safe Amid the Bird Flu Outbreak According to the CDC, human risk remains low. By Karla Alindahao Karla Alindahao Karla is a lifestyle journalist with more than 20 years of experience in food, drink and travel coverage. She has worked at Forbes, Vogue, The New York Observer, Women's Health, and Tatler Philippines — among other publications. She is also a founding judge at the Los Angeles Spirits Awards. Food & Wine's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 8, 2024 Close Photo: Johner Images / Getty Images Last week, a Texas dairy farm worker who had “exposure to dairy cattle” was confirmed to have tested positive for a “highly pathogenic” strain of avian influenza — also referred to as A(H5N1). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this is the second-ever instance of H5N1 reported in the United States, although it is the first contracted from cattle. The previous case, which was reported in 2022, was of a Colorado inmate at a state correctional facility who was infected after processing infected birds while he was participating in a work program at a poultry farm. The Texas patient suffered only mild symptoms — eye redness “consistent with conjunctivitis” — and is being treated with antiviral medication while in isolation. “This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the CDC considers to be low. “However, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.” Avian influenza has officially been confirmed in the states of Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, and Texas. And goats in Minnesota have also tested positive. And while there is no indication of person-to-person spread — or that anyone has contracted the diseases by way of milk, meat, or eggs — there’s an understandable concern among U.S. citizens about how to stay safe. Here’s everything you need to know about the current avian influenza outbreak. What is the bird flu? Bird flu is caused by an influenza virus that affects birds — both wild and domestic. The viruses are categorized as avian influenza A viruses and there are two main types, according to the CDC: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Eating Like a Salmon Is Better Than Eating Actual Salmon, Study Finds The former, which is more common, causes “either no signs of disease or mild disease in chickens/poultry (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production).” But it can potentially mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, given the right conditions. In contrast, the latter, is responsible for “severe diseases and high mortality” in poultry. What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans and how is it contracted? It’s uncommon for avian influenza to infect humans, but it happens. “Illness in humans from bird flu virus infections have ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death,” per the CDC. Humans contract the disease when the virus is inhaled — or gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth. “Human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred most often after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with bird flu viruses,” the CDC says. “This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches something that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose.” Everything You Need to Know About Reheated Rice Syndrome Symptoms include upper respiratory issues (such as cough, sore throat, or a stuffy nose), pneumonia, eye redness, headaches, fever, fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, nausea, seizures, vomiting, and shortness of breath. If you experience any of the above in relation to potential H5N1 exposure, call your primary care physician — in addition to your state or local health agency. You should be treated with antiviral medication. Can bird flu spread between people? The majority of avian influenza cases in humans are typically contracted through birds, and human-to-human transmission is incredibly rare. But it has happened in the past and is not unheard of. So it’s important to take precautions if you think you’ve been exposed. Are milk, eggs, and dairy products safe to consume? The Food and Drug Administration recently stated that it “does not currently have concerns” about pasteurized milk and cheese, given that the pasteurization process destroys pathogens through the heating of milk. Beyond that, milk from infected cows has either been “diverted or destroyed” — so you can feel safe in the assurance that none of the milk on supermarket shelves is contaminated. As for raw or unpasteurized milk, there are still a lot of unknowns regarding transmission, but “Because of the limited information available about the possible transmission of HPAI A (H5N1) viruses in raw milk, the FDA recommends that industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” Cal-Maine Foods, the largest supplier of eggs in the United States, had chickens that tested positive for H5N1. Does that mean that we should all be worrying? No — but it’s best to be cautious. Infected hens will likely lay contaminated eggs, and because most eggs sold in cartons aren’t pasteurized, it’s important to cook your omelets all the way through in accordance with U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service time-temperature guidelines. Dough and other food items that may contain raw eggs should be avoided at this time. It should also be noted that there are strict industry controls in place that aim to prevent infected eggs from making their way to the U.S. market. Here Are the 12 Most Contaminated Fruits and Vegetables, Ranked In terms of meat, the USDA remains “confident that the meat supply is safe.” Just make sure to use standard precautionary measures when handling raw products: Wash your hands frequently, don’t leave cooked food at room temperature for longer than two hours, and use a food thermometer. Should I be concerned about my pets? Avian influenza typically affects wild birds such as ducks, geese, chicken, and turkeys. Commercial poultry are also vulnerable. But it’s important to note that not only wild or barnyard animals are susceptible. Backyard flocks, as well as pet birds that may come in contact with infected wildfowl, could contract the disease. As for cats and dogs, they could get bird flu if they consume or are around sick animals. “If your domestic animals go outside and could potentially eat or be exposed to sick or dead birds infected with bird flu viruses, or an environment contaminated with bird flu virus, they could become infected with bird flu,” the CDC said in a statement. “While it’s unlikely that you would get sick with bird flu through direct contact with your infected pet, it is possible. For example, in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in NYC.” There's no indication of person-to-person spread, but it's important to remain vigilant and follow precautionary measures. tianyu wu / Getty Images I have a pet bird, now what? Pet birds, like any other pet you may have, should be moved indoors and kept away from potential exposure to wild birds or rodents. If your pet bird shows symptoms of avian flu — such as diarrhea, reduced egg count, lack of coordination, or nasal discharge — you should monitor your own health and watch out for signs of infection. And if you find a dead bird elsewhere, get in touch with your state wildlife agency, state veterinary diagnostic lab, or state health department. As for backyard flocks, the American Veterinary Medical Association has these guidelines, which are simple enough to follow. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Over the past 2-3 weeks, just two more outbreaks in poultry have been confirmed across Europe, and the disease situation has been declared “resolved” in three countries. However, ongoing cases in wild populations represent a continued threat to human health, according to a new study from the food safety agency.As France passed the half-way point in its year-long HPAI strategy earlier this month, the country’s agriculture minister has welcomed the progress achieved so far as a success.Minister March Fesneau highlighted that the national vaccination campaign was unprecedented. He acknowledged the engagement and participation of the administration and the various sectors in this progress. In the months to come, he committed to maintaining vigilance, and efforts to continue with the vaccination strategy.Following devastating losses to HPAI in recent years, France began a targeted HPAI vaccination campaign in October of last year. Administration of the vaccine is mandatory for commercial duck flocks across mainland France.Latest update from the French agriculture ministry puts the number of ducks that have received a first dose of vaccine at more than 26 million (as of April 2). A second dose has been administered to over 21 million birds, in progress that is ahead of schedule.In combination with the application of biosecurity measures and a lower viral pressure than in previous years, the ministry reports that the vaccination program has contributed to a significant drop in the number of HPAI outbreaks in France. Compared with 315 outbreaks in the 2022-2023 season, just 10 have been confirmed in France since the fall/autumn. 2 European nations record new outbreaks in poultryAs of April 5, 16 countries in the region have together recorded 135 HPAI outbreaks in commercial poultry flocks since the start of 2024.This is according to the Animal Disease Information System from the European Commission (EC), which monitors the disease situation in European Union (EU) member states and adjacent countries.Compared with the previous edition dated March 22, the outbreak total has risen by two. This is the result of a ninth outbreak in Bulgaria, and a first of the year for The Netherlands. Highest national total since January 1 is 55 recorded by Moldova, followed by Poland. Neither country has added to its total since early March.In a separate category of “captive birds” the EC System records HPAI outbreaks in non-commercial poultry, zoos and similar premises.Seven European countries had registered a total of 46 outbreaks affecting these populations in 2024 (as of April 5). No new cases have been reported since mid-March.Based on official notifications to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), three European states have officially declared that the HPAI situation in their respective poultry sectors have been “resolved” over the past 10 days. These self-declarations followed seven confirmed outbreaks in this population in Denmark since last fall/autumn, six in Great Britain, and 31 in Poland.In The Netherlands, the agriculture ministry lowered the HPAI risk level for poultry from moderate to low at the end of March, based on advice from an expert panel. With the exception of a few areas of particularly high poultry density, the nationwide order for mandatory housing of poultry — in place since November of last year — has been lifted. Minister Piet Adema said this change will come as good news for poultry owners whose hobby and commercial birds can again access outdoor ranges. Continued rise in cases among wild birds in EuropeLatest update of the EC’s System indicates that HPAI virus continues to circulate widely across the European continent in wild birds.For 2024, a total of 373 outbreaks have been registered with the EC System in this population by 25 countries (as of April 5). Compared with the previous update dated March 22, this is an increase of 14 outbreaks, of which nine were detected in Germany. One further case was confirmed by each of Belgium, Denmark, France, Moldova, and Romania.Furthermore, additional cases have been registered with WOAH over the past 10 days by Latvia, Moldova, The Netherlands and Norway.EFSA study explores HPAI risk to human health“One Health” measures have the potential to mitigate the risk of avian influenza (AI) viruses adapting to humans and other mammals. These aim to focus on limiting exposure and preventing spread, according to a new report published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).Supporting these conclusions, EFSA states that AI viruses are still prevalent in European wild bird populations, causing significant mortalities, and viral transmission occurs between birds and mammals. As a result of this transmission, AI infections have been confirmed in fur animals in the region, as well as more widely in other species — most recently in U.S. dairy cattle and other animals. As the viruses continue to evolve, there is potential for strains to emerge that are better adapted to mammalian transmission.For EFSA, key options to reduce this risk include enhanced surveillance of both people and animals, and greater collaboration between the veterinary and medical sectors. It also urges the enforcement of biosecurity on farms, reducing contact between wild and domestic animals, and avoiding poultry and fur farming in areas that attract wild waterfowl. Furthermore, EFSA introduces the option to consider AI vaccination of poultry as a disease prevention measure.

I cannot help but wonder if there is any possibility that my family or my dogs might be at risk. Why can a vaccine not be developed to protect birds and other species? How bad is the current situation? A.R.Dear A.R.,Thank you for your question. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu or H5N1, has had devastating effects on birds and other species for about four years now. Highly fatal in some bird species (approaching almost 100% mortality in chickens), seals and sea lions have also been affected and died from New England down to South America.The wildlife species have contracted the disease from infected wild birds. Over 300 seals have died off our local coasts whereas over 20,000 sea lions have died off the coasts of Chile and Peru. Penguins were also affected at one point. Luckily, this can be controlled in domestic species for now. There is a vaccine for poultry currently in use and along with good biosecurity measures, our poultry can be protected. Recently, dairy cattle were affected in TX and KS in small populations and properly controlled. There was almost no mortality, and most cattle recover uneventfully so there has been no impact on the dairy supply.Currently, there is little to no concern about dogs or cats contracting this disease and there is no vaccine for them. Due to the possibility of mutations, the pharmaceutical industry is keeping a watchful eye on the situation. There is also a human vaccine available in Europe in the event of a major outbreak that public health officials are monitoring for and our federal government also has a stockpile of vaccines for humans for two types of bird flu should they become needed. People can be infected with various kinds of flu from other species and this is why veterinarians are so essential in working in areas such as public health, food production and food safety.Dr. John de Jong owns and operates the Boston Mobile Veterinary Clinic.

Everyone's encouraged to take precautions to stop the spread of COVID-19, RSV, flu, and whooping cough.Queenslanders are being urged to act now to reduce mounting pressure on health services ahead of the traditional start to flu season.More than 300 people were hospitalised with COVID-19, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) across the state last week, with case numbers expected to increase in the coming colder months.Meanwhile, a nationwide pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak has pushed Queensland cases to more than 1,300 in the first three months of the year, compared to 20 for the same period of 2023.Queensland GP Roger Faint said it was a combination threatening to push hospital emergency departments to their limits.He and fellow Queensland doctors said it was vital residents took preventative measures sooner rather than later to protect the community's most vulnerable.Why so many cases?Townsville, one of the worst affected regions for flu so far this year, recorded more than triple the number of cases from January to April compared to the same period last year, according to Queensland Health.The has been a similar surge in RSV cases on the Sunshine Coast and in Mackay.Statewide, COVID-19 case numbers are lower than this time last year, but still account for a large proportion of weekly hospitalisations for respiratory infections.More than 300 people were hospitalised in Queensland at the beginning of April with either COVID, influenza, or RSV. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jessica Ross)Public health physician Nicolas Smoll said this year was panning out to be a more "significant" flu season, but the COVID-19 pandemic had made things harder to predict."In the past, every two years we would see quite a significant difference in the number of cases — one year would be small, the next year would be high. Ever since the pandemic that's been refining its equilibrium," Dr Smoll said.Whooping cough cases have been particularly high in children aged 10 to 14, predominantly in the state's south-east.Queensland's acting Chief Health Officer Catherine McDougall told ABC News Breakfast the surge in cases could be attributed to a number of factors."The first is that pertussis is known to run in cycles every three to four years and our last cycle was in 2019," Dr McDougall said."Additionally, for a two-year period during COVID, there was very little pertussis on the ground and that has an affect on the long-term immunity of the community."'Just constant coughing'Nambour nurse and mother-of-five Amy Taylor has urged parents to do whatever they can to protect their children from RSV.Amy Taylor, with daughters Lacey, Alice, and April, is urging parents to take up the RSV vaccine. (Supplied: Amy Taylor)Her youngest daughter, two-year-old Alice, recently contracted the virus for a third time.Ms Taylor said it had been a "miserable" experience."Just constant coughing — I'm talking every five to 10 seconds, just coughing, coughing, coughing," she said."They vomit when they cough. They don't eat, they don't drink."They're just miserable because they also get quite high temperatures as well."It was the first infection, when Alice was just four weeks old, that Ms Taylor said she had "never gotten over".Alice and her twin sister April spent 10 days fighting for life in intensive care after Ms Taylor insisted their initially "minor" symptoms were thoroughly investigated."I don't know what made me go to the doctor but I just felt like there was something wrong," she said."The doctor didn't know what it was either, so she sent us to hospital."Alice went into respiratory arrest in the emergency room and had to be resuscitated."It was just the most terrifying day of my life," Ms Taylor said."I would hate to think what things would have been like if we weren't already there."This virus lands more children in hospital than any other condition, and now there's a free jabPhoto shows A tiny baby lying on a hosptal bed. Blue gloved hands hold an oxygen mask to their face. RSV is a highly contagious virus that attacks the lungs and can lead to respiratory illnesses including bronchiolitis and pneumonia.Alice was discharged after two days, but soon deteriorated again."Little Allie coughed and spewed all over me, so I went and changed my clothes," Ms Taylor said."I came back and she was blue."She was readmitted to hospital with her twin April, who was also discovered to have dangerously low oxygen."[April's] oxygen levels were actually lower than Alice's," she said.The state government recently announced a 12-month program offering all Queensland newborns free RSV immunisations from next week."I'm not a vaccine pusher, by any means, but absolutely parents should take advantage," Ms Taylor said."I would hate for people to go through what I went through."Loading...Preventative measuresMore than 31,000 Queensland children under the age of five are considered overdue for the whooping cough vaccine, despite it being available for free.Across Queensland, flu vaccination rates are lowest in children aged five to 15 years.Free flu shots recently became available from GP clinics and pharmacies statewide and can be administered at the same time as a COVID vaccine.Dr Faint says GPs are seeing an early start to the flu season. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Meg Bolton)Dr Faint, who is based on the Sunshine Coast, said he hoped the wider availability of the vaccines would increase the uptake."We don't want everyone to become unwell at once and therefore put an incredible strain on hospital systems, including emergency departments … leading to a lack of hospital beds, more ambulance ramping," he said."It's certainly better that we have a herd immunity and get most people, or at least a large majority of people, vaccinated."Dr Smoll said other preventative measures were equally important."One of the best things you can do is when you are sick, just please stay home," he said."If you are sick, and you have to go outside, wearing a mask can help … and regularly washing your hands."ABC Sunshine — local news in your inboxGet our local newsletter, delivered free each WednesdayYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Wed 10 Apr 2024 at 6:17amWednesday 10 Apr 2024 at 6:17amWed 10 Apr 2024 at 6:17amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Symptoms for affected birds include diarrhoea, sneezing, a reduction in egg production and sudden death.The risk of infection in Australian wild birds is classified as high, after a risk assessment provided to the Department of Agriculture in December. The risk to poultry is listed as moderate to high.Dr Melinda Cowan, a veterinary specialist in avian medicine, said her Sydney clinic is already making preparations for an outbreak.“It’s critical that all bird owners, but especially our pet chicken owners, are aware of how to implement and potentially improve their own biosecurity measures,” she said. “And it’s sensible anyway.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Cowan said authorities are worried about the disease being introduced by migrating seabirds and nomadic waterfowl. The highly virulent strain of the virus has been identified in more than 300 species of wild birds worldwide.“We all need to really have our finger on the button,” she said. “We need to be very mindful of what’s going on overseas, there are definitely some things that we could implement straight away.”‘Cautious optimism’ as penguins test positive for bird flu but show no symptomsRead moreCowan said homes with back yard chickens or pet birds could reduce the risk of interaction with wild birds by creating netted, enclosed spaces and regularly changing and sanitising sources of food and water.She said that while implementing biosecurity measures in small back yards may be challenging, “this will be the way that we can protect our beloved pet birds, if we implement these things now”.“We are mentioning this concern so people can be alert but not alarmed. We are trying to educate people about this concern and what they can do to help their flock.”Peter Laurence has four pet chooks in his back yard in Tempe, near wetland bird habitats in Sydney’s inner west. He said he was not aware of the risk from avian flu, and said there should be better communications from authorities to back yard chook owners.“None of my friends who keep chickens are talking about bird flu, and we talk about our chooks a lot,” he said. “There’s very little awareness about the impact of diseases in the community with city flocks … we’ve been sheltered from so many agricultural diseases and viruses.”Four chickens is considered a low risk of infection, because the disease requires larger flocks to spread. But with the family cat registered with his local council, Laurence said he would like to see a similar process for his chickens.“I don’t see that it would be an inconvenience to have a chicken registered, particularly if it means that government would be able to get to us quickly if there was an outbreak … it would be really good if we could register our flock,” he said.Poultry researcher Dr Peter Groves said bird owners needed to be vigilant to spot unwell birds before disease of any kind began to spread.“The major risk to poultry in Australia would come from wild ducks or geese,” he said. “But to migrate, they need to be healthy and HPAI has killed huge numbers of them.”Groves said for bird flu to arrive on Australian shores, an infected bird would have had to survive the flight from Antarctica to Australia and transmit the virus to local ducks or geese. Those wild birds would then need to survive long enough to circumvent biosecurity protections and come into contact with a chicken or turkey in a commercial operation.“​​All of this is possible but probably very unlikely,” he said. “Poultry veterinarians regularly check poultry mortalities for the presence of avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle Disease [a virus that causes paralysis and death] and monitor our status of freedom from these diseases.”What happens now bird flu has reached the Antarctic? – podcastRead moreA spokesperson for the department of agriculture said Australia’s biosecurity system was one of “the most robust in the world” and the recent surge in cases was being closely monitored.“While migratory birds do travel between Australia and parts of Asia where HPAI is present, the distance between Australia and our northern neighbours may reduce the likelihood of introduction of HPAI viruses,” they said.“Australia has nationally agreed response arrangements in place to respond to emergency animal disease incursions and outbreaks, including for avian influenza.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe rural networkAgriculturenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

HealthWorld Bird flu outbreak in the US: What is H5N1 avian influenza & should India be concerned Genome sequencing from a patient in Texas showed that the flu was caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza A. Experts say it’s too soon to make predictions but advise caution. Sumi Sukanya Dutta 09 April, 2024 10:38 am IST FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedin Representational image | Photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ New Delhi: An outbreak of avian flu that has infected specific dairy cows in at least six US states and a farmworker in Texas has become a cause for worry in the medical world, with some global experts even raising concerns that it could be “getting dangerously close” to triggering a pandemic “100 times worse than COVID-19”. According to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which sequenced the virus genome from a specimen collected from the patient in Texas, the flu was caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) — a virus similar to the HPAI A(H5N1) pathogen infecting cattle, wild birds, and poultry in some parts of the country. According to the CDC, the Texas patient was the second reported case of the virus in the US. The first was from 2022 when a person in Colorado was “presumed” to be infected after coming in contact with poultry, the agency says on its website.

Also Read: How coronavirus, bird flu and rumours to stay off non-veg hit poultry industry hard in India What is avian flu The CDC defines avian influenza or bird flu as “the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses”. “These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species,” the website says. “These pathogens do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred.” According to senior virologist Gagandeep Kang, who’s associated with the department of gastroenterology at the Christian Medical College (CMC) in Vellore, H5N1 cases rarely transmit to humans. However, if they do, its severity can vary widely — from mild conjunctivitis to even death. India’s only reported case of the H5N1 infection was in 2021 when an 18-year-old man from Haryana died of the infection. Experts, however, believe that the lack of more recorded cases could be due to an absence of thorough surveillance. “Identification and reporting of types of influenza in India is very limited so we might not know, (of the real number of avian flu infections),” she said. According to biologist and genome scientist Dr. Vinod Scaria, while bird flu is not a new disease, an emerging new lineage 2.3.4.4b of H5N1 has been spreading across the globe since late 2020, mainly carried by migratory birds following certain routes. “However, the latest panzootic (the animal equivalent of a pandemic) is huge and has a significant effect on the avian population with disastrous consequences to the ecology and significant economic loss affecting poultry across the world,” Scaria, senior consultant with the Vishwanath Cancer Care Foundation and also associated with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT, Kanpur), said. In rare instances, the virus can infect mammals from birds, he said. Several such spillovers have been noticed in recent years — the most recent being polar bears in Antarctica. “Close contact with infected animals could mean the virus could spill over to humans. This comes with a significantly large fatality rate — over 50 percent,” he said. The latest outbreak of H5N1 was first detected late last month. First dubbed as a mystery disease, the culprit was later identified by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a highly pathogenic strain of the virus spreading in dairy herds across the states of Texas and Kansas. The infected animals showed symptoms such as loss of appetite, low-grade fever, and reduced lactation. According to Scaria, this was the first time that H5N1 had been detected in cattle, raising concerns about potential transmission routes and the broader impact on the dairy and meat industry. Should India be concerned? “Yes and no”, says Scaria. “Yes, because the outbreak in the avian population is quite large and widespread and has possibly resulted in the extinction of many species. And no, because there is no evidence of widespread infections in humans yet.” Kang, meanwhile, said that while there have been H5N1 outbreaks among birds in India, it’s still unclear if the virus was transmitted through migratory birds or some other mechanism. However, she said that like in the US, India should conduct surveillance on avian flu, particularly since it’s expected that H7N9 — another subtype of the Influenza A virus — might cause outbreaks in humans, she said. “In fact, it has already resulted in small outbreaks, mainly in southeast Asia and China, but mutations that increase its ability to spread in humans could change it into a pandemic,” she warned. Need for surveillance, specific vaccines According to Dr. Anurag Agarwal, dean of biosciences and health research at Ashoka University’s Trivedi School of Biosciences, there is no need to worry about H5N1 just yet. However, the biologist recommends a nationwide integrated respiratory surveillance system to identify moderate to severe respiratory infections, test for multiple known pathogens, and conduct detailed investigations of unknown cases. One such integrated system is the global efforts towards One Health — a proposed integrated approach to optimise health outcomes and prevent, predict, and respond to global health threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic. “I believe that globally, including India, we are already moving towards it. Outbreaks will keep happening. As long as we are adequately prepared, the human costs will be low,” he said. Experts also insist on global efforts to develop vaccines to help mitigate any future risks. However, Kang worried that in India, influenza vaccines appear to matter little because there is a small internal market. “This is more of a concern because scaling up flu vaccines made in eggs has a long lead time,” Kang said. She was referring to the most common way that flu vaccines are made — using an egg-based manufacturing process through which health agencies provide private sector manufacturers with candidate vaccine viruses grown in chicken eggs. These vaccine viruses are then injected into fertilised chicken eggs and incubated for several days to allow the viruses to replicate. This production method requires large numbers of chicken eggs and could take longer than other production methods. But this isn’t the only method to make vaccines. According to Kang, making vaccines in cell lines – when the viruses used to make vaccines are grown in mammalian cell cultures — or using other technologies such as protein-based, or mRNA vaccines (such as Pfizer and Moderna Covid ones) require existing platforms and can be easily switched over to.

Since 2022, H5N1 avian influenza has affected more than 82 million birds across the country, U.S. officials said. (AP) By Sara Swann April 12, 2024 If Your Time is short Public health authorities say avian influenza poses low risk to the general public. One person in the U.S. was recently diagnosed with bird flu. There are no signs the disease is spreading human-to-human. Bird flu infections in humans are rare. There have been sporadic cases and outbreaks among humans globally for nearly three decades. Officials say it’s safe to eat properly cooked poultry and eggs. Pasteurized dairy products are also safe to eat. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more. Recent U.S. outbreaks of avian influenza and the first known case of a human contracting bird flu from a mammal have ignited concerns that bird flu will be the next pandemic. Some social media users are claiming bird flu will be worse than COVID-19, which caused more than 1.2 million U.S. deaths since 2020. "GET READY because the fabled ‘Disease X’ COVID PLANDEMIC 2.0 IS on the horizon, and it looks like it’s the ‘Avian Influenza’ Bird Flu H5N1 variant," an April 4 X post said. Another X post, featuring butchered grammar, said, "Here we go …. Again. Scientists says Bird Flu pandemic could be ‘100 times worse’ than COVID." Other X users said public health authorities are "already working" on a bird flu vaccine for humans, suggesting the disease outbreak was planned. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Public health experts in the U.S. and worldwide say avian flu poses a low risk to humans, and there have been no signs of human-to-human spread of the disease. Developing a bird flu vaccine is part of the federal government’s pandemic preparedness. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a naturally occurring disease among wild birds, including ducks and geese, that can also infect domesticated birds, such as chickens and turkeys. Highly pathogenic strains of bird flu can cause severe infection and high fatality in birds. Low pathogenic strains trigger mild infections, but can turn highly pathogenic. Domesticated birds can contract avian flu through contact with infected birds, or through contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus. Because avian flu spreads quickly and is untreatable in animals, infected flocks are culled to prevent further infection. How widespread is the bird flu outbreak in the U.S.? This strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1, was discovered in wild birds in the U.S. and Canada in late 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In 2022, the virus began causing outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry. Since 2022, H5N1 bird flu has affected more than 82 million birds across almost every state, the CDC said. That means they live on premises where the flu has been detected. Sporadic infections of other wild animals, including bears, foxes and skunks, have also been reported. Recently, the virus spread to livestock for the first time. In March, U.S. officials reported that goats on a Minnesota farm tested positive for H5N1. Since then, the avian flu has also been detected in dairy cows in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas. At the beginning of April, the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods Inc., said it was temporarily halting production at a Texas plant after bird flu was found in its chickens. A Michigan poultry plant also reported bird flu infections. As of April 10, the U.S. Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said avian flu affected more than 3.85 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks in Michigan, South Dakota and Texas over the past 30 days. How often do people get infected with bird flu? It’s unusual for people to contract avian flu, but rare cases have occurred globally for nearly three decades, the CDC said. Infections can happen when the bird flu virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. The first bird flu outbreak among humans happened in 1997 in Hong Kong, and about 20 people were infected, the CDC said. No human cases were reported between 1998 and 2002, the CDC said. And since 2003, the World Health Organization said, there have been 889 cases of humans infected with bird flu across 23 countries, including the U.S., where two people have been diagnosed with the disease. The first U.S. case occurred in 2022 when a prison inmate caught the disease while killing infected poultry on a Colorado farm as part of a prerelease program. The person’s only symptom was fatigue and he recovered. On April 1, the second U.S. case of bird flu infection in a human was reported. The person who tested positive with the virus had been exposed to infected cows in Texas. The person, whose only reported symptom is eye redness, is being treated with an antiviral drug. Officials say public health risk remains low Many social media users have raised alarm about the avian flu’s fatality rate for humans, with some citing "scientists" who said a bird flu pandemic could be "100 times worse" than COVID-19. This prediction appears to come from an April 3 Daily Mail article in which John Fulton, founder of Canada-based pharmaceutical company BioNiagara, said, "This appears to be 100 times worse than Covid, or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate." PolitiFact reached out to Fulton for comment, but didn’t hear back before publication. Of the people diagnosed with H5N1 avian flu worldwide since 1997, about 470, or 52%, have died, the WHO said. Bird flu infection numbers and fatality rates differ from country to country. Most of these bird flu infections were reported in Egypt and Indonesia before 2020, according to the WHO. The fatality rate for bird flu in Egypt is about 33%; in Indonesia, it’s 84%. The lower fatality rate in Egypt may be because the infections were less severe, detected early and treated better, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said. Claire Standley, an associate research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security who specializes in zoonotic diseases, said the severity of a disease depends on a myriad of factors, including a person’s previous exposure to the disease, underlying health conditions, age, access and quality of health care and exposure to the pathogen. It’s possible that mild or asymptomatic cases of bird flu in humans are not being detected or reported as well in low- and middle-income countries, "so only those cases who are getting very sick are being picked up, along with their contacts — this is going to bias the case fatality data upwards, most likely," Standley said. "My sense is that the claim of being ‘100 times worse’ than COVID is just an expression and is not based on a quantitative analysis," Standley said. Bird flu remains primarily an animal health issue and the risk to the general public remains low, the CDC said. The WHO also said the public health risk posed by this virus is low. Is there a bird flu vaccine? Yes, there are bird flu vaccines in the federal government’s stockpile, but they are not available for sale. The CDC said vaccine manufacturers could use two candidate vaccine viruses to produce a H5N1 avian flu vaccine, if one was needed in an emergency. The current bird flu strain causing outbreaks in the U.S. is "very closely related" to these candidate vaccine viruses, the agency said. Viruses can change when they replicate after infection. The CDC has been monitoring the virus as outbreaks have occurred across the country. The agency’s preliminary analysis found that the virus remains "primarily avian" and "not well adapted to people." "There were no changes that would make these viruses resistant to current FDA-approved and recommended flu antiviral medications," the CDC said. Is it safe to eat poultry and dairy products? The Agriculture Department said poultry and eggs that are properly prepared and cooked to an internal temperature of 165° Fahrenheit are safe to eat. The chance of poultry affected by the avian flu entering the food supply is minuscule. The department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service personnel inspect poultry products intended for human consumption for signs of disease before the products enter the market. The department said it’s not concerned about the commercial milk supply’s safety because these products must be pasteurized before entering the market. Pasteurization heats dairy products to destroy any bacteria and viruses in them. Additionally, dairies must send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. Milk from avian flu-infected animals is diverted or destroyed so that it stays out of the human food supply, the department said. The FDA warns against consuming raw milk or unpasteurized dairy products because they can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can seriously threaten health.

He can be reached at jasghar@gmail.com As a disease detective, the danger of the next pandemic is always on our radar. The 1918 flu pandemic, which killed 50 to 100 million people and infected one-third of the population of just 1.5 billion, showed how deadly a flu pandemic could be. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Of them, A and B are the causes of flu season every year. Influenza A is considered the only influenza virus to have the potential to cause a major pandemic in humans. For the above reasons, the world was concerned about the next flu pandemic and WHO has set up alert systems around the globe since 1952 to identify any new changes in the influenza virus, which could increase its capacity to infect others or become more lethal. In 2007, a poultry farm in Abbottabad got infected with bird flu (H5N1). As a standard procedure, the stock was culled to prevent infection spreading to other farms. The person who was responsible for culling developed flu-like symptoms and got some medical aid. After a few days, when his situation did not improve, he moved to Peshawar and went to a local hospital. As his situation worsened, he was admitted to the hospital and later shifted to the ICU. While he was being treated, a few of his brothers developed the same symptoms, and two of them later died one after another while the original patient recovered. As some other related people, including a physician, started to report similar symptoms the treating consultant sent the samples on the suspicion of H5N1. Until then, there was no known human case of H5N1 in Pakistan, and it was a rare human disease anyway. By the time the final diagnosis came, and the world knew about the threat of another potential human flu pandemic, it was already close to 40 days from the start of culling. I had just started my work as a US-CDC Resident Adviser for the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training program (FELTP), and we had to quickly develop a training module to train both veterinarians and medical doctors to manage and control a potential pandemic. I also have to send some of my students to help the provincial government investigate the outbreak. But within four days, I received an email from Washington, DC, saying that a Pakistani has been admitted to a hospital in New York with flu-like symptoms, and he is giving the history that two of his brothers have died of bird flu, and he was back in Pakistan for their burials. It really sent shockwaves of failures in detect and control systems and also showed that it is actually impossible in today’s world to stop any infectious diseases at the borders. Luckily, he had the simple flu, and H5N1 human-to-human transmission was limited and not sustained. The current bird flu strain is infecting mostly poultry, and hundreds of millions of birds across the globe have been culled. That is why global prices of poultry and eggs went up in many western countries. However, it has also spilled from poultry to different animals, most recently cows. Last week in the US, the second case of human bird flu was identified in a person who probably got it from cows. He has mild symptoms. In Pakistan, there has been no case of H5N1 in poultry reported for more than a decade. However, India reported it in its poultry in 15 states and its first human case and death in 2021. Pakistan follows the policy of carpet vaccination among its commercial poultry, but the US and Europe have a different policy of not vaccinating poultry to avoid the emergence of resistant strains and instead culling birds to stop the transmission. The world is cautious but not in panic, as the human-to-human transmission of H5N1 until now has not been sustained for very long. However, the recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) has also shown that any virus could change itself to become lethal and more infectious and cause a major epidemic or pandemic. We need to have a good-quality global health intelligence system to safeguard our populations. Published in The Express Tribune, April 9th, 2024.

(Getty)India has begun monitoring virus strains amid the looming scare of bird flu globally, especially in the United States. Last week, the Union government conducted an assessment of the prevailing flu strains in the country. Poultry firms, too, have been closely monitoring the situation.Experts worldwide have raised a warning about the potential of a bird flu pandemic, which could be a hundred times more severe than Covid-19. The emergence of H5N1, also known as avian influenza, among dairy cows in the US, with a confirmed case of a human testing positive for the virus in Texas, has sparked considerable alarm.“Last week, the government assessed the prevailing influenza viruses in India. We did not identify any concerning levels of avian influenza. H1N1, known to cause swine flu, was detected, but there was nothing unusual noted," a top government official told News18. Similarly, poultry firms across India have increased vigil and poultry. Avian influenza is a disease which results from infection of birds with influenza viruses. These viruses typically circulate among wild aquatic birds globally and have the potential to infect domestic poultry and other avian and animal species. While bird flu viruses typically do not infect humans, isolated cases of human infections have been reported across the globe. According to Ranpal Dhanda, president of the Poultry Federation of India (PFI) — a lobby of over 2,500 members including farmers, veterinarians, breeders, processors, and other allied fields related to the poultry — no unusual trend has been spotted by the industry, so far. Dhanda told News18 that “news of bird flu could have been more concerning if it had surged about two months ago".He noted that during winter, migratory birds arrive from various parts of the globe, potentially bringing such viruses with them. “However, at present, it is the time when these birds leave India, reducing the likelihood of acquiring new infections."Dhanda, who is also the president of Unnat Group engaged in the poultry feed and equipment business, stated that the association has instructed its members to remain vigilant and report any unusual activity. “Nothing unusual has been observed so far," he added.‘Prepare as if next pandemic will happen now’According to Dr Anurag Agrawal, Dean, BioSciences and Health Research, Ashoka University, the strategy of surveillance has to be similar to what we follow in case of influenza viruses. “We only need to follow the data and maintain strict vigil and respiratory infection surveillance."Agrawal, the former director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), advised that “India needs to follow the one health approach". The One Health approach is a collaborative method that recognises the interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and environmental health to address health challenges effectively.Similarly, Dr Vishal Rao, a member of Karnataka’s genomic surveillance committee, also called for adopting a “one health approach". Rao, who is also the dean for the Centre of Academic Research at Bengaluru-based HCG Cancer Hospital, advised that all Indian states and central government should be prepared to fight the pandemic even if the news around H5N1 fizzles out in a week. “We understand that avian influenza is a highly pathogenic virus, but it does not typically spread from human to human. Nonetheless, we should prepare ourselves as if it has the potential to cause the next pandemic. What is the point of learning from the second wave of Covid-19 if we do not begin preparing well in advance?"tags :avian influenzabird flucovid-19H5N1news18 specialsTexasLocation : New Delhi, IndiaFirst Published:April 10, 2024, 10:23 ISTNews india Bird Flu Scare: Govt Checks Virus Strains Circulating in India, Poultry Lobby Finds No Unusual TrendRead More Advertisement More Impact ShortsLatest newsTurmeric Milk To Kashmiri Kahwa: 5 Health Drinks To Keep You Warm During WintersWACA Nets Covered From Public View As India Start Preparations For Border-Gavaskar TrophyNBA: Donovan Mitchell Shines as Cleveland Cavaliers Extend Historic Unbeaten Start to 12-0 With Win Over Chicago BullsIND Team Celebrates Sanju Samson's Birthday Upon Arrival At Centurion Ahead Of Third T20I vs SALatest Entertainment News Live Updates Today (November 12, 2024): German Man Finds Ancient Hindu Text In Flea Market, Desis Help Identify Its Originmore latest news live tvCNN News18ChannelsAdvertisementAstrology View More November 12, 2024Choose ZodiacChoose ZodiacariestaurusgeminicancerleovirgolibrascorpioSagittariuscapricornAquariusPiscesTodayWeeklyMonthlyYearly...read moreAstrology NewsMore Astrology NewsTrending Videos View More More Trending VideosLatest Blogs Photogalleries View MoreMore Photogalleries AdvertisementPreviousNextTrending TopicsUS Election Results LiveMaharashtra ElectionsDiwali 2024Lawrence BishnoiSalman KhanShraddha KapoorDisha PataniKaran JoharAnkita LokhandeAnanya PandayMovie ReviewsMalaika AroraRashmika MandannaTripti DimriShah Rukh KhanKiara AdvaniShraddha KapoorKerala Lottery ResultsShillong Teer ResultsWeb StoriesHot On SocialShehnaaz GillMouni RoyJanhvi KapoorDeepika PadukoneKareena Kapoor KhanSalman KhanVirat KohliSanya MalhotraRohit SharmaRanveer SinghNikki TamboliSonali RautAlia BhattTamannaah BhatiaSonam BajwaAmitabh BachchanNayantharaBobby DeolUrfi JavedSobhita DhulipalaPopular CategoriesLatest NewsIndiaMovies WorldPolitics ViralAutoTech VideosPhotosWeb Stories CricketExplainersShowshaOpinion LifestyleBusinessEducation-CareerSportsCity NewsElectionsLanguage SitesMarathi NewsGujarati NewsBengali NewsTamil NewsTelugu NewsMalayalam NewsPunjabi NewsUrdu NewsAssam NewsOdia NewsKannada NewsNetwork18 Group SitesTopperLearningMoneycontrolFirstpostCNBCTV18History IndiaMTV IndiaFollow Us OnNews18 App Download NowAbout UsCookie PolicyDisclaimerContact UsRSSComplaint RedressalAdvertise with UsSitemapPrivacy PolicyCNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2024 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

(BT) Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinWhatsappEmail 703 In a major development for the public health infrastructure, the World Health Organisation has named the Best-dos Santos Public Health Laboratory a National Influenza Centre and a member of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The designation, initially announced in October 2023, was celebrated on Monday in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), the Caribbean’s WHO regional office. The laboratory, which opened in 2018, has been playing a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic response. One of the first Caribbean labs to acquire test kits and reagents for COVID-19 detection, it has processed over 800 000 COVID-19 tests in the last three years. It also features programmes for global salmonella and influenza surveillance, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infections examinations, and water and air quality monitoring. PAHO’s representative for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, Dr Amalia Del Riego, said the lab’s new role will help Barbados better understand the flu, track its changes, and protect the population through more effective vaccines and treatment. He said: “The laboratory is recognised for its highest standards and its ability to perform specialised diagnostics, contribute to global flu surveillance and provide critical data that helps in the fight against influenza and pandemic.” Minister of State in the Ministry of Health Davidson Ishmael highlighted Barbados’ longstanding commitment to excellence in flu testing, calling the recognition “a culmination of years of hard work, perseverance, and collaboration, not just in relation to influenza but to public health on a whole”. “As the Ministry of Health and Wellness expands its capacity to monitor non-communicable diseases, including and arguably chief of which is cancer, surveillance and enhanced diagnostics will be key to addressing early detection and monitoring,” he added. Prime Minister Mia Mottley expressed gratitude to all involved and underscored the importance of national investment in healthcare infrastructure, emphasising the laboratory’s capability to uphold standards worthy of global recognition. The Best-dos Santos Public Health Laboratory at Enmore is named in honour of two former health experts who pioneered the development of Barbadian laboratory services and technologies – senior laboratory technologist Cecil Best and senior consultant pathologist Wilfred dos Santos.
