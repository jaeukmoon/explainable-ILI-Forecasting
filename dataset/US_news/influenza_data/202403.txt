A next-generation influenza virus vaccine would provide long-lasting, broadly-reactive immune protection against current and future influenza virus strains for both seasonal and pre-pandemic viruses. Next generation immunogens were designed using computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology to protect against a broad range of strains over numerous seasons. Novel HA and NA amino acid sequences were derived from multilayered consensus sequence alignment for multiple subtypes of influenza. This multivalent formulation was hypothesized to elicit broadly protective immune responses against both seasonal and pre-pandemic influenza viruses. Mice were vaccinated with multivalent mixtures of HA and NA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, N1, N2) proteins. Multivalent COBRA vaccinations elicited antibodies that recognized a broad panel of strains and vaccinated mice were protected against viruses representing multiple subtypes. This is a promising candidate for a universal influenza vaccine that elicits protective immune responses against seasonal and pre-pandemic strains over multiple seasons.

IAV can be further distinguished into subtypes identified by the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins2. Currently there are 18 identified HAs (H1–H18), divided into two groups3 and 11 identified NAs (N1–N11)4 with H1N1 and H3N2 strains are currently circulating in humans. However, pre-pandemic zoonotic strains, H2, H5, and H7, all have pandemic potential to transmit from avian or swine reservoirs and then between humans5.Influenza viruses have circulated in humans for centuries, though it was not isolated until the beginning of the twentieth century6. Since 1918, there have been four pandemics caused by IAV: 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1), 1957 Asian flu (H2N2), 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2), and 2009 Swine flu (H1N1)7. The 2009 pandemic virus (clade 6B.1) has since replaced the prior seasonal H1N1 strains and is the current lineage circulating in humans8,9. Currently, H3N2 infections are composed of a wider range of strains from two antigenically distinct clades (clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a)8,10. H2Nx, H5Nx, and H7Nx pre-pandemic strains have high potential to transmit to humans, causing outbreaks that result in severe disease and death11.The efficacy of influenza virus vaccines vary year to year, from around 10–60%12. An ideal universal Influenza vaccine would provide durable protection against circulating strains, seasonal and pre-pandemic13. Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology has been utilized to design HA and NA antigens that protect against a broad breadth of strains for each subtype14,15,16,17,18,19. The correlate of protection for influenza has historically been hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titers of antibodies targeting the HA globular head20. Neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers have also been examined as an independent role in protection against infection21. The COBRA methodology aligns multiple layers of consensus sequences to generate a single immunogen which could protect against a large panel of strains for each subtype22. Our previous studies showed monovalent COBRA HA or NA vaccinations elicits wider breadth of immune response compared to wild type counterparts.In this study, mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with multiple COBRA HA and NA immunogens in quadrivalent (H1, H3, N1, N2) or heptavalent (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, N1, N2) regimens formulated with AddaVax™, an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant. These vaccines elicited protective immune responses against a wide breadth of seasonal IAV strains. Heptavalent formulations elicited protective immune responses against a wide breadth of pre-pandemic strains as well. Multivalent COBRA HA and NA proteins are promising candidates for a universal, broadly-reactive influenza vaccine.ResultsCOBRA rHA and rNA elicit antibodies with broadly-reactive HAI activityThe COBRA methodology has been used to design rHA and rNA proteins representing individual subtypes of influenza virus14,15,16,17,18,19. In this study, multivalent vaccine formulations were generated to cover current circulating IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2), as well as future pre-pandemic subtypes (H2, H5, and H7) (Table 1). Mice were vaccinated with recombinant proteins in two different formulations: Quadrivalent formulation consisting of COBRA rHA and rNA representing seasonal subtypes (H1, H3, HAs and N1, N2 NAs) and heptavalent formulation consisted of COBRA rHA and rNA representing both seasonal and pre-pandemic subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 HAs and N1, N2 NAs).Table 1 COBRA vaccine components.Full size tableMice vaccinated with either COBRA formulation had statistically similar HAI titers against a panel of H1N1 strains (Fig. 1a,b). Sera collected from COBRA vaccinated mice had robust HAI activity against currently circulating CA/09-like strains (clade 6B.1), but little HAI activity against older historic H1N1 strains (SI/06 and Bris/07). Mice vaccinated with quadrivalent or heptavalent formulations also had antibodies with HAI activity (≥ 1:40 or higher) against four out of six H3N2 strains in the panel (clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a). KS/17 (clade 3c.3a) and HK/19 (subgroup 3c2.a1b/137F) had average antibody titers less than 1:40 (Fig. 1c,d). Quadrivalent vaccine group had statistically higher HAI antibody titers for SA/19 (subgroup 3c2.a1b/131K) than heptavalent, both groups had HAI activity > 1:80.Figure 1Serum HAI antibody titers for seasonal influenza viruses after vaccination in mice. Immunologically naïve DBA/2J mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) three times at four-week intervals with quadrivalent (left) or heptavalent (right) formulations of COBRA recombinant HA and NA proteins, with AddaVax™ as adjuvant. Sera collected two weeks after final vaccination were used for HAI assay against a panel of (a, b) H1N1 and (c, d) H3N2 viruses. The virus strains are listed along the x-axis. The y-axis indicates the log2 HAI titers for each vaccinated group and presents them as absolute mean values ± SEM. The dotted lines indicate HAI titers ranging from 1:40 (lower line) and 1:80 (upper line). Statistical differences between quadrivalent and heptavalent vaccine groups were analyzed using multiple unpaired t-tests by GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). A p value of less than 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001).Full size imageMice vaccinated with the heptavalent COBRA HA vaccinations had antibodies with HAI activity against a wide breath of H2Nx VLPs (Fig. 2a), representing three different phylogenetic clades17. Antibodies had higher HAI activity against clade 1 viruses (Mal/NL/01 and Duk/Cam/13) compared to clade 2 viruses (T/64 and Duk/HK/78) and clade 3 viruses (Tur/CA/08 and Qu/RI/16). Mice vaccinated with COBRA vaccine had HAI activity that averaged ~ 1:40 or higher against strains from clade 2.2 (ws/Mo/05), subclade 2.2.1 (Eg/07), subclade 2.3.2.1 (Hu/10), and subclade 2.3.4.2 (Gu/13) (Fig. 2b). Antibody titers were lower against clade 1 (VN/04) and subclade 2.3.4.4 (Si/14) H5 viruses. COBRA vaccinations elicited antibody titers ≥ 1:40 for all H7Nx strains representing multiple lineages (Fig. 2c).Figure 2Serum HAI antibody titers for pre-pandemic influenza viruses after vaccination in mice. Immunologically naïve DBA/2J mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) three times at four-week intervals with heptavalent formulations of COBRA recombinant HA and NA proteins, with AddaVax™ as adjuvant. Sera collected two weeks after final vaccination were used for HAI assay against a panel of (a) H2Nx, (b) H5Nx, and (c) H7Nx. The virus strains are listed along the x-axis. The y-axis indicates the log2 HAI titers for each vaccinated group and presents them as absolute mean values ± SEM. The dotted lines indicate HAI titers ranging from 1:40 (lower line) and 1:80 (upper line).Full size imageQuadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA vaccinations elicit antibodies with NAI activitySera from COBRA vaccinated mice were tested for NAI activity. Quadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA groups had robust NAI activity against N1 (Fig. 3a). Quadrivalent COBRA groups had significantly higher NAI50 titer compared to heptavalent (Fig. 3b). NAI activity against N2 was lower for both groups compared to N1 (Fig. 3c), with quadrivalent and heptavalent having similar NAI50 titers (Fig. 3d).Figure 3Serum NAI antibody titers after vaccinations in mice. Immunologically naïve DBA/2J mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) three times at four-week intervals with quadrivalent (green) or heptavalent (blue) formulations of COBRA recombinant HA and NA proteins, with AddaVax™ as adjuvant. Sera collected two weeks after final vaccination were used for NAI assay against (a, b) N1 and (c, d) N2. Sera were diluted two-fold from starting dilution of 1:20 to quantify NAI titer (a, c). Non-linear regression was conducted from these results to obtain reciprocal titer that inhibited 50% of the NA activity (b, d). Statistical differences between NAI50 titers were analyzed by unpaired t-tests by GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). A p value of less than 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001).Full size imageQuadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA vaccinations elicit neutralizing antibodies against seasonal viruses in miceNeutralizing antibody activity was measured by focus reduction assay (FRA) against seasonal influenza viruses (Fig. 4). Heptavalent and quadrivalent COBRA vaccinated groups had similar levels of robust neutralizing activity against H1N1 strains (Fig. 4a,b). Both COBRA groups had higher neutralizing activity against Bris/18 compared to CA/09. Mice vaccinated with the quadrivalent COBRA HA vaccine had higher neutralization titers against the H3N2 strains compared to sera elicited by the heptavalent COBRA HA vaccine (Fig. 4c,d). Overall, neutralizing antibody titers correlated with HAI titers with the highest titers against H1N1 influenza viruses and lower titers against H3N2 strains.Figure 4Neutralizing antibody titers for seasonal influenza viruses after vaccination in mice. Immunologically naïve DBA/2J mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) three times at four-week intervals with quadrivalent (green line) or heptavalent (blue line) formulations of COBRA recombinant HA and NA proteins, with AddaVax™ as adjuvant. Sera collected two weeks after final vaccination were pooled for FRA against modern strains of (a, b) H1N1 and (c, d) H3N2 viruses. Top dashed line represents 50% neutralization, bottom dashed line represents 80% neutralization.Full size imageQuadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA vaccines protect mice against multiple subtypes of influenzaNext, the ability of these vaccines to protect against viral challenge was determined (Fig. 5). Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were challenged with either an H1N1 (Bris/18) or H3N2 (KS/17) influenza virus. Mice vaccinated with the adjuvant only and negative control mice had a rapid drop in body weight following Bris/18 infection (Fig. 5a) and all mice reached humane endpoints by day 6 post-infection (Fig. 5b). All mice vaccinated with either set of the COBRA vaccines were protected with little weight loss and all mice survived lethal Bris/18 challenge (Fig. 5a,b). All mice, regardless of vaccination, survived KS/17 (H3N2) virus challenge (Fig. 5c,d) COBRA vaccinated groups had significantly less weight loss on day 2 post infection compared to adjuvant only and negative control mice (Fig. 5c). Subsequently, a mouse-adapted strain of H3N2 was used for challenge. Another set of mice were infected with mouse-adapted A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (MA-Switz/13) (Fig. 5e,f). Mice given no vaccination lost a significant amount of weight, causing 40% mortality. Quadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA vaccinated mice lost 10% or less of original body weight (Fig. 5).Figure 5Protective efficacy against seasonal virus infection in vaccinated mice. Naïve DBA/2J mice (n = 11 per group) were vaccinated i.m. three times at four-week intervals with quadrivalent (green) or heptavalent (blue) formulations of COBRA recombinant HA and NA proteins, with AddaVax™ as adjuvant. Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were intranasally infected with (a, b) lethal dose of A/Brisbane/02/2018 (3 × 106 PFU), (c, d) A/Kansas/14/2017 (6 × 106 PFU), or (e, f) mouse-adapted A/Switzerland/2013 (1 × 105 PFU). The animals were observed for clinical signs and their body weight was recorded daily post infection. Statistical differences after infection with H3N2 was analyzed by multiple unpaired t-tests by GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). A p value of less than 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001).Full size imageViral titers in lungs were quantified after seasonal virus infections. After Bris/18 infection, adjuvant only or negative control mice had high viral lung titers (~ 5 × 107 pfu/g) on day 2 post-infection that remained high on day 6 post-infection (Fig. 6a). Mice vaccinated with either set of COBRA vaccines had viral lung titers that were 4 logs lower (~ 5 × 103 pfu/g) than lung viral titers in mock vaccinated mice at day 2 post infection (Fig. 6a). There were no detectable lung viral titers in COBRA vaccinated mice on day 6. After KS/17 infection, mice vaccinated with adjuvant only or mock vaccinated mice had ~ 1 × 104 pfu/g on day 2 post-infection, but COBRA vaccinated mice had less than 100 pfu/g (Fig. 6b). KS/17 virus was not detectable in the lungs of any mouse on day 6 post-infection. After MA-Switz/13 challenge, quadrivalent COBRA mice had ~ 1 × 104 pfu/g lung viral titer on day 3 post infection, and heptavalent COBRA mice had ~ 5 × 104 pfu/g on day 3 post infection. Negative control mice had lung viral titers that were 2 logs higher on day 3 post infection, ~ 2 × 106 pfu/g. By day 6 post infection, all COBRA vaccinated mice had no detectable vial lung titers, and negative control mice had ~ 103 pfu/g.Figure 6Lung viral titers after seasonal challenge. Lungs were taken on days 2 or 3 (n = 3) and day 6 (n = 3) post infection with Bris/18 (a), KS/17 (b), or MA_Switz/13 (c). Viral titers in lung tissues are presented as PFU/g on the y-axis.Full size imageHeptavalent COBRA vaccinated mice were also challenged with pre-pandemic influenza viruses (Fig. 7). Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were infected with lethal dose of Sich/14 (H5N6). Mice vaccinated with the adjuvant only or mock vaccinated mice lost greater than 20% of their original body weight by day 6–7 post-infection (Fig. 7a). All mock vaccinated or adjuvant only vaccinated mice reached humane endpoints by days 5–7 post-infection with no mice surviving challenge. In contrast, mice vaccinated with the heptavalent COBRA vaccine lost little or no body weight and all mice survived Sich/14 challenge (Fig. 7b). A second set of heptavalent COBRA vaccinated mice were challenged with lethal dose of Anh/13 (H7N9) that lost ~ 10% body weight by day 6 post-infection, but then regained body weight throughout the course of the 14-day observation (Fig. 7c) with all mice surviving infection (Fig. 7d). All adjuvant only or negative control mice reached humane endpoints on days 5 and 6. A third set of mice were challenged with mal/MN/08 (H2N3) (Fig. 7e,f). All heptavalent COBRA vaccinated mice survived challenge, where as negative control mice had 60% mortality (Fig. 7e).Figure 7Protective efficacy against pre-pandemic virus infection in vaccinated mice. Immunologically naïve DBA/2J mice (n = 11 per group) were vaccinated i.m. three times at four-week intervals heptavalent (blue line) formulation of COBRA recombinant HA and NA proteins, with AddaVax™ as adjuvant. Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were intranasally infected with (a, b) lethal dose of A/Sichuan/26221/2014 (106 PFU) or (c, d) lethal dose of A/Anhui/01/2013 (102 PFU), or (e, f) A/mallard/Minnesota/AI08-3437/2008 (104 PFU) in 50 µL volume. The animals were observed for clinical signs and their body weight was recorded daily post infection.Full size imageViral lung titers were quantified on days 3 and 6 after infection with pre-pandemic strains. After Sich/14 infection, adjuvant only or mock vaccinated mice had high viral lung titers (~ 106–107 pfu/g) on days 3 and 6 post-infection (Fig. 8a). Low viral lung titers (102–103 pfu/g) were detected in a few of the COBRA vaccinated mice on day 3 and 6 post-infection. Viral lung titers were detectable in all Anh/13 challenge mice on day 3 post-infection, however heptavalent COBRA vaccinated mice had viral titers that were 4 logs lower than mock or adjuvant only vaccinated mice (Fig. 8b). These viral lung titers declined in all mice by day 6 post-infection, but there were still high viral lung titers in adjuvant only or mock vaccinated mice (5 × 106 pfu/g) (Fig. 8b). After H2N3infection, some heptavalent COBRA mice had detectable viral lung titers on day 3 (< 102 pfu/g) and undetectable viral lung titers by day 6. Negative control mice had higher lung viral titers (~ 104–105 pfu/g) on day 3, which had not decreased by day 6.Figure 8Lung viral titers after pre-pandemic challenge. Lungs were taken on day 3 (n = 3) and day 6 (n = 3) post infection with Sich/14 (a), Anhui/17 (b), or mal/MN/08 (c). Viral titers in lung tissues are presented as PFU/g shown on the y-axis.Full size imageDiscussionCurrent influenza vaccines are composed of three to four seasonal strains that have to be updated annually23,24. It is difficult to predict the current circulating strain due to mutations in the antigenic surface glycoproteins (antigenic drift), resulting in vaccine mismatch and lower protective efficacy25. Pandemic outbreaks are even more difficult to predict and prepare. Often, random reassortment events between two or more influenza viruses (antigenic shift) create novel influenza A viruses against which humans have little to no immune protection5. Pre-pandemic influenza vaccine development and production are more costly and time consuming than development of seasonal influenza virus vaccines11,26. It is more effective to have pre-emptive vaccine strategies instead of reactive vaccine strategies for pre-pandemic viruses27.Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology uses multi-layered consensus alignment of circulating strains to design an immunogen that reflects the antigenic evolution of the subtype while maintaining conserved epitopes22. Monovalent, single COBRA antigens elicited cross-protective immune responses compared to single wild type HA or NA counterparts14,15,16,17,18,19. The HA trimer is responsible for cell entry and membrane fusion28. Antibodies directed against HA neutralizes virus by inhibiting attachment and entry29. The NA tetramer has enzymic activity that releases newly formed virus from infected cells30. NA works in tandem with HA, resulting in effective infection and spread31,32. Prior to this study, multivalent combinations of COBRA HA combined with COBRA NA immunogens had not been tested in vivo. COBRA HA and NA immunogens were selected to represent different subtypes. Each COBRA immunogen selected for this study has previously demonstrated to elicit wider breadth of antibody responses than wild type comparators and other previously designed COBRA constructs (Table 1).In this study, quadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA vaccinations provided robust protective antibody responses against many IAV subtypes. Both of these vaccine formulations elicited similar broadly reactive HAI antibodies against a panel of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains (Fig. 1). In addition, COBRA heptavalent vaccines elicited HAI responses against pre-pandemic subtypes H2Nx, H5Nx, and H7Nx, with antibody binding spanning multiple clades for each subtype (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that a large number of COBRA antigens can be administered together to increase breadth without reduction in antibody titers.For H1 HAIs, both vaccines elicited robust antibody response against A(H1N1)2009 pandemic strains (CA/09, Mich/15, Bris/18, GD/19) (Fig. 1a,b). There was no reactivity to historical H1 strains (SI/86, Bris/07). Our group has previously designed COBRA immunogens which elicited HAI response against historic strains in mice33. However, since the historic strains have been completely replaced by the A(H1N1)2009 lineage34, we utilized the Y2 COBRA which are based on strains that are currently circulating15. The design of the Y2 COBRA was based on strains from 2016 to 2019 (Table 1), which may explain the increased neutralization titers for Bris/18 compared to CA/09 (Fig. 4a,b). Currently circulating H1 viruses are more similar to Bris/18 compared to CA/0934.Our group tested monovalent NA COBRA vaccines and demonstrated breadth and efficacy of protection19,35. In this study, we showed that multivalent COBRA vaccinations which included COBRA N1 and N2 elicited antibodies that inhibited NA activity against N1 and N2 (Fig. 3). Recombinant proteins were generated by our lab and used for NAI assays, since using wild type virus would cause steric hindrance by HA antibodies in the mouse sera and resulting in non-specific NA inhibition36,37.Quadrivalent and heptavalent COBRA vaccinated mice were protected against seasonal IAV challenges (Fig. 5). Both COBRA vaccine groups were protected against lethal H1N1 challenge and had lower viral lung titers compared to mock vaccinated mice (Fig. 5b, 6a). Wild-type seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses do not replicate well in mice38, thus all mice challenged with KS/17 survived, including control groups (Fig. 5c,d). COBRA vaccinated mice had less weight loss (significant on day 2 post challenge) and decreased viral lung titers compared to adjuvant only and mock vaccinated mice (Fig. 6b), despite a titer < 1:40 HAI against KS/17. A mouse-adapted strain of H3N2 (MA-Switz/13) was subsequently used in order to better demonstrate vaccine protection. Both COBRA vaccine groups were completely protected against infection, while 40% of mice given no vaccination reached humane endpoints (Fig. 5e,f).The correlate of protection elicited by seasonal influenza vaccines in humans has historically been associated with an HAI titer of 1:40 or greater39. In this study, as well as others, the 1:40 HAI titer does not necessarily correlate with protection against pre-pandemic potential from subtypes such as H2, H5, and H7. In addition, recent human infections studies indicate that anti-HA stem and anti-NA antibodies elicit protective immunity independent of hemagglutination inhibition of receptor binding20,40,41. HA stem-based antibodies are more conserved and cross reactive compared to HA head binding antibodies42,43. Anti-stem HA antibodies can aid in neutralization by inhibiting fusion44 and has antiviral activity via Fc-receptor mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)45. Anti-NA antibodies can reduce the spread of virus by inhibiting release of viral progeny46.NA vaccines have not been as extensively examined compared to HA47. NA is considered to be immunosubdominant to HA after infection and vaccination4,48. There are more HA molecules present on the surface of the virus compared to NA49, contributing to higher levels of anti-HA antibodies after natural infection50. Unlike HA, inactivated influenza virus vaccines have varied amounts of NA in the composition that is not standardized between production lots51. However, vaccinating with monovalent COBRA NA reduced lung viral titers in vaccinated mice compared to controls following influenza virus infection19. Combining NA in an influenza vaccine would complement HA, since antigenic drift of HA and NA are independent of each other52, and NA has lower mutation rates than HA53.COBRA heptavalent vaccinations elicited broad breadth of antibody responses against pre-pandemic subtypes H2, H5, and H7 (Fig. 2). Recent human infections of avian H5 and H7 are causes for concern54. Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu virus emerged in 1996 and have caused outbreaks in over 60 countries and infected over 800 humans with a fatality rate of almost 53%55,56. Since 2013, there have been six H7N9 outbreaks with over 1500 confirmed infections and over 600 deaths57,58. Heptavalent COBRA vaccinations protected mice from lethal doses of viruses with pandemic potential. The H5 challenge virus in this study (Si/14) is from subclade 2.3.4.4, which recently had an abrupt and widespread global distribution59. It originated from the highly pathogenic H5 strain A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (gs/GD/96, clade 2.3.4) that has been responsible for hundreds of deaths since its emergence in 199760. All vaccinated mice survived lethal H7 Anh/13 infection as well. Anh/13 virus was not cleared as quickly as the other three infections, which is indicated by the slower recovery in weight.The current wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infection in wild birds and poultry have caused global alarm55. Since 2020, this virus from the 2.3.4.4b subclade has overtaken other circulating H5Nx subtypes, causing outbreaks in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America61,62,63. Currently, this is the largest of the three H5Nx viral outbreaks since 2005 resulting in ~ 200 million poultry deaths by the end of 202264. This wave is infecting not only wild birds and domestic poultry, but marine mammals as well61,65,66 with a human mortality in Cambodia in 2023. Transmission of H5Nx to humans is not completely understood, but change in sialic receptor preference from α-2,3 to α-2,667 and six mutations in HA protein (Q222L, G224S, E186D, K189R, S223N, and N182K)68 are linked to infectivity of human cells in the upper respiratory tract. In the past decade, human infections have been from subclades 2.2.1 and 2.3.4.4 viruses59,69,70. In February 2023, it was reported that two human H5N1 (subclade 2.3.2.1c) infections occurred in Cambodia71. COBRA heptavalent vaccination elicited antibodies that recognized viruses representing these clades-Eg/07 (subclade 2.2.1), Sich/14 (subclade 2.3.4.4), and Hu/10 (subclade 2.3.2.1), as well as viruses from other clades.Influenza virus is constantly mutating, making global circulation patterns difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced influenza circulation during the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons, lowering global exposure and immunity. However, following intense COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, influenza cases increased dramatically during the 2022–2023 influenza season, peaking earlier than historical norms, which led to increased disease severity72. Current vaccines are only effective when well-matched to the circulating strains73. The COBRA methodology can capture the antigenic evolution, while maintaining conserved epitopes to protect against past viruses that may re-emerge, currently circulating viruses, and potential future viruses74. The COBRA immunogen can be implemented in many different delivery platforms, such as mRNA and viral vectors. Other influenza virus vaccines use a large number of antigens, up to twenty75,76, in order to elicit protective immune responses against both seasonal and pre-pandemic strains. Due to the breadth of protection from each individual immunogen, COBRA-based HA and NA vaccines would most likely not need as many components included in an influenza virus vaccine.Next steps will include IBV COBRA HA in the formulation to assess efficacy against both IAV and IBV. Seasonal H3 viruses mutate at a higher rate than H1 or IBV77, with two antigenically distinct clades circulating. Including more than one COBRA H3 HA proteins with elicitation of distinct antibody profiles in the vaccine formulation may increase breadth of antibody activity against H3N2 drifted viruses. Since most people have been previously exposed to seasonal influenza viruses, future studies in pre-immune ferrets or humans may reveal the true effectiveness of COBRA based vaccine strategies78. These future studies can confirm that multivalent COBRA HA and NA formulation is a promising candidate for a broadly-reactive influenza virus vaccine.MethodsInfluenza viruses and virus-like particlesInfluenza viruses were obtained through either the Influenza Reagents Resource (IRR), BEI Resources, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or provided by Virapur (San Diego, CA, USA). Viruses were passaged once in the same growth conditions as they were received, either embryonated chicken eggs or semi-confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures as per the instructions provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)79.H1N1 virus lots were titered with 0.8% turkey erythrocytes and made into aliquots for single use applications. H3N2 virus lots were titered with 0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence of 20 nM Oseltamivir, and made into aliquots for single-use applications. H5Nx virus lots were tittered with 1% horse erythrocytes and made into aliquots for single use applications.H1N1 Influenza viruses used in this study include: A/Solomon Islands/03/2006 (SI/06), A/Brisbane/59/2007 (Bris/07), A/California/07/2009 (CA/09), A/Michigan/45/2015 (Mich/15), A/Brisbane/02/2018 (Bris/18), and A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (GD/19).H3N2 Influenza viruses used in this study include: A/Panama/2007/1999 (Pan/99), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (Switz/13, clade 3c.3a); mouse-adapted Switz/13 (MA-Switz/13); A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (HK/14, clade 3c.2a); A/Singapore/IFNIMH-16-0019/2016 (Sing/16, clade 3c.2a1); A/Kansas/14/2017 (KS/17, clade 3c.3a); A/South Australia/34/2019 (SA/19, clade 3c2.a1b/131K); A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (HK/19, clade 3c2.a1b/137F).H5Nx viruses used for this study were PR8 reassortant viruses containing internal genes from the mouse adapted strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Vn/04; H5N1), A/whooper swan/Mongolia/244/2005 (ws/Mo/05; H5N1), A/Egypt/321/2007 (Eg/07; H5N1), A/Hubei/1/2010 (Hu/10; H5N1), A/Guizhou/1/2013 (Gu/13; H5N1), A/Sichuan/26221/2014 (Si/14; H5N6). H7N9 virus used was A/Anhui/01/2013 (Anhui/13; H7N9). For H2Nx and H7Nx HAIs, virus like particles (VLPs) were used instead of BSL-3 level viruses. VLPs were produced as previously described17,80. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 p55 Gag sequence, NA (A/South Carolina/1/1918 H1N1 for H2 VLPs, A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 H5N1 for H7 VLPs), and various wild type H2 or H7 HAs. The cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at low speed and filtered through 0.22 µm sterile filter. Next, VLPs were purified via ultracentrifugation on a 20% glycerol cushion (23,500 g for H2, 100,000 g for H7) for 4 h at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and stored in − 80 °C until use.For H2 HAIs, VLPs produced were: A/Taiwan/1/1964 (T/64), A/Duck/Hong Kong/273/1978 (Duk/HK/78), A/Mallard/Netherlands/13/2001 (mal/NL/01), A/Turkey/California/1797/2008 (Tur/CA/08), A/Duck/Cambodia/ 419W12M3/2013 (Duk/Cam/13), A/quail/Rhode Island/2016 (Qu/RI/16). For H7 HAIs, VLPs produced were: Aurkey/Italy/589/2000 (tur/Italy/00), A/blue-winged teal/Ohio/658/2004 (blu/OH/04), A/duck/Jiangxi/3230/2009 (duk/Jia/09), A/Anhui/01/2013 (Anhui/13), A/Hunan/02650/2016 (Hun/16), A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16). A/Mallard/Minesota/AI08-3437/2008 (mal/MN/08, H2N3) virus was used for challenge.Vaccine design and productionComputationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology used to produce influenza HA and NA recombinant proteins representing seasonal and pandemic subtypes. The design and production of these COBRA antigens have been previously published by our lab (Table 1). Briefly, full length wild-type (WT) HA or NA sequences were downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) for each subtype. The sequences were aligned and primary consensus sequences were created from clusters of WT sequences based on percent similarity. Secondary consensus sequences were created from the primary sequences; this multi-layered consensus building way continued until a final COBRA sequence was obtained.The production of recombinant COBRA HA and NA proteins has been previously described81. Briefly, each COBRA HA or NA nucleotide sequence was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 + plasmid vector, being truncated by removing the transmembrane domain and replacing with a T4 fold-on domain, an AviTag, and a 6 × His tag for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The plasmid was transfected into human endothelial kidney 293T (HEK 293T) suspension cells for protein expression. Protein concentration of the purified soluble proteins were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).Mouse vaccination and infectionDBA/2J mice (females, 6–8 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The mice were housed in microisolator units, and allowed free access to food and water. All animals were cared for under the USDA guidelines for laboratory animals, and all procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (no. A2018 06-018-Y3-A16). The mice were randomly divided into four vaccine groups (n = 44) and each vaccine group had four different infection groups (n = 11). The vaccine groups were quadrivalent COBRA formulation, consisting of seasonal components H1 HA (Y2), H3 HA (NG2), N1 NA (N1I), and N2 NA (N2A); heptavalent COBRA formulation, consisting of seasonal Y2, NG2, N1I, N2A along with pandemic components H2 HA (Z1), H5 HA (IAN 8), and H7 HA (Q6); adjuvant only; or negative control. The vaccines were formulated with 3 µg of each recombinant protein or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Corning, Tewkbury, MA, USA) and adjuvanted with an emulsified squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax™ (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) at 1:1 ratio. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly (i.m.) into the hind leg of the animals on day 0, 28, and 56 in a homologous prime-boost-boost regimen. Blood was collected from the facial vein 14 days following each vaccination, on day 14, 42, and 70. Sera was isolated from the blood by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min in BD Microtainer blood collection tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Clarified serum was removed and frozen at − 20 °C.Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 50 µL volume of live influenza virus: lethal dose of Bris/18 (3 × 106 PFU), KS/17 (6 × 106 PFU), MA-Switz/13 (1 × 105 PFU), Mal/MN/08 (1 × 104 PFU), lethal dose of H5N6 Sich/14 (106 PFU), or lethal dose of Anhui/13 (102 PFU, under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions). Following infection, the animals’ body weights were recorded daily, and the animals were monitored twice daily for clinical signs (labored breathing, lethargy, hunched back, ruffled fur, failure to respond to stimuli, and severe respiratory distress) for 14 days. Weight loss more than 25% was used as a primary measurement for determination of humane endpoint. On days 2 or 3 and 6 after infection, three animals from each group were sacrificed, and lungs were collected to assess viral load. Lungs were frozen on dry ice and stored at − 80 °C. Remaining mice (n = 5) were euthanized 14 days after challenge.All animal procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (no. 2018 06-018-Y3-A16) and performed in accordance with the National Research Council (NRC) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Animal Welfare Act, and the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories. This study was reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines82.Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assayThe hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay was used to assess functional antibodies to the HA that are able to inhibit agglutination of turkey erythrocytes for H1N1 viruses and H2, H7 VLPs. Horse erythrocytes were used for PR8 reassortant H5 viruses. Guinea pig erythrocytes were used for H3N2 viruses. Guinea pig red blood cells are frequently used to characterize contemporary A(H3N2) influenza strains that have developed a preferential binding to α2,6-linked sialic acid receptor83. The protocols were adapted from the WHO laboratory influenza surveillance manual1. To inactivate nonspecific inhibitors, sera samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Co., Japan) prior to being tested. Briefly, three parts of RDE was added to one part of sera and incubated overnight at 37 °C. RDE was inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 30 min.RDE-treated sera were diluted in a series of two-fold serial dilutions in v-bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume of each virus or VLP, adjusted to approximately 8 hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 µl was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 0.8% turkey erythrocytes (or 1% horse erythrocytes for H5) (Lampire Biologicals, Pipersville, PA, USA) in PBS were added. Prior to use, the red blood cells (RBCs) were washed twice with PBS, stored at 4 °C, and used within 24 h of preparation. The plates were mixed by gentle agitation, covered, and the RBCs were allowed to settle for 30 min (or 1 h for H5) at room temperature. The HAI titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last well that contained non-agglutinated RBCs. Positive and negative serum controls were included for each plate.Similarly, for H3N2 HAI, RDE-treated sera were diluted in a series of two-fold serial dilutions in v-bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume of each H3N2 virus, adjusted to approximately 8 HAU/50 µl in the presence of 20 nM Oseltamivir carboxylate, was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then 0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes (Lampire Biologicals) in PBS were added. Prior to use, the RBCs were washed twice with PBS, stored at 4 °C, and used within 24 h of preparation. The plates were mixed by gentle agitation, covered, and the RBCs were allowed to settle for 1 h at room temperature. The HAI titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last well that contained non-agglutinated RBCs. Positive and negative serum controls were included for each plate.All mice were negative (HAI ≤ 1:10) for pre-existing antibodies to human influenza viruses prior to infection or vaccination, and for this study, a positive HAI reaction (HAI +), or “sero-protection”, is defined as an HAI titer ≥ 1:40, and “seroconversion” refers to a fourfold increase in titer compared to baseline, as per the WHO and European Committee for Medicinal Products to evaluate influenza vaccines84.Focus reduction assayFocus reduction assay (FRA) was used the assess the ability of polyclonal sera from vaccinated mice to neutralize H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in vitro, as previously described85. Briefly, MDCK-SIAT1 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate in media (DMEM containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin–streptomycin). RDE-treated mouse sera were serially diluted twofold starting at 1:20 dilution in virus growth medium (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, penicillin–streptomycin, and 1 mg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin). 50 mL of sera were added to the cell monolayers. Afterward, 50 µL of virus (600 focus forming units (FFU)/50 µL) were added and the plates incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were overlaid with 1.2% Avicel (FMC Health and Nutrition, Philidelphia, PA) in 2 × modified Eagle medium containing 0.1% BSA, penicillin–streptomycin, and 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. Plate were incubated 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The overlays were removed and the cell monolayers washed with PBS to remove any residual Avicel. The plates were fixed with 4% formalin and cells were permeablized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS/glycine. The plates were washed with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with monoclonal antibody against influenza A or B nucleoprotein from IRR. After washing three times, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse peroxidase labeled IgG (474-1802; SeraCare, Inc, Milford, MA) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times and infectious foci were visualized by adding TrueBlue substrate (SeraCare) containing 0.03% H2O2 to the cells for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by washing with distilled water five times. The foci were counted using BioSpot analyzer with ImmunoCapture 6.4.87 software (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH). The virus control well containing no sera was used for comparison of focus reduction.Neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assayIn order to assess NAI activity from polyclonal mouse sera, recombinant NA proteins representing wild type strains were generated in our lab as an alternative to using whole virus. This was done to prevent HA binding antibodies in the sera from inhibiting NA activity via steric hindrance36,37. Bris/18 (N1) and Switz/13 (N2) soluble tetrameric NA proteins were produced as previously described81. Briefly, NA nucleotide sequences were cloned into a pcDNA3.3-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific), transiently transfected into EXPI293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the ExpiFectamine 293 transfection kit protocol, and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Protein concentrations determined by BCA. NA acitivty was determined by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) as previously described19: high-affinity Immunoblot 4HBX 96-well flat bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 100μL of 25μL/mL fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in commercial KPL coating buffer (Seracare Life Sciences, Milford, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed 3× in PBS-T (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and serial dilutions of rNA in sample diluent (Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.133 g/L CaCl2 and 0.1 g/L MgCl2 (DPBS) + 1% BSA + 0.5% Tween 20) were added to the plates and incubated for 17 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed 6×, and 100 µL of peanut agglutinin-HRPO (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1,000 fold in conjugate diluent (DPBS + 0. 1% BSA) was added. Plates were incubated for 2 h at RT. Plates were washed 3× and 100 µL of 500 µg/mL of o-phenylenediamine dihydrchloride (OPD) in 0.05 M phosphate-citrate buffer with 0.03% sodium perborate pH 5.0 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 10 min at RT in the dark. 100 µL of 1N sulfuric adic was added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was read at 490 nm using the Biotek spectrophotometer (Epoch 2; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Linear regression analysis was used to determine the concentration of rNA to use in NAI assay (90–95% NA activity).To analyze NAI activity of polyclonal sera after vaccination, 50 µL two-fold serial dilutions of vaccinated mouse sera in sample diluent was combined with 50 µL rNA antigen (in the optimal concentration determined above). This mixture was placed in 96-well fetuin-plates (previously coated overnight then washed 3×) and incubated for 17 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed 6× and incubated with 100 µL peanut agglutinin-HRPO for 2 h at RT. Plates were washed 3× and 100µL OPD added for 10 min at RT in the dark. 100 µL 1N sulfuric adic was added to stop the reaction. Plates were read at 490 nm on the Biotek spectrophotometer. NA percent activity was determined by substracting the mean background absorbance of the negative-control wells and dividing the serum absorbance by the mean virus positive-control wells muiltipled by 100. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine 50% NAI titer on GraphPad Prism.Influenza viral plaque assayFor mouse lung plaque assay, MDCK cells (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were seeded into each well of a six-well plate at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well one day prior to performing the plaque assay. On the day of the assay, frozen lung tissues were thawed on ice were weighed and homogenized in 1 ml of DMEM (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min to remove tissue debris, and the supernatant was collected and subjected a serial tenfold dilution in DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin (DMEM + P/S) (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). When MDCK cells reached 90% confluency in each well, the plates were washed 2× with DMEM + P/S, and infected with 100 µL of each dilution of homogenate supernatant. The plates were then shaken every 15 min for 1 h. After 1 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed and cells were washed twice with fresh DMEM + P/S. Following the second wash, a solution of 2× MEM and 1.6% agarose (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) mixed 50:50 v/v, and supplemented with 1 µg/mL of TPCK trypsin (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was added into each well. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C + 5% CO2 for 72 h. After 72 h, the gel overlays were removed from each well, and the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 10 min and stained with 1% crystal violet (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were then rinsed thoroughly 5× with fresh water to remove excess crystal violet. Plates were allowed to air dry for 24 h and the viral plaques were enumerated as the reciprocal of each dilution. The lung viral titers were calculated and presented as plaque forming units (PFU)/g of lung tissue.Statistical analysisData is presented as absolute mean values ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA, unpaired multiple t tests, and two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons were used to analyze the statistical differences between vaccine groups using GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). A “p” value less than 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001).

As we continue to monitor the death of innumerable species and track the movement of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) into mammal populations, we must strengthen the focus on integrating the surveillance of emerging influenza clades in wild birds and mammals to support critical vaccine libraries. “H5N1 now presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity. It has infected over 150 wild and domestic avian species around the globe as well as a dozens of mammalian species. The bird flu outbreak is the worst globally and also in U.S. history, with hundreds-of-million birds dead since it first turned up in domestic waterfowl in China in 1996. Bird flu is highly transmissible, spread through droplet and feces-borne infections, and exacerbated by climate-change-altering migration schedules for birds and its repeated re-circulation in domestic poultry. “Globally, HPAI H5N1 has now infected many mammals—including foxes, pumas, skunks, and both black and brown bears in North America. Some 700 endangered Caspian seals died from HPAI near Dagestan in 2023. Additionally, outbreaks in mink farms in Spain and Finland that serve as potential mixing vessels for reassortment have also been documented. HPAI H5N1 has arrived in Latin America with devastating consequences, afflicting multiple countries that include WCS land- and seascapes in Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, and Argentina. “Sampling efforts suggest that more than 95 percent of the Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pups born along 300 km of the Patagonia coastline died at the end of 2023. It’s the first report of massive elephant seal mortality in the area from any cause in the last half century. The sight of elephant seals found dead or dying along the breeding beaches can only be described as apocalyptic. This 2023 die-off contrasts starkly with the 18,000 pups born and successfully weaned in 2022. “As the virus continues to spread through mammal populations, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on public health officials to prepare for a potential spillover of H5N1 to people. The "R naught" value—or the number of people infected by a single infected person—for COVID initially ranged from 1.5 to 7. For H5N1 among birds, it is around 100. It is imperative that we take a collaborative One Health approach to identifying emerging strains of bird flu across the globe to support the development of specific and universal vaccines that can quickly treat infection in people to prevent another pandemic. “The cost of inaction is already causing major devastation to wildlife. As we work to help affected populations recover, we must remain vigilant against the spread of this deadly pathogen to people before it’s too late.” Background Wildlife Conservation Society Health Program In the last few decades, it has become increasingly evident that conservation, our own health, and the health of wild and domestic animals are all inextricably linked. A single pathogen can wipe out the last populations of an endangered species and, in turn, threaten the stability of local human populations. Thus there is an urgent need to simultaneously address the health of people, animals and the environment recognizing that disease poses challenges to both conservation of the planet's biodiversity and efforts to improve the quality of human life. Additional Background: Global leaders in wildlife and human health issued 10 principles – The Berlin Principles – with an urgent call to governments, academia, and civil society that all sectors need to break down barriers to ensure a united effort to prevent the emergence or resurgence of diseases that threaten humans, wildlife, and livestock. COMUNICADO DE PRENSA DE WCS Contacto: Mary Dixon, mdixon@wcs.org; +1 347-840-1242 Mensaje Urgente de WCS Mientras el Virus de la Influenza Aviar Amenaza la Vida Silvestre en Todo el Mundo La mortandad masiva de elefantes marinos en Argentina debido a la gripe aviar es la última señal de que el virus es una amenaza para la vida silvestre Nueva York, 15 de enero de 2024 – La Sociedad para la Conservación de la Vida Silvestre (Wildlife Conservation Society, WCS por sus siglas en inglés) emite la siguiente declaración urgente sobre la influenza aviar H5N1 debido a la mortandad en curso de vida silvestre en todo el mundo: El Dr. Chris Walzer, Director Ejecutivo de Salud de WCS, dijo: "Con la aterradora mortandad de animales en todo el mundo debido a la gripe aviar, WCS hace un llamado a los gobiernos para que traten esta creciente crisis con la urgencia que exige. A medida que continuamos registrando la muerte de innumerables especies, y estudiando la transmisión de la influenza aviar causada por una variedad altamente patógena de este virus en las poblaciones de aves y mamíferos, debemos fortalecer la integración en la vigilancia de las variantes de influenza emergentes en aves y mamíferos silvestres para sostener las bases de datos relacionadas con el desarrollo de vacunas críticas. "El H5N1 representa ahora una amenaza a la biodiversidad del mundo. Ha infectado a más de 150 especies de aves silvestres y domésticas, así como a docenas de especies de mamíferos. El actual brote de gripe aviar es el peor registrado a nivel mundial para esta enfermedad, también para los Estados Unidos, con cientos de millones de aves muertas desde que se registró por primera vez en aves domésticas, en China, en 1996. La influenza aviar es altamente transmisible, se propaga a través de la respiración y las heces. El problema se profundiza a partir de la interacción entre aves silvestres y especies domesticas mantenidas en criaderos para consumo humano, al igual que por el cambio climático, que altera la migración de aves silvestres. "A nivel mundial, la gripe aviar altamente patógena H5N1 ha infectado a muchos mamíferos: zorros, pumas y osos negros y pardos, en América del Norte. Unas 700 focas del Caspio, en peligro de extinción, murieron este año de gripe aviar altamente patógena, cerca de la República de Daguestán. También se han documentado brotes en criaderos de visones, en España y Finlandia, que sirven a los procesos de mutación y generación de nuevas variantes del virus. La gripe aviar altamente patógena H5N1 ha llegado a América del sur con consecuencias devastadoras, afectando a varios países en los que WCS tiene programas terrestres y marinos, como Perú, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador y Argentina. "Los muestreos sugieren que el 97 por ciento de las crías de elefante marino del sur (Mirounga leonina), nacidas a lo largo de 300 km de la costa patagónica de la Argentina, han muerto entre septiembre y octubre de este año. Es el primer evento de mortalidad masiva de elefantes marinos en la zona en el último medio siglo. La imagen de elefantes marinos muertos o moribundos a lo largo de las playas de cría solo puede describirse como apocalíptica. La mortalidad ocurrida esta primavera contrasta marcadamente con las 18.000 crías nacidas y destetadas con éxito en 2022. "A medida que el virus continúa propagándose a través de las poblaciones de mamíferos, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha pedido a los funcionarios de salud pública que se preparen para un posible contagio del H5N1 a las personas. El valor "R cero", o el número de personas infectadas por una sola persona infectada, para COVID inicialmente osciló entre 1.5 y 7. En el caso del H5N1, y entre las aves, es de alrededor de 100. Es imperativo que adoptemos el enfoque colaborativo de "una sola salud” como lema de salud global para el planeta, a los fines de identificar las cepas emergentes de gripe aviar y apoyar el desarrollo de vacunas específicas y universales que puedan tratar rápidamente la infección en las personas para prevenir otra pandemia. "El costo de la inacción ya está causando una gran devastación a la vida silvestre. A medida que trabajamos para ayudar a las poblaciones afectadas a recuperarse, debemos permanecer atentos frente a la propagación de este patógeno mortal a las personas antes de que sea demasiado tarde". ### Programa de Salud de Wildlife Conservation Society En las últimas décadas, se ha vuelto cada vez más evidente que la conservación de la vida silvestre, la salud humana y la de los animales silvestres y domésticos, están inextricablemente vinculadas. Un solo patógeno puede acabar con las últimas poblaciones de una especie en peligro de extinción, amenazar la estabilidad de las poblaciones de especies relativamente saludables e impactar al ser humano. Por lo tanto, es urgente abordar simultáneamente la salud humana, la de muchas especies animales y la del ambiente, reconociendo que las enfermedades plantean desafíos tanto para la conservación de la biodiversidad global como para los esfuerzos por mejorar la calidad de la vida del ser humano. Antecedentes adicionales: Los líderes mundiales en vida silvestre y salud humana emitieron 10 principios, los Principios de Berlín, con un llamado urgente a los gobiernos, la academia y la sociedad civil para que todos los sectores eliminen las barreras para garantizar un esfuerzo conjunto para prevenir la aparición o el resurgimiento de enfermedades que amenazan a los seres humanos, la vida silvestre y el ganado.

In our third winter since the COVID-19 pandemic, the respiratory disease season has hit with several respiratory viruses circulating simultaneously.Â We know that itâs possible to have flu and COVID-19 at once and that having both â or having one infection right after another â weakens the patient significantly and can lead to severe, sometimes life-threatening disease.Â We can help prevent flu-related hospitalizations and deaths thanks to vaccines. But too many older adults are just not getting their flu vaccine this season. Rates of flu vaccinations have tumbled more than 5% points in the US since a peak level of 75% coverage among older adults in 2020.1 We see similar trends in major European markets as well, including France, Germany, and Italy, where rates of vaccination have also declined over the last year, and in some cases, not even reaching 50% of the populations.2Â While it was observed in scientific studies that Â both COVID-19 and flu vaccines could be administered Â together without any safety concerns, little proactive public information has been out to older adults to reassure them on this point.3, 4Â The need for older adults to get both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines has perhaps also contributed to creating general fatigue about getting yet another shot. This is a worrisome trend for the public health community.Â We cannot control influenza epidemics, but we can mitigate their impact with high levels of vaccination coverage across the population, particularly amongst older adults, as this helps prevent flu-related complications like pneumonia5, heart attacks and strokes.6, 7, 8, 9 Protecting Heart Health: Flu Vaccines and Beyond - More information here.Itâs important for older adults to understand that in the short term, they should continue getting their once-annual shot, and that they can ask for vaccines developed specifically for their weaker immune systems.10 At Sanofi, weâre deep into the development of a new approach to influenza vaccination, one that we hope will change the game in the future when it comes to getting the flu vaccine.Â We are working to target influenza strains that could provide broader protection against a vast number of influenza strains, so that no matter what circulates, older adults would be better protected.

[+] livestock and even wild birds and wildlife globally.getty Whilst humans were busy with the Covid-19 pandemic, the world’s birds and wildlife were hit hard by a pandemic of H5N1 avian influenza. “H5N1 now presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity,” warned Chris Walzer, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Executive Director of Health, in a statement. “It has infected over 150 wild and domestic avian species around the globe as well as dozens of mammalian species. The bird flu outbreak is the worst globally and also in U.S. history, with hundreds-of-millions of birds dead since it first turned up in domestic waterfowl in China in 1996.” The so-called “bird flu” is highly transmissible both through airborne droplets and feces-borne infections. The worsening climate crisis is exacerbating it because wild birds are altering their schedules to coincide with optimal migration weather. Thus, the flu virus’s circulation continues and grows, thanks to intensive egg and poultry farming and its characteristically filthy and overcrowded cages crammed with sick and dead birds. This horrific environment is superb for encouraging influenza to mutate into ever-more contagious and deadly forms, through a process known as genetic ‘reassortment’. These increasingly virulent flu viruses then spill over into wild birds that quickly carry it far and wide whilst they migrate, often with devastating consequences. “First, Great Skuas began dying across islands in Scotland in summer 2021,” reported the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). “Then in winter 2021/22 on the Solway Firth, bird flu killed a third of the Svalbard breeding population of Barnacle Geese – at least 13,200 birds. In winter 2022/23, up to 5,000 Greenland Barnacle Geese died on Islay, as well as hundreds of ducks, swans, gulls and other geese species. Birds of prey such as Peregrine Falcon, Hen Harrier, Buzzard, White-tailed Eagle and Golden Eagle have also been testing positive.” MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023ByCassidy HortonContributor In fact, almost all of the 77 species of seabirds that breed in the UK have tested positive for H5N1. Unfortunately, documenting this virus in wild birds underestimates the total species diversity as well as the true number of wild birds killed by bird flu. This is because the surveillance scheme only tests dead birds, and not all dead wild birds are reported or collected. Further, a large diversity of mammals are now dying from HPAI, too. “Globally, HPAI H5N1 has now infected many mammals — including foxes, pumas, skunks, and both black and brown bears in North America,” Dr Walzer noted. Additionally, it was just reported that a wild polar bear tested positive for H5N1 in Alaska — the first influenza death ever documented in this species (more here). “Some 700 endangered Caspian seals died from HPAI near Dagestan in 2023,” Dr Walzer continued. Troublingly, influenza outbreaks in Spain and Finland have also been documented in farmed mink. This is especially dangerous because these small mammals — which, like poultry, are kept in filthy, overcrowded and unhealthy conditions — provide ample opportunities for viral reassortment so it can easily begin to infect other mammals (don’t forget that humans are mammals too) whilst simultaneously increasing its virulence. This increasingly dangerous HPAI influenza is now found in the Global South, especially along its coasts, because it was carried there by infected migrating seabirds. Hunting or opportunistically scavenging mammals that eat these dead or dying birds can thus be exposed to very large quantities of the virus. This provides H5N1 with a convenient pathway to sneak in and adapt to a new host population that it does not normally infect. The effects of HPAI influenza can be devastating. “Sampling efforts suggest that more than 95 percent of the Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pups born along 300 km of the Patagonia coastline died at the end of 2023,” Dr Walzer pointed out. “It’s the first report of massive elephant seal mortality in the area from any cause in the last half century. The sight of elephant seals found dead or dying along the breeding beaches can only be described as apocalyptic. This 2023 die-off contrasts starkly with the 18,000 pups born and successfully weaned in 2022.” Could HPAI influenza infect and kill humans, too? Possibly. This concern is especially relevant considering that our health and the health of both wild and domestic animals are inextricably linked. As the global population grows, humans are increasingly moving into previously uninhabited areas, so more humans come into contact with wildlife and their diseases, which increases our pandemic risk. (COVID-19 is but one such example.) Whether it’s H5N1 or a different virus, it’s inevitable that new viruses will continue to emerge and threaten to trigger another human or wildlife pandemic. “As the virus continues to spread through mammal populations, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on public health officials to prepare for a potential spillover of H5N1 to people. The ‘R naught’ value — the number of people infected by a single infected person — for COVID initially ranged from 1.5 to 7. For H5N1 among birds, it is around 100,” Dr Walzer reported. A highly contagious novel pathogen like HPAI influenza that can potentially wipe out entire species can likewise threaten the stability of human populations and societies. For this reason, there is urgent need to safeguard the health of people, their pets and livestock, of wildlife, as well as conserve global biodiversity and protect the natural environment to reduce the threat of emerging diseases. “It is imperative that we take a collaborative One Health approach to identifying emerging strains of bird flu across the globe to support the development of specific and universal vaccines that can quickly treat infection in people to prevent another pandemic,” Dr Walzer advised. “The cost of inaction is already causing major devastation to wildlife,” Dr Walzer pointed out. “As we work to help affected populations recover, we must remain vigilant against the spread of this deadly pathogen to people before it’s too late.” Socials: Bluesky | CounterSocial | Gab | LinkedIn | Mastodon Science | Post.News | Spoutible | SubStack | Threads | Tribel | Tumblr | Twitter Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

However, less is known about the effect of the influenza vaccine on the epigenome. We utilized a targeted DNA methylation approach to study the longitudinal effects (day 0 pre-vaccination and day 28 post-vaccination) on influenza vaccination responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found that baseline, pre-vaccination methylation profiles are associated with pre-existing, protective serological immunity. Additionally, we identified 481 sites that were differentially methylated between baseline and day 28 post-vaccination. These were enriched for genes involved in the regulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, an important regulator of viral responses. Our results suggest that DNA methylation changes to components of the RIG-I pathway are associated with vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, immunization strategies that target this pathway may improve serological responses to influenza vaccination.

Influenza occurs worldwide and causes significant morbidity, and its symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge. In severe cases, its complications may lead to death1. Influenza virus not only affects respiratory organs but also the heart, brain, and muscles2,3,4, and it can be easily spread by respiratory droplets produced from coughing and sneezing5. These viruses are also highly mutable. There are two main types of influenza viruses, A and B. The most common influenza A subtypes are H1N1 and H3N2, and the most common influenza B subtypes, known as lineages, are Yamagata and Victoria6.The most effective way to prevent illness and the spread of influenza virus is through annual vaccination. Influenza vaccines induce antibodies against the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin7. The seasonal influenza vaccine can induce HA-specific antibody titers, which can be measured using the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to quantity functional antibodies that block virus agglutination of turkey erythrocytes.Pre-vaccination factors, including age, prior infection, vaccination history, immune cell frequencies, and transcriptomic profiles are known to be associated with differential responses to influenza vaccination8. However, epigenetic regulation of responsiveness to influenza vaccination is mostly unexplored and may provide insights into mechanisms underpinning the immune response to influenza vaccination.DNA methylation (DNAm) is one of the most widely studied epigenetic mechanisms. It involves the transfer of a methyl group onto the fifth carbon position of cytosine residues. DNAm is associated with gene regulation and hence many biological processes and diseases9. In humans, DNAm appears predominantly in the CpG dinucleotide context. The human genome is not methylated uniformly, and CpG islands are usually hypomethylated10. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods can be applied to bisulfite-converted DNA to profile DNAm. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS) are two approaches that can be used to measure DNAm levels across CpG sites11.Previous studies have shown that influenza virus infection induces changes in DNAm. One study examined 24 genes known to be involved in the inflammatory response and found that the promoters for 7 genes had significant changes in methylation levels They also observed that strains of influenza viruses with different virulence may affect methylation levels at these promoter regions12. Using site-specific mutant knock in mice and region-specific demethylation tools, one study was able to confirm how methylated sites affect interferon I production13.Other studies explored how DNAm affects immunosenescence and how age can affect the response to the influenza vaccine. The comparison of responders and non-responders to the influenza vaccine revealed larger differences in DNAm amongst individuals of older ages, suggesting a larger epigenetic remodeling for older people14. Additionally, another study identified methylation sites correlated with the humoral response to influenza vaccination. They demonstrated that methylation sites used for predicting humoral immune responses showed enrichment for binding sites of polycomb-group proteins and the FOXP2 transcription factor15.However, none of the previous studies examined longitudinal changes in DNAm following vaccination. In this study, we first analyzed the association of pre-vaccination methylation levels with seroprotection against multiple influenza strains measured by the hemagglutination inhibition assay. We further performed a longitudinal analysis of DNAm and found significant changes in genes associated with viral response pathways, such as the regulation of RIG-1 signaling. Our approach demonstrates that DNAm profiling provides insights into the serological response to the influenza vaccine.ResultsInfluenza vaccination cohort demographics and targeted bisulfite sequencingOur study examined cohorts of influenza vaccine recipients enrolled at the University of Georgia from 2016 to 202016, from which we chose in total 55 participants vaccinated in the 2019 cohort (UGA4) who had also previously been vaccinated in the 2018 cohort (UGA3). Participant demographics, as well as pre- and post-vaccination serological immunity to influenza were described in Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 2 (Additional file 2). The vaccine that was administered was Fluzone, an inactivated, quadrivalent construct consisting of one vaccine substrain from each of the four major subtypes, H1N1, H3N2, Yamagata, and Victoria. For H1N1, the UGA3 vaccine substrain was A/Michigan/45/2015, and UGA4 was A/Brisbane/02/2018. For H3N2, the UGA3 vaccine substrain was A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016, and UGA4 was A/Kansas/14/2017. For Yamagata and Victoria, UGA3 and UGA4 included the same vaccine substrains, which were B/Phuket/3073/2013 and B/Maryland/15/2016, respectively. The proportion of the seroprotected and seroconverted samples for each of the UGA3 and UG4 substrains are shown in Fig. 1B and C).Figure 1Study design overview. (A) Experimental design for this study, 59 subjects at day 0 and 96 subjects at day 28 were vaccinated with licensed Fluzone. Of these participants, 55 were measured on both days. These samples were characterized using targeted bisulfite sequencing (IGV chr17: chr17:77,138,449–77,142,985 SEC14L1) and hemagglutination inhibition assays. (B) The proportion of subjects seroconverted 28 days after receiving the vaccination. (C) The proportion of subjects seroprotected at day 0 and 28 days after receiving the vaccination.Full size imagePeripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at baseline prior to vaccination and 28 days following vaccination. Targeted bisulfite sequencing was performed on 59 individuals for baseline, day 0 (pre-influenza vaccination) and 96 individuals for day 28 (28 days post-influenza vaccination). 55 samples were paired between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination. We sequenced approximately 5000 targeted regions within the genome that were selected based on previous evidence that they were associated with viral infections (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table 3). In total, we quantified levels of DNAm at approximately 70,000 CpG sites. The specific criteria for selecting targeted regions are described in the "Methods" section. BSBolt17 was used to align the reads and quantify methylation levels. The final methylation matrix contained 15,631 CpG sites after requiring that each site be covered by at least 20 reads in all the samples as described in detail in the "Methods" section.Association of pre-vaccination methylation with seroprotection and seroconversion against influenza vaccine substrainsWe first analyzed baseline (day 0) methylation data collected prior to vaccination. Regression analysis adjusted by age, sex, and BMI was performed on each individual CpG site for association with seroprotection at day 0 for the 6 vaccine substrains included in UGA3 and UGA4 (Fig. 2A–F). We found that 121 out of 178 CpG sites that had significant associations with seroprotection (Padj < 0.05) were associated with virus substrains contained only in the Fluzone construct given in UGA3, 54 sites were associated with UGA 3/4 shared strains, and only 3 sites were associated with UGA4 substrains alone.Figure 2Association of pre-vaccination methylation with day 0 seroprotection of 6 vaccine substrains.

(G) Top 10 most significantly enriched pathways that contain genes that are proximal to the union of all significant CpG sites against all targeted background sites.Full size imageTo investigate potential pathways enriched in CpG sites associated with pre-vaccination seroprotection, we pooled the significant sites for the 6 vaccine substrains and mapped them to proximal genes as described in the "Methods" section to perform a gene set enrichment analysis. The most enriched gene set among the 117 genes we identified was associated with the RIG-I signaling pathway (Fig. 2G).We also carried out a regression analysis to measure the association between baseline DNAm levels and seroconversion at day 28 and investigated the same 6 vaccine substrains (Fig. 3A–F). In contrast to the association with seroprotection, 125 out of 141 significant CpG sites associated with seroconversion were for viruses contained only in the UGA4 vaccine. However, when we carried out an analysis of enriched gene sets associated with genes that were proximal to the significant CpG sites we again found that the most significant enrichment was for the RIG-I signaling pathway (Fig. 3G).Figure 3Association of pre-vaccination methylation with seroconversion of 6 vaccine substrains.

(G) Top 10 most significantly enriched pathways that contain genes that are proximal to the union of all significant CpG sites against all targeted background sites.Full size imageTo validate whether DNA methylation in promoter regions have a negative correlation with transcription, we obtained the day 0 pre-vaccination bulk RNA sequencing data for this cohort from a previous study and computed the distribution of the correlation between baseline significant DNA methylation sites and mapped gene expression in the promoter and gene body region18. We observed that as expected DNA methylation in the promoter region is negatively associated with gene expression (Additional file 4: Fig. S1A,B). The RIG-I signaling pathway genes GPATCH3, SEC14L1, C1QBP, and NPLOC4 are expressed, and their promoter methylation sites all displayed hypomethylation patterns (Fig. S1C,D).Cell type deconvolution at day 0 and day 28 and their correlations with phenotypic traitsTo estimate the relative amount of immune cell types contained in each PBMC sample, we carried out cell type deconvolution on both day 0 and day 28 methylation matrices using CellFi19. The reference signature matrices contained four main cell types that are found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC): B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells. We found that there was an increase in the proportion of T cells and a decrease in B cells between day 0 and day 28, although these results were not significant. By contrast, we found a significant decrease in monocytes (Fig. 4A). We also calculated the correlation between cell type proportions and seroprotection and seroconversion against the six vaccine substrains (Fig. 4B). The change in cell type proportion was calculated by using the day 28 cell type proportion minus the day 0 cell type proportion. We found that some cell type abundance changes were significantly correlated with some of the variables. For example, the change in T cell abundance was significantly negatively correlated with age. The full correlation heatmap is shown in Fig. S2 (Additional file 4).Figure 4Cell type deconvolution and correlation with phenotypic traits. (A) Cell type deconvolution for pre-vaccination and 28 days post-vaccination using methylation profiles. Significance of the changes in abundance was calculated using a two-sided paired t-test. (B) The correlation between different cell type proportions and phenotypes. Only significant rows and columns were kept (*Indicates p < 0.05, **Indicates p < 0.01).Full size imageLongitudinal changes in DNA methylation are associated with seroconversionTo analyze the change in methylation after vaccination, we subtracted the day 28 methylation values from the day 0 methylation values (the resulting delta methylation distribution is shown in Fig. 5A). Principal component analysis was performed, and we examined whether there were differences in the first principal component (PC1) between the seroconverters and the non-seroconverters for each of the previously selected six vaccine substrains from both UGA3 and UGA4. We found that PC1 values were mostly lower in the non-seroconverted group (Fig. 5B). We computed the sum of the log2 transformation of the fold change HAI for all four UGA4 substrains and split the seroconverters (n = 29) and the non-converters (n = 26) with a cut-off value of 8. We found significant differences in PC1 between the two groups (Fig. 5C). To identify genes that are associated with the changes in PC1 values, we focused on the top 200 CpG sites that had the largest weight of PC1. These sites were then mapped to 70 proximal genes, and then enrichment analysis was performed. The most significantly enriched pathway was associated with mast cell activation (Fig. 5D). One of the genes, PIK3CD, had reduced methylation 28 days post-vaccination, and is believed to affect the maturation of mast cells via the microphthalmia transcription factor20.Figure 5Changes in methylation from day 0 to day 28 associated with seroconversion.

(D) The top ten most significant enriched pathways of the top 200 largest weight sites of the first principal component.Full size imageDifferentially methylation between days 0 and 28 include sites proximal to genes associated with the RIG-I signaling pathwayWe performed differential methylation analysis on each individual CpG site using a two tailed paired t-test to measure significant changes from day 0 to day 28 (n = 55, and 15,631 CpG sites). There were 481 significantly differentially methylated sites after Bonferroni correction (Fig. 6A). To check if these differentially methylated sites were due to the significant decrease in monocytes, we also conducted a monocyte-specific differential methylation analysis and found no significant sites using CellDMC, which examines the interaction between cell type proportions and the phenotype of interest21. We mapped these differentially methylated sites to proximal genes and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis and reported the top ten most significantly enriched pathways in Table 1. We again found RIG-I signaling to be the most significantly enriched pathway. We show the methylation level changes in the most significant differential methylation site in each of the nine genes that were associated with the RIG-I signaling pathway (Fig. 6B), all of which show an increase in methylation post-vaccination. The second most significant pathway was the regulation of defense response to viruses that includes common influenza virus response genes such as STAT1.Figure 6Differential methylation analysis and RIG-I signaling genes. (A) Negative log transform of the p-value from the paired t-test, with RIG-I signaling pathway significant genes are highlighted in black. The red line indicates significance based on the Bonferroni correction. (B) DNAm level at day 0 and day 28 after vaccination of the 9 significant genes associated with the RIG-I signaling pathway.

We compared the genes identified from each analysis to explore the overlap between these genes and pathways (Fig. 7). Twenty-three genes appeared in all three analyses, and two of them, SEC14L1 and GPATCH3, are involved in negative regulation of RIG-I signaling. Among the overlapping genes between the list of differentially methylated genes and day 0 seroprotection genes, C1QBP and NPLOC4 were also associated with negative regulation of RIG-I signaling. Many other overlapping genes, such as RNF125, have known roles in antiviral immune responses, including the production of type-1 interferons.Figure 7Joint analysis of DMS and baseline inspection. (A) Venn diagram of significant DMS genes, baseline seroprotection genes and baseline seroconversion genes. (B) A table summarizing all the overlapping genes between each of the three categories.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we explored the effect of epigenetic regulation on serological responsiveness to influenza vaccination. Study subjects received the quadrivalent Fluzone vaccine one year prior to sampling for this work (UGA3) and in the study year (UGA4) received an updated construct of Fluzone incorporating the same Yamagata and Victoria Strains, but different H1N1 and H3N2 strains. Pre-vaccination DNAm profiles were associated most strongly with seroprotection against strains only included in Fluzone from UGA3 from the previous year, whereas changes in DNAm post-vaccination were associated with seroconversion against all four strains included in the most recent Fluzone from UGA4. All analyses highlighted epigenetic regulation of RIG-1 signaling, and downstream type-1 interferon responses, as key components of serological response to influenza vaccination.We first examined pre-vaccination methylation as it provides information about the starting immune state of the individuals. We investigated the association of baseline seroprotection of six vaccine substrains found in UGA3 and UGA4 vaccines with baseline methylation. The majority of significant CpG sites were associated with substrains contained in the UGA3 vaccine which was administered the previous year. The H3N2 and Victoria strains from the UGA3 cohort had more associations with the H1N1 and Yamagata strains. A potential explanation is that the H3N2 and Victoria strains were newly introduced in the UGA3 vaccine, whereas the H1N1 and Yamagata strains were the same as those used in the previous 2017 quadrivalent influenza vaccine. This suggests that there is epigenetic memory associated with the influenza strains from prior vaccinations. This may help explain why vaccination history and pre-existing immunity have consistently been identified as predictive of response to vaccination16,22,23, as epigenetic changes from these prior exposures likely persist even if antibody titers wane.We next examined the association of seroconversion for the same vaccine substrains and their association with baseline methylation. We found that baseline methylation is associated with seroconversion (a fold change in HAI from day 28 to day 0) for the UGA4 substrains but not for UGA3. This suggests that the epigenome at baseline is primed to respond to new viral substrains, and that to some degree the epigenetic profile of an individual can forecast whether that individual will seroconvert against the strains found in the vaccine. We also mapped the significant CpG sites for both seroprotection and seroconversion to proximal genes and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis. Interestingly, both results identified the regulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway as most significant, which indicates that this pathway is associated with both baseline protective immunity and immune conversion.We then analyzed the cell type changes after vaccination. We found that there was a slight increase in the proportion of T cells and a slight decrease in B cells, and significant changes in monocytes. Neutrophil levels were low as we expected from PBMC samples, which typically exclude the neutrophil fraction. We computed the correlation between the change in cell types and different variables. Our findings that the change in T cells was negatively correlated with age were consistent with previous studies, which suggested that T cell activation becomes weaker with age24. This result is consistent with the observation that response to vaccination wanes with age25. The observed significant alterations in the relative proportion of monocytes are suggestive of a transition from the innate to the adaptive immune response, which is essential for the induction of protective immunity memory following vaccination. This induction process is mediated by the production of interferons26.Finally, we investigated the change in methylation between baseline and day 28 in relation to protective immunity and immune conversion. We showed that when analyzing changes in DNAm by principal component analysis, the first principal component (PC1) value tended to be lower in the seroconverted group, suggesting there is a global association between longitudinal changes in DNAm and seroconversion. We next sought to identify the sites that contributed most strongly to PC1 and found that the genes mapped to the top 200 sites were enriched in mast cell activation involved in immune responses. Our finding supports previous work that demonstrated that mast cells influence the response to influenza virus infection in mice27. We also mapped significant differentially methylated CpG sites post-vaccination to proximal genes and performed gene ontology enrichment analysis. Again, we find that the RIG-I signaling pathway is associated with longitudinal changes in methylation. Four genes coinciding with baseline seroprotection and seroconversion following vaccination were identified as negative regulators of the RIG-I signaling pathway. An increase in methylation within their promoter regions suggests a downregulation of gene expression, thereby potentially enhancing the activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway. This observation is supported by previous studies that have documented the role of RIG-I pathway activation in enhancing immune responses post-influenza vaccination28.The RIG-I signaling pathway was previously shown to be involved in antiviral responses29,30. Following viral infection, the RIG-I signaling pathway drives the transcription of type-1 interferons, which normally are expressed at low and undetectable levels. Type-1 interferons are a key component of innate immune defense against viral infection, while also promoting initial adaptive immune responses. However, they can also cause immunopathology in acute viral infections, and can lead to immunosuppression and loss of virus control during chronic viral infections31. The genes and DNA methylation CpG sites within the RIG-I signaling pathway and how they contributed to immune response remains to be fully characterized. We identified nine RIG-I signaling genes proximal to differentially methylated sites and investigated their functions based on previous studies and their interactions are depicted in Fig. 8.Figure 8RIG-I pathway summarization with significant differential methylated genes. (A) Generated using BioRender, the full pathway of RIG-I signaling starting from virus detection to interferon production. (B) A summary table of each of the genes’ functions.Full size imageNOP53 is a tumor suppressor protein that translocates to the cytoplasm during viral infection. It was previously found to remove K63-linked ubiquitination, which leads to the decreased transcription of type 1 interferons32. NPLO4 is involved in K48-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding activity33, which also negatively regulates the production of type 1 interferons. USP15 is a positive regulator of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune response and removes polyubiquitin from TRIM25 which promotes its stabilization and enhancement of RIG-I viral responses34. PUM2 is a translational repressor involved in cytosolic viral sensing through LGP2, which itself stimulates type-1 interferon production while regulating RIG-I signaling35,36. BIRC2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; it functions as a repressor of the NF-kB pathway37, which itself is positively regulated by RIG-1 signaling38. TRIM15 is a RIG-I-like receptor protein regulator required for RIG-I signaling and downstream type-1 interferon production32,39. SEC14L, GPATCH3 and C1QBP compete or interact with virus-induced signaling adaptor molecules (VISA), and can disrupt the assembly of virus-induced VISA signalosomes which negatively regulate the RIG-I signaling pathway40,41,42,43.Taken together, these functions suggest epigenetic regulation of RIG-I signaling, and related pathways that control type-1 interferon production, is an important component of influenza vaccine responses. In support of this, adjuvants that activate RIG-I signaling can enhance both serological and cellular response to influenza vaccination44,45,46. While the exact mechanisms behind this effect are incompletely understood, induction of type-1 interferons is consistently identified as a key factor. Future research may be directed toward elucidating the mechanisms by which DNA methylation modifications enhance the specificity of immune responses to distinct viral antigens. Furthermore, investigations could explore the dynamic relationship between the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system and how these are moderated by DNA methylation patterns. Insights from such studies have the potential to contribute to the development of more potent and durable immune responses.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we identified differential methylated sites post-vaccination and baseline methylation profiles associated with protective immunity prior to and following influenza vaccination. Consistent patterns of DNAm were detected near genes involved in the regulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, suggesting that vaccination constructs and/or strategies that enhance activation of this pathway may be beneficial. Our finding also suggests that mast cell activation involved in immune responses could play a role in affecting seroconversion. Finally, certain immune cell type proportions and cell type changes were correlated with the immune response to the influenza vaccine. We find that the epigenome allows us to identify pathways involved in the regulation of responsiveness to influenza vaccination.Material and methodsCohorts of seasonal influenza vaccinationThe cohorts we examined have been described in detail previously16. Briefly, as part of an ongoing study by the University of Georgia, Athens (UGA), a total of 690 participants were recruited during five seasons between 2016 and 2020 (UGA1-5). The study procedures, informed consent, and data collection documents were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Georgia (IRB #3773). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Participants received the split-inactivated influenza vaccine Fluzone by Sanofi Pasteur. For the 2018–2019 season (UGA3), the strains were A/Michigan/15 (H1N1), A/Singapore/16 (H3N2), B/Phuket/2013 (Yamagata lineage), and B/Colorado/2017 (Victoria lineage). For the 2019–2020 season (UGA4), the strains were A/Brisbane/2018 (H1N1), A/Kansas/2017 (H3N2), B/Phuket/2013 (Yamagata lineage), and B/Colorado/2017 (Victoria lineage). Participants provided blood samples on the day of vaccination (Day-0) prior to vaccine administration, and 7/28 days post-vaccination (Day-7 and Day-28). Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays were performed on the Day-0 and Day-28 blood samples against each of the vaccine strains as well as other strains as described in detail in the previous study16. For this study, we selected and analyzed a subset of 55 participants who were enrolled and vaccinated as part of UGA3 and remained enrolled at both time points of UGA4. In this paper, we define seroprotection as the HAI titer and seroconversion as the HAI titer fold change compared to the baseline. A subject is seroprotected if the HAI titer ≥ 1:40, and a subject is seroconverted if the HAI titer fold change ≥ 4.Targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS-seq)Probe selectionThe selection of targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS-seq) CpG probes is based on the following criteria. First, they have been selected to be used in DNA methylation-based aging clocks47. Second, they are located in the promoters (− 1000 bp/ + 250 bp from tss) of viral-response genes associated with SARS and influenza infections48,49,50,51. Third, they have blood and immune cell-type-specific DNAm profiles built using CellFi reference from the Blueprint Epigenome Project19,52. Fourth, they have associations with body metabolism phenotypes such as BMI53,54. The probes that cover the selected CpG sites have been synthesized by IDT, and the coordinates (GRCH38) of the criteria are listed separately in Supplementary Table 3 (Additional file 3).Library preparationUsing the standard phenol–chloroform extraction method for blood samples as described in this paper, DNA was isolated from each individual55. For the TBS-seq library preparation, 500 ng of extracted DNA were used56. Adapter ligation and dA-tailing were performed using the NEBNext Ultra II Library prep kit and custom pre-methylated adapters (IDT)57. Purified libraries were then hybridized to the biotinylated probes. Under the following conditions: 2 min at 98 °C; 14 cycles of (98 °C for 20 s; 60 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 30 s); 72 °C for 5 min; hold at 4 °C. PCR amplification was performed after bisulfite treatment on captured DNA using KAPA HiFi Uracil +. Library quality control was conducted on the high-sensitivity D1000 assay on a 2200 Agilent TapeStation. Two NovaSeq6000 (Sp lane) were used to sequence the libraries as 150 paired-end bases.Data processing and methylation callingAdapter sequences were removed using cutadapt (v2.10) for the demultiplexed FastQ files58. Then, BSBolt (v1.3.0) was used to align the reads to the reference GRCh38 genome17. Samtools was used to remove PCR duplicates using the markdup function59. Lastly, methylation calling was performed using the BSBolt CallMethylation function. Methylation values were calculated by taking the sum of methylated cytosine and unmethylated cytosine, and then dividing by the coverage. For the final step of generating the methylation matrix, all the CpG sites need to be covered by at least 20 reads in all the samples using the AggregateMatrix function in BSBolt. This work used computational and storage services associated with the Hoffman2 Shared Cluster provided by UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education’s Research Technology Group.Statistical testingOLS regression analysisOrdinary least square (OLS) regression analysis was performed on the day 0 methylation matrix for both cohort 3 and cohort 4 vaccine substrains. And both seroprotection (HAI score at day 0) and seroconversion (HAI score fold change from day 28 to day 0) were regressed against individual CpG sites. Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method was used to adjust for multiple testing problems. And the final p values for testing if the coefficients are zero or not was log transformed for data visualization.Delta methylation and principal component analysisDelta methylation matrix was obtained from the change of methylation matrix from day 28 to day 0. The values of delta methylation were standardized before performing the principal component analysis (PCA). PCA was then conducted for the standardized delta methylation matrix using the scikit-learn package60. The first principal component explains the most variance, and the 200 top sites of the first principal component were selected by looking at their weights to the first pc which can be both positive and negative values.Paired t-test and differentially methylated sites (DMS)Two sided paired t tests were performed for each individual CpG site at day 28 and day 0. The differentially methylated sites were selected based on p-value from the t test result. Those sites (481 sites) that passed the significance threshold 0.05 after Bonferroni correction were considered significant.Cell type deconvolution for methylation matrixFour main blood cell types were used as references when performing cell composition estimation using CellFi which are neutrophils, T cells, B cells and monocytes. The reference datasets were obtained from the Blueprint Epigenome Project52. A non-negative least squares regression was performed on the methylation level of cell type specific regions of the samples and references to estimate the cell type proportion for each sample.Proximal genes and gene set enrichment analysisEach CpG site was mapped with the nearest gene features using the Biomart package (v2.28.0) in R (4.1.0)61. Proximal genes were defined by the criteria that the site was either within the gene body or in the promoter region that is in the range of -1000 to + 250 base pairs away from the transcription start site. The dataset homo sapiens genes (GRCh37.p13) was used to implement the CpG to gene annotation. Then, the gene set enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr against all targeted background sites and verified using GREAT (Additional file 4: Fig. S3)62,63. The gene ontology biological process was used as the gene set, and a hypergeometric test was carried out to conduct the gene set enrichment analysis.Ethics approval and consent to participate and publishThis study has been approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Review Board.

Yun Huang Yong /Flickr cc The woman is from Ziyang City, her symptoms began on November 25, and she was hospitalized 4 days later. An investigation revealed that she had visited a live-poultry market before her symptoms began. Her illness marks China's eighth human H5N6 infection of 2023 and the country's 89th since the virus was first detected in humans in 2014. China reported its last H5N6 case in the middle of December, which also involved a woman from Sichuan province. That patient, who died from her infection, had also visited a live-poultry market before she became ill. Highly pathogenic H5N6 avian flu is known to circulate in poultry in some Asian countries, but only China and Laos have reported human cases, which are often severe or fatal. Most patients have had contact with poultry or had been exposed to poultry environments. Global mortality from fungal diseases has nearly doubled News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Fungal Infection CDC / Stephanie Rossow Global incidence and mortality from invasive fungal disease is substantially higher than previously thought, according to a systematic review published last week in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Using data from literature published from 2010 through 2023, along with 85 papers on individual country and global disease burden, the review estimates that over 6.55 million people annually are affected by invasive fungal infection, including over 2.1 million with invasive aspergillosis, 1.8 million with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, and 1.5 million with a Candida bloodstream infection or invasive candidiasis, 500,000 with Pneumocystis pneumonia, and 194,000 with Cryptococcal meningitis. These infections lead to more than 3.75 million deaths annually, of which 2.55 million are directly attributable to the fungal disease. The review also estimates that fungal asthma affects approximately 11.5. million people annually, with 92,000 asthma deaths linked to fungal allergy and 46,000 directly attributable. Higher than previous estimates The mortality figures are higher than the prior estimates of 1.5 million to 2 million annual deaths, in part because many fungal infections exacerbate diseases such as leukemia, lung cancer, and AIDS, and deaths have often been attributed to those diseases. In addition, many fungal diseases go undiagnosed and untreated because of limited access to diagnostics. But the new estimates, based on a combination of untreated mortality, the proportion of patients who are treated, and percentage survival in treated patients, suggest that invasive aspergillosis could be responsible for up to one-third of the 3.23 million annual deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while 340,000 (28%) of the more than 1.2 million deaths from tuberculosis may have been attributable to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. David Denning, PhD, author of the study and a professor at the University of Manchester, says that while the estimates are "necessarily crude" and limited by the scarcity of adequate epidemiologic data from many countries and uncertainty in the mortality rate of undiagnosed and untreated patients, they're "critical to health system capacity building." "Improved clinical awareness, appropriate sampling, and timely laboratory diagnostic testing, combined with imaging, could definitively reduce the substantial number of mostly avoidable premature deaths from life-threatening fungal disease," he wrote. CARB-X to fund development of gonorrhea vaccine News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Gonorrhea Sexually Transmitted Infections CARB-X announced today that it is awarding Dutch contract development and manufacturing organization Intravacc $633,000 to develop a vaccine for gonorrhea. The money will help support early-stage development of Intravacc's meningococcal outer membrane vesical (OMV) vaccine, which carries tailored gonococcal antigens designed to prevent infections caused by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium. Gonorrhea is the world's second most reported sexually transmitted infection, infecting roughly 82 million adults each year. Because of N gonorrhoeae's ability to quickly develop resistance to antibiotics, there is only one antibiotic (ceftriaxone) that remains effective for treating gonorrhea infections. But resistance to ceftriaxone is rising. "Drug-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have evaded all but one existing antibiotic (ceftriaxone)," Erin Duffy, PhD, R&D Chief of CARB-X (the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), said in a press release. "With an appropriate vaccination strategy, Intravacc's vaccine project, if successful, could prevent the disease, and significantly curb the spread of resistant bacteria across the globe." The vaccine candidate is the second project to receive a grant through CARB-X's 2022-2023 funding call, and the 93rd project CARB-X has funded since 2016. "This CARB-X project allows us to combine our science and OMV expertise for the development of a vaccine for gonorrhea infections," said Intravacc CEO Jan Groen, PhD. "We believe the outcome of this vaccine project could be an important contribution to the antimicrobial resistance epidemic." Virginia officials warn of measles exposures at 2 international airports News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) recently announced that it is investigating potential measles exposures following the confirmation of an infection in a person who traveled through northern Virginia after returning from an international trip. ehpien/Flickr cc The VDH is warning people about potential exposure at multiple locations, including Dulles International Airport the evening of January 3 and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport during the afternoon of January 4. "Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights," the agency said. People who were at the locations during the time and have never received a measles-containing vaccine are at risk for illness, the VDH warned, adding that people with possible exposure should watch for symptoms until January 25. No new cases in Philly outbreak No new cases have been reported over the past few days in an outbreak centered in Philadelphia, keeping the illness total at eight, the city's health department said in a January 12 update. Officials also announced more new vaccination sites for children and adults who need to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in their community. Philadelphia's outbreak began in December, with the virus spreading to two hospital patients and to children in a daycare. The daycare illnesses occurred after a sick patient was at the location, despite quarantine and exclusion instructions. Experiment shows mule deer could spread SARS-CoV-2 News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Tom Koerner, USFWS / Flickr cc A new study from the US Department of Agriculture shows that elk experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 did not shed infectious virus but mounted low-level serologic responses, while mule deer shed and transmitted virus and mounted a more pronounced serologic response to the virus. The authors of the study, published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, said the results suggest mule deer could spread COVID-19. "Surveillance studies have demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection in free-ranging and captive white-tailed deer in the United States and Canada," the authors wrote explaining previously documented human-to-animal spillovers in cervid populations. "After their displacement in humans, the Alpha and Delta variants of concern persisted in white-tailed deer population." Surveillance studies have demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection in free-ranging and captive white-tailed deer in the United States and Canada. The experiment consisted of infecting 6 weanling elk (all female) and 6 yearling mule deer (5 female, 1 male), with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was not detectable from the oral and nasal swabs of elk, but was seen in samples from the mule deer. "Our results indicate that although elk seem to be minimally susceptible to infection with the Delta variant, mule deer are highly susceptible and capable of transmitting the virus," the authors said. "Inoculated elk showed no clinical signs, did not shed infectious virus, and mounted low-level humoral titers." There is currently no evidence that wild cervids are a notable source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for humans, the authors wrote. But the experiment suggests that virus could become established in mule deer as a host species, furthering the rise of novel variants. FDA temporarily allows import of French firm's penicillin for syphilis during US drug shortage News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Sexually Transmitted Infections Resilient Drug Supply Syphilis bacteria Amid rising syphilis infections in the United States and a continuing shortage of Pfizer’s penicillin G injectable Bicillin, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is allowing the temporary import of a similar but US-unapproved drug from a French pharmaceutical firm.In a letter to Paris-based Laboratoires Delbert on the FDA website, the agency approved the import into the US market of prescription penicillin G benzathine (brand name, Extencilline) powder and diluent for reconstitution for injection. The drug is made in Italy and is being imported by Provepharm for distribution by Direct Success.Key differences between 2 drugsThe FDA letter warns of important differences between Bicillin and Extencilline, such as that the latter lacks some US-required labeling and instructions and contains soy, which may cause allergic reactions in people with a sensitivity. Also, Bicillin comes in filled syringes, while Extencilline requires reconstitution.The FDA first announced the Bicillin shortage on its website in late April 2023. In June, Pfizer warned customers of a coming depletion. In December, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) said Bicillin was in short supply because Pfizer, the sole US supplier of the formulation, was prioritizing it for rising adult syphilis cases. "Once current supplies of the pediatric Bicillin-LA vials are depleted, it is unclear when more product will be manufactured," ASHP said on its website.Since bottoming out in 2000 and 2001, syphilis rates have climbed nearly every year, spiking 28.6% in 2020 and 2021, according to the most recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Once current supplies of the pediatric Bicillin-LA vials are depleted, it is unclear when more product will be manufactured.Rates of the sexually transmitted infection have also been spiking in newborns, with 10 times as many babies born with it in 2022 than the annual rate 10 years prior, raising rates to their highest in 30 years or more, the American Academy of Pediatrics noted on its website. Other antibiotics can be used in adults and children, but they don't offer the convenience of Bicillin, which is the only one approved for treatment of infected pregnant women.

Here's what symptoms doctors are seeing.There have been 47 flu deaths in children and teens so far this season, the CDC said on Friday.Jan. 19, 2024, 8:38 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsThe current flu season is shaping up to be a severe one for children.So far this season, 47 kids and teens have died from the flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday — a worrisome toll that experts say puts the U.S. on track with what was seen last flu season, a particularly bad one for children that ended with 183 pediatric deaths reported."We are probably going to at least meet or exceed that," said Dr. Andi Shane, head of pediatric infectious diseases at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. "We are seeing quite a notable season in terms of deaths."The increase in pediatric deaths comes amid an apparent slowdown in flu activity.On Friday, the CDC reported that for a second week in a row, the number of people hospitalized for the flu has decreased slightly.Still, the virus continues to circulate at "elevated" levels across most of the country, and the agency warned that it is too soon to say the season has peaked as it continues to watch for another possible rise in spread. An estimated 180,000 people have been hospitalized so far this season, and 11,000 people have died.Flu A, particularly H1N1, accounts for the majority of cases, though flu B, which is often more severe in children, is also being reported.Flu symptoms doctors are seeing in kids this seasonDr. Kali Broussard, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Our Lady of Lourdes Women's and Children's Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana, said that the majority of children she is seeing with flu have high fevers, of 103 or 104 degrees Fahrenheit, for up to a week."This year, it's really the prolonged fevers, dehydration and poor appetite that seem to be getting the best of kids," Broussard said.Children may also experience a sore throat, runny nose, chills and extreme body aches, said Samia Kadri, a lead family nurse practitioner at Banner Urgent Care in Phoenix, Arizona."Some are coming in with one or two of those symptoms. Some are coming in with all of those symptoms," Kadri said. Flu patients generally have one thing in common: "It's how fast that virus hits you. If it hits you hard and fast, it's probably the flu," she said.Sometimes, children develop a severe and painful form of muscle inflammation called myositis. They may feel that they can't walk, and sometimes only want to be carried, Broussard said."It's a relatively uncommon side effect of influenza," Broussard said, adding that it tends to be more common in males and in influenza B patients. She estimates that it can affect up to 20% of kids during seasons when flu B is spreading widely. It usually resolves within a few days.But it's dehydration that can send a child into the hospital with the flu. Broussard said the following dehydration signs warrant a doctor's attention:Eyes that are sunken in.Crying that does not produce tears.Babies and toddlers who stop drooling as much as they normally do.Saliva that becomes thick.The annual flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, and for children starting at 6 months old. There is still time to get that shot this year, doctors say. While there is no guarantee the shot will protect against infection, it can help reduce the severity of the illness.Unvaccinated children are often sicker, said Kadri of Banner Urgent Care in Phoenix. "I find them to be much more ill than my kids who have been vaccinated."CORRECTION (Jan. 19, 2024, 5:08 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the gender most affected by myositis.

As a specialist in virus-host interaction, I would like to shed some light on the new dynamics of the respiratory virus season. The infamous SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2, the instigator of the COVID-19 pandemic, is still with us. Despite limited access to screening tests, analysis of the number of hospital admissions shows that the virus is still going strong. Québec’s Institut National de Santé Publique counted more than 33,000 hospitalizations in Québec in 2023 affecting all age categories, including 648 children under the age of nine. The virus is not seasonal. It has a strikingly efficient capacity to spread through aerosols, especially as we take refuge indoors to escape the cold. The virus currently circulating is actually a mixture of different viruses, known as variants, each of which has the potential to partially evade the immunity an individual has acquired through a previous infection or vaccination. Resurgence of seasonal flu After a hiatus due to health measures, the influenza virus, which causes seasonal flu, has returned with the same force. It is once again circulating in different variants belonging to Types (strains) A and B, although scientists believe that one Type B strain, the Yamagata lineage, has disappeared. A variant of H1N1 Type A, different from the viruses that caused the 1918 and 2009 pandemics, is now dominant in North America where it is causing an increase in hospital admissions, especially among the elderly and young children. However, we must remain vigilant, as the strain may change within the same season. What could this mean? The target population could change, as it did in the 2018-2019 season. And what about RSV? The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also appears to be resuming its pre-pandemic transmission levels. RSV causes bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Bronchiolitis is characterized by the obstruction of the small airways, which can progress to wheezing or respiratory distress. Virtually all children are infected with RSV before the age of 2, and RSV infection is one of the main causes of hospitalization in young children. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an average of 2,523 hospitalizations per year in Canada, half of them in children under six months of age and more than a quarter requiring admission to intensive care. But RSV also severely affects the elderly and adults who are immunocompromised or have existing chronic conditions. RSV shows high levels of severe illness, hospital admissions and in hospital deaths in adults, figures which are comparable to those for influenza. Admittedly, although these three viruses are attracting attention, other less publicized respiratory viruses are also circulating, demonstrating a diverse viral environment. The continued presence of SARS-CoV-2 means our hospitals can’t catch their breath. (Shutterstock) SARS-CoV-2 has turned everything upside down The presence of SARS-CoV-2 marks the principal difference from the pre-pandemic era, since it is augmenting the burden on an already weakened health-care system. The challenge is amplified by the extremely high transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with influenza and RSV, which makes seasonal management much more complex. Until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the respiratory virus season had a fairly predictable beginning and end that was determined by virus surveillance over the years. Our systems were already struggling to absorb this seasonal increase in patients. But today, the picture has become even more complex with the continuing presence of SARS-CoV-2. And our hospitals, with no time to catch their breath, are struggling to keep up. Beyond infection The second major difference that should not be overlooked is SARS-CoV-2’s ability to cause widespread health problems well beyond the respiratory system. In addition, it causes long-term consequences after infection, such as post-COVID syndrome (also known as long COVID), which affects millions of people. The extent of the consequences of infection and reinfection on human health remains uncertain, as does the effectiveness of vaccines in limiting these effects. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic – with its exceptional transmission levels – has produced a large number of patients available for research. Coupled with unprecedented funding, this has made it possible to undertake research that has never been possible before on a post-viral syndrome. Of course, the number of people infected with RSV or influenza globally each year does not even come close to the number infected with SARS-CoV-2, even at this stage of the pandemic. However, there is considerable evidence that, in addition to the acute symptoms and mortality associated with influenza and RSV, post-viral conditions also exist, as they do with SARS-CoV-2. The importance of vaccines The final distinction from the pre-pandemic period is the arrival of RSV vaccines. In Canada, the Arexvy vaccine has been approved for people over 60, and the Abrysvo vaccine was also approved for pregnant women, providing immunity to children from birth. However, these two vaccines have not yet been officially recommended. We are still waiting for a vaccine to be made available for children. The trio of vaccines against COVID-19, influenza and RSV will certainly help to reduce the severe symptoms associated with respiratory virus infections in the coming seasons. However, our primary objective must be to reduce the incidence of respiratory virus infections. Despite vaccination, we can expect the mortality and morbidity associated with these infections to increase as the population ages. All three viruses share a common trait — they spread through the air. Their transmission could be reduced by implementing passive strategies aimed at reducing the concentration of aerosols in indoor air.

Here’s What Doctors Advise to Stay Safe. By Amy Maxmen January 18, 2024 Republish This Story (Moment/Getty Images) With around 20,000 people dying of covid in the United States since the start of October, and tens of thousands more abroad, the covid pandemic clearly isn’t over. However, the crisis response is, since the World Health Organization and the Biden administration ended their declared health emergencies last year. This story also ran on Rural News Network. It can be republished for free. Let’s not confuse the terms “pandemic” and “emergency.” As Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University, said, “The pandemic is over until you are scrunched in bed, feeling terrible.” Pandemics are defined by neither time nor severity, but rather by large numbers of ongoing infections worldwide. Emergencies are acute and declared to trigger an urgent response. Ending the official emergency shifted the responsibility for curbing covid from leaders to the public. In the United States, it meant, for example, that the government largely stopped covering the cost of covid tests and vaccines. But the virus is still infecting people; indeed, it is surging right now. With changes in the nature of the pandemic and the response, KFF Health News spoke with doctors and researchers about how to best handle covid, influenza, and other respiratory ailments spreading this season. A holiday wave of sickness has ensued as expected. Covid infections have escalated nationwide in the past few weeks, with analyses of virus traces in wastewater suggesting infection rates as high as last year’s. More than 73,000 people died of covid in the U.S. in 2023, meaning the virus remains deadlier than car accidents and influenza. Still, compared with last year’s seasonal surge, this winter’s wave of covid hospitalizations has been lower and death rates less than half. “We’re seeing outbreaks in homeless shelters and in nursing homes, but hospitals aren’t overwhelmed like they have been in the past,” said Salvador Sandoval, a doctor and health officer at the Merced County public health department in California. He attributes that welcome fact to vaccination, covid treatments like Paxlovid, and a degree of immunity from prior infections. Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up While a new coronavirus variant, JN.1, has spread around the world, the current vaccines and covid tests remain effective. Other seasonal illnesses are surging, too, but rates are consistent with those of previous years. Between 9,400 and 28,000 people died from influenza from Oct. 1 to Jan. 6, estimates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and millions felt so ill from the flu that they sought medical care. Cases of pneumonia — a serious condition marked by inflamed lungs that can be triggered by the flu, covid, or other infections — also predictably rose as winter set in. Researchers are now less concerned about flare-ups of pneumonia in China, Denmark, and France in November and December, because they fit cyclical patterns of the pneumonia-causing bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae rather than outbreaks of a dangerous new bug. Public health researchers recommend following the CDC guidance on getting the latest covid and influenza vaccines to ward off hospitalization and death from the diseases and reduce chances of getting sick. A recent review of studies that included 614,000 people found that those who received two covid vaccines were also less likely to develop long covid; often involving fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and joint pain, the condition is marked by the development or continuation of symptoms a few months after an infection and has been debilitating for millions of people. Another analysis found that people who had three doses of covid vaccines were much less likely to have long covid than those who were unvaccinated. (A caveat, however, is that those with three doses might have taken additional measures to avoid infections than those who chose to go without.) It’s not too late for an influenza vaccine, either, said Helen Chu, a doctor and epidemiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Influenza continues to rise into the new year, especially in Southern states and California. Last season’s shot appeared to reduce adults’ risk of visits to the emergency room and urgent care by almost half and hospitalization by more than a third. Meanwhile, another seasonal illness with a fresh set of vaccines released last year, respiratory syncytial virus, appears to be waning this month. Another powerful way to prevent covid, influenza, common colds, and other airborne infections is by wearing an N95 mask. Many researchers say they’ve returned to socializing without one but opt for the masks in crowded, indoor places when wearing one would not be particularly burdensome. Karan, for example, wears his favorite N95 masks on airplanes. And don’t forget good, old-fashioned hand-washing, which helps prevent infections as well. If you do all that and still feel sick? Researchers say they reach for rapid covid tests. While they’ve never been perfect, they’re often quite helpful in guiding a person’s next steps. When President Joe Biden declared the end of the public health emergency last year, many federally funded testing sites that sent samples to laboratories shut their doors. As a result, people now mainly turn to home covid tests that signal an infection within 15 minutes and cost around $6 to $8 each at many pharmacies. The trick is to use these tests correctly by taking more than one when there’s reason for concern. They miss early infections more often than tests processed in a lab, because higher levels of the coronavirus are required for detection — and the virus takes time to multiply in the body. For this reason, Karan considers other information. “If I ran into someone who turned out to be sick, and then I get symptoms a few days later,” he said, “the chance is high that I have whatever they had, even if a test is negative.” A negative result with a rapid test might mean simply that an infection hasn’t progressed enough to be detected, that the test had expired, or that it was conducted wrong. To be sure the culprit behind symptoms like a sore throat isn’t covid, researchers suggest testing again in a day or two. It often takes about three days after symptoms start for a test to register as positive, said Karan, adding that such time estimates are based on averages and that individuals may deviate from the norm. If a person feels healthy and wants to know their status because they were around someone with covid, Karan recommends testing two to four days after the exposure. To protect others during those uncertain days, the person can wear an N95 mask that blocks the spread of the virus. If tests remain negative five days after an exposure and the person still feels fine, Chu said, they’re unlikely to be infected — and, if they are, viral levels would be so low that they would be unlikely to pass the disease to others. Positive tests, on the other hand, reliably flag an infection. In this case, people can ask a doctor whether they qualify for the antiviral drug Paxlovid. The pills work best when taken immediately after symptoms begin so that they slash levels of the virus before it damages the body. Some studies suggest the medicine reduces a person’s risk of long covid, too, but the evidence is mixed. Another note on tests: Don’t worry if they continue to turn out positive for longer than symptoms last; the virus may linger even if it’s no longer replicating. After roughly a week since a positive test or symptoms, studies suggest, a person is unlikely to pass the virus to others. If covid is ruled out, Karan recommends tests for influenza because they can guide doctors on whether to prescribe an antiviral to fight it — or if instead it’s a bacterial infection, in which case antibiotics may be in order. (One new home test diagnoses covid and influenza at the same time.) Whereas antivirals and antibiotics target the source of the ailment, over-the-counter medications may soothe congestion, coughs, fevers, and other symptoms. That said, the FDA recently determined that a main ingredient in versions of Sudafed, NyQuil, and other decongestants, called phenylephrine, is ineffective. Jobs complicate a personal approach to staying healthy. Emergency-era business closures have ended, and mandates on vaccination and wearing masks have receded across the country. Some managers take precautions to protect their staff. Chu, for example, keeps air-purifying devices around her lab, and she asks researchers to stay home when they feel sick and to test themselves for covid before returning to work after a trip. However, occupational safety experts note that many employees face risks they cannot control because decisions on if and how to protect against outbreaks, such as through ventilation, testing, and masking, are left to employers. Notably, people with low-wage and part-time jobs — occupations disproportionately held by people of color — are often least able to control their workplace environments. Jessica Martinez, co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, said the lack of national occupational standards around airborne disease protection represents a fatal flaw in the Biden administration’s decision to relinquish its control of the pandemic. “Every workplace needs to have a plan for reducing the threat of infectious disease,” she said. “If you only focus on the individual, you fail workers.” Amy Maxmen: amaxmen@kff.org Related Topics COVID-19 Public Health Doctors Vaccines Contact Us Submit a Story Tip Share This Story: TwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailPrint Republish This Story We want to hear from you: Contact Us Republish This Story × Copy And Paste To Republish This Story ‘Emergency’ or Not, Covid Is Still Killing People.

However, in most countries the first post-pandemic influenza season was not unusually large and/or severe. Here, based on an analysis of historical influenza virus epidemic patterns from 2002 to 2019, we show that historic lulls in influenza virus circulation had relatively minor impacts on subsequent epidemic size and that epidemic size was more substantially impacted by season-specific effects unrelated to the magnitude of circulation in prior seasons. From measurements of antibody levels from serum samples collected each year from 2017 to 2021, we show that the rate of waning of antibody titres against influenza virus during the pandemic was smaller than assumed in predictive models. Taken together, these results partially explain why the re-emergence of seasonal influenza virus epidemics was less dramatic than anticipated and suggest that influenza virus epidemic dynamics are not currently amenable to multi-season prediction.

However, the incidence of seasonal influenza was unusually low during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, likely due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at reducing transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2, which were also effective in limiting exposure to seasonal influenza viruses4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. This global lull in influenza virus circulation and consequent lack of exposure to influenza viruses led to widespread concerns, supported by modelling studies, that increased susceptibility to seasonal influenza viruses due to waning immunity could result in larger and more severe epidemics in subsequent seasons7,10,12,13,14,15.While a comparison to pre-pandemic epidemic sizes is difficult because testing behaviour in many countries has changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is little evidence to suggest that the first post-pandemic influenza season was unusually large or severe. For example, the level of influenza virus circulation in the 2022 Australia influenza season was described as moderate, with low clinical severity16. Preliminary estimates of the 2022/2023 influenza burden in the United States suggest that the winter epidemic was not unusually severe, falling well within the range of influenza epidemics in the US prior to the COVID-19 pandemic: in 5 of 10 seasons in the previous decade, the estimated upper bound of the number of influenza hospitalisations was higher than in the 2022/2023 season, and in 6 of 10 seasons in the previous decade the lower bound was higher17,18. In the United Kingdom, too, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza-attributable mortality fell well within the range observed in the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic19.The lack of a clear post-pandemic increase in season size and/or severity suggests that our current understanding of the determinants of an epidemic’s size and severity, reflected in predictive models, does not capture one or more aspects of influenza virus epidemiology. Here, we sought to explain the apparent conflict between model predictions and observed epidemiological dynamics. First, we analysed two decades of epidemiological data from 47 countries to investigate the relationship between the magnitude of incidence in prior seasons and subsequent epidemic size. Second, we analysed serum samples collected longitudinally before and during the COVID-19 pandemic from adults living in the Netherlands to investigate the extent to which measured influenza antibody waning rates agree with those assumed in predictive models. Together, our analyses provide explanations for the disparity between the predicted and observed post-pandemic epidemiological dynamics of seasonal influenza.ResultsThe effects of past (sub)type lulls on subsequent (sub)type epidemic sizeFirst, we investigated to what extent the predicted relationship between the magnitude of influenza virus circulation in prior years and the size and severity of subsequent epidemics holds, where little activity in prior seasons should translate to a bigger subsequent epidemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, seasonal influenza virus circulation was highly heterogeneous, with individual influenza epidemics in any given country typically being dominated by one or two influenza virus (sub)types. Hence, there were frequent lull periods lasting 1–3 years where other seasonal influenza virus (sub)types barely circulated. Due to the lack of immunological cross-reactivity between (sub)types, these lulls are potentially analogous to the scenario observed during the COVID-19 pandemic for individual (sub)types. We leveraged these historical lulls to gain insight into how influenza virus circulation lulls affected subsequent influenza epidemic sizes in the past.To identify and estimate the frequency of (sub)type lulls, we analysed virological surveillance data for 47 countries in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for the period from 2002 until 2019, deposited in the WHO FluNet database20 (Supplementary Table 1). (Sub)type lull periods were identified if a particular (sub)type did not exhibit substantial levels of circulation over consecutive seasons in a given country. We defined substantial (sub)type circulation for a season if the (sub)type accounted for ≥20% of detections in the country during said season. In 45%, 45%, and 77% of country-season pairs for A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B viruses, respectively, (sub)type lulls lasted for at least one season, with some lull periods lasting as long as two seasons (Fig. 1a). Hence, extended periods of relative absence of individual influenza (sub)types are a regular feature of influenza epidemic dynamics.Fig. 1: The effects of influenza epidemic dynamics in preceding seasons on subsequent epidemic composition and size.a The distribution of lull period durations, in number of seasons, by (sub)type, across all countries and seasons. A lull duration of zero corresponds to the same (sub)type’s substantial circulation in the previous season and the current season. b The distribution of relative epidemic sizes by virus (sub)type, across all countries and seasons. c The relationship between the number of seasons since previous substantial circulation of a (sub)type and the probability of the (sub)type’s substantial circulation. Error bars correspond to 95% confidence interval from an exact two-tailed binomial test for proportions. Points correspond to point estimates of the probability. The probabilities were computed from all countries and seasons (n = 642, 460 and 624 country-season pairs for A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B, respectively). d Relationship between the relative size of a (sub)type-specific epidemic and the number of seasons since previous substantial circulation of that (sub)type. Each point corresponds to a specific country, in a specific season (n = 188, 198 and 186 country-season pairs for A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09 and B, respectively). Points are coloured by the season. Boxplots show the median and first and third quantiles. Whiskers correspond to the minimum of the maximum value and the third quartile + 1.5 × the interquartile range for the upper whisker, and the maximum of the minimum value and the first quartile − 1.5 × the interquartile range for the lower whisker. e Relationship between the relative size of a (sub)type’s epidemic and (1) the size of that (sub)type’s epidemic in the previous season (left); and (2) the sum of the two previous seasons’ sizes of that (sub)type (right). For each of the two subpanels, each point corresponds to a specific country, in a specific season (n = 180 country-season pairs for each (sub)type for previous season size, n = 160 for each (sub)type for previous two seasons size sum). Points are coloured by the season.Full size imageWhile virological surveillance data demonstrates the frequency of (sub)type lulls, it does not reveal how (sub)type lulls affect epidemic size as viral sampling rates may vary from year to year. Hence, we required a metric that more accurately represents the size of a (sub)type’s epidemic in a particular season, rather than solely the proportion of a season’s total activity attributable to the (sub)type. To that end, we estimated (sub)type-specific relative epidemic sizes by integrating virological surveillance data with influenza-like illness (ILI) data from the WHO FluID21 database for 20 countries in Europe and the Middle East where, in addition to the virological surveillance data described above, high-resolution ILI data was available (Supplementary Table 1). Because high-resolution ILI data is sparse for most seasons preceding the 2009 A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic, we restricted this analysis to the seasons from 2010/2011 until 2019/2020. In our estimates, a relative size of one corresponds to the mean number of influenza virus infections in a single season for a given country, irrespective of (sub)type. Very small or absent (sub)type-specific epidemics (defined as relative epidemic sizes <0.1) were observed for 28%, 23%, and 37% of country-seasons for A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B viruses, respectively (Fig. 1b).To investigate the effect influenza virus (sub)type lulls had on epidemic composition and size, we correlated our computed (sub)type-specific relative sizes with the number of seasons elapsed since the (sub)type’s previous substantial circulation. Additionally, we correlated relative size against previous season relative size and the sum of the two previous seasons’ relative size. We found that both the probability of a (sub)type’s substantial circulation and the mean epidemic sizes for each influenza virus (sub)type increased with time since substantial circulation (Fig. 1c, d). Nevertheless, epidemic sizes varied substantially for each value of seasons since substantial circulation (Fig. 1d). This suggests that there is an effect of absence or presence of circulation in previous seasons on epidemic size, but also that there is substantial background variation in epidemic size, independent of absence or presence of circulation in preceding seasons. Similarly, while there is a negative relationship between the relative epidemic size of each (sub)type and its relative size in the preceding season and the relative summed size over the last two seasons, there is wide variation in epidemic size: seasons with very low and very high relative sizes both occurred frequently following seasons of low-to-mid incidence (Fig. 1e). Notably, in 9 of the 20 countries included in our dataset, the first season after the 2009 A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic that saw substantial circulation of the A/H3N2 subtype (2011/2012) was not one of the three largest A/H3N2 epidemics in the influenza seasons from 2010/2011 until 2019/2020, despite three years of near-absent circulation.Importantly, for each number of seasons since substantial circulation, we observed a striking degree of clustering of relative epidemic sizes across countries by season, suggesting the existence of season-specific effects on epidemic size, shared among countries in a single season (Fig. 1d). For example, the A/H3N2 epidemic size in 2016/2017 appeared consistently greater than in 2013/2014 despite, in many countries, equal time since previous substantial A/H3N2 circulation. We thus hypothesised that the size of (sub)type-specific epidemics could be jointly explained by a combination of season-specific effects, shared among countries, and effects related to the presence or absence of that virus (sub)type in the seasons preceding an epidemic. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the likely effects of (i) seasons since substantial circulation, (ii) size in the previous season and (iii) the sum of previous two seasons’ sizes. (Fig. 2). We also estimated the respective season-specific effects, which correspond to the predicted ‘base size’ of a (sub)type’s epidemic given that (i) the previous substantial circulation of that (sub)type was in the previous season, (ii) there was no circulation of that (sub)type in the previous season, or (iii) there was no circulation in the previous two seasons. These season effects are modulated by the effects of prior circulation to yield an epidemic’s predicted size. Each of the three predictors individually had non-trivial effects on epidemic size in models with season effects and estimated effects were substantially smaller than in models that did not include season effects (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Bayesian hierarchical model correlating influenza (sub)type relative epidemic size with seasons since substantial circulation, epidemic sizes in previous seasons and season-specific effects.Posterior distributions of parameter estimates in the model, with seasons since previous substantial circulation (circles), previous epidemic size (diamonds), or sum of previous two epidemics’ size (squares) as predictors, either with or without season effects. Points, thick and thin lines correspond to the posterior median, 50% CI, and 95% CI, respectively (n = 188, 198, 191 country-season pairs for A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09 and B, respectively, for models with seasons since substantial circulation as predictor, n = 180 country-season pairs for each (sub)type for models with previous season size as predictor, n = 160 country-season pairs for each (sub)type for models with sum of two previous seasons size as predictor).Full size imageCrucially, models that included season effects exhibited much better predictive performance than models without season effects (Supplementary Fig. 1), showing that season effects are a crucial determinant of epidemic size. Across all model formulations, the estimated season effects, shared among countries, differed substantially between seasons. Furthermore, between-season differences in season effects were consistently substantially greater in magnitude than any of the predictors related to prior incidence. For example, in the model that includes previous season size as predictor for A/H3N2 epidemic size, the estimated season effects (‘base sizes’) ranged from 0.17 (95% CI 0.04–0.31) in 2015/2016 to 0.83 (95% CI 0.75–0.92) in 2016/2017: a difference of 0.66. Conversely, assuming the size of the previous season was the mean A/H3N2 season relative size (across all included countries and seasons), the effect of previous season size would only reduce predicted size by 0.06 (95% CI 0.01–0.12) compared to if there were no circulation in the previous season. Together, these results suggest that an effect of the magnitude of influenza virus circulation in the preceding season(s) on subsequent epidemic size is present but limited and that epidemic size is dominated by season-specific factors, unrelated to the magnitude of prior circulation.Effects of past (sub)type lulls on subsequent influenza season severityIn addition to season size, we investigated how influenza circulation lulls affected season severity. Here, we used excess mortality as a proxy for severity, leveraging Europe-wide estimates of excess mortality as calculated by the EuroMOMO network22,23. By comparing these estimates to our computed lull durations, we qualitatively investigated if a clear relationship exists between prior incidence and season severity. Rates of pooled Europe-wide influenza-attribute excess mortality as calculated by the EuroMOMO network varied substantially between seasons, ranging from 0.31 (95% CI 0.24–0.38) per 100,000 in 2013/2014 to 28.58 (95% CI: 28.22–28.95) per 100,000 in 2014/2015. Hence, in the decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemics could differ by up to two orders of magnitude in their severity22,23. In the 2011/2012 season, which was A/H3N2-dominant Europe-wide and followed a three-year A/H3N2 lull in almost all countries, Europe-wide total excess mortality in the winter period amounted to 6.73 (95% CI 5.26–8.21) per 100,000. In turn, in the 2014/2015 and 2016/2017 seasons, which were also A/H3N2-dominant Europe-wide and saw substantial A/H3N2 circulation one or two seasons prior in almost all countries, respectively, influenza-specific excess mortality amounted to 28.58 (95% CI: 28.22–28.95) and 25.65 (95% CI: 25.26–26.05) per 100,000, respectively. Hence, in these seasons, influenza-specific excess mortality was four to five-fold higher than total winter period excess mortality in 2011/2012, despite substantially shorter lull durations. While this coarse analysis could only be performed for seasons dominated by a single (sub)type, these results suggest that there is no clear relationship between the magnitude of circulation in the preceding seasons and the severity of subsequent seasons.Antibody responses to seasonal influenza virus during the COVID-19 pandemicWaning of pre-existing immunity due to lack of immune stimulation has been posited to lead to larger post-lull epidemics, but evidence is lacking on precisely how antibody immunity against seasonal influenza viruses changes due to near-absence of seasonal influenza circulation, such as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. To quantify the effects of lack of influenza virus circulation on antibody titres against seasonal influenza viruses, we analysed influenza virus antibody dynamics in the pre- and intra-COVID-19 pandemic periods in the Netherlands. We quantified the baseline antibody titres of an adult population in the Netherlands for the seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of their decrease during the pandemic. Influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09 and B/Yamagata viruses had caused epidemics in the three influenza seasons prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 3a) and epidemic activity during this period was consistent with patterns from 2010–2019 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Since antibody responses to the haemagglutinin protein of influenza viruses are known to be correlates of protection24,25,26, we measured antibody titres with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against representative strains of each (sub)type of seasonal influenza in 130 serum samples from a longitudinal cohort of 31 female and 34 male adult COVID-19 patients that were not vaccinated for seasonal influenza in 2020 (the Viro-immunological, clinical and psychosocial correlates of disease severity and long-term outcomes of infection in SARS-CoV-2 – a prospective cohort study (RECoVERED))27 (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4a). Additionally, we measured antibody titres against longitudinal samples collected in the summers from 2017 to 2020 from 100 healthy male adults within the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS28 (ACS) (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4b). This cohort only consists of men, and influenza vaccination status was not known, but it crucially allows for comparison of intra-pandemic against pre-pandemic influenza antibody dynamics, and hence provides important additional data. Hence, our data consisted of a total of 630 serum samples across both cohorts. Importantly, all participants were healthy, and specifically all ACS individuals were HIV-seronegative.Fig. 3: Antibody dynamics to seasonal influenza virus before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.a Seasonal influenza virus epidemic activity 2017–2021 in the Netherlands, computed as the number of reported cases of influenza-like illness per 100,000, stratified by (sub)type as estimated from virological surveillance data. b Individual antibody titres against seasonal influenza viruses based on haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay from 2017–2021 among 70 healthy male adult participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS (ACS) cohort for each influenza virus (sub)type as well as 34 male and 31 female participants of the RECoVERED cohort for years 2020-21 (dashed). Mean antibody titre changes across all individuals are drawn in bold lines with error bars indicating the mean standard error. The viruses used are A/Netherlands/04189/2017 (A/H3N2), A/Netherlands/10218/2018 (A/H1N1pdm09), B/Netherlands/04136/2017 (B/Yamagata), and B/Netherlands/00302/2018 (B/Victoria). c HI titre distributions in the two cohorts following each winter epidemic period coloured by influenza virus (sub)type. HI titre distributions of individuals who experienced a ≥ 2 log2 units increase in HI titre (≥4-fold increase in HI titre) in the next winter epidemic period, indicating likely infection, are shown in grey bars. d Mean HI antibody titre waning rates by influenza virus (sub)type in adults estimated from HI titres from the individuals among the 70 ACS individuals that did not see a ≥ 2 log2 units increase in titre in consecutive years in the study period and 65 RECoVERED participants. Error bars correspond to the 50% and 95% credible intervals and horizontal grey lines correspond to the median of the posterior distribution of the mean. Waning rate of −1.0 corresponds to 1 2-fold decrease in antibody titre in 1 year.Full size imageFrom 2019 to 2021, mean HI titres remained largely unchanged for all influenza virus (sub)types, including during the COVID-19 pandemic period, for both the ACS and RECoVERED cohorts (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5b). For all seasonal influenza virus (sub)types, mean HI titres increased after the 2017/2018 influenza epidemic but returned to pre-2017/2018 levels by summer 2019 in the ACS cohort (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 5b). Due to experimental variation resulting from differences in the receptor-destroying enzyme used, the ACS individuals were split into two separate groups of 70 and 30 individuals. Results from the larger group are presented in the main text while the smaller group of 30 is referred to the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Fig. 5). Differentiating the year-on-year individual HI titre distributions by titre rises that are indicative of recent influenza virus infection (≥4-fold increase, ≥2 log2 units), showed that influenza A and B virus infections were most common in individuals with low antibody titres in the year prior to infection (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5c); consistent with lower antibody titres being associated with greater risk of infection. Overall, the HI titre distributions of the cohort remained largely unchanged over the study period, including during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.We applied a mathematical model on the HI titres of participants in 2020 and 2021 to estimate pandemic-period antibody titre waning rates. For the ACS individuals, we estimated that antibody titres against A/H3N2 viruses waned at −0.06 log2 units per year, 95% credible interval (CI) (−0.18, 0.05); A/H1N1pdm09 viruses at −0.01, 95% CI (−0.14, 0.13); B/Yamagata viruses at 0.10, 95% CI (−0.02, 0.22); and B/Victoria viruses at 0.10, 95% CI (−0.04, 0.24) (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 5d). For the RECoVERED cohort, we estimated mean waning rates towards A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria to be −0.15, 95% CI (−0.32, 0.02), −0.06, 95% CI (−0.28, 0.17), −0.08, 95% CI (−0.21, 0.05) and −0.11, 95% CI (−0.24, 0.02) log2 units per year respectively, in agreement with those derived from the ACS cohort (Fig. 3d). Combining data from both cohorts for the 2020–2021 period, the estimated mean waning rates remained similar to previous estimates (Fig. 3d). We also estimated mean waning rates using HI titres from the same ACS individuals for the entire 2017–2021 period (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 5d). For this period, waning estimates are generally lower with narrower credible intervals as they were estimated from longitudinal data spanning five years, but no substantial waning of HI titres against any of the viruses was observed either, and estimates were similar to estimates for the 2020–2021 period, for both the ACS and the RECoVERED cohorts (A/H3N2: −0.20, 95% CI (−0.25, −0.15), A/H1N1pdm09: −0.09, 95% CI (−0.15, −0.04), B/Yamagata: −0.13, 95% CI (−0.17, −0.08), B/Victoria: −0.14, 95% CI (−0.19, −0.09)). For the ACS cohort, we included only individuals who experienced no ≥2 log2 unit increases in HI titre for the entire study period and hence were likely not infected in the 2017–2021 period in our waning model (A/H3N2: n = 59, A/H1N1pdm09: n = 54, B/Yamagata: n = 53, B/Victoria: n = 58).To investigate potential age or sex-specific patterns in antibody dynamics in our two cohorts, we stratified baseline antibody titres by age and sex, for each (sub)type. However, we found no consistent age- or sex-related effects on baseline titres (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6a). Similarly, we investigated if there were age or sex-specific effects on estimated individual-level waning rates, but we found no consistent age or sex-related differences (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6b). The estimated standard deviation of the measured titre value around the model-estimated individual-level titre amounted to 0.31 log2 units (95% CI 0.29–0.33) for the ACS cohort for the full 2017–2021 dataset and 0.05 (95% CI 0.03–0.08) for the RECoVERED cohort, suggesting that the model used to estimate the waning rates fits the data well.Fig. 4: The effects of age and sex on baseline antibody titre and waning rate.a A cross section of antibody titres in 2021 for 70 ACS individuals and 65 RECoVERED individuals, broken down by (sub)type, age and sex.

Points correspond to median individual-level fitted waning rates. The smoothing line corresponds to a LOESS fit with span = 0.75, for each sex individually. The confidence band corresponds to a 95% confidence interval.Full size imageDiscussionOur analysis of two decades of epidemiological data from 47 countries demonstrates that low country-level prevalence of influenza (sub)types over one or more years was not unique to the COVID-19 pandemic but occurred frequently in the past. Additionally, while our analysis shows that periods or low or near-absent circulation of particular (sub)types on average led to increased epidemic sizes of that (sub)type, both very large and very small epidemics occurred following sustained periods of low to near-absent circulation. Consistent with this, Bayesian statistical modelling shows that the magnitude of a (sub)type’s circulation in preceding seasons had only limited effect on subsequent size. Instead, the strong clustering of different countries’ epidemic size within individual seasons, supported by statistical modelling, suggests that epidemic size is more strongly influenced by season-specific effects that are unrelated to the absence or presence of circulation in the prior season(s). Similarly, the severity of influenza seasons appears to be largely independent of the magnitude of influenza virus circulation in the preceding seasons.Given our finding that prior incidence only had a subdominant effect on subsequent epidemic sizes historically, the lack of exceptionally large or severe post-pandemic influenza seasons is not unexpected. Our results suggest that the relationship between accumulation of susceptibility and epidemic size is decidedly more complex: even if there were substantial accumulation of susceptibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more likely that epidemic size and severity would be dominated by season-to-season variation due to the combined effect of other known or unknown factors unrelated to the absence or presence of substantial circulation in preceding years. Nevertheless, it is possible that periods of absent circulation much longer than seen during the COVID-19 pandemic will have substantial effects on epidemic dynamics. While the precise mechanisms are unknown and likely multifactorial, the prolonged absence of influenza virus circulation may have contributed to historical observations of severe outbreaks in remote areas, and it is possible that such instances may yield insights into the effects of longer lulls29,30.The precise determinants of these season effects are likely manifold, combining factors such as the flux of viral seeding, heterosubtypic competition, vaccine effectiveness, antigenic novelty, immune imprinting, and possibly other unknown factors31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39. While our analysis showed that an effect of prior incidence on epidemic size exists, it also shows that it is only one of likely many determinants. Crucially, our lack of understanding of many of these determinants currently limits our capacity to generate meaningful multi-year forecasts of epidemic sizes. Predictive models that incorporate the uncertainty arising from the unpredictability of season effects will necessarily yield outputs that have wide confidence intervals, limiting their utility for public health purposes. Simultaneously, not incorporating this uncertainty will likely result in substantial prediction error. It is likely that a better understanding of the different immunological, evolutionary, ecological and epidemiological factors that determine epidemic size, beyond waning immunity, is required to perform accurate and precise multi-year prediction of epidemic size.We also showed that HI-measured immune protection against recent seasonal influenza viruses remained largely unchanged in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that waning of antibody titres against seasonal influenza viruses occurs at timescales substantially longer than the lull in seasonal influenza virus circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic10. We showed that waning rates following periods of absent circulation were largely in agreement with waning rates previously reported for adults during regular periods of influenza virus circulation40. This lower waning rate is also more consistent with individual-level estimates of the duration of protection against infection by circulating strains41, and is lower than was assumed in models used to project post-COVID-19 pandemic epidemic sizes12,13,15. In modelling studies, one of the reasons for the assumption of a high rate of waning is to yield annually recurring epidemics in SIR-type models15. In reality, epidemics recur annually with a much lower waning rate. While much is unknown about the mechanisms behind the annual recurrence of influenza epidemics, network effects might form a plausible explanation for the annual recurrence of influenza epidemics despite a limited rate of waning of protection. However, such dynamics cannot be incorporated in SIR-type compartmental models. Hence, the inherent shortcomings of oft-used epidemiological models in modelling a relatively complex pathogen lead to the use of unrealistic parameter values, potentially leading to unreliable inferences. The complexity of influenza epidemiology and its contravention of SIR-predicted dynamics is also reflected in the empirical observation that novel antigenic variants do not necessarily lead to larger epidemic sizes31.Our study has some limitations. First, we used influenza-like illness data from the WHO FluID database and virologically confirmed data from the WHO FluNet database in our epidemiological analyses. Bias might affect both data sources. In particular, the FluID ILI data is not influenza-specific and might be affected by year-to-year variation in sentinel sites, and FluNet data might be biased due to the presence of convenience samples and overrepresentation of outpatient surveillance. However, the observed consistency in the estimated (sub)type-specific epidemic sizes across the 20 countries included in the analysis for any given season suggests that these data sources broadly capture influenza epidemiological dynamics. Therefore, our results are unlikely to be substantially affected by potential year-on-year differences in reporting behaviour or unrepresentative sampling. Second, the applicability of our analysis to the post-COVID-19 pandemic-like situation is predicated on the absence of heterosubtypic immunity. Importantly, heterosubtypic protection has previously been estimated to be exceedingly short-lived, with duration on the order of a single day41. Third, we could only perform our severity analysis based on Europe-wide excess mortality data. Nonetheless, the clustering of epidemic sizes across different European countries within a particular season as observed in our epidemiological analysis suggests that, for any given season, Europe-wide severity data is likely representative at the individual country level.Fourth, the serum samples were collected in two independent cohorts, with substantial diversity in age and sex, accounting for the elderly but excluding children. Due to the complex effects of immunosenescence, the elderly potentially exhibit differing antibody dynamics. Whilst studies have shown that vaccine-mediated protection wanes modestly quicker in those over 65 years of age42,43, there is little evidence to support the notion that serum antibodies wane significantly faster for this age group. Our results showed similar antibody baseline titres and waning rates for adults below and above 65 years of age, suggesting that serum antibodies in both subgroups wane at similar rates.Due to the lack of children in our serological analysis, the extent to which their waning rates changed during the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. Immune dynamics in children are known to differ from those in adults41, with potentially higher waning rates. This could lead to increased susceptibility to infection, and the duration of protection against infection is known to be shorter in children than in adults41,44. Furthermore, the accrual of additional birth cohorts during prolonged periods of absence of influenza virus circulation might affect epidemic dynamics. However, the same dynamics of waning in children and population turnover also occurred in pre-pandemic (sub)type lulls. Although we could not perform the serological analysis for children, the epidemiological data we use to estimate the effects of (sub)type lulls on subsequent epidemic size does incorporate dynamics of waning in children and population turnover. For this reason, the absence of child sera is unlikely to bias our conclusions.Finally, although participants in the RECoVERED cohort were confirmed to be unvaccinated during the study period, vaccination status for the ACS cohort was not known. However, in the Netherlands individuals <60 years of age are only eligible for influenza vaccination if they have underlying health conditions, and assuming population-wide rates of influenza vaccine uptake in the Netherlands, only 3% of the ACS individuals, who importantly were all HIV-seronegative, would be expected to be vaccinated. Combined with the similarity in antibody baseline titres and waning rates when comparing adults below and above 60 years of age, it is unlikely the lack of vaccination status for the ACS cohort biases our conclusions.Leveraging multiple sources of data, our results show that predicted relationships between prior epidemic magnitude, the degree of accumulation of susceptibility, and the resultant epidemic size do not accurately reflect the complexity of influenza epidemiology. Likely, our lack of understanding of many aspects of influenza epidemiology fundamentally hampers our ability to generate meaningful forecasts of epidemic size and severity.MethodsEpidemic composition dataWe downloaded records of virological surveillance data from the WHO FluNet20 database for all countries in the temperate Northern and Southern Hemisphere from 2002 until 2020, or a shorter period for a limited subset of countries. We limited the dataset to countries in temperate zones because the discrete seasonal nature of influenza epidemics in temperate zones facilitates the computation of lull durations and epidemic sizes. For each country, we retained the longest sequence of consecutive seasons in which at least 20 specimens were influenza-positive. In each season, defined as the period from the period from week 40 until week 20 for the Northern Hemisphere and the entire year for the Southern Hemisphere, we computed the proportion of all positive tests that was attributable to each of A/H3N2, pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 (from the 2009 pandemic onwards), and influenza B viruses. We did not break down influenza B viruses by lineage because in many countries influenza B viruses were not further characterised.In many seasons, only a proportion of all influenza A virus positive tests were subtyped; in those cases, we approximated the total proportion of each subtype by assuming that the subtype of the non-subtyped influenza A virus specimens were distributed according to the relative proportions of subtyped influenza A viruses. Additionally, we required that in each country-season at least 20 positive specimens were characterised (though most counts were much higher). This resulted in a dataset of 718 season-country records over a period of 18 seasons, for 47 countries. We assigned a binary variable to each (sub)type in each season for substantial circulation; we defined substantial circulation as a (sub)type accounting for at least 20% of all detections in a country in a season. Hence, in principle, all three (sub)types considered can simultaneously substantially circulate in a single season. To avoid including effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza dynamics, we truncated the 2019/2020 season at the 15th of February 2020, and to avoid including the effect of the 2009 A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic, we truncated the 2008/2009 influenza season at the 1st of April 2009.Epidemic size dataTo estimate epidemic sizes for each (sub)type, we extracted weekly records of influenza-like illness from the WHO FluID21 database. We limited this dataset to countries for which influenza-like illness (ILI) records were available for all seasons from 2010/2011 until 2019/2020, and for which virological surveillance data was available, as described above. This period was chosen because the availability of ILI data was insufficient for the years preceding 2010. We required ILI curves to follow the expected shape of an influenza epidemic curve, i.e. peaking in winter and only sporadic isolation outside this period, and without periods of missing data. To facilitate the estimation of season effects, we only considered countries located in the Northern hemisphere. This yielded a set of 20 countries, each with 10 seasons worth of ILI data, located in Europe and the Middle East.To approximate the relative epidemic size of each subtype in each country in each season, we first multiplied total ILI incidence in that country’s season by the proportion of all detections in that country in that season attributable to that (sub)type in the virological surveillance data, yielding a measure of (sub)type-specific ILI. We then computed the relative size of each (sub)type’s epidemic in each country by season by computing the proportion of all ILI in that country in the total study period, i.e. from the 2010/2011 until 2019/2020 seasons, that was attributable to that (sub)type and season, and multiplying this number by the total number of seasons. Hence, if in a particular season in a particular country a (sub)type’s epidemic had a relative size of 0.8, its size corresponded to 80% of the mean influenza epidemic size (irrespective of (sub)type) in that country in the ten-year period. In this way, this metric accounts for differences between seasons with regard to epidemic size, as opposed to only composition. We accounted for the COVID-19 pandemic as described above.Statistical modellingWe used Bayesian hierarchical linear regression to estimate the effects of lull periods on epidemic size. As predictors, we separately used each of (1) seasons since previous substantial circulation, (2) previous season relative size, or (3) previous two seasons’ relative size sum. The first model has relative size as outcome and seasons since substantial circulation as calculated using the virological surveillance data as predictor (n = 188, 198, 191 for A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09 and B):$${y}_{i} \sim {{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}({\alpha }+\beta {x}_{i},{\sigma }_{y})$$ (1) where yi is an epidemic’s relative size for a certain (sub)type in country-season pair i, α is the model intercept for that (sub)type, β is the coefficient for number of seasons since substantial circulation of the (sub)type, and σy is the error standard deviation. xi represents the number of seasons since substantial circulation of the (sub)type in country-season pair i, such that α represents the predicted size if the previous substantial circulation was in the previous season. We put weakly informative priors on the main effect, the intercept and the standard deviation.$$\beta \sim {{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}\left(0,1\right)$$ (2) $${\alpha } \sim {{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}(0.5,1)$$ (3) $${\sigma }_{y} \sim {{{{{\rm{Half}}}}}}-{{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}(0,1)$$ (4) We also ran the same models with season effects, where we furnished each season with its own intercept:$${y}_{i} \sim {{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}({{\alpha }}_{s[i]}+\beta {x}_{i},{\sigma }_{y})$$ (5) Here, αs[i] is the season effect for that (sub)type corresponding to that season, for a country-season pair i. Season effects are shared between countries in a single season. We assumed that the season effects αs, constrained to positive values, are distributed according to a common mean μα and common standard deviation σα, and we put weakly informative priors on the mean season effect and its standard deviation:$${{\alpha }}_{s} \sim {{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}({\mu }_{{{{{{\rm{\alpha }}}}}}},{\sigma }_{{{{{{\rm{\alpha }}}}}}})$$ (6) $${\mu }_{{\alpha }} \sim {{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}(0.5,1)$$ (7) $${\sigma }_{{\alpha }} \sim {{{{{\rm{Half}}}}}}-{{{{{\rm{Normal}}}}}}\left(0,1\right)$$ (8) In addition to the model described above, we ran models with relative size as outcome and relative size in the previous season as the predictor (n = 180 for each (sub)type) or the sum of the two previous seasons’ sizes (n = 160 for each (sub)type). We used the same model specification and priors as for the size~seasons since substantial circulation model, but we replaced the predictor with the relative size in the previous season, or with the sum of relative size in the two previous seasons. All the above models were run both with and without season effects, i.e. with either a single value for the intercept, or with a separate intercept for each season. In the models with season effects, the season effects correspond to the predicted ‘base size’ of a (sub)type’s epidemic in a particular season, given that either the previous substantial circulation was in the previous season, there was no circulation in the previous season, or there was no circulation in the previous two seasons, respectively, for the models with seasons since previous substantial circulation, previous season size, and previous two seasons’ size sum as predictors. We ran the models for each (sub)type individually, and for each predictor individually. The models were fit using MCMC in Stan v2.21.0. The models were each run for 3000 iterations, discarding the first 1000 as burn-in, with four independent chains. Convergence was assessed by inspection of Rhat (<1.05), effective sample size (> 200) and the trace plots. We compared models with and without season effects using leave-one-out cross-validation45. Analyses were performed using R v4.0.3.Severity dataWe used excess deaths as a proxy for epidemic severity. We extracted pooled Europe-wide winter-period excess mortality for the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons, and pooled-Europe wide flu-specific winter-period excess mortality for the 2012/2013 to 2017/2018 seasons from the EuroMOMO network, which combines data regarding excess deaths in European countries to estimate Europe-wide excess mortality22,23. The number of countries included in the calculation of excess deaths ranged from 7 in 2010/2011 to 24 in 2017/2018. For seasons that were (1) dominated by a single (sub)type in most countries; and (2) were uniform across most countries with regard to the number of seasons since previous substantial circulation of the dominant (sub)type, we compared the Europe-wide excess mortality to the value for seasons since substantial circulation. Because these criteria were only met for a small number of seasons, the comparison was performed mostly qualitatively.VirusesTo select the four representative strains used in this study (A/Netherlands/04189/2017 (A/H3N2), A/Netherlands/10218/2018 (A/H1N1pdm09), B/Netherlands/04136/2017 (B/Yamagata), and B/Netherlands/00302/2018 (B/Victoria)), we downloaded high-quality (<5% ambiguous nucleotides, >95% full length) seasonal influenza virus haemagglutinin sequences (A/H3N2, n = 1396; A/H1N1pdm09, n = 1283; B/Yamagata, n = 1129; and B/Victoria, n = 1408) collected between 2016 and October 2021 from GISAID (www.gisaid.org) and reconstructed maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees for each influenza virus subtype using the general time reversible substitution model with IQ-TREE46.These trees were used to assess the representativeness of viruses from the Netherlands in the early portion of the study period and the selected viruses were all representative of viruses that caused epidemics in the Netherlands during the 2017/2018 winter.All four viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in infection medium which consisted of MEM-Eagle Medium /EBSS (Lonza, Geleen, The Netherlands) supplemented with MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Gibco, ThermoFischer Scientific, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), l-Glutamine (Lonza), HEPES (Lonza), and TPCKtrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). They were harvested after 72 h of incubation at either 37 °C (H3N2 and H1N1) or 33 °C (Yamagata and Victoria) and checked by Sanger sequencing.Longitudinal serum samplesA total of 630 serum samples from 165 healthy male and female adults, including people >70 years of age (elderly), were collected in the Netherlands, longitudinally, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in two separate cohorts: 1. the Viro-immunological, clinical and psychosocial correlates of disease severity and long-term outcomes of infection in SARS-CoV-2 – a prospective cohort study27 (RECoVERED) and 2. Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS28 (ACS).The aim of the RECoVERED cohort study is to describe the immunological, clinical and psychosocial sequelae of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals aged 16 to 85 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled from May 2020 until the end of June 2021 in the municipal region of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All participants provided written informed consent. The RECoVERED study was approved by the medical ethical review board of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre (NL73759.018.20). From the RECoVERED study, we selected a total of 34 male and 31 female adults ranging from 20 to 77 years old at the time of sample collection in mid-2020, all of which had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection but were otherwise healthy and unvaccinated for influenza in 2020. For these 65 individuals, samples were collected in the summer period of 2020 and 2021 only (two total for each participant).The initial aim of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies was to investigate the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of HIV-1 infection. The study population consists of men who have sex with men and live mainly around the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participation in ACS is voluntary and without incentive. Written informed consent of each participant was obtained at enrolment. The Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands (MEC 07/182). Participants from the ACS cohort included in our study were all HIV-1 seronegative men ranging from 22 to 70 years old at the time of sample collection in mid-2017. Briefly, five stored samples were used per participant, i.e. 1. mid-2017, 2. mid-2018, 3. mid-2019, 4. mid-2020, 5. mid-2021.Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assayAll serum samples were receptor destroying enzyme (RDE)-treated, as described elsewhere47. Briefly, for ACS individuals 1–30, 100 μL of serum was combined with 200 μL of RDE (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan); for ACS individuals 31–100, 100 μL of serum were combined with 300 μL or 200 μL of RDE (supplied by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment). This difference in protocol was per the instructions of the providers of the respective batches of RDE. For all 65 RECoVERED subjects, the latter RDE was used, combining 100 μL of serum with combined with 200 μL of RDE. Because of this protocol difference, the results of ACS participants 1–30 and 31–100 are shown separately. Differences in dilution were accounted for in titre calculation. All samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 18–20 h. The RDE reaction was then halted by heating the treated samples at 56 °C for 30–60 min.The haemagglutination inhibition activity of all serum samples was tested in an HI assay as described elsewhere47 using two replicates per sample for A/H1N1pdm09, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria viruses, and one single measurement for A/H3N2 viruses. Due to inefficient agglutination of turkey red blood cells (tRBCs) by recent A/H3N2 viruses, we used glycan remodelled tRBCs expressing appropriate receptors for recent A/H3N2 viruses for the HI assays of the A/H3N2 virus stock48. Briefly, the haemagglutination titre of each of the four viruses was determined by performing a two-fold serial dilution of 50 μL of each virus stock and adding 50 μL of PBS and 25 μL of 1% turkey red blood cells (tRBCs) to each well, followed by 1 h incubation at 4 °C and the reading of the haemagglutination patterns. The virus stocks were then diluted to a concentration of four haemagglutination units (HAU). The diluted viruses were then incubated with 50 μL of 2-fold serially diluted serum, in a total volume of 75 μL for 30 min at 37 °C. The initial dilution used for the serial dilution of the serum was 1:20 of the RDE-treated serum. After the incubation step, 25 μL of 1% turkey red blood cells were added to the serum-virus mix and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The haemagglutination inhibition patterns were then read out and used for the calculation of antibody titres.Antibody waning modelFor the RECoVERED cohort for the years 2020 and 2021, all participants were confirmed to have not received an influenza vaccination between the two sample collections and no natural influenza infection can be safely assumed given the near absence of influenza in the Netherlands during this period. For the ACS data, those who experienced a four or greater fold increase in titre between consecutive visits for a particular strain had their strain-data discarded in order to remove the obscuring effects of vaccination and infection.True antibody titre log2 HI, \({\widetilde{T}}_{i}\) as opposed to that measured by HI assay, Ti, is a continuous variable which we assume, for every individual i, decays with time t as$${\widetilde{T}}_{i}={c}_{i}-{\alpha }_{i}t$$ (8) Where ci are individual specific initial titres and αi are the individual waning rates. The waning rates are assumed to be normally distributed about a population mean, αµ, with standard deviation, ασ.If serum dilutions could be performed in arbitrarily small increments, we assume the point at which haemagglutination would be observed to cease, Tobs, to be distributed normally about the true value:$${T}_{{obs}} \sim N(\widetilde{T,}\epsilon )$$ (9) Instead, with discrete dilutions in increments of one, the probability of measuring T ∈ {0,1,2…8} is the probability that Tobs falls between T and T−1. Thus, the measurement probability is given by:$$P(T{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}\widetilde{T},\epsilon )=\left\{\begin{array}{c}\Phi (1,\widetilde{T},\epsilon )\hfill\\ \Phi (T,\widetilde{T},\epsilon )-\Phi (T-1,\widetilde{T},\epsilon )\hfill\\ 1-\Phi (8,\widetilde{T},\epsilon )\hfill\end{array}\right.\begin{array}{c}T\, < \,1\\ 1 \le T\, < \,8\\ T\ge 8\end{array}$$ (10) where Φ(x, μ, σ) is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.Our data for each individual, i, consists of a series of titre measurements, \({{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}_{i,r}=({T}_{1,i,r},{T}_{2,i,r},\ldots .,{T}_{n,i,r})\), at corresponding timepoints 1… n, where r ∈ {1,2} indicates replicate measurements. To infer the probability of the unknown parameters ϵ, αμ and ασ given the data, it is necessary to augment the data by introducing individual intercepts. For one replicate from one individual, the likelihood of unknown parameters αμ, ασ, ϵ, and ci then becomes:$$p({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i}{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}})\propto p({{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}{\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i})\Pi ({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i})$$ (11) $$\propto p({{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}|{\widetilde{{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i}))\Pi ({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i})$$ (12) where \({\widetilde{{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}}({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i})=({\widetilde{T}}_{1,i},{\widetilde{T}}_{2,i},\ldots .,{\widetilde{T}}_{n,i})\) are the true values of titre, given the unknown parameters and Π is the prior joint distribution of the parameters. The total log likelihood is thus the sum over all individuals and replicates:$$L({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,c{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}})\propto \mathop{\sum }\limits_{i}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{r}\log (p({\alpha }_{\mu },{\alpha }_{\sigma },\epsilon,{c}_{i}{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}{{{{{{\boldsymbol{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\boldsymbol{i}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{,}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}}}))$$ (13) A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm implemented in Stan v2.21.0 was used to explore the distribution of model parameters (waning and measurement) and augmented data (individual intercepts). This model was run on four independent chains, each consisting of 5000 iterations discarding the first 2500 as burn in. Weakly informative priors were used and convergence was assessed by inspection of the trace plots and Rhat. Analyses were conducted using R v4.0.3, with code available in the GitHub repository.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Here we introduce an approach to control antigen orientation via site-specific insertion of aspartate residues that facilitates antigen binding to alum. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach with antigens from Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses and observe enhanced neutralizing antibody responses in all cases. We then reorient an H2 HA in an ‘upside-down’ configuration to increase the exposure and immunogenicity of HA-stem. The reoriented H2 HA (reoH2HA) on alum induced stem-directed antibodies that cross-react with both group 1 and group 2 influenza A subtypes. Electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) revealed that reoH2HA (group 1) elicits cross-reactive antibodies targeting group 2 HA-stems. Our results highlight antigen reorientation as a generalizable approach for designing epitope-focused vaccines.

In the case of influenza virus, current vaccines elicit strain-specific antibody responses against the immunodominant but variable head region of HA (HA-head) that undergoes antigenic drift, necessitating annual updates of seasonal influenza vaccines4,5. When a novel zoonotic influenza virus acquires the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission, existing vaccine-induced immunity is unlikely to confer protection6. Such risks highlight the importance of pandemic preparedness and the urgent need to generate a universal vaccine that protects against diverse influenza strains7.A potential strategy for developing more broadly protective vaccines is to focus the immune response (referred to as immunofocusing) on antigenic regions that are less likely to evolve. Because the stem region of HA (HA-stem) contains highly conserved epitopes across different influenza subtypes, focusing antibody responses on HA-stem and away from the immunodominant HA-head is a promising approach8. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HA-stem show broad neutralizing activity and protect animals from lethal challenges9,10,11,12,13. HA-stem-directed antibodies also correlate with protection from infection and disease in humans14.Current immunofocusing approaches include sequential immunization15,16,17,18 or mosaic display19,20 of heterologous HAs or chimeric HAs that contain the same HA-stem but varying HA-head to stimulate a stem-directed response21. These approaches require complicated vaccination regimens and do not directly address the immunodominance of HA-head22. Other immunofocusing approaches include masking HA-head with glycosylation23,24 or PEGylation25 or structure-based design of HA-stem-only immunogens26,27,28,29. While epitope masking often leads to reduced immunogenicity in vivo24,25, the generation of HA-stem-only proteins requires laborious rounds of design, screening and optimization of antigens to retain the proper presentation of conformational epitopes. Ultimately, although these strategies have found some success in inducing cross-reactivity among a particular phylogenetic group (that is, group 1 or group 2) of influenza A virus HAs, it remains a challenge to elicit a consistent response to both groups from a single immunogen.In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that antigen reorientation is a straightforward and effective immunofocusing strategy. We tested if reorientation of HA in an ‘upside-down’ configuration from its natural presentation on influenza virions would sterically occlude HA-head and redirect the antibody response to the more exposed HA-stem. Interestingly, stem-directed (but not head-directed) mAbs isolated from vaccinated individuals exhibit significantly reduced binding to the whole virus as compared to recombinant HA proteins30. We hypothesize that steric occlusion leads to poor accessibility of HA-stem31, thereby biasing antibody responses toward HA-head during natural infection30.To control antigen orientation, we first developed an approach based on the site-specific insertion of short stretches of aspartate residues (oligoD) into different protein antigens to facilitate their binding to alum, a well-established vaccine adjuvant that has been used for over 90 years32. The surface of alum allows the presentation of oligoD-modified antigens in a pre-defined manner. Methods to afford increased antigen binding to alum were developed previously33,34,35. Most notably, phosphoserine-tagged antigens showed increased binding to alum, leading to substantially enhanced humoral immune responses after immunization35. Still, this approach requires additional synthesis of phosphorylated peptides followed by chemical conjugation to antigens and post-modification purification procedures. In contrast, oligoD insertion is a simple, one-step process pre-programmed by molecular cloning. To validate our proposed approach, we inserted oligoD at the C-terminus of Ebola glycoprotein and showed that oligoD insertion increased antigen-binding to alum and elicited robust germinal center (GC) and neutralizing antibody responses. To demonstrate the simplicity and generalizability of our approach, we also inserted oligoD at two other protein antigens (SARS-CoV-2 spike and HA of A/New Caledonia/20/99) and found that oligoD-modified antigens induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibody responses compared to wild-type antigens.After establishing that oligoD insertion mediated antigen binding to alum, we identified a permissive site on the head of an H2 HA (A/Japan/305/1957) for oligoD insertion. We chose this H2 HA because H2 HAs contain a bulky phenylalanine residue on their stem region that expands the breadth of B cell responses upon vaccination compared to HAs from other subtypes36. We showed that oligoD insertion into H2 HA resulted in the tri-valent anchoring of its head to alum at specific locations on each HA trimer in an ‘upside-down’ configuration. Immunization with this reoriented group 1 H2 HA (reoH2HA) on alum elicited a stem-directed and cross-reactive antibody response to diverse HA subtypes from both group 1 and group 2. Negative-stain electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (nsEMPEM) also revealed that reoH2HA elicited cross-reactive antibodies that recognized stem epitopes of group 2 HAs, whereas H2 HA did not. Our results demonstrate the potential of designing epitope-focused vaccine candidates via antigen reorientation.ResultsOligoD insertion enables antigen binding to alumTo determine the length of oligoD required for alum binding, we first used the ectodomain of Ebola glycoprotein (GP) as a test case and genetically inserted 2, 4, 8 or 12 repeating units of aspartates (abbreviated as 2D, 4D, 8D or 12D, respectively) at its C-terminus (Fig. 1a). OligoD-modified GP proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells via transient transfection and purified to homogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). OligoD insertion did not change the thermal melting profile (Fig. 1b) or melting temperature (Tm, 58 °C; Extended Data Fig. 1c) of GP, suggesting a negligible perturbation to its native structure. In addition, we selected a panel of five GP-specific mAbs (mAb114, c13C6, ADI-15742, KZ52 and ADI-16061) that recognize different epitopes on GP and examined their binding to wild-type or oligoD-modified GP using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) (Supplementary Fig. 1). We found no noticeable differences in the binding profiles of these mAbs to all GP proteins (Fig. 1c), suggesting proper presentation of those conformational epitopes. Next, we measured the effect of oligoD insertions on GP-binding to alum (Alhydrogel). We pre-mixed wild-type or oligoD-modified GP with alum (protein:alum, 1:10, w/w) for 1 h and then incubated the mixtures in the presence of naive mouse serum (10%, v/v) at 37 °C for 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 1d). After incubation, alum pellets were rinsed extensively and subjected to protein gel electrophoresis followed by western blot analysis to determine the amount of alum-bound GP. Whereas only a small fraction of wild-type GP was detected on the blot, an increasing amount of GP bound to alum as the number of aspartates increased from two to 12 (Fig. 1d). To quantify the amount of alum-bound GP, we collected the supernatant from GP–alum mixtures and measured the concentration of unbound GP by ELISAs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Consistent with the western blot, higher GP binding to alum correlated with increasing oligoD length (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1f). The presence of naive mouse serum did not affect binding of GP-8D or GP-12D to alum. To directly visualize antigen binding to alum, we performed immunogold labeling for GP–alum complexes (Extended Data Fig. 1g) and observed the absorption of GP-12D (but not GP) on alum under transmission electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The interaction between oligoD and alum also did not affect the thermal stability of GP proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Because oligoD likely mediates its alum binding via electrostatic interactions, use of the negatively charged aluminum phosphate (Adju-Phos) adjuvant abolished antigen binding as the length of oligoD increased (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Besides the C-terminus, we identified three flexible loop regions (after residue R200, T294 or A309) on GP that readily accommodated oligoD insertion (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Thermal melting profiles and Tm of the resulting oligoD-modified GP proteins were identical to those of wild-type GP (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Although both GP-8D and GP-12D exhibited approximately 100% binding to alum, only 12D insertion afforded approximately 100% GP binding to alum when inserted into each of these flexible loop regions (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Therefore, we inserted 12D into antigens to promote maximal binding to alum for subsequent immunization studies.Fig. 1: OligoD insertion enables antigen binding to alum and enhances neutralizing antibody responses.a, Site-specific insertion of oligoD of different lengths (2, 4, 8 or 12 aspartate residues, pink) at the C-terminus of Ebola GP (Protein Data Bank ID: 5JQ3). b, Thermal melting profiles of wild-type or oligoD-modified GP measured by differential scanning fluorimetry. c, Analysis of GP-specific mAb binding of wild-type or oligoD-modified GP by BLI.

Comparison of two groups was performed using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test (g,i). P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.Source dataFull size imageTo evaluate the immunogenicity of oligoD-modified GP, we immunized mice with GP or GP-12D adjuvanted with alum via subcutaneous injection (Fig. 1f). A single dose of GP with alum elicited a relatively weak GP-specific antibody response, whereas GP-12D with alum stimulated a much stronger response with almost 10-fold higher IgG titers 6 weeks after immunization (Fig. 1g). At 6 weeks and 8 weeks after immunization, we detected very low IgG titers against oligoD or other C-terminal affinity tags that were used for purification purposes (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Next, we generated Ebola GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses (EBOVs) (Extended Data Fig. 2f) to analyze the neutralizing antibody response. Consistent with the IgG titers, GP-12D induced a three-fold to five-fold stronger neutralizing antibody response than GP did (Fig. 1h). Whereas all mice immunized with GP-12D adjuvanted with alum developed neutralizing responses at week 6 (Supplementary Fig. 2a), only half of the mice immunized with GP did, although the titers were lower. Even at week 12, one mouse immunized with GP did not show any neutralizing activity (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Taken together, oligoD insertion increased antigen binding to alum and significantly enhanced neutralizing antibody responses in animal immunizations compared to wild-type GP.OligoD-modified antigens stimulate robust GC responsesTo understand the mechanism underlying the enhanced antibody response elicited by GP-12D, we immunized mice with GP or GP-12D and analyzed the GC responses in draining lymph nodes at 7 d, 14 d or 21 d after immunization using flow cytometry37 (Fig. 2a). As with the previous immunization (Fig. 1g), a single injection of GP-12D with alum elicited a stronger antibody response than GP with alum did (Fig. 2b). Use of alum also led to a Th2-biased response (IgG1) in both groups with negligible titers of IgG2a or IgG2b (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Besides the serological response, we examined the responses of GC B cells (CD19+CD95+CD38−), IgG+ GC B cells and T follicular helper cells (TFH, CD3+CD4+PD1+CXCR5+) in the draining lymph nodes (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Compared to GP with alum, GP-12D with alum induced an extended GC response with a substantially higher magnitude of GC B cells (Fig. 2c), IgG+ GC B cells (Extended Data Fig. 3c) and TFH cells (Fig. 2d), which all peaked at 14 d after immunization. These data suggest that the higher antibody titers elicited by GP-12D with alum resulted from stimulation of a robust GC response.Fig. 2: OligoD-modified GP stimulates a robust GC response.a, Immunization schedule for the analysis of GC responses in draining lymph nodes.

P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.Source dataFull size imageOligoD insertion is generalizable to other protein antigensGiven the simplicity of our approach, we applied oligoD insertion to two other protein antigens for additional validation. We first inserted oligoD at the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 spike to generate spike-12D (Fig. 3a). Wild-type spike and spike-12D were transiently expressed and purified to homogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). In both the absence (Extended Data Fig. 4c) and the presence (Extended Data Fig. 4d) of alum, spike-12D shared the same thermal melting profile and Tm transitions (44 °C and 52 °C) with spike. We also found nearly identical binding profiles for ACE2–Fc and three spike-specific mAbs (COVA2-15, CB6 and CR3022) against spike or spike-12D (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4e). Next, we immunized mice with spike or spike-12D adjuvanted with alum via subcutaneous injection (Fig. 3c). A three-dose regimen of spike-12D with alum elicited a significantly higher antibody response than spike with alum did against both spike (Fig. 3d) and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 3e). Immunization of spike-12D with alum also greatly enhanced the neutralizing response against spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Despite the less than two-fold difference in IgG titers at week 9, the neutralization titers (NT50) of the spike-12D group were over five-fold higher than those of the spike group. When we further assessed the neutralization of other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Extended Data Fig. 5a–e and Supplementary Fig. 3c–e), we found consistently higher neutralizing activity from antisera elicited by spike-12D (Fig. 3g).Fig. 3: OligoD insertion into spike enhances neutralizing antibody responses.a, Insertion of oligoD (12D) at the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 spike (Protein Data Bank ID: 6VXX). b, BLI binding analysis of spike or spike-12D with ACE2–Fc and three spike-specific mAbs. c, A three-dose immunization study with spike or spike-12D adjuvanted with alum via subcutaneous injection in BALB/c mice. d,e, Serum spike-specific (d) or RBD-specific (e) IgG titers over time (n = 10 mice per group).

Comparison of two groups was performed using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test (d–g). P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.Source dataFull size imageBesides SARS-CoV-2 spike, we inserted oligoD at the C-terminus of an H1 HA (A/New Caledonia/20/99) (Fig. 4a). Similar to the modifications in GP and spike, oligoD insertion did not affect the expression, homogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b) or thermal stability (Extended Data Fig. 6c) of H1 HA. The binding profiles with different HA-specific mAbs (CH65, H2897, 6649, MEDI8852, CR9114 and FI6v3), as determined by BLI, also suggested the proper presentation of conformational epitopes on H1 HA-12D (Supplementary Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b). A prime-boost immunization of H1 HA-12D with alum elicited substantially higher (five-fold to 10-fold) HA-specific IgG titers than H1 HA with alum did (Fig. 4c,d). Increased IgG titers also translated into more potent neutralizing activity (Fig. 4e), where H1 HA-12D induced significantly higher NT50 than H1 HA did against authentic A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1 A/NC/20/99) viruses (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c). To determine whether the antisera targeted HA-head or HA-stem, we performed competition ELISA, in which antigen-coated ELISA plates were pre-incubated with a saturating concentration of individual HA-specific mAbs before incubation with antisera. We observed a clear competition between antisera and HA-head-directed mAbs (H2897 or 6649) with a more pronounced change in the H1 HA-12D group (Fig. 4f). In contrast, there was negligible competition with HA-stem-directed antibodies (MEDI8852 or CR9114), suggesting that oligoD insertion at the C-terminus of HA only boosted antibody responses toward the immunodominant HA-head. Nonetheless, higher antibody titers elicited by H1 HA-12D correlated with an increased breadth against two other group 1 HAs, namely H2 (A/Japan/305/1957) and H5 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) HAs, presumably toward conserved epitopes on HA-head (Extended Data Fig. 6d).Fig. 4: OligoD insertion into HA enhances neutralizing antibody responses.a, Insertion of oligoD (12D) at the C-terminus of H1 HA (Protein Data Bank ID: 1RU7 for reference). b, BLI binding analysis of H1 HA or H1 HA-12D with HA-specific mAbs. c, A prime-boost immunization study with H1 HA or H1 HA-12D adjuvanted with alum via subcutaneous injection in BALB/c mice. d, Serum H1 HA-specific IgG titers over time (n = 10 mice per group).

P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.Source dataFull size imageReorientation of H2 HA on alum to afford immunofocusingHaving validated using three protein antigens that oligoD insertion enabled their binding to alum and increased their immunogenicity, we then attempted to insert oligoD into HA-head to anchor this region on alum and redirect antibody responses to the newly exposed HA-stem (Fig. 5a). We chose to insert oligoD into an H2 HA because the bulky phenylalanine (F45HA2) in its HA-stem expands the cross-reactivity of stem-binding B cells36. Although oligoD insertions into HA-head often led to substantially reduced protein expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 5a), insertion after residue S156 in the head of H2 HA (A/Japan/305/1957) was successful (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and produced reoH2HA (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). ReoH2HA maintained the thermal stability of its wild-type counterpart (Extended Data Fig. 7d), including in the presence of alum (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The insertion into the head of H2 HA also did not appreciably affect the binding profiles (Supplementary Fig. 5c and Fig. 5b) or affinities (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f) of stem-directed mAbs against the protein. To validate the ‘upside-down’ orientation of oligoD-modified HA on alum, we measured binding of head-directed and stem-directed mAbs (Extended Data Fig. 7e) to reoH2HA on streptavidin-coated or alum-coated ELISA plates (Fig. 5c,d). When C-terminal biotinylated H2 HA or reoH2HA was adsorbed on streptavidin-coated ELISA plates (Extended Data Fig. 7f and Fig. 4c), both head-directed (8F8 and 8M2) and stem-directed (MEDI8852 and FI6v3) mAbs showed similar high-affinity binding to these antigens, suggesting that oligoD insertion did not affect the antigenicity of H2 HA. Because H2 HA adsorbed poorly on alum, we created H2 HA with 12D inserted at its C-terminus as an ‘upright’ control and found identical mAb-binding profiles between streptavidin-coated and alum-coated plates (Extended Data Fig. 7f). In contrast, only stem-directed mAbs bound to reoH2HA when it was adsorbed on alum (Fig. 5d). Loss of binding of head-directed mAbs suggests that reoH2HA adopted an ‘upside-down’ configuration on alum, where epitopes on HA-head were no longer accessible. We also validated binding of reoH2HA on alum via immunogold labeling, where we observed decoration of alum by reoH2HA but not H2 HA by transmission electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 7g).Fig. 5: Reorientation of H2 HA enabled immunofocusing on HA-stem.a, Insertion of oligoD into the head of H2 HA (A/Japan/305/1957) after residue S156 (Protein Data Bank ID: 2WRE).

P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.Source dataFull size imageWe next immunized mice with H2 HA or reoH2HA adjuvanted with alum and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 5e). We chose this combined alum/CpG adjuvant because we found in an immunization study with another HA (A/Shanghai/2/2013) that it further elevated the overall antibody titers compared to alum alone (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). After three injections, mice from both groups developed robust H2 HA-specific IgG responses (Fig. 5f). Despite similar antigen-specific titers, reoH2HA elicited 10-fold higher antibody titers against HA-stem, as measured by binding of antisera to the H1-stabilized stem (H1-SS) protein28 (Fig. 5g). To test whether stem binding translated to increased cross-reactivity, we measured binding of antisera to different group 1 and group 2 HAs. After two doses, antisera from mice immunized with reoH2HA showed higher cross-reactive titers than those immunized with H2 HA (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Even after three doses, mice immunized with H2 HA mostly cross-reacted with half of the HAs that we tested (H1 CA/09, H5 VT/04 and H7 SH/13) although with relatively low titers. In contrast, almost all mice immunized with reoH2HA developed cross-reactive responses against both group 1 and group 2 HAs tested (Fig. 5h). To further evaluate if cross-reactive responses were focused, at least partially, on neutralizing epitopes of HA-stem, we analyzed whether antisera competed for binding with a known stem-specific broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) (MEDI8852). Compared to the H2 HA group, antisera against reoH2HA showed greater competition with MEDI8852 (Fig. 5i). Similarly, there was also stronger competition with a pan-H1, anchor-directed antibody (222-1C06) with antisera from the reoH2HA group (Supplementary Fig. 6a). As a control, antisera from neither group showed much competition for binding with another broadly protective antibody (FluA-20) that targets the trimer interface of HA (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These results indicate that alum-bound reoH2HA directed antibody responses away from the head and toward the stem region of H2 HA.To further boost cross-reactive responses, we immunized mice with H2 HA or reoH2HA adjuvanted with a higher dose of CpG (Fig. 6a). Similar to the previous immunization, both antigens induced robust H2 HA-specific IgG responses (Extended Data Fig. 8d), whereas reoH2HA elicited greater stem-directed responses (Fig. 6b) and cross-reactivity toward both group 1 and group 2 HAs (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 8e). Antisera raised against reoH2HA also showed stronger competition with MEDI8852 (Supplementary Fig. 6c) and 222-1C06 (Supplementary Fig. 6d) than those against H2 HA did, and both groups showed negligible competition with FluA-20 (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Despite an increase in the CpG dose (1 µg to 5 µg), the overall antibody responses were still Th2-biased given the use of high-dose alum (150 µg) (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g).Fig. 6: Cross-reactive antibodies elicited by reoH2HA recognize group 2 HA-stem.a, A three-dose immunization study with H2 HA or reoH2HA adjuvanted with a higher dose of CpG with alum in BLAB/c mice. b, Serum stem-specific IgG titers over time (n = 10 mice per group).

Each circle represents a single mouse (n = 10 mice per group). Dashed lines indicate the limit of quantification in b,c. Data are presented as geometric mean ± s.d. of the log10‐transformed values (b,c). Comparison of two groups was performed using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test. P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. d,e, nsEMPEM analyses for week 12 (d) or week 7 (e) pooled antisera raised against H2 HA (top row) or reoH2HA (bottom row). Composite maps generated from negative-stain reconstructions of polyclonal immune complexes with H2 HA, H7 HA or H3 HA are shown for each group. Representative 2D class averages with the polyclonal Fab labeled are shown for immune complexes in low abundance, in which dotted lines highlight the likely position for the Fab population.Source dataFull size imageTo characterize epitopes targeted by cross-reactive antisera, we created polyclonal immune complexes (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b) and performed nsEMPEM38 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). After three immunizations, both antigens induced antibodies binding to head, stem and anchor epitopes of H2 HA (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), whereas reoH2HA also elicited antibodies targeting the apex of intact HA trimers (Extended Data Fig. 9b), possibly due to introduction of a neo-antigen by oligoD near this region. We also observed low levels of cross-reactive, stem-directed antibodies against a group 2 HA (H7 HA) from both groups. We then performed additional nsEMPEM analysis with two group 2 HAs using week 7 antisera, where we observed the highest stem-directed IgG titers from the reoH2HA group (Fig. 6c). When complexed with H7 HA, reoH2HA elicited antibodies targeting HA-stem and another ambiguous epitope (Extended Data Fig. 9c), whereas responses to these epitopes were not observed in antisera against H2 HA (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 9d). Notably, immunization with reoH2HA also induced low levels of cross-reactive antibodies targeting H3 HA-stem (Extended Data Fig. 9e) despite the lowest cross-reactive titers toward H3 HA, whereas immunization with H2 HA did not (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Taken together with ELISA data, reoH2HA stimulated a stem-directed antibody response with higher magnitude, breadth and affinity than H2 HA did.Considering the generally weak neutralizing activity of stem-directed antibodies and the limited availability of sera, we pooled antisera from each group and purified IgG to assess the cross-neutralizing activity against A/California/7/09 (H1N1) viruses (Extended Data Fig. 10a), because we observed the highest cross-reactive titers against this corresponding H1 HA. Whereas IgG purified from the H2 HA group did not show any significant cross-neutralization at all concentrations, IgG purified from the reoH2HA group exhibited modest cross-neutralizing activity against this heterosubtypic H1N1 strain (Extended Data Fig. 10b).DiscussionIt remains challenging to acquire durable and protective immunity from vaccinations against viruses with high sequence variability, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. However, the discovery of bnAbs that target conserved epitopes on viral glycoproteins suggests the possibility of developing universal vaccines against these targets and has prompted the development of epitope-focused vaccine candidates to direct antibody responses toward bnAb epitopes7,39. In the case of influenza virus, intense efforts to focus antibody responses to HA-stem include cross-strain boosting15,16,17,18, mosaic display19,20, epitope resurfacing21, epitope masking23,24,25 and protein dissection26,27,28,29. Although these diverse immunofocusing approaches have led to substantial progress toward broadening the breadth of the antibody response, it has not been possible to elicit an antibody response with a single immunogen that consistently cross-reacts with HAs from both group 1 and group 2 influenza A subtypes.Here we introduce a new approach to immunofocusing—antigen reorientation. Our hypothesis was that the reorientation of antigens could alter epitope accessibility and redirect the immune response to less dominant but more desirable epitopes. Using influenza HA as a model, we reoriented the full-length HA ectodomain in an ‘upside-down’ configuration facilitated by its binding to alum, to redirect antibody responses away from the variable HA-head and toward the highly conserved HA-stem. We envisioned that this approach could increase the exposure of the poorly accessible HA-stem that was originally occluded by HA-head on influenza virions30,31 while simultaneously sterically decreasing the exposure of HA-head—in the context of an intact HA trimer that preserves the native structure of HA-stem.To test this, we genetically inserted oligoD into HA-head and found that this modification enhanced antigen-binding to alum in an ‘upside-down’ configuration, likely through electrostatic interactions. Compared to existing immunofocusing approaches, our strategy simultaneously preserved the native structure and conformational epitopes of HA and mitigated the immunodominance of HA-head by tethering it to alum. Immunization with wild-type H2 HA on alum induced an antibody response that cross-reacted with several of the HAs tested, consistent with previous results40. By contrast, reoH2HA on alum elicited higher titers of cross-reactive antibodies against all group 1 and group 2 HAs tested (Fig. 6c), in support of our hypothesis that antigen reorientation redirected antibody responses to the HA-stem region. Data from the competition assay (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. 6c) and nsEMPEM (Fig. 6d,e) further revealed that antibodies targeting HA-stem epitopes afforded cross-reactivity toward two group 2 HAs (H3 and H7 HAs). We also observed cross-reactive antibodies targeting an ambiguous epitope on H7 HA (Extended Data Fig. 9c), which warrants future investigations. Taken together, increased exposure and accessibility of HA-stem in the reoriented HA directed a fraction of the overall response to important stem epitopes.Our results provide proof of concept that the reorientation of viral antigens leads to a stem-directed cross-reactive antibody response. Although antisera raised against reoH2HA only showed modest cross-neutralizing activity, they may still confer protection via Fc-mediated effector functions, as demonstrated in the case of H1-SS nanoparticles28. Whereas IgG2 correlates with stronger effector functions than IgG1 in mice, use of alum/CpG in our studies drove a Th2-biased response with much higher titers of IgG1 than IgG2 (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Therefore, it will be important to explore different ratios and formulations of adjuvants with the aim of boosting a balanced Th1/Th2 response with broad cross-reactivity. Because our reorientation approach relies on antigen binding to alum, formulation of reoH2HA with emulsion-based adjuvants remains a challenge. It remains to be determined whether cross-reactive antibody responses elicited by reoriented antigens protect against lethal challenges by direct viral neutralization or Fc-mediated mechanisms.The simplicity of our approach makes it readily generalizable to other antigens because it only requires molecular cloning and screening of insertion sites. Meanwhile, existing methods for attaching antigens to alum require additional synthesis of linker molecules followed by chemical conjugation and subsequent purification steps35,41, which may face challenges in controlling mass transport and efficient mixing during large-scale manufacture. Importantly, identifying sites where insertion of oligoD is permissive for protein expression in mammalian cells will likely be required to generate antigens with preserved native structures42. The tri-valent anchoring afforded by three distinct oligoD motifs within each HA trimer rigidifies the antigen–alum binding interface and reduces the possibility of antigens ‘lying down’ on alum. In addition, conceptually similar motifs that harness electrostatic interactions (for example, oligomeric glutamate residues) and other protein tags or binding partners43,44,45 may substitute or could be combined with oligoD for antigen reorientation and high-resolution immunofocusing purposes.In summary, we introduce a generalizable immunofocusing strategy that enables the control of antigen orientation on alum by oligoD insertion. Our results showed consistent cross-reactivity toward group 1 and group 2 HAs with a single immunogen (reoH2HA) that encodes HA from a single influenza subtype. This approach has the potential to accelerate the development of epitope-focused vaccines against a broad range of viruses and other infectious agents.MethodsCell linesHEK-293T and MDCK.2 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in D10 medium—DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (GeminiBio) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin–L-glutamine (GeminiBio). HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were provided by Jesse Bloom at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as a generous gift and were maintained in D10 media. Expi-293F cells were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and maintained in Freestyle293/Expi-293 media (2:1, v/v, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in polycarbonate shaking flasks (TriForest Labware). Stellar and BL21(DE3) competent cells were purchased from Takara Bio and Thermo Fisher Scientific, respectively.AntibodiesmAbs against Ebola GP (mAb114, c13C6, ADI-15742, KZ52 and ADI-16061), SARS-CoV-2 spike (COVA2-15, CB6 and CR3022) or influenza hemagglutinin (CH65, H2897, 6649, MEDI8852, CR9114, FI6v3, 8F8, 8M2, 222-1C06 and FluA-20) were expressed in Expi-293F cells via transient transfection.Mouse anti-His Tag antibody (clone J099B12, BioLegend, 652502), goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP conjugated (clone Poly4053, BioLegend, 405306), goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (SouthernBiotech, 1070-05), goat anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP (SouthernBiotech, 1083-05), goat anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP (SouthernBiotech, 1093-05), rabbit anti-human IgG, HRP conjugated (Abcam, ab6759) and goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP conjugated (Invitrogen, G-21234) were used as detecting antibodies for western blot analysis or ELISAs. Goat anti-human IgG, gold-conjugated (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 25208) was used for immunogold labeling. Mouse anti-influenza A nucleoprotein antibody (clones A1, A3 blend, Sigma-Aldrich, MAB8251) and rabbit anti-influenza A nucleoprotein antibody (clone HL1078, Invitrogen, MA5-42363) were used for influenza A virus microneutralization assays. For the analysis of GC responses, we stained cells with Ghost Dye Violet 510 (Tonbo Biosciences), anti-mouse CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences, 553142), CD3 (clone 17A2, BioLegend, 100216), CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioLegend, 100469), CXCR5 (clone L138D7, BioLegend, 145529), PD1 (clone 29F.1A12, BioLegend, 135228), CD19 (clone 6D5, BioLegend, 115534), CD95 (clone Jo2, BD Biosciences, 557653), CD38 (clone 90, BD Biosciences, 740245) and IgG (clone A85-1, BD Biosciences, 550083).Antigen and antibody cloningDNA encoding the Ebola GP (Mayinga, Zaire, 1976) ectodomain with the mucin-like domain deleted (residues 1–308 and 491–656) and the transmembrane domain replaced with a GCN4 (ref. 46) or foldon trimerization47 domain followed by an Avi-Tag48 and a hexahistidine tag was cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pADD2) by In-Fusion (Takara Bio). Similarly, DNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike (residues 1–1,143 from the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence, GenBank, MN9089473) or influenza hemagglutinins (HAs of H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/99, H1N1 A/California/07/2009, H2N2 A/Japan/305/1957, H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004, H3N2 A/Victoria/3/1975, H7N7 A/FPV/Dutch/1927 and H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013) were cloned into the pADD2 vector with a GCN4 or foldon trimerization domain followed by an Avi-Tag and a hexahistidine tag on the C-terminus. DNA encoding Gen6′ H1-SS was cloned into the pADD2 vector with a GCN4 trimerization domain followed by an Avi-Tag and a hexahistidine tag on the C-terminus. OligoD was inserted at the C-terminus after the hexahistidine tag in pADD2 expression plasmids. OligoD was also inserted into the flexible loop regions on Ebola GP or head regions of H1 HA (A/New Caledonia/20/99 or A/California/07/2009), H2 HA (A/Japan/305/1957), H5 HA (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H3 HA (A/Victoria/3/1975) or H7 HA (A/FPV/Dutch/1927 or A/Shanghai/2/2013) for screening purposes. DNA encoding ACE2–Fc fusion or ZsGreen with an Avi-tag, a hexahistidine tag and oligoD insertion to the C-terminus (ZsGreen-Avi-His-12D) was cloned into the pADD2 vector. Superfolder green fluorescent protein with a GCN4, an Avi-tag and a hexahistidine tag on the C-terminus (GFP-GCN4-Avi-His) was cloned into a pET28a bacterial expression vector49. DNA fragments encoding the variable heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) of antibodies were inserted into an expression plasmid encoding VRC01 HC and LC constant domains by In-Fusion. All plasmid sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Sequetech). For transfection, plasmids were transformed into Stellar cells, isolated by Maxiprep kits (NucleoBond Xtra Maxi kit, Macherey Nagel), filtered through a sterile 0.45-µm membrane in a biosafety cabinet and stored at −20 °C.Protein expression and purificationAll antigens and antibodies were expressed in Expi-293F cells. Expi-293F cells were cultured at 37 °C under constant shaking (120 r.p.m.) in a humidified CO2 (8%) incubator. Expi-293F cells were transfected at a density of 3–4 × 106 cells per milliliter. For 200-ml transfection of antigen proteins, the transfection mixture was made by adding 120 µg of plasmid DNA (from Maxiprep) to 20 ml of expression media, followed by dropwise addition of 260 µl of FectoPro transfection reagent (Polyplus) with vigorous mixing. For antibody production in 200 ml of Expi-293F cells, the transfection mixture contained 60 µg of LC plasmid DNA and 60 µg of HC plasmid DNA. Transfection mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before being transferred to Expi-293F cells. D-glucose (4 g L−1, Sigma-Aldrich) and valproic acid (3 mM, Acros Organics) were added to the cells immediately after transfection to increase recombinant protein production. Cells were boosted again with D-glucose 3 d after transfection and harvested on day 4 by centrifugation at 7,000g for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane for subsequent purification. Biotinylated proteins were expressed using the same protocol but in the presence of the BirA enzyme. For screening purposes, we expressed proteins in small scales (5–10 ml of Expi-293F cells) and analyzed the supernatant with western blots. We used mAb114 (0.5 µg ml−1) or anti-His Tag antibody (1:4,000) to detect Ebola GP or influenza HAs, respectively.Antigen proteins with hexahistidine tags were purified with HisPur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, the filtered supernatant from Expi-293F cells was mixed with Ni-NTA resin (1 ml of resin per liter of supernatant) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was then passed through a gravity-flow column, washed with 20 mM imidazole in HEPES buffer saline (HBS) (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and then eluted with 250 mM imidazole in HBS. Elution was concentrated with centrifugal filters (30 kDa or 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), MilliporeSigma) and buffer exchanged to HBS for size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 (Increase 10/300 GL, Cytiva) or Superdex 200 column (Increase 10/300 GL, Cytiva) on an ÄKTA Protein Purification System (Cytiva). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, buffer exchanged to HBS with 10% glycerol and filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane.All antibodies and ACE2–Fc were purified with MabSelect PrismA protein A chromatography. Filtered supernatant from Expi-293F cells was directly applied to a MabSelect PrismA column (Cytiva) on an ÄKTA Protein Purification System. The column was washed with HBS, and then antibodies were eluted with glycine (100 mM, pH 2.8) to HEPES buffer (1 M, pH 7.4). Fractions were concentrated and buffer exchanged to HBS with 10% glycerol. Fragment antigen binding (Fab) was prepared by digesting antibodies (IgG) with Lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Chemicals). After digestion, Fabs were purified with Protein-A Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and buffer exchanged to HBS with 10% glycerol.BL21(DE3) competent cells were transformed with the pET28a plasmid encoding GFP-GCN4-Avi-His and induced at an optical density of 0.6 with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM) for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000g for 5 min, resuspended in HBS with protease inhibitors (Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000g for 60 min, and the supernatant was further purified with Ni-NTA resin, as described above.The concentration of all proteins was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (A280), and the purity was assessed by protein gel electrophoresis. Protein samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C.Size-exclusion chromatography–multi-angle light scattering analysisSize-exclusion chromatography–multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of wild-type and oligoD-modified proteins was performed on a 1260 Infinity II high-performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent) coupled with a miniDAWN and Optilab detectors (Wyatt Technologies) for light scattering and refractive index analysis. Purified protein samples (0.2–0.5 mg ml−1) were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Increase 3.2/300, Cytiva) sequentially for analysis. ASTRA software (version 7.3.2.21, Wyatt Technologies) was used for quantitative analysis of the molar mass of antigen proteins (Supplementary Table 1).Differential scanning fluorimetryThermal melting profiles of proteins were measured by differential scanning fluorimetry on a Prometheus NT.48 instrument (NanoTemper). Protein samples (0.1 mg ml−1) were loaded into glass capillaries (NanoTemper) and then subjected to a temperature gradient from 20 °C to 95 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C per minute. Alternatively, protein samples (0.1 mg ml−1) were pre-mixed with alum (10 mg ml−1, Alhydrogel, InvivoGen) at a ratio of 1:10 (protein:alum, w/w) for 30 min at room temperature before loading into glass capillaries. HBS and alum (diluted to 1 mg ml−1 in HBS) were also loaded into glass capillaries and measured as controls. Intrinsic fluorescence (350 nm and 330 nm) was recorded as a function of temperature. Thermal melting curves were plotted using the first derivative of the ratio (350 nm/330 nm). Melting temperatures were calculated automatically by the instrument (PR.ThermControl software, version 2.3.1) and represented peaks in the thermal melting curves.BLIBLI experiments were performed on an Octet RED96 system (FortéBio). All samples were diluted with the Octet buffer (DPBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA), and assays were performed under agitation (1,000 r.p.m.). mAbs (for example, mAb114, c13C6, ADI-15742, KZ52 and ADI-16061 for Ebola GP; COVA2-15, CB6 and CR3022 for spike; CH65, H2897, 6649, MEDI8852, CR9114 and FI6v3 for H1 HA; all at 200 nM) or ACE2–Fc (200 nM) were loaded onto anti-human IgG Fc capture (AHC) biosensors (FortéBio) and then dipped into antigen solutions (for example, GP, spike and H1 HA at 150 nM or 200 nM) for binding analysis, followed by dissociation into the Octet buffer. Alternatively, biotinylated antigens (for example, H2 HA or reoH2HA at 200 nM) were loaded onto streptavidin biosensors (Sartorius) and then dipped into antibody solutions (for example, MEDI8852, CR9114 and FI6v3 at 200 nM) for binding analysis, followed by dissociation into the Octet buffer. Serial dilutions of Fabs (for example, MEDI8852, CR9114 and FI6v3 starting at 200 nM) were used to measure the affinity (KD) for biotinylated antigens. Data were processed by Data Analysis software (version 9.0.0.15, FortéBio) and then plotted. Shifts in nanometers of mAb binding to wild-type proteins were used as the maximal binding value (1.0), and shifts from oligoD-modified proteins were normalized as a fraction of the maximal binding value.Antigen–alum binding assaysWild-type GP or oligoD-modified GP was first incubated with alum (protein:alum, 1:10, w/w) for 30 min in PBS at room temperature, and then naive mouse serum was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). The mixture with alum alone or wild-type GP alone served as controls. Mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C under constant shaking (220 r.p.m.) on an orbital shaker for 24 h before being centrifuged to pellet alum (10,000g for 5 min). The supernatant was collected for ELISA to measure the concentration of unbound protein antigens. Alum pellets were rinsed extensively with PBS and re-pelleted again (twice) by centrifugation and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for western blot analysis to determine the amount of alum-bound protein.To measure the amount of unbound GP, we coated Nunc 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with mAb114 (2 µg ml−1 in DPBS, 50 µl per well) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with Milli-Q water (300 µl) using a plate washer (ELx405, BioTek) and then blocked with ChonBlock (100 µl per well, Chondrex) overnight at 4 °C. For subsequent steps, all dilutions were made in DPBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, and ELISA plates were rinsed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, 300 µl, three times) in between steps. Antigens with proper dilutions were added to the plate and detected by the mouse anti-His tag antibody (1:4,000). Goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated (1:4,000), was then added for 1-h incubation before rinsing with PBST six times. ELISA plates were developed with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (1-Step Turbo-TMB, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 6 min and terminated with sulfuric acid (2 M). Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded on a microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek). GP with a series of known concentrations was used to establish a standard curve, and the amount of antigen was quantified by fitting the absorbance values to this curve.For western blot analysis, alum pellets were resuspended in sample loading buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min before being applied to a pre-cast polyacrylamide gel (4–20% Mini-PROTEAN, Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked in PBST with 10% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad), incubated with mAb114 (0.5 µg ml−1 in PBST with 10% non-fat dry milk) and then detected with rabbit anti-human IgG, HRP-conjugated (1:4,000 in PBST with 10% non-fat dry milk). Luminescent signals were developed using a luminol-based substrate (Pierce ECL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for imaging on a chemiluminescence imager (GE Amersham Imager 600).Immunogold stainingSimilar to the antigen–alum binding assay, GP, GP-12D, H2 HA or reoH2HA was incubated with alum (protein:alum, 1:10, w/w) in the presence of naive mouse serum (10%, v/v, final concentration) for 24 h. The mixture with alum alone and alum plus naive mouse serum served as controls. After incubation, alum was separated by centrifugation (10,000g for 5min), followed by extensive rinsing with DPBS. After repeating this step three times, alum pellets were resuspended in the blocking buffer (PBST with 1% BSA) for incubation overnight. The next day, antigen–alum complexes were stained with mAb114 or MEDI8852 (20 nM, diluted in PBST with 1% BSA) for GP or HA proteins, respectively, for 10 min. After rinsing three times with DPBS, samples were further stained with goat anti-human IgG, gold-conjugated (1:10 in PBST with 1% BSA), for 10 min, followed by rinsing with DPBS six times. Samples were then pipetted onto a carbon-coated copper grid (Ted Pella) and incubated for 5 min. Grids were rinsed with DPBS six times and dried overnight. Images were acquired on a Morgagni microscope (FEI) operating with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.Streptavidin-coated and alum-coated ELISATo investigate antigen orientation on alum, we measured mAb binding in streptavidin-coated or alum-coated ELISAs. For streptavidin-coated ELISAs, Nunc 96-well MaxiSorp plates were coated with streptavidin (4 µg ml−1 in DPBS, 60 µl per well) for 1 h at room temperature. These plates were washed three times with Milli-Q water and then blocked with ChonBlock (120 µl per well) overnight at 4 °C. For subsequent steps, all dilutions were made in DPBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, and ELISA plates were rinsed with PBST in between steps. Biotinylated H2 HA-12D or reoH2HA (2 µg ml−1) were added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. mAbs (8F8, 8M2, MEDI8852 and FI6v3) were serially diluted (10-fold dilution starting from 20 nM) and then added to the ELISA plates for 1-h incubation at room temperature. Rabbit anti-human IgG, HRP-conjugated (1:4,000), was added for 1-h incubation before rinsing with PBST six times.For alum-coated ELISA, Nunc 96-well MaxiSorp plates were coated with ZsGreen-Avi-His-12D (abbreviated as ZsGreen-12D, 4 µg ml−1 in DPBS, 60 µl per well) for 1 h at room temperature. These plates were washed three times with Milli-Q water and then blocked with ChonBlock overnight at 4 °C. For subsequent steps, all dilutions were made in DPBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA unless otherwise noted, and ELISA plates were rinsed with PBST in between steps. Alum (100 µg ml−1 in HBS) was added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing, H2 HA-12D or reoH2HA (2 µg ml−1) was added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. mAbs were serially diluted (10-fold dilution starting from 20 nM) and then added to the ELISA plates for 1-h incubation at room temperature. Rabbit anti-human IgG, HRP-conjugated (1:4,000), was added for 1-h incubation before rinsing with PBST six times.ELISA plates were developed with the TMB substrate for 5 min and terminated with sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded on a microplate reader.Mouse immunization studiesAll animals were maintained in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy for Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under a protocol approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC-33709). Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, maintained with 12-h light/dark cycles at 65–75 °F with 40–60% humidity and randomly grouped for the studies. Antigens were mixed with adjuvants before injections, with the total volume adjusted to 100 µl with HBS. Injection mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before use.To compare GP-12D with wild-type GP, we performed a single-dose immunization in two groups of BALB/c mice (n = 6) with 5 µg of protein antigens adjuvanted with 150 µg of alum via subcutaneous injection. To compare spike-12D with wild-type spike, we immunized two groups of BALB/c mice (n = 10) with 5 µg of protein antigens adjuvanted with 150 µg of alum via subcutaneous injection on days 0, 21 and 49. To compare H1 HA-12D with wild-type H1 HA, we immunized two groups of BALB/c mice (n = 10) with 5 µg of protein antigens adjuvanted with 150 µg of alum via subcutaneous injection on days 0 and 56. To examine the effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, we immunized two groups of BALB/c mice (n = 5) with 5 µg of H7 HA-12D adjuvanted with 150 µg of alum alone or 150 µg of alum and 1 µg of CpG (ODN 1826, InvivoGen) via subcutaneous injection on days 0 and 21. To compare reoH2HA with wild-type H2 HA, we immunized two groups of BALB/c mice (n = 10) with 5 µg of protein antigens adjuvanted with 150 µg of alum and 1 µg of CpG via subcutaneous injection on days 0, 21 and 70. We also repeated this immunization following the same regimen but with a higher dose of CpG (5 µg) coupled with alum (150 µg). Pre-immune, interim and final blood samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding into serum gel tubes (Sarstedt). Serum gel tubes were centrifuged at 10,000g for 6 min, and sera were collected and stored at −80 °C.Serum ELISAsWe used proteins with a different trimerization domain from the immunogens for ELISA binding analysis of antisera. Nunc 96-well MaxiSorp plates were coated with streptavidin for 1 h at room temperature. These plates were washed three times with Milli-Q water using a plate washer and then blocked with ChonBlock overnight at 4 °C. For subsequent steps, all dilutions were made in DPBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, and ELISA plates were rinsed with PBST in between steps. Biotinylated antigens (2 µg ml−1) were added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse antisera were serially diluted (five-fold dilution) and then added to the ELISA plates for 1-h incubation at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated (1:4,000), was added for 1-h incubation before rinsing with PBST six times. ELISA plates were developed with the TMB substrate for 6 min and terminated with sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded on a microplate reader.To test the cross-reactivity toward different HAs, streptavidin-coated ELISA plates were incubated with biotinylated HAs (2 µg ml−1) from the following strains: A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1 NC/99), A/California/07/2009 (H1 CA/09), A/Japan/305/1957 (H2 JP/57), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5 VT/04), A/Victoria/3/1975 (H3 VC/75), A/FPV/Dutch/1927 (H7 NT/27) and A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7 SH/13). To deplete serum antibodies that target C-terminal tags (for example, Avi-His tags), we added GP-GCN4-Avi-His protein (2 µg ml−1, final concentration) to the dilution buffer when testing cross-reactivity against different HAs.For competition ELISA assays, competing antibodies (for example, MEDI8852, 222-1C06 or FluA-20, 100 nM) were pre-incubated on the plate with antigens for 1 h before the addition of serially diluted mouse antisera.Pseudotyped lentiviruses and neutralization assaysEBOVs encoding a luciferase-ZsGreen reporter were produced in HEK293T cells by co-transfection of five plasmids50. This five-plasmid system includes a packaging vector (pHAGE-Luc2-IRES-ZsGreen), a plasmid encoding full-length Ebola GP (pCDNA3.1 EBOV FL-GP) and three helper plasmids (pHDM-Hgpm2, pHDM-Tat1b and pRC-CMV_Rev1b). One day before transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm TC-treated culture dishes (5 × 106 cells per culture dish, Corning). Transfection mixture was prepared by adding five plasmids (10 µg of packaging vector, 3.4 µg of GP-encoding plasmid and 2.2 µg of each helper plasmid) to 1 ml of D10 medium, followed by the dropwise addition of BioT transfection reagent (30 µl, Bioland Scientific) with vigorous mixing. After 10-min incubation at room temperature, the transfection mixture was transferred to HEK293T cells in the culture dish. Culture medium was replenished 24 h after transfection, and, after another 48 h, viruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane. Pseudotyped lentiviruses were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −80 °C and titrated before further use.SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses encoding a luciferase-ZsGreen reporter were produced using the same method but with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike (HDM-SARS2-spike-delta21, Addgene, 155130) or its variants of concern. Wild-type pseudovirus included a D614G mutation. B.1.351 (Beta) pseudovirus included D80A, D215G, Δ240-242, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G and A701V mutations. B.1.617.2 (Delta) pseudovirus included T19R, T95I, G142D, Δ156–157, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R and D950N mutations. B.1.617.2/AY1 (Delta plus) pseudovirus included V70F, A222V, W258L and K417N mutations in addition to the ones in B.1.617.2. B.1.529.1 (Omicron BA.1) pseudovirus included A67V, Δ69–70, T95I, G142D, Δ143–145, Δ211, L212I, G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K and L981F mutations. B.1.529.2 (Omicron BA.2) pseudovirus included T19I, Δ24–26, A27S, G142D, V213G, G339D, S371F, S373P, S375F, T376A, D405N, R408S, K417N, N440K, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, Q954H and N969K mutations.Neutralization assays against pseudoviruses with mAbsNeutralization of EBOV was validated with five Ebola GP-specific mAbs. HEK293T cells were seeded in white-walled, clear-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific or Greiner Bio-One) at a density of 20,000 cells per well 1 d before the assay (day 0). On day 1, GP-specific mAbs (2 µM in HBS with 10% glycerol) were filtered with 0.22-μm sterile membranes and diluted with D10 media to 20 nM as the starting concentration. Subsequently, mAbs were serially diluted (10-fold dilution) in D10 media and mixed with EBOV (diluted in D10 medium, supplemented with polybrene, 1:1,000, v/v) for 1 h before being transferred to HEK293T cells. On day 4, medium was removed, and 100 µl of luciferase substrates (Britelite plus, PerkinElmer) was added to each well. Luminescent signals were recorded on a microplate reader (BioTek SynergyHT or Tecan M200). Percent infection was normalized to cells only (0% infection) and virus only (100% infection) on each plate. Neutralization assays were performed in four technical replicates.Similarly, neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was validated with ACE2–Fc or three spike-specific mAbs. HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were seeded at a density of 6,000 cells per well 1 d before the assay (day 0). On day 1, ACE2–Fc or spike-specific mAbs (2 µM in HBS with 10% glycerol) were filtered and diluted to 20 nM as the starting concentration. Subsequently, ACE2–Fc or mAbs were serially diluted (10-fold dilution) in D10 media and mixed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses for 1 h before being transferred to HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells. On day 3, medium was removed, and luciferase substrates were added to each well. Luminescent signals were recorded on a microplate reader and converted to percent infection for subsequent analysis. Neutralization assays were performed in four technical replicates.Serum neutralization assays against pseudovirusesAntisera were heat inactivated (56 °C, 30–60 min) before neutralization assays. Neutralization against EBOV was analyzed in HEK293T cells with mouse antisera against Ebola GP. Neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was analyzed in HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells with mouse antisera against spike. In brief, cells were seeded in white-walled, clear-bottom, 96-well plates 1 d before the assay (day 0). On day 1, antisera were serially diluted in D10 media and mixed with pseudoviruses for 1 h before being transferred to cells. Assays against EBOV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were read out with luciferase substrates 3 d or 2 d after infection, respectively. Percent infection was normalized on each plate. NT50 were calculated as the serum dilution, where a 50% inhibition of infection was observed. Neutralization assays were performed in technical duplicates.Influenza A virus microneutralization assaysA/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1 A/NC/20/99) virus was a generous gift from Florian Krammer’s laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. A/California/07/2009 (H1N1 A/CA/7/09) virus was purchased from Microbiologics. Viral infectivity was titrated in MDCK.2 cells, and 100× 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was used for influenza A virus microneutralization assays51.We first validated the assay with HA-specific mAbs. MDCK.2 cells were seeded in white-walled, clear-bottom, 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well 1 d before the assay (day 0). On day 1, mAbs were filtered and serially diluted in infection assay media (IAM) (Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 0.3% BSA, 0.01% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, and 100 µg ml−1 calcium chloride). Viruses were diluted in IAM with trypsin (TPCK-treated, final concentration, 1 µg ml−1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mixed with antibody dilutions for 1 h at 37 °C before being transferred to MDCK.2 cells. After 1-h infection, we removed supernatant from all wells and rinsed cells with DPBS twice before transferring antibody dilutions for further incubation. After 48 h, we removed medium from all wells, rinsed cells with DPBS twice and fixed cells with paraformaldehyde (BioLegend). After fixation, we rinsed cells with DPBS twice and permeabilized cells with Triton X-100 (Cell Signaling Technology). For subsequent steps, detecting antibodies were diluted in DPBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, and plates were rinsed three times with PBST in between steps. Cells were stained with mouse anti-influenza A nucleoprotein antibody (1:4,000) for 1 h, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP conjugated (1:4,000, 1 h). Plates were rinsed with PBST six times and then developed with the TMB substrate for 6 min and terminated with sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded on a microplate reader. Percent infection was normalized to cells only (0% infection) and virus only (100% infection) on each plate. Neutralization assays were performed in technical duplicates.Antisera were first treated with receptor-destroying enzymes (Denka Seiken) at 37 °C for 20 h before adding sodium citrate to stop the treatment (2.5% w/v). Then, antisera were heat inactivated at 56 °C for 60 min and passed through centrifugal filters (Corning, 0.22 µm). Similar to mAbs, serially diluted antisera were incubated with viruses for 1 h before being transferred to MDCK.2 cells for 1-h incubation. Cells were rinsed twice and further incubated with serially diluted antisera for 48 h. For readout, cells were stained with rabbit anti-influenza A nucleoprotein antibody (1:4,000), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP conjugated (1:4,000).IgG was purified from pooled antisera raised against H2 HA or reoH2HA for influenza A virus microneutralization assays against H1N1 A/CA/7/09. Pooled antisera from each group were incubated with CaptureSelect IgG-Fc (multi-species) Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 24 h on a rotator. Resins were transferred to centrifugal filters (0.22 µm) and centrifuged at 1,000g for 2 min, followed by rinsing with DPBS three times and removal of the flow-through. Mouse IgG was eluted with glycine buffer (100 mM, pH 2.8) into HEPES buffer (1 M, pH 7.4), buffer exchanged to HBS and concentrated to 2 mg ml−1 for influenza A virus microneutralization assays.nsEMPEMPolyclonal IgG was purified from pooled mouse antisera using a Protein G column (Cytiva) before ficin digestion for 4 h at 37 °C (Pierce Mouse IgG1 Fab Preparation Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Free Fab was separated from Fc using a Protein A spin column (Cytiva). Subsequently, HA trimers (5–10 µg) were complexed with polyclonal Fab at a 1:50 ratio (w/w) overnight at room temperature before purification with size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 column (Increase 10/300 GL, Cytiva) against Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 ml of NaCl). Fractions containing HA:Fab immune complexes were pooled and deposited for 30 s at approximately 10–15 µg ml−1 on freshly glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences). Grids were then washed three times with Milli-Q water or TBS, followed by staining with uranyl formate (2%, w/v). Images were acquired at ×17,500 magnification (2.35 Å per pixel) on a Glacios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 200 kV, equipped with a Gatan K3 camera. Electron micrographs were collected in a semi-automated fashion using SerialEM before processing in RELION52 and cryoSPARC53 as previously described38,54.Composite figures were created by docking 20-Å low-pass-filtered Fab volumes into 3D density corresponding to bound Fab for each complex, whereas HA is represented as a 20-Å low-pass-filtered volume. Where evidence for a Fab was only present in 2D class averages, the presumed position (based on similar 2D class averages from known HA:Fab complexes) in composite figures was marked by dotted lines around the Fab. UCSF ChimeraX was used to calculate predicted Fab footprints and generate composite figures55.Flow cytometry analysis of GC responsesTo study the GC responses, we immunized BALB/c mice (n = 10 mice per group) with 5 µg of protein antigens (GP or GP-12D) adjuvanted with 150 µg of alum via subcutaneous injection on days 0, 7 and 14 (two groups per timepoint). On day 21, all six groups of mice and another group of naive mice were euthanized for tissue collection. Draining lymph nodes were collected and triturated through a 70-μm cell strainer to make single-cell suspensions. Cells were then stained for viability with Ghost Dye Violet 510 for 5 min on ice in PBS with EDTA (2 mM). After rinsing, cells were blocked with Fc receptor antibody (anti-CD16/32) for 5 min on ice before staining with fluorescently conjugated antibodies in FACS staining buffer (PBS, 3% FBS, 1 mM EDTA): CD3 (1:50), CD4 (1:200), CXCR5 (1:50), PD1 (1:200), CD19 (1:200), CD95 (1:200) and CD38 (1:200). Surface staining was carried out for 30 min on ice and 15 min at 37 °C, followed by fixation for 10 min at room temperature. Data were acquired on a BD LSR II flow cytometer using BD FACSDiva software (version 8.0.1) and analyzed with FlowJo software (version 10.4.0).Statistics and reproducibilityWestern blot analysis, immunogold labeling and serological analyses were repeated at least twice with similar results, and one set of representative data is presented. Statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 9.3.1). Non-transformed data are presented as mean ± s.d. ELISA titers and NT50 were log10 transformed and presented as geometric mean ± s.d. Comparisons of two groups were performed using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test. Comparisons of more than two groups were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni test. Comparisons of IgG titers or NT50 over time were performed using two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni test. P values of 0.05 or less are considered significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

However, this method presents challenges such as "egg adaptation," leading to genetic changes in the vaccine material during the growth process. In contrast, cell-based technology utilizes mammalian cells as the substrate for virus growth, eliminating egg adaptation issues. The resulting virus closely aligns with the targeted wild type, providing a more accurate match for vaccine production.Cell-based manufacturing offers advantages over egg-based methods. It is faster, more scalable, and avoids the limitations associated with egg use, providing a higher yield. The alignment between the vaccine and the targeted wild type is crucial for optimal antibody production, especially in pediatric immunizations. Mammalian cell-based manufacturing aims to enhance the response to influenza exposure, ultimately improving vaccine effectiveness by approximately 10% compared to egg-based production.The World Health Organization identifies strains for influenza vaccine production, aligning with the Southern Hemisphere for Northern Hemisphere distribution. The closer the alignment between the vaccine and the targeted wild type, the better the antibody production, potentially preventing or minimizing disease. The transition to cell-based manufacturing addresses issues with egg adaptation, providing a more efficient and effective process. This shift not only improves vaccine alignment but also contributes to enhanced scalability and speed in production, demonstrating promising benefits in influenza prevention, particularly in pediatric populations.Video synopsis is AI-generated and reviewed by Contemporary Pediatrics editorial staff.Recent VideosRelated Content MenACWY program associated with reduced invasive meningococcal disease among adolescentsJoshua Fitch, Senior Editor November 7th 2024ArticleThe study outcomes were estimated IMD cases and deaths averted by MenACWY vaccination in adolescents and adults aged 11 to 23 years.

These were his first symptomsQuenten Thomas' father is urging people to take the flu seriously: "If you love your family, don’t risk it."Jan. 16, 2024, 6:38 PM UTC / Updated Jan. 17, 2024, 2:05 PM UTC / Source: TODAYBy Sarah JacobyQuenten Thomas, 27, a father of three young kids in Maryville, Tennessee, died last week due to complications of the flu.He was coughing and having trouble breathing, his father, Robert Thomas, told NBC News."It hurt really bad when he coughed, and he was having trouble catching (his) breath," Robert Thomas recalled. He'd been using a finger monitor to keep track of his blood oxygen levels. "He noticed his oxygen was dropping, so he went to the hospital asking for oxygen first," Robert Thomas said. Quenten Thomas, 27, died of flu complications on Jan. 6, 2024. He went to the hospital prior to his death but was sent home.Courtesy Kensie ThomasAt first, the hospital sent Quenten Thomas, who had not received a flu shot this season, home to recover with water, food and sleep, his father said. But his oxygen levels remained low and he was still in pain, so he went back.This time, doctors took his symptoms more seriously, but his condition quickly became more severe."They put them on a ventilator and eventually in a coma," Robert Thomas said. He died on Jan. 6, 2024, leaving behind an 7-year-old daughter, as well as an 11-month-old girl and a 1-month-old boy. "It's unbelievable," Robert Thomas said, adding that his son was a "healthy, hard-working young man," and "there was no quit in him."2024 flu symptomsAcross the country, flu activity remains high, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this flu season, about 9,400 people have died, and there have been 150,000 hospitalizations and 14 million illnesses. In the first week of January, the CDC counted 13 flu-related deaths in children, bringing the total to 40 pediatric deaths so far this season. The data as of Jan. 12, 2024, (the most recent available) indicated that flu activity may be decreasing, but it's possible that it will spike again, a CDC spokesperson told NBC News.This flu season, some doctors have seen more severe flu symptoms than usual in young people, sometimes even if they got their flu shot, NBC News reported. Dr. Dhaval Desai, director of Hospital Medicine at Emory Saint Joseph’s Hospital in Atlanta, told NBC News that he's recently treated people of a range of ages with severe flu symptoms. Desai himself struggled with a severe bout of influenza and ended up in the emergency room in November despite being vaccinated.Common flu symptoms include:FeverCoughSore throatHeadacheRunny noseFatigueMuscle acheMost people who get the flu will recover within a week, but some are at a higher risk for serious complications from the disease, particularly those with underlying conditions like asthma, heart disease and diabetes, as well as older adults. Rarely, the flu can be severe — and even deadly — for young, otherwise healthy people.Desai and Dr. Rachael Lee, an associate professor in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama, told NBC News that some of the more severe flu symptoms that they've seen this season include:DehydrationWheezingSevere head and muscle achesHigh fevers, sometimes staying above 104FatigueWith the flu continuing to spread alongside other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, experts are urging people to take precautions, especially getting vaccinated and wearing a mask.Robert Thomas is also urging people to take the flu more seriously. And he has a message for those who think they don't need a flu vaccine: Don't risk it."You might not need the flu shot. You might do just fine without it," he said. "(But) you might spread the flu to your son, who's younger than you are, who might die of it.“If you love your family, don’t risk it. Why risk somebody you love you so much?"CORRECTION (Jan. 18, 2024, 3:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the name of the Thomas family's town. It is Maryville, Tennessee, not Marysville. A previous version of the story also misstated the ages of Quenten Thomas' children. The ages have since been corrected.Stephanie Gosk, Erika Edwards and Patrick Smith contributed.RelatedGetty Images/iStockphotoThese are the best cold remedies according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Nov. 8, 2024Mindful Media / Getty ImagesHow to make yourself sneeze, according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Oct. 15, 2024Getty ImagesAre your fall allergy symptoms worse this year?

The kelp gull is widespread in the sub-Antarctic islands and is one of the species affected by the avian influenza virus. Images: British Antarctic Survey / Camille Lin First announced last spring of the southern hemisphere, highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI is now affecting five of the 14 species tested in South Georgia. A few suspected cases near the Antarctic Peninsula suggest that the disease is still spreading. Following the confirmed cases of avian influenza in the Falkland Islands, suspected cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), with apparent symptoms in animals in South Georgia have now been confirmed. According to the latest press release from the British Antarctic Survey on January 11, five of the 14 species tested were carriers of HPAI H5N1. Elephant seals and fur seals are particularly affected. Among birds, antarctic skuas, kelp gulls and antarctic terns are affected. There are suspicions that giant petrels and snowy sheathbills have been too. However, there are still uncertainities for albatrosses and penguins. These results come from the first samples taken following the first signs of the epidemic in the austral spring. At the time, the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency sent a scientist to the area, inspecting colonies with the help of a Navy mission and a coastal patrol. HMS Forth (P222), a British coastal surveillance vessel in the South Atlantic, pictured here in March 2020. Image : Camille Lin Today, the spread of the virus can be observed only to a limited extent. Scavenging birds are very active and traces disappear rapidly. Some sites have been closed to scientists and tourists. “It’s difficult now to access all the different places and fjords on the island. Since some have been closed to visitors, we no longer have regular information about them,” explains Mark Belchier, Director of Fisheries and Environment for the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands GSGSSI. Still, two sites are regularly monitored. Bird Island, in the north-east of the archipelago, where a base is established since 1963, and King Edward Point next to the administrative centre at Grytviken. “Although some sites appear to have been particularly affected, the level of mortality of species monitored such as fur seals, brown skuas and giant petrels has not exceeded the level of a bad year,” he adds. “It would appear that the virus is particularly threatening for fragile species such as wandering albatrosses, grey-headed albatrosses and black-browed albatrosses.” Trois espèces d’albatros citées parmi les espèces sensibles de la Géorgie du Sud. Images : Camille Lin/Julia Hager/Richard Phillips/BAS A mission is currently underway to confirm (or deny) that the virus does not affect albatrosses. Jennifer Black, head of the Department for the Environment at the GSGSSI, is currently crossing the Atlantic to the archipelago. “This will give us the opportunity to access the most remote areas to potentially detect the virus in other species and better understand the general impact on animals”, adds Mark Belchier. As previously reported by us, elephant seals are also affected. “There has always been mortality during reproduction, but this time it affects all the life stages,” explains the director. “The fur seals bredding season is in full swing now, and we saw high mortality among juveniles too.” Virologists assure that there are no new mutations that would increase the (low) risk of transmission to humans. The biggest concern remains animals. Images : Camille Lin In Antarctica, suspicious cases have been detected in Antarctic jaegers on the South Orkney Islands, near the Orcadas station belonging to Argentina. The same applies to Heroína Island, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. “To be honest, I’m surprised there haven’t been more reports from the Antarctic Peninsula,” he adds. Le niveau d’alarme concernant la grippe aviaire en Amérique du Sud juste avant cet été austral était haut. “L’immunité contre ce virus est encore en cours de découverte”, nous explique Michelle Wille, chercheuse de l’Université de Melbourne, spécialiste du HPAI. Le principal espoir pour les animaux de l’Antarctique reste cependant l’immunité collective, afin qu’ils soient moins touchés lors d’un prochain épisode.

Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe 16 January 2024 Statement Reading time: Good morning, good afternoon. I’d like to wish all of you a very Happy New Year from everyone here at the WHO Regional Office for Europe. We certainly hope for a healthy and more peaceful 2024. And on that note, I’d like to begin with some positive news. A new study led by WHO/Europe has found that at least 1.4 million lives in our region were saved thanks to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Without them, the European Region’s cumulative known death toll could have been around 4 million, possibly even higher. Our analysis of 34 countries also found that more than 90% of lives saved were people over the age of 60. Overall, COVID-19 vaccines reduced death by 57% across the WHO European Region, between December 2020, when the vaccine rollouts began, and March 2023. In fact, the first booster doses alone saved an estimated 700 000 lives. Just think about it: today, there are 1.4 million people in our region – most of them elderly – who are around to enjoy life with their loved ones because they took the vital decision to be vaccinated against COVID-19. This is the power of vaccines. The evidence is irrefutable. WHO’s recommendation is for persons at highest risk from COVID-19 to continue to be re-vaccinated 6 to 12 months after their most recent dose. This includes the elderly, pregnant women, the immunocompromised and those with significant chronic medical conditions, and frontline health workers. Besides COVID-19, the European Region is seeing widespread circulation of respiratory viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles.When looking overall at the Region, we can see that RSV rates peaked before the new year and are now declining, COVID-19 rates remain elevated but are decreasing, and influenza rates are now rapidly increasing. And while this isn’t necessarily out of the ordinary, we would like to draw your attention to a few trends. As we speak, we are seeing a high intensity of influenza infections in several countries across the Region. Health systems should be ready to see a likely surge in influenza cases over the coming weeks. Across the Region, the past 2 weeks have seen a 58% increase in reported hospitalizations for influenza, and a 21% increase in intensive care admissions, compared to the previous 2 weeks. Influenza cases increased 4-fold between November and December, with 38 countries in our region reporting the start of the seasonal influenza epidemic.As expected, the groups most affected by severe disease are the over 65s and the very young.We are concerned about reports of localized pressures on hospitals and overcrowding in emergency rooms, due to a confluence of circulating respiratory viruses. In addition to COVID-19 and influenza circulation, RSV and other pathogens such as mycoplasma and measles have caused increased hospitalizations among children. Also, while COVID-19 infection rates are broadly decreasing across our region, this can rapidly change. A new SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest – known as JN.1 – is fast replacing other known variants. It’s now the most common variant being reported globally and is the dominant variant circulating in our region, accounting for 79% of sequenced variants. Though there’s no current evidence to suggest the JN.1 variant is more severe, the unpredictable nature of this virus shows how vital it is that countries continue to monitor for any new variants. Many countries have reduced or stopped reporting on COVID-19 to WHO. I cannot stress enough how important continued COVID-19 surveillance is, alongside other circulating respiratory viruses. Thirteen countries in our region did not report any data on respiratory viruses last week. Surveillance remains our first line of defence to monitor unpredictable respiratory pathogens, be it mutations or new viruses.COVID-19 is here to stay.The pandemic years taught us a great deal, not least that protecting yourself and others from respiratory infections is a newly accepted way of living. We know how to keep ourselves and others safe, whether from COVID-19 or other respiratory infections. No one knows your risk like you yourself do.What we need to do now is apply that knowledge when and where it matters. This means assessing our own level of risk and our risk to others at every step of our days, and then applying the protective measures that matter most to reduce the chances of catching or spreading respiratory infections.Measures range from staying at home if sick, hand and cough hygiene, and adequate indoor ventilation; to mask-wearing in certain settings – such as hospitals or crowded places. In this context, we all need to use our own judgement when taking steps to protect ourselves, and others around us, based on an individual assessment of risk.Importantly, as we learn to live with COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, it’s absolutely vital for vulnerable populations to stay up to date with their COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations as recommended. As we put a difficult 2023 behind us and look forward to 2024, I am deeply concerned that health is slipping from the political agenda and that we are failing to address the ticking time bomb facing our health and care workforce. As health systems come under strain, we are reminded that we may be unprepared for anything out of the ordinary, such as the emergence of a new, more severe COVID-19 variant or a yet unknown pathogen. In closing, I encourage everyone to show gratitude, patience and solidarity with the dedicated health workers who are doing their utmost best under difficult circumstances. I ask policy-makers and health-care leaders to show demonstrable support for the health workforce; not with words but with action. Thank you.

And with it, illnesses will continue to be more severe and overlap with one another when the following viruses hit higher numbers during cold weather months:AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyInfluenza (the flu).Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).COVID-19 (coronavirus).COVID-19, in particular, is the latest of these to peak seasonally, and it continues to be dangerous. Together, these respiratory viruses make up an infectious disease combination — one healthcare providers refer to as “flurona.”Microbiologist and pathologist Daniel Rhoads, MD, explains why, even now, the threat of multiple infections should be a concern for everyone, especially the most vulnerable populations. He also offers some helpful advice for managing flurona if it happens to you.What is flurona?Flurona isn’t a proper medical diagnosis, but it has become an increasingly popular term for what happens when you get infected by both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. That said, the term flurona, though catchy, is kind of misleading. The experience of getting more than one infection at the same time is not isolated to just COVID-19 and the flu. You can get co-infections of multiple respiratory viruses at the same time — meaning you can get infected with any combination of COVID-19, the flu, RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus and other viruses.“Even before COVID-19 emerged, people would get multiple viruses that cause common colds or common coronaviruses,” explains Dr. Rhoads. “People can get more than one or, sometimes, more than two of these viruses at the same time.”AdvertisementPart of the reason co-infections are even possible is because viruses are always changing in an effort to break through our body’s defenses and cause ongoing infection.Influenza, for example, rears its ugly head every flu season. As new variants of the virus become ever more potent and infectious, the medical community has to meet those demands by creating an annual flu vaccine that targets current strains of influenza.Still, from 2010 to 2020, the flu hospitalized between 140,000 and 710,000 people in the United States each year, according to estimates by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Annual deaths tied to the flu ranged from 12,000 to 52,000 in the U.S. over the same period.Fast forward, and we’re now experiencing even earlier increases in the flu among kids under the age of 18. At the same time, we’re seeing higher surges of RSV in both kids and adults. These surges have led to a new RSV vaccine for older adults and an RSV immunization for babies to provide further protection.And while there may be differences between these viruses and COVID-19, co-infection is not only possible, but also particularly common in children and people who are immunocompromised.“COVID-19 first emerged in the middle of flu season. All of these were circulating for a short period and then COVID-19 kind of crowded out influenza and RSV,” says Dr. Rhoads. “Now that they’re all circulating at the same time, there will be some overlap and co-infections between viruses.”What you can doAs we’ve seen in previous years, healthcare providers are confident that winter surges in COVID-19 cases will continue to happen. Because of this, a new annual COVID-19 vaccine is now seasonally available to target the most current variant of the virus making its rounds.All together, you can decrease your chances of getting more than one infection at the same time if you continue to protect yourself from these viruses with currently available vaccines, and if you take proper precautions when sick or when coming into contact with others who’ve had an illness.“Preventing disease is ideal, and one of the best tools that we as individuals and as a population have to prevent severe disease due to flu or COVID-19 is the memory of our immune system,” stresses Dr. Rhoads.“Vaccines help to teach our immune system the specific shape of these viruses, so that our antibodies and immune cells can quickly recognize these viruses if we are unfortunate enough to encounter them in the future.”AdvertisementWhat does flurona feel like?It’s hard to tell on your own which set of viruses you have without a clinical diagnosis from a healthcare provider. Most respiratory viruses have similar symptoms, including:Fever or chills.Cough.Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.Fatigue.Muscle or body aches.Headaches.Sore throat.Congestion or runny nose.Nausea or vomiting.Diarrhea.How is flurona treated?In the case of co-infections, it’s possible for some of these symptoms to be more severe. For example, you could experience a higher fever or prolonged fatigue. But knowing exactly how co-infections will affect you is difficult because everybody reacts to multiple viruses in different ways.For severe infections, Dr. Rhoads says there are oral therapies available to help treat both COVID-19 and the flu. These therapies fall along the lines of oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) and antiviral pills.Milder symptoms can be managed at home with over-the-counter medications and fever reducers. And should you find yourself with this combo of respiratory illness, you should seek treatment and stay home until you’re no longer contagious.In many cases, healthcare providers suggest treating any respiratory illness as if it’s COVID-19 because you just never know what you have until you’re tested. So, if you experience any of these symptoms, again, you should stay home until you’re no longer contagious and/or seek medical treatment as you would if you thought you had COVID-19.Advertisement“If you’re at risk for getting respiratory viruses, there’s a chance that you’ll get more than one,” warns Dr. Rhoads. “Also, respiratory viruses are passed from person to person.

In this image, a flu vaccine is readied in Lynwood, California.AP File Photo/Mark J. TerrillBy Julie Washington, cleveland.comCLEVELAND, Ohio — During the holidays, we gather to be merry and sneeze on each other. The result? A lump of coal in the form of increased circulation of COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.But now that we’re heading toward mid-January, it’s far from behind us. We won’t stop running fevers, sniffling and coughing for some time. It is still several weeks before these viruses are expected to hit a peak and fade, local health experts said.“We have three viruses that are very active right now, and in large part are on the rise,” said Dr. Christine Alexander, chair of family medicine at MetroHealth System. “There are subtle differences between them, but each of them can cause severe infection leading to hospitalization and in some cases, death. So it’s really important that we stay on top of this.”Flu activity across Ohio — driven by the H1N1 strain formerly called swine flu — is rated “very high,” according to the most recent state data.Ohio’s fall and early winter COVID-19 surge is still ongoing, fueled by the new, globally dominant JN.1 variant, which is better at evading the vaccine.And this season, RSV is hitting older people in Ohio harder than infants, health experts said. Locally, RSV in infants peaked in mid-December, and is expected to start heading down in the next few weeks, said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, director of infection control at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital.RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, causes respiratory tract infections and spreads through coughs, sneezes and germs on surfaces. In children under age 2, severe RSV can lead to pneumonia and hospitalization.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an “urgent” alert stating that low vaccination rates for these viruses, combined with increases in winter virus activity, “could lead to more severe disease and increased healthcare capacity strain in the coming weeks.”As many as 52,000 flu-related deaths take place annually, the CDC said. There have been more than 1.1 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States since the start of the pandemic.And RSV is annually responsible for as many as 10,000 deaths among adults 65 years and older, and as many as 300 deaths in children younger than 5 years old in the United States, according to CDC statistics.Here’s a closer look at COVID-19, influenza and RSV in Ohio and closer to home.Flu-related illnesses in Northeast OhioWhile the state’s current influenza activity level is very high, flu activity in Cuyahoga County remained low throughout December.The number of flu-related illness and hospitalizations in Northeast Ohio also are lower than those seen last year, said Dr. Usha Stiefel, chief of the infectious diseases section of the VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare System.“We are actually seeing less than a third the number of influenza cases thus far this year than we had seen by this time last year,” Stiefel said.It’s impossible to say whether Northeast Ohio is seeing less flu because more people are getting the flu shot; health officials don’t track the number of flu vaccines that are given.Flu activity may peak in Northeast Ohio in late January or February, Alexander said.The main flu strain circulating this season is H1N1, which can be “pretty potent,” Alexander said. H1N1, formerly called the swine flu, can cause serious illness in people who have compromised immune system, are older or haven’t received a flu shot.This season’s influenza vaccine — recommended for everyone 6 months and over — is a good match against the strains in circulation, Alexander said.It’s not too late to get vaccinated against the flu. During the 2022-2023 influenza season, the flu shot prevented 6 million flu-related illnesses, 65,000 hospitalizations and 3,700 deaths, the CDC estimates.Influenza vaccinations are available at many drugstores, retail stores, the Cuyahoga County Board of Health and doctors’ offices. Most health insurances cover the cost.To find a flu shot near you, use this vaccine finder, or call the Cuyahoga County Board of Health at 216-201-2041 to make an appointment to get the flu shot.The Cleveland Department of Public Health has two health centers that provide flu shots, with walk-ins welcome.Previously: Ohio reports first pediatric death of current flu seasonFlu by the numbers in Greater Cleveland countiesMost Greater Cleveland counties have seen just one or two flu-related deaths this season.The exceptions are Lake County with seven flu-related deaths, and Geauga County with four flu-related deaths, according to the most recent data. Summit County has three flu-related deaths.Cuyahoga County has recorded one flu-related death, as have Lorain, and Medina counties. Portage County has seen two influenza-related deaths. There have been no flu deaths reported in Ashtabula County this season.Geauga County is seeing more flu-related deaths this season than its five-year average, said Joseph Rombough, epidemiologist for Lake County General Health District and backup epidemiologist for Geauga Public Health Department. Geauga County’s five-year average for flu-related deaths is two deaths at this same point in the flu season, Rombough said.However, Lake County’s seven flu-related deaths are lower than the county’s five-year average of 13.2 deaths at this same point in the flu season, Rombough said.Flu-related hospitalizations tell a different story.Among Northern Ohio counties, Cuyahoga County has the highest number of flu-related hospitalizations this season at 248, followed by Summit County (74) and Lorain County (50). Ashtabula County (5) has the lowest number of flu-related hospitalizations this season.The latest map from the Ohio Department of Health shows COVID-19 vaccination rates by county. Counties that are shaded darker have higher rates for receiving the latest updated shot.Ohio Department of HealthLatest COVID-19 trendWe were in the midst of a COVID-19 wintertime surge, as evidenced by the rise in Ohio’s weekly COVID-19 case numbers from late October to the end of December. The state’s case numbers remained well over the 10,000 benchmark since late November, even after dropping two of the last three weeks.“There is often an autumn surge, then a decrease and then a rise again during the holiday season,” the VA’s Stiefel said. Based on what she’s seen at the VA hospital in the past, she expects the surge to wane in mid- to late-January.Around Thanksgiving, the JN.1 COVID-19 became the dominant circulating variant. This could contribute to a rise in cases because the updated vaccine targets an older variant.“There is still good protection with the vaccines, but maybe not quite as much as there would have been had (an older variant)” been dominant, Stiefel said. “So this could be a contributor to increased cases as well.”Another factor contributing to the current surge could be the low number of American adults who have received the updated one-shot COVID-19 vaccine, Stiefel said. In Ohio, only about 10% of the population has received an updated COVID-19 vaccine.Only about 30% of Americans have received the new COVID-19 one-shot vaccination, but nearly 50% have gotten the flu shot, according to the latest Gallup national survey.About 10.3% of Ohioans have received the one-shot vaccination, according to the latest state data.Many people think the pandemic is over, and precautions like getting a vaccine aren’t necessary. In reality, people need to think about the COVID-19 shot in the same way they think of the flu shot, Alexander said. For both illnesses, vaccines prevent severe complications.People who don’t have immunity from a recent COVID-19 infection, or from the updated vaccine, may have been more vulnerable to COVID-19, adding to the surge in cases, Stiefel said.However, this winter’s COVID-19 surge is milder than past surges.There were 1,450 weekly COVID-19 deaths in the United States in mid-December this year, compared to 3,187 weekly deaths at the same time in 2022, and 10,250 weekly deaths in 2021, according to the CDC.Cuyahoga County has been among the leading counties in Ohio for people getting the latest COVID-19 vaccine, yet only 14.7% of the county’s populations had received the shot by early January, according to state data.Elsewhere in Greater Cleveland, the percentages are lower: Geauga (14.3%), Lorain (13.1%), Medina and Summit (12.8%) Lake (12.6%), Portage (11%) and Ashtabula (9.3%) counties.RSV affecting more elderly than infantsLast year saw local pediatric intensive care units filled with babies with RSV, but now older people are being hit hard by RSV both in Ohio and nationally, MetroHealth’s Alexander said.“It really is in older adults that that we’re seeing this spike,” Alexander said.In Ohio, RSV in infants and adults has climbed sharply since fall, according to the CDC. The state does not keep its own data on RSV.Last year, pediatricians were seeing older children getting RSV, because they had been masked at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and weren’t exposed to the virus as infants, UH’s Hoyen said. This year, the RSV season is back to normal, with among children mostly infants being hospitalized with the illness.“We are having a moderately busy year (for pediatric RSV),” Hoyen said. “We are still seeing kids getting admitted and ending up in the ICU. Fortunately, it’s nothing like last year.”Locally, RSV peaked in mid-December, and is expected to start heading down in the next few weeks, Hoyen said.New RSV vaccines for newborns and adults 60 and over were introduced last fall.Not as many babies received the protection as health experts had hoped, because of manufacturing shortfalls.“So this year, we’re still seeing those very little babies who, had had they been able to get the shot, probably wouldn’t have gotten admitted (to the hospital),” Hoyen said. “Going into next year, we’re hopefully going to have a better supply (of vaccine).”Julie Washington covers healthcare for cleveland.com.

As of Wednesday, 31 people, including one child, have died of flu this season in Washington, and Influenza-like illness activity remains high. Individuals who become sick should remain home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical treatment. Medical treat- ment is not necessary in most instances, but it may be required for people in higher risk categories. According to the PHSS, higher-risk groups include young children, people 65 and older, pregnant people and people with certain medical conditions.

Like with influenza (the flu), the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 continues to evolve every year as it tries its best to infect as many hosts as possible and survive our immune systems’ defenses. In fact, the spike protein itself, which allows the virus to attach to our human cells, has undergone more than 111,200 mutations alone since 2019.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyPathologists Hannah Wang, MD, and Daniel Rhoads, MD, explain what this means for the future of COVID-19 vaccination and why we should be just as concerned about up-and-coming COVID-19 variants as we’ve been in the past.Why are there so many COVID-19 variants?One of the most recent COVID-19 variants is the XEC variant. This variant is a recombinant variant, meaning it’s a combination of two older variants within the JN.1 parent lineage. The JN.1 variants were dominant in the U.S. during the winter and early spring of 2024. These belong to the omicron family of COVID-19 variants that now make up nearly all cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.And the buck won’t stop there. Even the JN.1 variants have evolved into different subvariants, informally called FLiRT and FLuQE, that have their own unique set of mutations on top of all the other mutations of every variant that came before them.“If you look back to the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, we were seeing variants that were very different from one another. You can think of them as different families of variants showing up,” says Dr. Wang. “Now, since late 2022 and early 2023, omicron has become the overarching variant family. Over the past few years, we've seen more new variants come up, but they're all within this one family.”AdvertisementThat means the latest COVID-19 variants are more closely related to one another with only slight differences in their genetic code.“Let’s use cars as an analogy. SARS-CoV-2 is like the car maker, and the variant is like the model of a car,” illustrates Dr. Rhoads. “Every few years, the manufacturer redesigns the model. The new one looks substantially different than last year’s model, and although it definitely is substantially different, it is still pretty similar. omicron is like that new redesigned model, and SARS-CoV-2 keeps coming out with new trim packages for omicron.”Still, even one small change can affect the way a virus looks, functions and infects its hosts.Take for example KP.2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed their fall 2024 vaccine to target KP.2 and its specific mutations because it was gearing up to be the most infectious, dominant variant at the time.“It’s going to be a little less recognizable by our immune system. That's why KP.2 sort of took off earlier this year, and it's also why the public health authorities in the U.S. have directed vaccine manufacturers to target one of the subvariants within the FLiRT variant — KP.2 — for vaccine manufacturing,” says Dr. Wang.Does the vaccine protect against current COVID-19 variants?Even though it wasn’t long before KP.3.1.1 emerged as the most dominant COVID-19 variant after the KP.2 vaccines were produced, the COVID-19 vaccine still offers protection.“It’s slightly different from the KP.2 that the vaccines are targeting but they’re still in the same family,” says Dr. Wang, “So, we expect the COVID-19 vaccine will still provide a good amount of protection until a new one comes out next year to target new COVID-19 variants.”While it’s possible to get reinfected, the number of cases that result in serious illnesses, hospitalizations or death is relatively low because vaccines are working to suppress the strength and spread of COVID-19. There are also new treatments for COVID-19, making the recovery process even more manageable.“Staying away from others who are sick, staying away from others when you are sick and staying up to date on vaccines are the best tools we have for preventing respiratory virus infections like COVID, influenza and RSV,” states Dr. Rhoads.How many COVID-19 variants are there?Although the original virus is no longer circulating, dozens of variants and subvariants continue to circulate around the world.In the U.S. alone, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) continues to monitor dozens of variants currently circulating in the U.S., including up-and-coming variants of interest. Some of the most prominent COVID-19 variants that have been tracked as part of this process include delta, omicron and a variety of once-dominant subvariants including:AdvertisementHV.1.EG.5.FL.1.5.1.XBB.1.5.BA.2."SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated continual evolution since its emergence in humans. This evolution results in new variants that emerge and replace existing variants over time,” says Dr. Rhoads. “Since the emergence of omicron in 2021, these variants have shared similar disease symptoms and severity over time.”Do COVID-19 variants share the same symptoms?You can think of current and emerging COVID-19 variants like brothers, children, grandchildren or first-cousins all within the omicron family. They’re so closely related that they share a lot of the same features while also having very unique mutations that set them apart from all other COVID-19 variants. That means your symptoms will likely remain the same regardless of which COVID-19 variant you come in contact with.“The symptoms are generally the same or similar, but the caveat is that the symptoms can look different in any one individual,” says Dr. Rhoads.That means COVID-19 affects everyone differently. You can be asymptomatic or have any number of symptoms that include:Sore throat.Body aches.Cough.Runny nose and congestion.Fever or chills.Shortness of breath.What can you do to minimize infection from new COVID-19 variants?You want to follow the same guidelines for new COVID-19 variants that you’ve followed for every other variant and subvariant of the coronavirus.AdvertisementThe best preventive measures include:Getting vaccinated.Wearing a mask when you’re sick and during respiratory season.Staying home when sick.Avoiding contact with people who are sick.Washing hands often.Trying not to touch your face.“Although COVID-19 may feel like old news, it’s still one of the most important and common causes of respiratory illness in our local and global communities today,” says Dr. Wang. “Scientists, healthcare providers and public health officials are still hard at work studying and battling COVID-19 as it continues to evolve. Help them by taking care of yourselves and your loved ones.”AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryCoronavirus, COVID-19OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionHealth LibraryCoronavirus, COVID-19OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionAdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 11, 2024/Infectious DiseaseFLiRT COVID Variants: What To KnowThe latest omicron subvariants carry specific mutations that may allow the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be better at evading immune protectionNovember 7, 2024/Infectious DiseaseCan COVID-19 Cause Erectile Dysfunction?Research shows the virus can affect your ability to get or maintain an erectionOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 10, 2024/Infectious DiseaseHow Contagious Is RSV?Respiratory syncytial virus spreads easily through respiratory droplets spewed out by those who are infectedOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

Some information may no longer be current.ShareBookmarkPlease log in to bookmark this story.Log InCreate Free Account This is an excerpt from A Nation’s Paper: The Globe and Mail in the Life of Canada, a collection of history essays from Globe writers past and present, coming this fall from Signal/McClelland & Stewart. On the morning of Oct. 25, 1918, The Globe ran a letter on its front page from the widow of an army chaplain who died of Spanish influenza.“Canada can well be ashamed,” the headline read, quoting what the widow said were some of the last words of her husband, Captain Roy Kain. He perished at a military base hospital in Toronto, crammed in a room with five other dying men and, according to his wife, ignored by doctors struggling to care for more than 800 soldiers in a building fit for 300, at most.“I shall never forget the horror of that room,” Lillian Kain wrote. “Can any front-line trench be worse than to be placed in a room with the most advanced cases, to hear the cries of the dying, to realize your own time is coming as surely as the sun will rise, to feel that you are suffering and dying from the neglect and carelessness of others?”The letter is one of the few front-page items that The Globe – the newspaper that would later absorb a competitor and become The Globe and Mail – ran about the catastrophic wave of influenza that swept across Canada and the world in the autumn of 1918.There should have been far more of them. Despite killing an estimated 50,000 Canadians over two years at a time when the country’s population was just over eight million, the Spanish influenza was often relegated to The Globe’s inside pages.Open this photo in gallery:A Globe article on Oct. 3, 1918, confirms the arrival of Spanish influenza in Toronto.To be fair, it’s not as though The Globe ignored the flu’s toll on civilians. It carried 356 articles mentioning influenza in October, 1918, the height of the pandemic. Many of those stories would be hauntingly familiar to anyone who lived through the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools, theatres, dance halls and other public gathering places were closed. Hospitals were overrun. Gauze masks came into vogue. Toronto’s medical officer of health, Charles Hastings, encouraged people to shop by phone and pleaded with bosses to let their symptomatic employees stay home, lest they spread the flu to more workers.However, such stories rarely received front-page treatment.Moreover, The Globe’s editorial pages in 1918 lacked the kinds of crusading columns, editorials and investigative reporting that would mark its coverage of COVID-19 a century later. Veteran health columnist André Picard set the tone on March 11, 2020, when he called on Canada’s leaders to “Shut it down,” a few days before officials began closing schools, businesses and major public events in the face of the frightening new virus.In contrast, the paper’s editorials at the peak of the Spanish influenza crisis were uncharacteristically tepid, sometimes amounting to little more than the reprinting of public-health advice and the commending of volunteers for tending to the sick. “Effective methods of combatting the Spanish influenza must be mainly personal,” wrote Junius, as The Globe calls the authors of its unsigned editorials, on Oct. 9, 1918. Closing schools, churches and other public gathering places hadn’t saved Boston from the ravages of the flu, so a “minimum of community disturbance” should be the order of the day in Toronto, Junius wrote – though when the city’s medical officer of health began enacting closings a week later, The Globe didn’t push back.Looking back at the coverage from the vantage point of a journalist who reported on COVID-19 nearly every day for 18 months, The Globe’s underplaying of the far deadlier Spanish influenza pandemic seems puzzling. But unlike reporters in the COVID era, Globe journalists and editors in 1918 were consumed with covering a world war that was weeks from ending as Spanish influenza peaked in Toronto. They were also working in a different media world, one shaped by the space limitations of a physical newspaper instead of the infinite space of the internet. Signs in downtown Toronto warn people to stay home on April 2, 2020, three weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass-media technology in the 21st century allowed for a much faster, broader response to COVID-19 than was possible for influenza in the 1910s. Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail In both pandemics, Canadians quickly turned their public spaces to new uses: In 1918, La Salle College in Thetford Mines, Que., was repurposed as a hospital, and in 2021, the Woburn Collegiate Institute gym in Scarborough became a vaccination clinic. Thetford Region Archives Center; Melissa Tait/The Globe and Mail Neither pandemic hit all ages equally. Influenza largely killed Canadians in their 20s and 30s – the generation that fought in the First World War, a conflict whose end these Calgarians are celebrating on Nov. 11, 1918, with masks to guard against infection. COVID-19 took the elderly: Marjory Robert lost her 78-year-old husband, Gilles, at the Orchard Villa retirement home in 2020. Supplied; Melissa Tait/The Globe and Mail Today, medical historians believe the Spanish influenza first came to Canada in a spring 1918 herald wave mistaken for a bad season of “la grippe,” the French word for influenza.The Globe’s first mention of an unusually dangerous type of flu was contained in a May 29, 1918, news brief out of Spain that described Madrid’s business sector as paralyzed by a “grip” that had infected a third of the population, including King Alfonso.The true origins of the 1918 pandemic are still contested, but what is known is that it didn’t begin in Spain. However, that country’s neutral status made it the first place from which correspondents could report on the disease’s toll without their stories being quashed by wartime censors. Throughout nearly two years of coverage, The Globe referred to pandemic influenza as being of the “Spanish” type.In early 20th-century Canada, protecting public health fell to municipalities and provinces. Ottawa’s only relevant job was enforcing quarantine regulations for ships of immigrants presumed to be carrying contagious scourges such as cholera and smallpox.There existed no national health department at the time. Some reformers, led by recently enfranchised women, pushed for the creation of one during the war years, partly to stem the spread of venereal disease in anticipation of infected soldiers returning from Europe. The Globe supported the establishment of a Dominion health department and the prosecution of a national war on the “social diseases,” as the paper often referred to syphilis and gonorrhea.“This evil,” Junius wrote of venereal diseases on Aug. 30, 1917, “ramifying through every class, stalking unseen where least expected, and lying in ambush to spring upon the innocent and helpless, who are cursed for the sins of the guilty, has reached such dimensions that it must be brought under control to save society from devastation.”Open this photo in gallery:Treponema pallidum is the organism that causes syphilis. Canadians' attitudes about venereal disease would colour their decisions about public health in the early 20th century.The Associated PressIn January, 1918, C.K. Clarke, dean of the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine and director of the Toronto General Hospital, described the toll of venereal diseases (VD) in a four-part series in The Globe. He heaped blame on prostitutes, 60 per cent of whom he labelled as “mentally defective” girls who ought to be isolated on industrial farms.The Globe’s drumbeat of editorials, written against the backdrop of an Ontario judge’s inquiry into legal means of controlling VD, used similar language. They bemoaned the “feeble-minded” and “fallen” women who spread disease to men who couldn’t control themselves – men who went on to infect their innocent wives and unborn children.There was no such moralizing in the pages of The Globe when a terrifying new incarnation of the flu reached Canada. “The big difference? Sex,” says Heather MacDougall, professor emerita of history at the University of Waterloo. “Influenza was indiscriminate in who it attacked and who it killed and didn’t have anything to do with sex.”Nor did the arrival of Spanish influenza have anything to do with immigrants from overseas, frequent scapegoats in past infectious-disease outbreaks, or with soldiers returning from the battlefields of Europe, a common misconception about the pandemic’s origins in Canada.In truth, as historian Mark Humphries explains in a 2013 book optimistically titled The Last Plague, influenza spread north to Canada from the United States.The virus arrived in Canada in mid-September, 1918, in four different places around the same time: the Quebec town of Victoriaville, where a Eucharistic Congress seeded a civilian outbreak The Globe didn’t cover; Sydney, N.S., where a U.S. ship bound for Europe dropped hundreds of infected soldiers on a small-town hospital; a military hospital in St. Jean, Que., where recruits from Boston likely brought the virus north; and Niagara-on-the-Lake, where a training camp for Polish-American recruits for the French army was the site of the first major outbreak in Ontario.Open this photo in gallery:Flu-infected human cells glow green under fluorescent light. Today, epidemiologists can analyze the form and genome of viruses to discern where they came from; not so in 1918.Ted S. Warren/The Canadian PressCapt. Kain was ministering with the Polish camp, as The Globe called it, when he caught the flu. His wife took him to the base hospital, located inside a previously shuttered Toronto General Hospital building, hoping he would receive better care, only to see him die there.Lillian Kain’s letter in The Globe came via Toronto mayor Tommy Church, a colourful conservative who used the press to harangue military leaders over conditions at the base hospital and military camps, including one for Canadians at Niagara. He received the widow’s letter in his capacity as head of the police commission and apparently shared it with the press.Giving prominent play to coverage of the base hospital scandal was, for The Globe and other papers, a back door to criticizing Robert Borden’s Union government without running afoul of press censors or condemning a war The Globe supported. Putting Kain’s letter on the front page, “would have been a very political act,” says Humphries, a professor of history at Wilfrid Laurier University.At the time of Capt. Kain’s death, a coroner’s inquest was already under way at Toronto’s morgue, ostensibly into the death of one member of the Royal Air Force, 26-year-old Cadet Freeman A. Davidson, a law student and conscript who died at the base hospital on Oct. 13, 1918. The inquest morphed into an investigation of whether the facility was properly equipped to care for the crush of infected men who streamed through its doors when influenza struck.The Globe covered every turn of the proceedings, from Church’s testimony blaming Ottawa for “bungling everything,” to the fire chief declaring the base hospital a “fire trap,” to surgeon-general J.T. Fotheringham, the acting director-general of medical services for Canada, “flaying” the press for what he deemed their unfair coverage of the scandal.“It is the duty of the Government not only to investigate and discipline the men responsible for this state of affairs,” The Globe editorial board wrote on Oct. 30, 1918, “but to see that they are replaced by men who are competent and ready to undertake, without a moment of unnecessary delay, the institution of a new and a better system under which Canadian citizens may be assured that their suffering soldier sons are being cared for as they deserve. The government must act at once.”Kain herself testified at the inquest on Nov. 5, 1918. The Globe described the widow as a frank but “somewhat nervous” witness who “bore up well” under questioning, considering officials at the base hospital called a key aspect of her letter false. They testified that doctors examined Capt. Kain’s chest daily, and that he received the best of care. She wrote that her husband went five days without a chest exam.Realistically, there wasn’t much doctors anywhere could do for the infected. Antibiotics for the bacterial pneumonias that preyed on influenza-weakened patients were more than a decade away. The pathogen that caused the flu pandemic wasn’t even identified as a virus until the 1930s. The only recourse was preventing infection in the first place; cramming soldiers cheek-by-jowl into an old hospital building did the opposite.When the coroner’s jury in the base hospital scandal delivered its verdict, it exonerated local doctors and nurses, and instead pinned the blame squarely on Ottawa “for not providing better hospital accommodation for soldiers after four years’ duration of the war.”Open this photo in gallery:Men bury Spanish influenza victims in North River, Labrador, in 1918.Spanish influenza, unlike COVID, struck young adults with a particular ferocity, further hollowing out the same demographic group felled on the battlefield. Medical historians can’t say for certain why Spanish influenza was deadliest to people in their 20s and 30s, but a leading theory is that less-lethal versions of influenza A didn’t circulate much during their childhoods, leaving their immune systems ill-prepared for the fight in 1918.Either way, influenza’s penchant for killing people in the prime of their lives meant The Globe regularly printed stories of children orphaned and parents devastated multiple times over by the war and the flu.The paper also printed partial lists of the dead, often with street addresses – a violation of medical privacy unthinkable today. If the circumstances were tragic enough, the deaths merited their own stories, as happened in the case of the Hare brothers.Young John William Hare of 147 De Grassi St. succumbed to pneumonia in mid-October, 1918. “Scarcely was the funeral over,” The Globe wrote, “when the news came from across the sea to an already heartbroken mother telling her that her other son, Gunner Arthur Hare, died in England on the same day as his brother, stricken by the same disease.”The final weeks of the war, which coincided with the height of the influenza pandemic, cast an inescapable shadow over The Globe’s coverage of the flu. Of 12 front-page stories in October and November of 1918 that mention influenza, three were about the base hospital scandal and four were about Victory Bond fundraising with the flu mentioned only in passing.By contrast, The Globe and Mail ran 116 front-page stories about COVID-19 in March and April of 2020. Customers form a physically distanced line at a Toronto grocery store in June, 2020. As COVID-19 restrictions kept changing among provinces and cities, The Globe kept an array of online explainers up to date on what was allowed where. Melissa Tait/The Globe and Mail Brampton Civic Hospital staff prepare to turn an ICU patient in 2021. The highly racialized neighbourhoods of Brampton, Ont., had some of Canada’s highest COVID-19 positivity rates, and The Globe launched a special reporting project to learn more. Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail In 1919, as soldiers streamed home and Canada suffered sporadic outbreaks of flu and venereal disease, the federal government established a national department of health, a precursor to today’s Health Canada.Funding and political support for the department waxed and waned over the decades as public-health challenges of different magnitudes hit the country: tuberculosis, polio, the less-lethal influenza pandemics of 1957 and 1968, AIDS, the original SARS outbreak in 2003 and another minor flu pandemic caused by H1N1 in 2009.The SARS crisis led to the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, the entity that would pilot the federal response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that killed tens of thousands of Canadians and upended the lives of everyone in this country.COVID emerged into a media landscape that would have been unrecognizable to anyone who read the old black-and-white Globe broadsheet as the Spanish influenza raged. Not only was there no headline-dominating corollary to the First World War to distract reporters and editors from COVID, but there had also been a sea change in how people consumed the news.By 2020, the news was omnipresent, cacophonous and relentless. It spilled from earbuds, blared from TVs and buzzed from smartphones at all hours of the day. Yes, The Globe and Mail still published a daily paper. But it also had a website with infinite space and, in the first year of the pandemic, The Globe seemed determined to fill almost all of it with COVID content.The pandemic dominated The Globe and Mail for nearly two years in a fashion that pushed all other stories aside. That didn’t make sense in 1918, when Canada, and the world, were at war. The main exceptions to The Globe’s passive take on Spanish influenza were stories where the flu and the war collided, such as the paper’s campaign on behalf of the soldiers dying inside the Toronto base hospital where Capt. Kain spent his final days.The Globe’s coverage of influenza is a reminder of how a story can be shaped by the stories happening around it.Kelly Grant is a health reporter at The Globe and Mail.In depth: How Globe staff coped in COVID-19′s first yearWhen COVID-19 sent Canadians into lockdown, Globe journalists had to follow suit while continuing to report what was happening.

(Chris Young/The Canadian Press)Social SharingCOVID-19 and the flu have killed at least 14 New Brunswickers in a week and hospitalized more than 100 people, including five children under four, the latest figures from the Department of Health show.COVID-19 activity remains "moderate," according to the Respiratory Watch report."All indicators remained stable throughout the current reporting period," Dec. 31 to Jan. 6.Influenza activity remains "elevated," it says.Eight people died from COVID-19, up from six the previous week. They were all aged 65 or older.Their deaths raise the pandemic death toll to at least 997. Only confirmed cases who die in hospital are counted.'Critical state' hospital protocol could make nursing home situation worse, says union repForty-eight people were hospitalized for or with the virus, including two children under age four. That's up from 43.Five of them required intensive care, unchanged from Dec. 24 to Dec. 30.Among those admitted to ICU were one person aged 20 to 44, one aged 45 to 64 and three aged 65 or older, the report shows.There were 13 COVID outbreaks confirmed by labs, up from 10. Six of these were in nursing homes, while seven were in "other facilities."Public Health is stepping up its vaccination campaign messaging on social media to try to encourage more New Brunswickers to get vaccinated, the acting chief medical officer of health has said. (Hau Dinh/The Associated Press)A total of 142 new cases of COVID were confirmed through PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab tests during the reporting week, down slightly from 146.The positivity rate — the percentage of PCR lab tests performed that produced a positive result — was nine per cent, down from 10.Nearly 3,500 more New Brunswickers rolled up their sleeves to get the latest COVID-19 XBB.1.5 shot, according to figures from the department. There have been 132,588 vaccines administered since Oct. 4.Flu deaths rise to 6The flu claimed six lives between Dec. 31 and Jan. 6, up from four the previous week.The latest deaths included one person aged 45 to 64, and five people aged 65 or older, the report shows.Seventy people were hospitalized because of the flu, three of whom required intensive care.That's down from 76 and 12, respectively.Among those hospitalized were three children under age four, according to the report.

"That is expected, as many people gathered for the holidays and as New Brunswickers spend more time indoors over the winter months."The viruses are expected to continue to circulate in the province throughout the winter, he said, as Léger noted during a media availability last week about the rise in respiratory illnesses and the high number of severe strep bacterial infections, some of them fatal."Public Health expects we are approaching the seasonal peak of influenza activity in the province," so it's not too late to get the flu shot, said Hatchard. This season's vaccine has shown effective protection against viruses circulating in the province, he said.Good ventilation can also help protect people from respiratory infections, along with wearing a well-fitting mask when in crowded places, Hatchard said.Horizon shows improvementsHorizon Health Network is showing improvements across the board in its weekly COVID-19 update. It had 39 hospitalized COVID patients, including four in intensive care, as of Saturday.That's a 37 per cent drop from the 62 active patients it had a week before, six of whom required ICU.There were seven Horizon hospital units with COVID outbreaks, as of Monday, down from 10. They included: Moncton Hospital — neurology, acute stroke, general surgery. Saint John Regional Hospital — family medicine, orthopedics and urology surgery. St. Joseph's Hospital — geriatric assessment. Charlotte County Hospital — family medicine. In addition, fewer Horizon health-care workers are off the job after testing positive for COVID with a rapid test or PCR test than last week — nine, compared to 19.Vitalité Health Network has no COVID outbreaks, as of Tuesday, but it only updates the rest of its COVID data monthly.In December, 45 people were hospitalized for or with COVID-19, none in ICU, and 72 infected health-care workers were absent, the dashboard shows.Student absences jump 20% in NovemberNew Brunswick students missed more school in November than October, but fewer classes than they did a year ago, according to the latest data from the Department of Education.Absenteeism increased in November in both the anglophone and francophone sectors, across all districts and for all age groups, the data shows.Students missed a combined total of about 180,000 days, or an average of 1.8 days for each of the province's approximately 100,000 public school students.Anglophone students in grades 9 to 12 had the highest average absenteeism rate in New Brunswick in November at 2.4 days, while francophone students in kindergarten to Grade 8 had the lowest at 1.2 days, data from the Department of Education reveals. (CBC)That's up about 20 per cent from a combined average of roughly 1.5 days in October, but down from the average of 2.5 days in November 2022.The data does not identify why a student was absent. "A student could be absent for many reasons, including dental and medical appointments, sickness or personal/family reasons," said department spokesperson Charles Renshaw.Pre-pandemic, in November 2019, students missed an average of 1.2 days.December absenteeism rates are not yet available.Top doctor sends memo to parentsLast week, the province's acting chief medical officer of health sent a memo home to parents and guardians, encouraging people to take steps to protect themselves, others, and the health-care system, including staying home when sick and masking."As you may be aware, this is the time of year when respiratory viruses such as influenza, RSV, COVID19, and others are spreading in New Brunswick and elsewhere," Léger wrote in the memo, obtained by CBC News. "In addition to those viruses, we are seeing increased infections from the streptococcus bacteria (Group A Strep)."All these additional infections also add more strain to the health-care system. Fortunately, we know what we can do to reduce our risk of getting infected and passing on our infections to others."Dr. Yves Léger, the province's acting deputy chief medical officer of health, sent a memo to parents and guardians on Jan. 12, advising of increased infections and the added strain on the health-care system. (Government of New Brunswick/Zoom)Public Health says people should stay home if they have a fever or a new or worsening cough, vomiting or diarrhea, or if they have two or more of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, runny nose/congestion, headache, new onset of fatigue or purple markings on the fingers and toes of children. Public Health also recommends people stay home if they have symptoms of gastrointestinal illness, such as vomiting or diarrhea, until they feel better, are fever-free for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing medication, and free of vomiting and diarrhea for at least 48 hours.Masking "remains a personal choice," said Léger. But "given the current situation, consider wearing a mask, particularly when indoors in a crowded public space," he said."In addition, consider wearing a mask if you are recovering from an infection and you still have some symptoms but you're returning to your usual activities."He also recommends staying up to date with vaccinations and frequent hand washing with soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer."The more measures you take, the more you can reduce your risk of getting infected."CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories 'Exceptional circumstances' sees seniors at Saint John hospital given priority for nursing home beds 1/3 of hospital patients are waiting for long-term care, Horizon CEO says Strep A deaths spike in N.B., include young children, data shows Ambulances diverted from Moncton Hospital during 'critical overcapacity' in ER N.B. adds 17 more COVID-19 deaths, child under 4 among first flu deaths, warning about strep COVID-19 kills 2 more in N.B., hospitalizations and nursing home outbreaks jumpFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Desk Updated Jan 15, 2024, 10:07 AM IST SUMMARY Decline in patients at fever clinics in China since New Year's Day Health authorities warn of possible Covid-19 rebound in January Influenza currently the main respiratory disease, but Covid-19 levels may rise There is a possibility of a rebound in the coronavirus infection epidemic in China in January despite a reduction in the number of patients received at fever clinics in medical institutions across China since New Year's Day, China's Global Times reported citing health experts. National Health Commission (NHC) spokesperson Mi Feng said at a press conference on Sunday that since the start of 2024, the number of patients received at fever clinics across the country has shown a downward trend. Currently, the predominant respiratory diseases are influenza, with Covid-19 infections being relatively low, he added. Data post New Year's Day shows the positive rate for Covid-19 tests in sentinel hospitals has been under one percent. However, the JN. 1 variant strain has seen an increase, according to Wang Dayan, director of the China National Influenza Center. Experts predict that various respiratory pathogens will alternate or co-circulate this winter and upcoming spring in China, with influenza viruses expected to dominate in the short term. Wang warned of a potential Covid-19 rebound in January due to the continuous import of the JN. 1 variant strain, a decrease in domestic influenza, and a decrease in population immunity. He further said that it is difficult to differentiate between seasonal influenza caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses in terms of clinical symptoms and different types and subtypes of influenza viruses usually coexist during the same flu season but in different proportions. "The immune response generated after contracting influenza A does not provide effective immune protection against influenza B, which means that even if one has had influenza A during the epidemic season, there is still a possibility of being infected with influenza B," said Wang. He emphasized the need for enhanced monitoring and early warning as the Spring Festival and winter vacation approach, which could accelerate the spread of respiratory diseases due to increased movement and gathering of people. He also recommended timely health consultation and referral guidance services for the elderly, pregnant women, children, and patients with chronic diseases, along with vaccinations. He stressed the importance of active allocation of medical resources, optimization of medical treatment processes, and ensuring the supply of medical supplies.

Now they have a new deadly challenge facing them: bird flu. It was recently confirmed that a polar bear from northern Alaska has died from the disease.The current strain of H5N1 influenza has affected a far wider range of species than any previously recorded strain. This has included several mammal species, such as foxes, otters, mink, sea lions and seals (including, for the first time, seals in Antarctica). Cases have been detected in humans, too.However, while some cases in mammals have been associated with large numbers of animal deaths, the few cases in humans have, so far, shown only mild symptoms or have been asymptomatic. So, why are there such differences between species, and what are the implications of this polar bear’s death for the wider polar bear population, as well as other large mammals and humans?Influenza viruses are highly adaptable. Their relatively simple genetic code not only changes at random via mutation in the same way as truly living organisms, but also via reassortment. This is where closely related viruses that infect the same host cell exchange genetic material to produce novel genomes. This can lead to greater adaptation for invasion, survival and replication within that host species.This is probably how the current H5N1 strain has come to affect such a variety of bird species, with devastating effects for some populations.Normally, large numbers of deaths associated with a disease are considered to be caused by the spread of a disease between individuals within the population. However, very specific genetic changes are needed for avian influenza viruses to become adapted to mammalian hosts.These changes have not yet been detected in the current strain of H5N1. Although individual-to-individual transmission cannot be ruled out for some mammalian species that have been affected by H5N1, neither can vertical transmission – the transfer of the virus via consumption.If we look at the list of mammals that have been infected by the current H5N1 strain, we see carnivores – and particularly those that are known to scavenge.Very large numbers of some seabird species have died rapidly with H5N1. The likelihood of a seal or a polar bear finding and eating at least one infected bird carcass at an arctic colony suffering an outbreak seems quite high.It is easy to imagine a pod of seals finding a colony of seabirds suffering an outbreak of H5N1 and gorging on carcasses. Under these circumstances, each seal would probably ingest and inhale massive viral loads. Those massive viral loads may have overrun the seals’ immune systems, leading to rapid infection and death without infection being passed between seals.Whether the polar bear encountered large numbers of dead seabirds, one or more seals that had become infected after eating dead seabirds or some other source of virus remains unknown. The answer may be uncovered via testing of the virus and comparison with viruses found in species that occupy the same landscape. This approach is being used to track the spread of H5N1 between wild animals and poultry in the UK.More to find outMuch of this remains hypothetical – for now. The consequences of the polar bear’s death for the species’ populations and for other large mammals cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty. But if genetic testing reveals that the polar bear’s H5N1 remains poorly adapted to mammalian hosts, we might expect few other cases in polar bears.Any further cases might also be closely associated with outbreaks of H5N1 in a nearby seabird colony. It also seems likely that the list of affected mammals and their geographical distribution should continue to grow, but relatively slowly. This list is likely to continue to include only carnivores – and scavengers in particular.On the other hand, because influenza viruses are highly adaptable, ongoing surveillance of the H5N1 strain remains critically important. This will prepare us in case a new variant emerges that is adapted to mammalian hosts, potentially including humans.The consequences of H5N1 for populations of some seabirds have been devastating. The consequences of failure to respond appropriately to a mammal-adapted H5N1 could be severe for polar bears – and for us.Alastair Ward, Associate Professor of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management, University of LeedsThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Centre for Disease Control says group A strep infections higher than usualAkshay Kulkarni · CBC News · Posted: Jan 18, 2024 10:52 PM EST | Last Updated: January 19An electron microscope image shows group A streptococcus bacteria. Strep A was detected in four child deaths over the last month, according to B.C. health authorities. (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/The Associated Press)Social SharingB.C. health authorities are warning that group A strep was identified in four children who have died since mid-December, and the province is seeing unusually high levels of the disease this winter.The warning comes a day after CBC News obtained data showing that the potentially fatal bacterial infection is being seen in record numbers across the country.Invasive group A streptococcal infection kills roughly one in 10 people who contract it. In a Thursday statement, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) says it was detected alongside other viral respiratory illnesses in four child deaths over the last month."This includes two deaths previously reported by BCCDC, where group A streptococcus was identified alongside influenza," reads the statement."BCCDC has also received reports of two deaths where group A streptococcus was identified alongside human metapneumovirus, another viral respiratory illness."Aggressive, often deadly form of strep hits record-high case numbers in CanadaHealth authorities warn of rise in strep infections among B.C. childrenSevere invasive group A strep infections happen when the common strep A bacteria spreads beyond the places it typically infects (such as the throat or skin) into sterile parts of the body, such as the bloodstream or the liquid around the brain, or into soft tissue, where it can cause necrotizing fasciitis, known as flesh-eating disease.The BCCDC says there are no vaccines for strep A, but that residents can take steps to protect themselves against the illness.These include regularly cleaning hands, getting immunized against COVID-19 and influenza, and cleaning wounds promptly.The B.C. Centre for Disease Control says there is no vaccine for strep A. (Have a Nice Day Photo/Shutterstock)In its statement, the centre provides a list of symptoms that indicate when parents should seek medical attention for their child, including persistent fever and a full-body rash.The BCCDC says there has been a significant jump in group A strep cases since 2016, when 303 cases were reported across all of B.C. for a rate of 6.2 cases per 100,000 people. In 2023, there were 586 cases reported, a rate of 10.8 cases per 100,000 people.Family doctor links severity to COVID-19Dr. Susan Kuo, a Richmond-based family physician and member of Protect Our Province B.C., said the increase in severe infections in children is partly due to the impact of COVID-19 on people's immune systems, especially those who have had repeat infections.She says she's had more patients with sore throats over the past few weeks, and some of them have needed antibiotics to treat strep. Influenza, RSV on the rise in B.C. while COVID-19 continues to decline, health officials say'They're all back': B.C. medical experts warn of seasonal illness 'tridemic'"I'm also testing the throat with PCR to look for COVID," she said. "Some of those patients have ... strep throat, but they also have other viral infections."We're seeing some COVID cases for sure, but there has been definitely some RSV in there last month and some influenza."Dr. Susan Kuo, a family doctor in Richmond, B.C., says some of her patients haven't sought medical attention until their symptoms became more severe. She is encouraging residents to get sore throats checked out if possible. (Janella Hamilton/CBC)Kuo says she's seeing vaccine fatigue among parents when it comes to COVID-19 and flu shots, and urged residents to get their shots and seek medical attention as soon as they feel sick."In the case of something like strep, I think you do not want to put that off because if you got one of the more virulent strains, it could be potentially life threatening for your child," she said."So please, we urge the public to get seen and don't think it's a cold, right?

Experts say people need to stay up to date on vaccines even if COVID-19 is less severeLane Harrison · CBC News · Posted: Jan 16, 2024 5:00 AM EST | Last Updated: January 16From Jan. 2 to Jan. 10, TPH received reports of 122 COVID-19 related hospitalizations, eight new ICU admissions and 44 COVID-related deaths. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Social SharingToronto likely reached its influenza season peak in December, but according to Toronto Public Health's latest respiratory illness update, COVID-19 infections are expected to remain high for now.The percentage of positive influenza tests dropped to 6.6 per cent the week of Dec. 31 to Jan. 6, down from 15.6 per cent the week prior, Toronto Public Health (TPH) told the city's Board of Health Monday. When it comes to COVID-19, positivity dropped only slightly to 17.6 per cent for the week of Dec. 31 to Jan. 6 from 18.6 per cent the week before.But getting over the influenza peak doesn't mean there aren't still high levels of the illness in the city. "We went up the rollercoaster, we were at the top, that was the peak," Dr. Vinita Dubey, TPH's associate medical officer of health told CBC Toronto. "But even on the way down, you still have a lot of activity on the other side until you get to the bottom again." WATCH | First-time COVID infections still a risk for seniors:New COVID-19 data warns of risks to seniors not yet infected1 year agoDuration 1:47New Canadian data shows that more than four in 10 elderly adults may have avoided a COVID-19 infection so far. But they remain at the highest risk for hospitalization and death and researchers say keeping up-to-date with vaccinations is still the best way to reduce that risk.Dr. Susy Hota, head of the infectious diseases division at University Health Network (UHN), also says influenza appears to have peaked. While the hospital is still seeing patients hospitalized with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the vast majority of cases involve COVID-19.When it comes to RSV, she said the number of infections has been lower this year, which came as a relief after a bad previous season.Hota says it looks like COVID-19 could be peaking now, but it's hard to say how long that will last because the illness is still relatively new and therefore unpredictable.When it comes to what people should do with all that information, Hota says it's simple. "It's very much a similar message that we need to maybe reinforce to people every year," she said. Hota says people should stay up to date on vaccines and stay home when they're sick.'Really bad' to 'not good'The end-of-December influenza peak coincided with a spike in emergency department visits for respiratory illnesses, which started to decrease in the first week of January, says TPH.That's a trend that Toronto emergency room Dr. Lisa Salamon says is a shift from "really bad" to "not good."During the week of Dec. 31 to Jan. 6, the seven-day average of respiratory-related emergency department visits went down about 30 per cent, according the public health agency.Dr. Lisa Salamon, an emergency room physician with the Scarborough Health Network, says the baseline level of respiratory illnesses in emergency rooms hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Salamon, who works for the Scarborough Health Network, says despite the decline, hospitals are still feeling pressure."I think what is pretty important to know or at least what we feel, is that the baseline seems to be higher than ever before. So we never came back down to a pre-pandemic baseline," she said. Continued COVID-19 deaths discouraging: physicianFrom Jan. 2 to Jan. 10, TPH received reports of 122 COVID-19 related hospitalizations, eight new ICU admissions and 44 COVID-related deaths.Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease physician at Sinai Health, says it's discouraging to see hospitalizations and deaths related to the virus continue. "I was really hoping before this winter, that COVID was going to be down to about the level of influenza. And it's not... It's still significantly worse than influenza," McGeer said. RSV infections surge as hospitals brace for return of 'normal' respiratory virus seasonOntarians urged to get both flu, COVID-19 shots ahead of respiratory virus seasonGiven that, McGeer says people need to keep their vaccinations up to date. During TPH's presentation Monday, the agency shared its work to promote vaccines. But McGeer says getting shots in arms at this point is a challenge on two fronts. Firstly, many no longer want to hear about the pandemic. Secondly, COVID-19 is much less severe than it used to be and being infected doesn't feel very dangerous when so many people have had it.She says people need to view COVID-19 as familiar and dangerous, like a car. "When you drive your car, even in winter storms, you don't expect to be in an accident, right? You don't really think your seatbelt is necessary, but you put it on anyway," she said."COVID and flu vaccines are just like that. It's really easy to think it's not going to happen to you, and it's not going to be severe. But you still need to get your vaccine."ABOUT THE AUTHORLane HarrisonReporterLane Harrison is a journalist with CBC Toronto.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Decrease in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: increase in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 8 to 14 January 2024 (week 2), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 196 cases, compared to 240 cases the previous week (-18%). The positivity rate fell to 10% compared to 14% the previous week. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased. The latest sequencing data available for weeks 50-52 show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (72.0%) (95% CI: 64.1-79.9%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (16.8%) (95% CI: 10.3-23.3%) and the XBB.1.9 variant (8.0%) (95% CI: 3.2-12.8%) [1]. It should be noted that the JN.1 variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant with an additional mutation on its spike protein. Influenza For the week of 8 to 14 January 2024 (week 2), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 439 cases compared to 360 cases in the previous week, presenting an increase of 22%. These data largely overlap with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus, followed by rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2.1. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 8 to 14 January 2024 (week 2), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 29 cases, compared with 52 the previous week, presenting an decrease of 44%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

What is the highly pathogenic avian influenza?A polar bear faced an unfortunate death because of bird flu. This is the first time that bird flu has become the cause of death of a polar bear. What is the highly pathogenic avian influenza? Is the population of polar bears at risk due to the virus?By Astha PasrichaJan 17, 2024, 10:30 IST A polar bear died from bird flu for the first time. What is the highly pathogenic avian influenza?For the very first time, a polar bear has passed away because of bird flu. The incident took place in AlaskaThe death of the polar bear was confirmed in December by the Division of Environmental Health officials. The dead polar bear was found in October in Utqiagvik. The reason for death in this bizarre incident is the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Influenza can be caught in cases of scavenging on bird carcasses that have been infected with the H5N1.On one side, the Arctic population is struggling to bear with climate change, and if the bird flu spreads, it will add to the woes.Is it the first time for bears to contract with such a virus? Well, previously, brown and black bears have been acquainted with the virus. The incident of polar bear passing away due to the virus, however, seems to be more alarming as the species is already a vulnerable one. The species is troubled with a myriad of severe problems such as losing their sea habitat, making it difficult for them to survive. Now, the concern is that if in vase influenza spreads among the species, it can drastically bring down its already low population. ALSO READ: What Is The Difference Between The Arctic And Antarctic? The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) It was in the year 1996 when the H5N1, a strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was identified for the very first time in China. However, the virus has now spread all across the world. A new variant of the virus came in the year 2020. The deadly virus variant killed a great number of birds. It spread across North America as well later.In those years while humans were struggling with the pandemic caused by the coronavirus, the H5N1 and its variants killed thousands of mammals. ALSO READ: Scientists Have Discovered Ancient World Frozen Under the Surface of Antarctica. Here's All to Know! Are polar bears at risk due to the virus? Polar bears live in a habitat where detecting the virus among the species can turn out to be an extremely difficult task. This puts polar bears at risk. However, what serves as a ray of hope is the fact that since polar bears are solitary species, the risk of transmission of the virus stands low. Yet, the situation is still alarming, as the species is facing reduced sea ice, due to which it has begun to feed on seabirds more. Another concerning factor in the case of polar bears is their very low population, which thereby makes the species more vulnerable. The species get adversely affected by anthropogenic chemicals. These accumulate in the high-fat diets of animals. Now, since the fat store gets depleted, the stored pollutants begin affecting the immune system. A polar bear who hasn't eaten anything for a long time is definitely deprived of nutrition, resulting in a weak immune system. When polar bears come in contact with such viruses, it becomes very difficult for their immune systems to fight influenza.

While Canadians learned a lot about how to protect themselves from illness over the course of the pandemic, new information released by health care practitioners can help inform decisions, from availability of flu shots to any changes in COVID-19 protocols.We’ll be publishing an update on respiratory virus season each week.

E-mail audience@globeandmail.com to see whether we can help you.Open this photo in gallery:A woman wearing a protective face mask leaves a health centre in Madrid, Spain, on Jan. 10.SUSANA VERA/ReutersThe latest newsBritish Columbia reported a record-breaking 10,435 people in hospital one day last week as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 filled wards to the brim. Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix held a news conference to encourage residents to get their COVID-19 and flu shots. B.C. is not alone in grappling with overflowing emergency departments and hospital wards, a challenge compounded by staff shortages. Quebec health officials have been urging patients to stay away from ERs if they can. The province’s Health Minister said he expects ERs to be overtaxed for most of the winter.Canada’s top vaccine experts say seniors and younger people with compromised immune systems should get another dose of a COVID-19 vaccine this spring. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization made the recommendation on Friday so that provincial vaccination programs could prepare for a spring mini-campaign for the most vulnerable. As of early December, only 15 per cent of Canadians had received a reformulated version of the shot targeting the XBB family of variants.The Canadian Medical Association, which represents doctors across the country, issued a call to action urging the provincial and territorial governments that have yet to do so to sign bilateral health funding deals with Ottawa. In her statement, CMA president Kathleen Ross drew special attention to the toll respiratory viruses are taking on a fragile health system. “Staff shortages and hospital overcrowding combined with poor access to high-quality team-based primary care are leaving hospital emergency departments woefully under-resourced for the avalanche of patients with influenza, COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at this time of year,” she said.Spain is proposing a return to mask mandates at health-care facilities as respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza, are sweeping across Europe. The viruses are hitting some European countries harder than others.Flu outlook in CanadaThe Public Health Agency of Canada noted in its FluWatch report that influenza activity actually decreased in the first week of January – despite it feeling like everyone is getting sick right now. Nationally, the share of flu tests that came back positive in the week that ended Jan. 6 was 15 per cent, down from 18.7 per cent in the last week of December and 17.3 per cent the week before that.Overall, flu activity levels remain elevated and are in line with a regular, prepandemic flu season, the report said. Some parts of the country are faring worse than others, including British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, where influenza is widespread.The vast majority of cases confirmed by labs last week were influenza A; of those, three-quarters were H1N1. That strain is the culprit behind nearly all flu-associated hospital admissions in Canada this season.In the week ending Jan. 6, there were 229 people in hospital, at least 42 of whom were children, because of the flu. There were seven flu-related deaths. So far this season, 316 children have been admitted to hospital because of influenza at pediatric centres that are contributing to a new surveillance network. The weekly FluWatch report has not been reporting data on pediatric flu deaths, but the BC Centre for Disease and Control has reported at least three flu-related deaths in children under 10. All the children had secondary bacterial infections that contributed to their deaths, Dr. Henry said.Flu shotsFlu shots are still available at clinics, doctors’ offices and pharmacies across the country, with appointments available for anyone six months and older. Find out about clinics and availability for each of the provinces and territories here:Newfoundland; Prince Edward Island; Nova Scotia; New Brunswick; Quebec; Ontario; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Alberta; British Columbia; Yukon; Northwest Territories; NunavutHospitalizations for COVID-19There were 4,705 people in hospital as a result of COVID-19 during the week that ended Jan. 9, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, a slight increase from the previous week, when 4,625 were in hospital. The number of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care beds also rose, to 173 from 155.COVID-19 boostersThe three authorized vaccines, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax, protect against the XBB.1.5 subvariant of COVID-19 and should provide good protection against the related EG.5 family. The reformulated mRNA shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are approved for anyone six months and older.

According to Health Canada, you may start experiencing symptoms anywhere from one to 14 days after exposure. Typically, symptoms appear between three to seven days after exposure.Health Canada advises following the testing guidelines provided by your local public health authority if you have symptoms or have been exposed to a person with COVID-19. If you test positive, immediately isolate yourself from others, including those in your household, and follow the advice of your local public health authority on isolation requirements.How to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory virusesRespiratory viruses are spread from person to person or through contact with contaminated surfaces, so it’s important to protect against both forms of transmission.

The flu can impact anyone but a great way to reduce your risk of getting sick and protected the people around you, is by getting vaccinated. Dr. Claudia Kraft, Territorial Medical Director, would like to share her advice on protecting yourself and the community as we see higher numbers of flu infections. Dr Kraft.jpg “The flu spreads easily and quickly through the coughs and sneezes of people who are infected with the virus. It doesn’t matter how healthy or active you may be, you can still become sick with the flu. While some groups are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill (needing hospitalization or even dying), serious illness can also affect young and healthy people.” “It is important to get the flu shot every year as it provides you with newest vaccine, reduces your risk of getting infected and you will be more likely to experience milder symptoms if you do get the flu. By getting the vaccine, you’re not only protecting yourself but also helping stop the flu from spreading to others in the community, especially our more vulnerable populations such as young children, elderly individuals, and those who may have weaker immune systems.” “The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA) offer mass flu clinic opportunities across the NWT each year that allows for an easy and convenient way for people to get vaccinated, and then smaller flu clinics are provided or people can book an appointment at their local health centre. It’s the simplest thing you can do to stay on top of your own health and protect the community. It also helps reduce the strain on our hospitals and clinics, as vaccination can reduce the number of people who need to be cared for in health centres, clinics, and hospitals due to the flu. Sometimes it’s the little things that can make a huge difference.” The flu season isn’t over, and we continue to see respiratory viruses spread across the territory and impact individuals, communities, and our health and social services system. It’s not to late in the season for you and/or your family to get vaccinated. For residents in Yellowknife, you can book a vaccination appointment with Public Health by calling 867-767-9120 or submit a callback request form. For residents outside Yellowknife, contact your local health centre. The 811 health advice line (toll free: 1-844-259-1793) is available if you would like to speak with a registered nurse. If you are feeling unwell or part of a group at higher risk of serious illness, it’s especially important to speak with a nurse early in on if you feel sick to see if you may benefit from treatment that might lower your risk of becoming seriously ill. Our registered nurses are available 24/7 to provide you with confidential health advice and support. Feedback Have a suggestion to improve the site? Please give us your feedback.

Therefore, the appropriate response is to protect ourselves and prevent each other from getting sick by wearing masks.Many Hongkongers still have unused masks in their homes, and wearing them during flu season is important to prevent sickness and even death. We are used to wearing masks already – the Covid mask mandate was only dropped last year – so it isn’t a big deal to wear them again for a little while, at least in crowded areas like public transport.Hong Kong health minister confident city can handle rising Covid and flu casesAlthough some studies claim that masks don’t do much to prevent flu transmission in the community, there are still many reasons to wear masks if we consider the matter from a psychological and economic angle.Wearing masks can encourage people to adopt other behaviours that can keep them safe from illness. For example, Sage Journals found that we automatically tend to distance ourselves from others when we wear masks, which goes a long way to slow down transmission of the virus; you’re less likely to be exposed to someone’s germs when you are social distancing.Companies that manufacture masks have suffered huge losses due to the sudden halt in purchases, which may lead them to cut down on production to save money. This could be an issue for the community in the future, as there could be a shortage if we need them on a massive scale again. We all remember how difficult it was to buy masks in the early days of the pandemic, and we certainly don’t want to revisit that time, should another disaster strike.The flu season can put a big burden on the healthcare system. Photo: XinhuaNot only can masks protect us from others’ potential illnesses, but they can keep us from transmitting our own; if a mask is covering your mouth and nose, you will probably touch them less.Masks can help us slow down or stop flu transmission in the community, and wearing one is a small act that could help many people. It could also benefit Hong Kong’s medical facilities, as a flu outbreak could burden the city’s healthcare system, which is still recovering from the impact of coronavirus.Against: Calissa Poon, 12, Diocesan Girls’ SchoolCalissa Poon from Diocesan Girls’ School.After three years of mandatory mask-wearing during the tiring and frantic Covid-19 pandemic, Hongkongers are relieved that they no longer have to wear masks in their daily lives. However, flu season has now arrived, and the issue of wearing masks has arisen again.While masks appear to protect people from infection, we must carefully consider whether they are really necessary during flu season. Wearing masks often provides a false sense of security for people. Some may ignore other important measures, such as hand hygiene and social distancing.80 per cent of Hong Kong students are still wearing masksThe most crucial factor to consider as to why we should not wear face masks during the flu season is the effect that masks have on one’s immunity against the influenza virus. The flu is a viral disease that appears yearly, and there are vaccines available each year to help prevent widespread sickness. Rather than focusing on mask-wearing, Hongkongers should prioritise getting their vaccines before peak flu season hits.According to Professor Ivan Hung, an expert in infectious diseases from the University of Hong Kong, mask-wearing for students who have never been infected by upper respiratory diseases only delays an eventual outbreak. Meanwhile, their immune systems will not develop properly to defend themselves from these viruses.Professor Ivan Hung from the University of Hong Kong says mask-wearing for students who have never been infected by upper respiratory diseases does nothing but delay an eventual outbreak. Photo: Xiaomei ChenWearing a mask for a long time can have many other negative effects.For some, it can cause significant discomfort, such as breathing difficulties, acne or skin irritation. It also increases communication difficulties and harms social interaction. Disposing of a large number of face masks can also hurt the environment by creating waste and pollution.The pandemic dealt a heavy blow to Hong Kong’s economy, which is slowly recovering but still struggling. If the city were full of people with masks, it could impact concerned tourists and encourage others to refrain from visiting.The widespread use of masks could also create the perception of ongoing health risks in Hong Kong, leading to decreased outdoor activity and consumer spending and further delaying the city’s economic recovery.Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentYoung Post ReadersReaders share their thoughts and opinions on everything from social issues to pop culture.

[JOINT PRESS CORPS] The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) began implementing infectious disease countermeasures three weeks ahead of schedule on Friday, in response to a rapid rise in norovirus and other respiratory illnesses. The disease control measures were originally due to take effect during the Lunar New Year holiday, known as Seollal in Korean, which begins on Feb. 9 this year. According to the KDCA, over 360 people tested positive for norovirus from Jan. 7 to 13, the highest weekly caseload of the disease since January 2020. Norovirus cases in Korea typically spike between the third week of January and fourth week of February. Children under six years of age made up 49.4 percent of the recent cases, highlighting the disease’s rapid spread in day care facilities and kindergartens. The same demographic made up 57.7 percent of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases recorded in the first two weeks of this month, and numbers are expected to increase over the following weeks based on past infection trends, according to the KDCA. KDCA Commissioner Jee Young-mee called on members of the public to “immediately report” symptoms involving vomiting and diarrhea in more than two people living in the same household, as well as signs of respiratory illness, to their nearest public health center.

According to the National Health Insurance Service, the number of people who tested positive for the flu reached 873,590 in 2022 — a 91.2-fold increase from the previous year’s 9,574 reported cases. Cases of influenza declined drastically during the Covid-19 pandemic, when face coverings were required in almost all public settings, falling from 1.77 million cases in 2019. Almost 40 percent of those diagnosed with influenza in 2022 were teenagers, while 25.8 percent were aged 9 or under, according to the National Health Insurance Service’s data.

Doctors Break It DownWhat Exactly Is The 24-Hour Flu—And What Symptoms Does It Cause? Doctors Break It DownIt's actually not the "flu" at all. By Andi BreitowichUpdated: Jan 16, 2024 11:11 AM ESTSave ArticlePixelsEffect//Getty ImagesNo one ever wants to get sick, but in the era of the tripledemic (when RSV, flu, and COVID-19 peak at the same time) you’re likely doing everything in your power to stay healthy. But there’s unfortunately another not-so–fun illness that should be on your radar with the holiday season and winter travel in full-swing: the 24-hour flu.Believe it or not, even though it's called "the 24-hour flu," it has nothing to do with the flu or flu virus at all (kinda like the period flu). The 24-hour flu is a misnomer because influenza is an upper respiratory tract virus that does not involve the gastrointestinal tract, explains Nicholaos Bellos, MD, an infectious disease expert and the national medical director of extended care services at Quest Diagnostics. People who have the 24-hour flu are actually experiencing a condition known as gastroenteritis, also often referred to as the stomach flu, he says. Gastroenteritis is commonly known as the 24-hour flu because the symptoms it causes may only last a day or two. That's not always true, though, since GI issues caused by this condition can sometimes take up to 14 days to go away, notes Dr. Bellos. When it comes to the 24-hour flu, you don’t want to mess around. Below, read on to learn everything you need to know about this stomach bug, and how to treat it, according to doctors.Meet the experts: Nicholaos Bellos, MD, is an infectious disease expert in Dallas, Texas and the national medical director of extended care services at Quest Diagnostics. Natasha Chhabra, MD, is a gastroenterologist in Ridgewood, New Jersey at Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey. Shirin Mazumder, MD, is an infectious disease physician at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis, Tennessee.What causes the 24-hour flu?“Adult cases are usually caused by norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, rotavirus, or food poisoning,” says Dr. Bellos. The virus or contaminated food causes your stomach and intestines to become irritated and inflamed, leading to gastroenteritis and the associated symptoms, he explains.Related Story32 Possible Reasons Your Stomach HurtsBoth the norovirus and rotavirus are spread through coming into contact with someone who has the virus or their unwashed hands (especially after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper) or touching contaminated surfaces. Food poisoning, on the other hand, occurs when someone consumes contaminated food or water, notes Dr. Bellos. That said, the 24-hour flu is typically not airborne (caused by coughing, sneezing, or laughing), says Natasha Chhabra, MD, a gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey. “People can get it through ingestion of contaminated foods, but usually more rapid spread is in crowded areas and more through direct contact rather than respiratory.”“The 24-hour flu is very contagious which usually means if one member of your household becomes ill, then other members are at high risk of becoming sick too,” adds Shirin Mazumder, MD, an infectious disease physician at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis, Tennessee.What are the symptoms of the 24-hour flu?Symptoms usually appear within four to 48 hours after coming in contact with the virus or eating contaminated foods. They can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever, says Dr. Bellos. You may also have body aches, loss of appetite, or extreme fatigue, and dehydration is common if you're throwing up or going to the bathroom a lot. The tricky part is symptoms can be similar to those of the flu or COVID-19. “COVID-19 can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, even when breathing problems are not present, so it’s important to look at other more severe health conditions when experiencing symptoms,” says Dr. Bellos. But simple tests can rule out COVID-19, the flu, or bacterial infections. And while *anyone* can get the 24-hour flu, those with a weakened immune system are at a higher risk, notes Dr. Chhabra. Young children, elderly people, and anyone who is immunocompromised or taking medications that suppress their immune system are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Does the 24-hour flu really go away in a day?Unfortunately, no. “For most people, the illness goes away in a few days, and you can be contagious from a few days to two weeks or more, depending on which virus caused the gastroenteritis,” says Dr. Bellos. However, in the case of the norovirus, you may still be contagious a few days after you recover. The norovirus can remain in your stool for up to two weeks after recovery.We repeat: The 24-hour flu is very contagious, so the best way to avoid getting others sick is to limit contact, disinfect all surfaces (counters, door handles, faucets, etc.), and practice good hand washing (that means rinsing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds), says Dr. Bellos. The virus can also remain in your stool for up to two weeks after recovery, so hand washing after using the bathroom is absolutely essential, he adds. You should also avoid sharing personal items such as utensils, glasses, plates, and towels with anyone who is sick, explains Dr. Mazumder.Is the stomach bug actually the flu?Again, the name ‘24-hour flu’ is misleading because the illness is not the flu at all, says Dr. Mazumder. “The flu is caused by the influenza virus, which most commonly leads to a respiratory illness, and the 24-hour flu can be caused by different viruses which lead to gastroenteritis or inflammation of the digestive tract, which decreases the body’s ability to absorb and digest food,” she explains. Norovirus most often affects adults and rotavirus is the most common cause in children under two, she adds. How do you treat the 24-hour flu?Most cases go away on their own with lots of rest and plenty of fluids, and Dr. Mazumder recommends hydrating with water and Pedialyte. “The main complication of the 24-hour flu is dehydration, but avoid hydrating with energy drinks or other sugary beverages because sometimes the sugar in these beverages can cause a worsening of symptoms,” she explains. If you’re struggling to keep anything down, drink small amounts (two to four ounces) every 30 to 60 minutes, adds Dr. Bellos. You should also stick to bland foods like bread, crackers, rice, bananas, or applesauce, and avoid anything heavy or flavorful, adds Dr. Mazumder. Related Story8 Electrolyte Drinks To Consider“Sometimes antidiarrheals like Imodium can be used, but that should be discussed with your doctor before using in case there is an infection that requires more specific treatment like an antibiotic,” says Dr. Chhabra.A probiotic supplement may also be helpful to restore the gut flora, which can be thrown off when you’re dealing with an infection or virus. “There's not one probiotic that’s considered much better than others, but a probiotic in general supplies you with good bacteria and can help mitigate symptoms,” adds Dr. Chhabra. You may not feel the effects of the probiotic right away, but you’ll notice (and feel!) a difference over time. When should you see a doctor?If you have diarrhea that lasts more than several days or notice blood in your stool, then you need to seek medical care, says Dr. Chhabra. Prolonged nausea that lasts more than one to two weeks is also a sign that it’s time to check in with your doc. Related StoryHow To Get Rid Of Any Kind Of Stomach PainDehydration is another major concern with the 24-hour flu, so if you feel lightheaded, dizzy, delirious, or have dry mouth, lips, or eyes, then you need to go to the emergency room or urgent care ASAP, says Dr. Chhabra. It’s also especially important to watch for symptoms of dehydration in the elderly, children, and people with a weakened immune system, adds Dr. Mazumder.How is the 24-hour flu diagnosed?The 24-hour flu is usually diagnosed by symptoms and circumstances alone, says Dr. Mazumder. For example, if the sickness spreads through your family or household, it’s likely a virus. Testing is usually not necessary if symptoms only last a few days, but a stool test may be required if you have severe or prolonged symptoms, she adds.24-Hour Flu Vs. Food Poisoning Vs. COVID-19The 24-hour flu, food poisoning, and COVID-19 all have overlapping symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but there are some key differences when it comes to diagnosing the three, says Dr. Mazumder. Food poisoning is caused by bacteria such as e. coli, campylobacter, and salmonella, which can contaminate food products, says Dr. Mazumder. “Food poisoning is suspected if you have eaten out or traveled recently, and symptoms can start within hours of exposure,” she explains. Stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and cramps are common symptoms, but blood in your stool can also occur and should warrant an urgent medical evaluation, she adds. Food poisoning usually lasts anywhere from one to 10 days and antibiotics may be necessary in severe cases or in those with a higher risk of complications, notes Dr. Mazumder.Related Story25 Of The Best Foods For An Upset StomachCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is typically spread through close contact with an infected person. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequent COVID-19 symptoms, but sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, fatigue, and a loss of taste or smell can also develop, says Dr. Mazumder. A home test can be helpful to determine if COVID-19 is at play, but a PCR test at your local clinic can also (more accurately) detect the virus, she explains. If you test positive for COVID-19, isolate yourself from others for at least five days, and continue wearing a mask around others, especially if they are high risk, for an additional five days, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatment typically consists of rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen, but antiviral medications can be used to treat mild to moderate cases if someone is at high risk for complications, adds Dr. Mazumder. Unlike food poisoning, there is also a vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 and serious illness, she adds.Symptoms of norovirus or rotavirus typically start anywhere from one to three days after exposure, says Dr. Mazumder. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and fever, and typically last a few days, but can last up to two weeks, she explains. Since the 24-hour flu is caused by a viral infection, Dr. Mazumder says antibiotics won’t work to treat this kind of infection, but rest, plenty of fluids, bland foods, and antidiarrheals can help ease symptoms. Bottom line: The 24-hour flu typically lasts longer than a day and causes abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. If you become sick, get plenty of rest and stay hydrated, but if symptoms worsen or persist longer a week, or you have blood in your stool, visit a doctor ASAP.Andi BreitowichAndi Breitowich is a Chicago-based writer and graduate student at Northwestern Medill.

Since the Carnival period, there has been a noticeable increase in respiratory ailments, with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) confirming in its latest epidemiological report - published on January 8th - that "countries in the northern hemisphere are experiencing epidemic levels of acute respiratory disease associated with the circulation of three viruses, namely: SARS CoV-2 or COVID-19 virus, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)." The health institution noted that within the Caribbean subregion, SARS CoV-2 activity has remained at low levels for the last four weeks. However, influenza activity and RSV activity are fluctuating at moderate levels for this same period. Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Hazel Laws, in her press statement today (Jan. 14), revealed that in December 2023, there were no laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Between January 1 to 12, 2024, “the MOH has reported only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS CoV-2 or COVID-19, one of which was imported, and the patient was airlifted shortly after hospitalization.” This lines up with recent suspicions from tourism officials that the influx of visitors for the Carnival period from tourism source markets could be causing the increase in respiratory ailments. In the media statement, Dr. Laws noted that the Ministry of Health continues to maintain its robust respiratory surveillance activities to monitor and detect any rise in respiratory infections. She added, “emergency room physicians on both islands are currently evaluating and investigating all patients who present with fever and respiratory symptoms, including headache, coughing, sore throat, loss of sense of taste or smell, shortness of breath, joint pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.” As pointed out by the CMO, the steady rise in respiratory illness activity is a common annual trend that the MOH is continuously monitoring. “This trend is fueled by the flu season, the high influx of travelers, and the mass gatherings during the Christmas season and carnival celebrations. Respiratory illness activity usually peaks between January and March of each year.” Against that backdrop, the CMO made several recommendations to protect against the flu virus: 1. Get an updated or seasonal flu or influenza vaccine shot. The Ministry of Health is recommending that health care workers, older adults, pregnant women and patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes and asthma, get an updated influenza vaccine at the soonest possible time. Influenza vaccines are administered at all health centers in the Federation. 2. Practice good hand hygiene. Wash hands thoroughly after exposure to high-touch surfaces 3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. 4. Get prompt medical attention if you develop flu symptoms. 5. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. 6. Stay at home from school, work, church, funerals and any function or gathering when you are sick and experiencing respiratory symptoms. Copyright © 2024 SKNVibes, Inc. All rights reserved.

Min­is­ter of Health Ter­rence Deyals­ingh re­vealed this yes­ter­day while speak­ing with the me­dia at the Di­vali Na­gar, Ch­agua­nas, which has been trans­formed in­to the North Cen­tral Re­gion­al Health Au­thor­i­ty’s (NCRHA) mass vac­ci­na­tion lo­ca­tion for in­fluen­za. The min­is­ter said from De­cem­ber 28 to Jan­u­ary 14, five COVID-19 deaths were record­ed. “We had two re­port­ed from De­cem­ber 28 to De­cem­ber 31, and for Jan­u­ary 2024 we have had three. So, we have had five COVID deaths from De­cem­ber 28, 2023, to to­day, Jan­u­ary 15, 2024,” Deyals­ingh ex­plained. The min­is­ter said the vic­tims were el­der­ly and suf­fered from co­mor­bidi­ties. At the start of the year, Deyals­ingh not­ed the coun­try reg­is­tered a small in­crease in pos­i­tive COVID-19 in­fec­tions from ze­ro in No­vem­ber and De­cem­ber, to nine peo­ple be­ing hos­pi­talised, in­clud­ing a mi­nor. They are be­ing treat­ed at the San Fer­nan­do Gen­er­al Hos­pi­tal and Cou­va Hos­pi­tal and Mul­ti Train­ing Fa­cil­i­ty.“In Cou­va, we have three ward lev­el pa­tients. At SFGH, we have four adult ward lev­el pa­tients, we have one pae­di­atric ward lev­el pa­tient, and we have one ICU pa­tient at San Fer­nan­do,” he said. As a re­sult, he urged fam­i­lies with at-risk loved ones to wear masks, sani­tise, so­cial dis­tance and stay at home if feel­ing un­well. This, as he lament­ed that close to 800,000 dos­es of COVID-19 vac­cines, the last of which ex­pired in Sep­tem­ber, were de­stroyed due to peo­ple’s un­will­ing­ness to get in­oc­u­lat­ed. “Peo­ple were just not com­ing for­ward for COVID vac­cines and this is a glob­al phe­nom­e­non. Many peo­ple got vac­cine fa­tigued, many peo­ple be­lieved the mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion about COVID vac­cines, un­for­tu­nate­ly. They be­lieved all the out­right lies about COVID vac­cines and that’s un­for­tu­nate. To have dumped 795,000 dos­es of vac­cines rep­re­sents a ter­ri­ble waste,” he said. He said a cost could not be re­vealed on the loss of the vac­cines, since some were do­nat­ed and oth­ers pur­chased un­der non-dis­clo­sure agree­ments. The Gov­ern­ment is work­ing to ac­quire more vac­cines, though Deyals­ingh said it is a dif­fi­cult task for small na­tions to ac­quire them. Cau­tious not to see sim­i­lar wastage of in­fluen­za vac­cines, he urged the pop­u­la­tion to get im­mu­nised. Ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), sea­son­al in­fluen­za is an acute res­pi­ra­to­ry in­fec­tion caused by in­fluen­za virus­es. It spreads eas­i­ly and with the Car­ni­val sea­son around the cor­ner, ex­tra pre­cau­tion is rec­om­mend­ed. “We urge the im­muno-com­pro­mised, those are the peo­ple that we are con­cerned about, the el­der­ly who may not be par­ty­ing but your chil­dren may go to par­ty - wear a mask, sani­tise, have them sani­tise al­so,” Deyals­ingh said. To date, the Min­istry of Health has ad­min­is­tered 22,566 dos­es of in­fluen­za vac­cines since the start of the flu sea­son which com­menced last Oc­to­ber and will end in May. Sev­en­ty-five thou­sand dos­es of the (2023/2024) in­fluen­za vac­cine were ac­quired by the min­istry on Oc­to­ber 2, 2023. In­di­vid­u­als are re­mind­ed that the vac­cine does not pro­tect against the com­mon cold but it does of­fer sup­port against the po­ten­tial­ly dead­ly virus. The jab is safe for young peo­ple, the el­der­ly, preg­nant women and breast­feed­ing moth­ers. The Min­is­ter al­so ad­vised the pop­u­la­tion, es­pe­cial­ly im­muno-com­pro­mised peo­ple, to re­turn to mask-wear­ing to pre­vent them­selves from be­ing in­fect­ed.The in­fluen­za is be­ing ad­min­is­tered at Trinci­ty Mall, the Di­vali Na­gar and all health cen­tres.

While hospitalization rates are moderate, chest infections rise, prompting online consultations. Written by Zerneela Mohammed Wakil January 16, 2024 13:05 IST Follow Us Health expert attributes the problem to a combination of pollution and winter conditions. (Photo: Express File Photo/Representative Image) The combination of the winter season and elevated pollution levels in Delhi-NCR has resulted in a surge in influenza cases. Doctors note that while this increase is an annual occurrence during the colder months, there is a higher-than-usual prevalence of chest infections this time. Although the rate of hospitalization is moderately low, numerous individuals are seeking online consultations and visiting outpatient departments (OPDs) for medical advice. Medical professionals reveal that a majority of these patients are grappling with the Influenza A H1N1 virus, some with H3N2 virus, and others with chest infections exacerbated by H1N1, as well as other viral and bacterial infections. The Indian Express report quotes Dr Vikas Maurya, the head of the Pulmonology Department at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, explaining that hospitalization due to chest infections is not a cause for alarm and is primarily observed in elderly patients with pre-existing comorbid conditions that were intensified by H1N1, Covid, and other bacterial infections.

parents say gap in health system means they have ‘nowhere to go’By Jaime LythMultimedia Journalist·NZ Herald·19 Jan, 2024 04:00 PM6 mins to readSaveShareShare this articleCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitter/XLinkedInReddit10-year-old Tadhg Devine-Giles has gone from a thriving young boy to non-verbal and often agitated after a brain injury from 70-minute seizure brought on by influenza. Video / NZ HeraldTadhg loves rugby, sings in a choir and is the captain of his school’s kapa haka team. But since September, the 10-year-old has been a “completely different boy” after a 70-minute seizure brought on by influenza A. His parents say their son was going to be pushed out of rehab and hospital facilities, leaving them with nowhere to go. Reporter Jaime Lyth spoke with the parents about what they think is a “gap” in New Zealand’s health system.“We cannot realistically do this on our own,” mother Laura Devine-Giles says.Christchurch parents Laura Devine-Giles and Greg Giles have two children, 10-year-old Tadhg and 2-year-old Teagan.But since Tadhg’s brain injury, the two formerly close siblings are living separately and have barely been in the same room together because it’s no longer safe.He has gone from a confident boy writing speeches about rugby, to non-verbal and agitated, Devine-Giles says, with bruises on her body to prove it.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Tadhg caught viral encephalitis from influenza A last year, and disaster struck in September when Tadhg had a 70-minute seizure, aspirated and was put on a ventilator.He was rushed to ICU and then the children’s ward at Christchurch Hospital, and was transferred to Auckland in November.“Though he has come some way and we are so grateful every day that he’s still with us, so much has changed.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Our clever, chatty, silly, singing and fun-loving boy no longer speaks and is cognitively impaired.”Tadhg's parents Laura Devine-Giles and Greg Giles say their son was going to be pushed out of rehab and hospital facilities, leaving them with nowhere to go. Photo / Dean PurcellHis brain injury has left him with memory loss, psychosis, catatonic episodes and altered mental status, his parents said.“He is now so cognitively impaired he doesn’t comprehend very much.”His personality has changed, he gets startled by certain noises and drops to the floor. He picks up any object in sight so any space needs to be cleared.“He doesn’t sit still, constantly feeling out in his environment, wandering around aimless, in his own head, in circles around the room but checking in with us as he passes.”He needs assistance with all activities of daily living including toileting and eating. He has no safety awareness, hurting himself and others often.“Tadhg needs constant supervision and support.“He is like a toddler in many ways but can pull heavy furniture and items around.”Since being in Auckland, Tadhg has had no outings or left the children’s rehabilitation facility at the Wilson Centre in Takapuna other than to go to Starship in an ambulance.Starship Hospital has advised that Tadhg is not acute, and the hospital environment is not suitable to keep Tadhg.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Greg and Laura are in parent accommodation at the Wilson Centre, while Teagan is cared for by nannies at a rental home throughout the day.But, three weeks into what they thought would be a three-month stay, the family were told that the centre was not the right fit, Tadhg was not yet cognitive for rehabilitation, and he was a safety risk.The centre sought to discharge him, but Devine-Giles said, “eventually, they had to take us back because we had nowhere to go”.10-year-old Tadhg Devine-Giles has suffered major cognitive issues after a 70-minute seizure brought on by influenza. “Because this is an acquired brain injury [from illness], there’s no support from ACC.“We are in a horrendous situation with a gap in the New Zealand medical system to support our child,” Devine-Giles said.Greg has had to return to work remotely so the family can continue paying their mortgage in Christchurch, rent in Auckland, and cover carers for Teagan and Tadhg.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“We are at a loss as to what to do and what steps to take next.“We’ve got nowhere to go.”The family is desperately reviewing options for what private care they can get for their boy or a purpose-built home that will keep their children safe.Moving back home would require sedation for Tadhg and an emergency medical flight.Then the family would have to completely modify and redesign their home, which they cannot afford.“If we do go back to Christchurch, there’s no facility, we have to take him home to an environment we will find unliveable, and our daughter’s safety is a massive issue.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Tadhg is on risperidone, lorazepam, epilim, fluoxetine, olanzapine, melatonin to sleep and pamol throughout the day to help with migraines.“There is progress but at the moment it’s mostly movement-related progress, cognition may return but how much we don’t know.“We are told there is no certainty of a full recovery. We are trying to remain hopeful but we know the journey ahead is a long one, likely years.”The family has a Givealittle page for people who can offer support.10-year-old Tadhg Devine-Giles has suffered major cognitive issues after a 70-minute seizure brought on by influenza.

In a judgment handed down today, a group of NFU members has won a landmark legal challenge against the Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) in a battle over the proper compensation payable to poultry farmers affected by Avian Influenza (AI). The members, supported by the NFU, argued that APHA had wrongly interpreted the law underpinning its compensation scheme and failed to properly compensate affected farmers for birds which were healthy at the point at which it decided they should be culled. Today’s ruling confirms the NFU’s long-held view that the government has been applying an unlawful policy to the calculation of compensation for farmers affected by AI and that the right to compensation for healthy birds affected by AI accrues at the point at which APHA decides that the birds should be culled, and not at the later point of culling. Due to delays by APHA between condemnation and culling, many healthy birds became affected by AI in the interim period, leading to substantial losses for producers under APHA’s unlawful compensation regime. NFU President Minette Batters said: “Today’s High Court judgment is a tremendous result for the members who brought the legal challenge, as well as the NFU and its wider membership. AI is a truly devasting disease; so many farmers have suffered and are still enduring the aftereffects of the catastrophic outbreaks witnessed since 2021. The High Court has made clear that APHA’s AI compensation policy is unlawful, and we now look to government to rectify this wrong and to pay farmers the compensation to which they are lawfully entitled.” NFU poultry board chair James Mottershead said: “This is a hugely significant judgment for poultry farmers, providing important clarity on the interpretation of the AI compensation regime. On behalf of the poultry sector, I would like to express my gratitude to the NFU members who have fought this challenge from the outset right up until today’s fantastic judgment, and it’s great to see the power of what the NFU can do for its members. The government’s flawed approach to calculating AI compensation over recent years must be swiftly corrected as a result of this ruling.” NFU legal board chair Nick Hamer said: “This is an incredible result for the members involved in this case, along with the NFU and the wider poultry sector. The NFU’s Legal Assistance Scheme has provided significant financial support to the members bringing the claim. I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and expertise of the NFU’s poultry team and in-house legal department along with the fantastic support provided by NFU Panel Firm Jacksons Law Firm and legal Counsel Malcolm Birdling and Jagoda Klimowicz. This highlights once again the huge value of the NFU and the NFU’s LAS in supporting our members.” Read the judgment from the High Court here.

As per the agency's statistics, 154 cases of influenza have been detected in Maldives within the past four months. The most commonly detected variant in the country is H1N1. IGMH Internal Medicine Consultant Dr Mohamed Ali recently posted on social media X that three patients with pneumonia as a result of contracting influenza are currently on ventilator support at the hospital. HPA believes that the cause of the increase in the spread of influenza is the large number of persons who have travelled abroad during December's school holidays, noting that Covid and influenza cases are on the rise even in other countries in the region. Symptoms of Influenza - fever - runny nose - fatigue - headaches, body aches, throat pain - coughing Doctors advise seeking medical attention at the earliest should these symptoms persist for three days. Influenza vaccine provides protection from flu, pneumonia, heart issues, as well as ear and sinus infections. The vaccine can be administered in two doses to those under the age of nine, and one dose to those older. What can you do to prevent influenza? - frequently wash your hands with soap - limit exposure to crowds - get influenza vaccine shots Influenza is most commonly transmitted one day after getting infected, and between the fifth and seventh day. However, chances of contracting influenza from children and immunity compromised persons are higher.

Dr. Ali shared on Facebook that influenza has been spreading over the past two to three weeks, leading to three patients needing ventilator assistance due to pneumonia. Unfortunately, one youth has succumbed to the disease in the last month. While the likelihood of a widespread outbreak is low, Dr. Mohamed Ali emphasizes the importance of influenza vaccination to curb its escalation. The doctor said that he hopes for a time when seasonal vaccines will be accessible to the public through the Aasandha scheme, providing protection against flu, pneumonia, heart problems, as well as ear and sinus infections. Dr. Ali recommends two doses of the vaccine for children under nine years of age and a single dose for those older.
