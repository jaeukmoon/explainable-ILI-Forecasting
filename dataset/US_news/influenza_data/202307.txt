The current avian influenza situation has been raising concerns within the international community. Since October 2021, an unprecedented number of outbreaks has been reported in several regions of the world, reaching new geographical areas and causing devastating impacts on animal health and welfare. The disease puts at risk global food security and the livelihoods of those who depend on poultry farming. It has also led to an alarming rate of wild bird die-offs and has affected other wildlife including sea and land mammals. While it primarily affects poultry and wild birds, avian influenza can occasionally be transmitted to mammals, including humans. A rising number of H5N1 avian influenza cases has been reported in several mammalian animals both terrestrial and aquatic, causing morbidity and mortality. This sparks growing concern about the threat for the health of domestic and wild animals, biodiversity, and potentially for public health. The current situation highlights the risk that H5N1 avian influenza may become better adapted to mammals, and spill over to humans and other animals. In addition, some mammals, such as mink, may act as mixing vessels for different influenza viruses, leading to the emergence of new strains and subtypes that could be more harmful to animals and/or humans. Recently reported infections in farmed mink are a concern because infections of large numbers of mammals kept in close proximity of each other exacerbate this risk. Several studies are currently on-going to further explore the virulence and transmissibility (including between mammals) of these viruses. In collaboration with its network of experts, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) is closely monitoring the situation to assess the risks to animals and humans. WOAH calls on its Members to: Maintain enhanced disease SURVEILLANCE in domestic and wild birds.PREVENT the spread of the disease by implementing strict biosecurity measures in poultry holdings. In particular, step up the biosecurity around mink farms to avoid the introduction of the virus.CONTROL movements of susceptible domestic animals and their products to avoid disease spread.PROTECT humans in close contact with, or handling poultry or sick domestic or wild animals. Exposed humans should always take precautionary measures, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly when investigating die-offs or outbreaks.MONITOR susceptible domestic and wild animals. Investigate any unusual increase of mortality events in wild animals (die-offs).REPORT cases of avian influenza in all species to WOAH through WAHIS and in accordance with international standards. Timely and transparent reporting is key to maintain a good knowledge of the disease situation and to prevent any type of misinformation or disinformation.SHARE genetic sequences of avian influenza viruses in publicly available databases. WOAH is fully committed to supporting its Members mitigate risks against the impact of avian influenza and will continue to engage with its networks of experts as well as public and private partners, notably through the One Health Quadripartite Alliance and the Global Framework for transboundary animal diseases (GF-TADs) to provide technical updates as more information becomes available.

We investigated the efficacy of heterologous prime boost immunization with chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx2) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccines, expressing conserved influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 1 (M1) and neuraminidase (NA) in H1N1pdm09 pre-exposed pigs. We compared the efficacy of intra-nasal, aerosol and intra-muscular vaccine delivery against H3N2 influenza challenge. Aerosol prime boost immunization induced strong local lung T cell and antibody responses and abrogated viral shedding and lung pathology following H3N2 challenge. In contrast, intramuscular immunization induced powerful systemic responses and weak local lung responses but also abolished lung pathology and reduced viral shedding. These results provide valuable insights into the development of a broadly protective influenza vaccine in a highly relevant large animal model and will inform future vaccine and clinical trial design.

Current seasonal influenza vaccines primarily induce antibody responses to the major envelope glycoprotein haemagglutinin (HA), are strain specific and do not protect well against antigenically distinct viruses from the same HA subtype nor against infection with heterologous influenza viruses from different HA lineages. A broadly protective influenza A vaccine (BPIV) would be a significant advance in preventing seasonal infection and reducing mortality from pandemic influenza.Although most influenza vaccines are administered parenterally to adults, the intranasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) shows high efficacy in children suggesting that both systemic and local respiratory immunity play roles in protection1,2. Inhaled aerosol delivery methods have been explored to administer measles, tuberculosis, papilloma virus vaccines, and recently, the safety and immunogenicity of intranasal and aerosolized vaccines has been investigated in pre-clinical and clinical studies for SARS-CoV-23,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Comparison of aerosol, intranasal and parenteral delivery of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine in rhesus macaques indicated that each route generated distinct cellular and humoral responses and suggested that small droplet aerosol delivery offered immunological advantages over other respiratory routes12.In addition, when considering immunization against influenza, it is important to take into account that pre-existing immune memory can significantly impact subsequent influenza infection and vaccine efficacy13,14. Cross-reactive immunity acquired by prior seasonal influenza infections is principally due to T cell responses to conserved internal antigens NP and M1 and antibodies to conserved epitopes of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are likely to play a role15,16,17,18,19. Approaches toward development of BPIV have therefore focussed on either eliciting antibodies against the conserved regions of HA and NA or stimulating T cells against the internal NP and M1 proteins of the virus20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29. We have previously evaluated the efficacy of a single cycle replication BPIV candidate, S-FLU, in pigs30,31. These studies have shown that vaccine efficacy in pigs differed from that in small animals (ferrets and mice), suggesting that vaccines should be tested in more than one animal model30. Pigs are immunologically, physiologically and anatomically more like humans than small laboratory animals and have a comparable distribution of sialic acid receptors in the respiratory tract. Pigs exhibit comparable clinical manifestations and pathogenesis when infected with most human seasonal influenza A viruses, making them an excellent model to study immunity to influenza32,33.Because pigs are susceptible to the influenza A viruses that infect humans, we have developed an H1N1pdm09 (pH1N1) 1A.3.3.2 virus pre-exposure model to test the immunogenicity of a ChAdOx2 viral vectored vaccine, expressing influenza nucleoprotein, matrix protein 1 from pH1N1 and neuraminidase NA2 from A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017, H3N2 (ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2)34. We have shown that previous influenza virus pH1N1 infection in pigs does not prevent induction of immune responses following immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA234. We have also evaluated the importance of route of administration by comparing intra-nasal, aerosol and intra-muscular immunization. In these studies, aerosol delivery boosted the local lung T cell and antibody responses, while intra-muscular immunization boosted peripheral blood immunity34. However, protective efficacy was not evaluated and therefore in the present study we assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of prime boost with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 administered by the intra-muscular, intra-nasal or aerosol routes in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs against H3N2 challenge.ResultsExperimental design and antibody responses following prime boost immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigsTwenty pigs were infected intranasally with 3 × 106 PFU of A/swine/England/1353/2009 (pH1N1). All pigs were successfully infected and shed virus as determined by plaque assays of daily nasal swabs in the first 6 days following pH1N1 inoculation34. Four weeks after the pH1N1 inoculation, the pigs were randomly divided into four groups of five animals and were immunized with 5 × 108 IU ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 intramuscularly (IM), intranasally (IN) or by aerosol (AE) as previously described34. IN delivery was performed with a mucosal atomization device (MAD) generating droplets of ~ 80 to 100 µM diameter delivered in 300 µl volume to restrict the vaccine deposition to the upper respiratory tract. AE delivery by vibrating mesh nebulizer generated droplets of ~ 4.5 µm diameter capable of reaching the entire respiratory tract35. Four weeks after the ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 immunization the pigs were boosted by the same delivery route with 1.5 × 108 PFU MVA-NPM1-NA2. Unimmunized, but pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs were used as controls (C). The animals were culled four weeks after the boost, and immune responses were evaluated in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), spleen and blood (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: Experimental design and antibody responses.Twenty pigs were infected with pH1N1 and four weeks later were immunized with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 intramuscularly (IM), intranasally (IN) or by aerosol (AE). Four weeks later they were boosted with MVA-NPM1-NA2 and after further four weeks were culled. Weekly blood samples were collected. Control (C) animals were infected but not immunized (a). pH1N1 (b), H3N2 (c) and NA2 (d) specific IgG responses in serum were determined by ELISA at the indicated time points. pH1N1 (e), H3N2 (f) and NA2 (g) specific IgG and pH1N1 (h) and H3N2 (i) IgA responses in BAL, were determined by ELISA four weeks after the second immunization. The mean and standard error (SEM) is presented in each time point (b–d). The arrows below D0, D28 and D56 indicate the time of pH1N1 challenge and immunizations with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2. Significant differences are listed in Table 1. The top of each bar indicates the mean and the line the standard error mean (SEM) (e–i). Each symbol (circle, square and triangles) represents one animal. Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05) and were analyzed either by one-way (h, i) or two-way (b–d) ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed or with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (e–g).Full size imageCirculating antibody responses were measured by ELISA throughout the study, and in BAL at day 83 which is 27 days after final vaccination (Fig. 1b–i). Virus-specific IgG in serum was assayed against live MDCK cells grown pH1N1 and A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (H3N2) viruses and recombinant NA protein from H3N2 (NA2) (Fig. 1b–d). The IM immunized animals had a significantly higher pH1N1 IgG titer after ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 administration (D35 to D49) compared to the other groups. The pH1N1 IgG response decreased 4 weeks post immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 but was boosted by MVA-NPM1-NA2 and remained significantly higher compared to all other groups until D63 and D77, although not reaching the titer after the first immunization (Fig. 1b, Table 1). The second highest serum response was in the AE group on D49 (1:61,440), significantly higher compared to IN and C groups (Table 1). H1N1 neutralization titers were induced by the pH1N1 infection but not boosted by ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 as previously demonstrated34.Table 1 Significant differences between the four groups at the same time-point after immunization.Full size tableAlthough serum H3N2 IgG responses were highest in the IM and AE groups, these were not significantly different from IN and C groups following the first immunization (Fig. 1c). However, a week after boosting with MVA-NPM1-NA2 (D63) the IM group had a significantly higher response (1:36,864) in comparison to the other groups, which declined over time but remained significantly different from IN and C at D70 and D77 (Table 1). IM immunization significantly boosted IgG responses to recombinant NA2 protein on D49 compared to IN and C groups (Table 1). The NA2 response peaked a week after the MVA boost (D63), remained high until D70 (1:114,688) and declined from D77 onwards and was still significantly higher than the C group at D83 (Table 1). The IgG NA2 specific response was also increased in the AE group compared to C. No significant differences were observed in serum pH1N1 and H3N2 specific IgA responses between the groups (data not shown). Intranasal immunization did not boost significantly pH1N1, H3N2 or NA2 specific serum responses. There was no increase in pH1N1 neutralizing activity in the sera of any of the immunized groups compared to controls, suggesting that the vaccines did not boost the response to either H1 or N1, as these are the targets for neutralization. We were unable to detect neutralizing activity against H3N2 in serum from the ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA NPM1-NA2 pigs immunized by any route.No significant differences of pH1N1 specific IgG and IgA responses were observed in BAL at D83 between groups (Fig. 1e–i). In contrast AE immunization induced a significantly greater H3N2 specific IgG response in BAL compared to IN and C groups (Fig. 1f) and a trend for higher H3N2 IgA (Fig. 1i, p = 0.09, one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test).In summary, after pH1N1 pre-exposure, IM prime boost immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 induced high serum IgG titers against both pH1N1 and H3N2, while AE delivery induced high anti-H3N2 IgG and IgA titers in BAL in agreement with our previous study with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA234.Cytokine responses following prime boost immunization in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigsIFNγ ELISpot analysis was performed to quantify IFNγ producing cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, Fig. 2), BAL (Fig. 3a–e) and spleen (Fig. 3f–j) following stimulation with either pH1N1 and H3N2 live viruses or with pool of overlapping peptides covering the NP, M1 and NA2 proteins included in the vaccine (Figs. 2 and 3). IM immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 significantly increased the NP-specific response in PBMC after D42 and M1, pH1N1 and H3N2 responses on D49 (Fig. 2a, c, d, e). IM boost with MVA-NPM1-NA2, induced the greatest response to NP, M1 and NA2 which remained higher compared to the other groups until the end of the study D83. Significant differences in response between groups were reached at different time points after prime boost immunizations as indicated in Fig. 2.Fig. 2: IFNγ ELISpot responses in PBMC.IFNγ secreting spot forming cells (SFC) were enumerated following stimulation with a pool of peptides covering NP (a), NA2 (b) and M1 (c) proteins or pH1N1 (d) and H3N2 (e) viruses. The arrows below D28 and D56 indicate the immunizations with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2. Each symbol represents an individual animal, the top of the bar the mean and the line the standard error (SEM). Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test.Full size imageFig. 3: IFNγ ELISpot responses in BAL and spleen.IFNγ secreting spot forming cells (SFC) were enumerated in BAL (a–e) and spleen (f–j) on D83. Cells were stimulated with a pool of peptides covering NP (a, f), NA2 (b, g) and M1 (c) proteins or pH1N1 (d, i) and H3N2 (e, j) viruses. Each symbol represents an individual animal, the top of the bar the mean and the line the standard error (SEM). Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001) and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed (a–c, f, h, i) or with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (d, e, g, j).Full size imageAs with the antibody responses, cellular responses in the BAL were highest following AE immunization (Fig. 3a–e). AE induced the highest responses to NP, M1 and H3N2 stimulation and the response to pH1N1 was higher than any other although not significantly different (p = 0.056 relative to the control group, Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). The IFNγ ELISpot responses in the spleen (Fig. 3f–j) did not reveal significant differences between the groups, although a trend was observed to M1 stimulation (only 3 spleen samples were available for the IM group) (Fig. 3h).T cell responses were also analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in BAL (Fig. 4). IFNγ, TNF, IL-2 and IFN/TNF production by CD4 and CD8β T cells was measured following pH1N1, H3N2, NP and M1 stimulation (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). AE immunization was the only regimen that induced statistically higher responses compared to the other groups. AE immunization induced the highest IFNγ and TNF producing H3N2 and NP-specific CD4 cells in BAL (Fig. 4b, d). The CD8β T cells exhibited the highest IFNγ production to all stimuli with NP specific CD8β T cells having the highest frequencies of IFNγ (17.48%) and TNF (18.91%). AE immunization also induced the highest M1 and NP-specific TNF CD8β producing T cells (Fig. 4g, h) and NP-specific IFNγ/TNF co-producing CD4 and CD8β T cells (Fig. 4i, j). IL-2 frequencies were lower and did not show any differences between the groups.Fig. 4: T cell cytokine responses in BAL.BAL was collected four weeks after the MVA-NPM1-NA2 immunization. Cryopreserved cells from D83 were thawed, stimulated with pH1N1, H3N2, NP or M1 and IFNγ, IL-2, TNF and IFNγTNF cytokine secretion was measured in CD4 (a–d, i) and CD8 (e–h, j). T cells by intracellular cytokine staining. Each symbol represents an individual animal, the top of the bar the mean and the line the standard error (SEM). Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test were used to compare responses between groups and asterisks indicate significant differences (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).Full size imageThese data indicate that IM prime boost immunization induced a strong antibody and cellular IFNγ response in PBMC, while AE induced the highest antibody and T-cell responses in the BAL with very high frequency of cytokine producing CD8 T cells.Efficacy of prime boost immunization in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs against H3N2 challengeFollowing the immunogenicity study showing high systemic and local immune responses after different routes of prime and boost with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 in pH1N1 pre-exposed animals, we next investigated the efficacy of these immunization regimens in protecting against H3N2 influenza infection (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Twenty-four animals were inoculated with 3 × 106 PFU pH1N1 and as with previous studies, virus shedding was detected in nasal swabs taken daily for the first 6 days to confirm the successful infection of all animals (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Four weeks later the pigs were randomly divided into four groups of six animals and immunized either IM, IN or by AE with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 4 weeks apart as described above. Four weeks after the MVA-NPM1-NA2 boost, all animals were infected intranasally with 9 × 107 pfu of A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (H3N2). Animals were humanely euthanized four days later. This time point was chosen as it allows four days for monitoring virus shedding in daily nasal swabs, there is still significant viral load in the lungs and BAL and lung pathology is well developed30,31,36. Three animals reached their humane end point before the completion of the study due to bacterial infection unrelated to the procedures. Thus, the IN and C groups contained only four and five animals, respectively.Representative lung gross pathology, histopathology (submacro- and microscopic) and immunohistochemical NP staining are shown (Fig. 5a). Gross pathology was observed as areas of consolidation in the cranial and medial lobes. The unimmunized group (C) had a significantly higher gross pathology score in comparison to the IM and AE, but not the IN group. Histopathological analysis showed areas of bronchopneumonia characterized by the obliteration of the normal airway structures with inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar exudation, and bronchiolar and broncho-interstitial pneumonia with necrosis of epithelial cells and inflammatory infiltrates in the airways and parenchyma present in the C and IN groups, while the IM and AE groups did not show histopathological lesions. Labeling of influenza NP by immunohistochemistry (NP-IHC) was seen within the epithelial cells and exudates and occasionally within the parenchyma of unimmunized and intranasally immunized animals. NP labeling was not detected in the IM group and was only detected in one animal of the AE group (Fig. 5b).Fig. 5: Lung pathology and viral load following re-challenge with H3N2.Representative lung gross pathology, histopathology (submacroscopic and microscopic) and immunohistochemical NP staining of each group. Gross pathology is observed as areas of consolidation (arrows). At submicroscopic histopathology, areas of bronchopneumonia are characterized by the obliteration of the normal airway structures, with inflammatory cell infiltration (*), that can be observed at microscopic level as bronchiolo- and broncho-interstitial pneumonia with necrosis of epithelial cells and inflammatory infiltrates in the airways and parenchyma (*). Virus NP is detected by IHC (brown stain, arrows) within the bronchiolar wall and luminae and occasionally within the parenchyma (a). Gross (top graphs) and histopathology scores are shown, including the percentage of lung surface with lesions, lesion scores and histopathology scores (b). Virus load was determined by plaque assay in daily nasal swabs (c) post H3N2 infection (D1-D4), in the BAL (d) and lung (e) 4 days post infection (D87). The top of each bar indicates the mean and the line the SEM. Each symbol (circle, square and triangles) represents one animal.

Bar = 100 micrometers.Full size imageThe IM and AE groups showed the greatest reduction in virus shedding in daily nasal swabs, while the IN and C groups shed virus consistently until day 3 and 4 respectively (Fig. 5c). One animal in the AE group showed a low titer of virus at day 1 only and one animal from the IM group a low titer on 1- and 3-days post infection (dpi). No virus was detected in the BAL and lung of the AE immunized animals at 4 dpi, while in the IM and IN groups one animal had low levels of virus in BAL and one from the IN group in lung at 4 dpi (Fig. 5d, e). There was reduced pathology and virus load in the IN group, but the only parameter that differed significantly from the controls was virus load in BAL at 4 dpi.These results indicate that IM and AE immunization abolished lung pathology and were highly efficient in controlling virus shedding and viral load in lung.Immune responses after H3N2 challengeIM immunization induced the highest IgG response to pH1N1, H3N2 and NA2 in serum in agreement with the first immunogenicity study described above (Fig. 6a–c and Table 1). Four days following H3N2 infection (D87), serum H3N2 specific IgG titers increased in all groups with IM having the greatest titer compared to C group. AE immunization induced the highest pH1N1 and H3N2 specific IgG and IgA in BAL 4 days post H3N2 infection (D87) (Fig. 6d–g).Fig. 6: Systemic and mucosal antibody responses.pH1N1 (a), H3N2 (b) and NA2 (c) specific IgG responses in serum were determined by ELISA at the indicated time points. pH1N1 (d) and H3N2 (e) IgG and H1N1 (f) and H3N2 (g) IgA responses in BAL, were determined by ELISA 4 days after the H3N2 challenge. The mean and standard error (SEM) is presented in each time point (a–c). Significant statistical differences are listed in Table 1. The top of each bar indicates the mean and the line the SEM. Each symbol (circle, square and triangles) represents one animal (d–g). Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) and were analyzed either by one-way (g) or two-way (a–c) ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed or with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (d–f).Full size imageThe cellular immune responses in PBMC and BAL were measured by IFNγ ELISpot (Fig. 7). The IM immunized group had the highest number of NP-, NA2- and M1- specific IFNγ producing cells in PBMC (Fig. 7a–c). The IFNγ responses in BAL did not differ between the groups four days after H3N2 infection, except for the response to pH1N1 in the AE group (Fig. 7i). Similarly, the highest antigen specific CD8 responses in the BAL were detected in the AE group by intracytoplasmic staining (Supplementary Fig. 3). The very low cytokine responses after H3N2 challenge compared to the responses before challenge (albeit in a different experiment) might be due to activation induced cell death of cells which have been previously activated in vivo by the challenge H3N2 virus. There was no obvious influx of memory/effectors cells from the systemic circulation to the BAL in the IM group.Fig. 7: IFNγ ELISpot responses in PBMC and BAL.IFNγ secreting spot forming cells (SFC) were enumerated in PBMC (a–e) and BAL (f–j) on D87. Cells were stimulated with a pool of peptides covering NP (a, f), NA2 (b, g) and M1 (c, h) proteins or pH1N1 (d, i) and H3N2 (e, j) viruses. Each symbol represents an individual animal, the top of the bar the mean and the line the standard error (SEM). Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 ****p < 0.0001) and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed (a, b, c, e) or with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (d, f–j).Full size imageTaken together, these data indicate that the IM immunization elicited high Ab and T-cell responses in the periphery, while AE immunization induced high responses in the BAL and this difference was maintained after the H3N2 challenge.DiscussionCross protective T cell immune responses against conserved internal influenza A virus antigens such as NP and M1, have been associated with reduced virus shedding and limited severity of disease following influenza infection in humans16,17,18,19. This evidence, combined with a long history of animal studies demonstrating the protective effect of T cells induced by influenza virus infection, is the rationale for developing a BPIV that induces a strong T cell response against conserved internal antigens37. More recently, antibody responses to NA were also shown to provide broader protection29,38. Since almost all human influenza immunizations are given to influenza-exposed rather than influenza-naïve humans, to model this we exposed pigs to pH1N1 prior to vaccination rather than immunizing influenza-naïve pigs. We demonstrate that following pH1N1 exposure, intramuscular or aerosol prime boost regimens with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA NPM1-NA2, significantly reduced lung pathology, virus shedding and lung viral load after H3N2 influenza challenge. In contrast intranasal immunization, restricted to the upper respiratory tract, had a very limited effect on virus load and pathology in this model.We have demonstrated in young and adult humans that a two dose IM heterologous prime boost regimen with ChAdOx1 NP + M1 and MVA-NP + M1 given either 8 or 52 weeks apart, significantly increased the proportion of cross-reactive T cells and maintained them at high frequencies for 18 months after immunization21. We further showed that inclusion of a third antigen, the HA, in ChAdOx-NPM1-HA and MVA-NPM1-HA significantly reduced virus shedding in pigs after prime boost vaccination against homologous H1N1pdm09 virus challenge39. Here we show that inclusion of the NA, in ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 and MVA NPM1-NA2 induced powerful T cell and antibody responses in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs and protected them against H3N2 challenge.The intramuscular and aerosol prime boost immunizations with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2/ MVA-NPM1-NA2 generated distinct cellular and humoral responses. Local T and antibody lung responses were only observed after aerosol delivery targeting the lower and upper respiratory tract. In contrast, intramuscular administration boosted T cell and antibody responses in blood but had a weak effect on the lung mucosal response measured in BAL after pH1N1 pre-exposure. As the vaccines contain three immunogens, NP, M1 and the NA envelope antigen it is difficult to dissect the contribution of each antigen or arm of the immune response to protection. Furthermore, this may differ according to the route of immunization. In the IM group the most likely mechanism of protection may be the high titre of anti-NA2 antibodies especially as the immunizing NA is matched to the challenge H3N2 virus. Although we could not detect neutralizing activity in the sera of these pigs, other Fc mediated mechanisms may contribute to the killing of infected cells40. The IM regimen also induced a very strong systemic T cell response; however, we have no evidence for recruitment of these cells to the site of infection in the respiratory tract, which may reflect the sensitivity of the assay used or that there is a real difference in the effects of these immunization regimes.In contrast, AE immunization induced detectable IgG and IgA antibody against H3N2 in the BAL. The serum anti-NA2 titers was lower compared to the IM group, but still significantly higher compared to the control. There was a much stronger local BAL T cell response in the AE group. We speculate that both T-cell and antibody responses may contribute to the protection seen in this group. Aerosol immunization with another T cell candidate vaccine, S-FLU, which contains all viral proteins induced a powerful T cell response (but not neutralizing antibody response) and reduced pathology, but did not prevent virus replication or shedding, although in these experiments, there was no pH1N1 pre-exposure30,36. We speculate that T-cell responses can reduce pathology in severe disease, but combined T-cell and antibody responses are required to prevent pathology and virus shedding, which will also prevent onward transmission39,41. It should also be noted that AE immunization delivers only a third of the dose so that this route appears to be extremely efficient in inducing immune responses9,35.A limitation of this study is that we have not demonstrated broad immunity because the challenge virus was matched to the NA in the vaccine. That question could be addressed by challenging with a virus with a different NA sequence. However NA exhibits a slower drift that is discordant with that of HA and antibody responses against NA typically show broader cross-reactivity42,43,44. Further studies with vaccines containing only NPM1 or NA2 will allow us to determine whether antibodies against viral envelope proteins are essential for prevention of virus shedding and whether mismatch of immunizing and challenge NA reduces protection in pigs as has been demonstrated in small animals29,41,45. These experiments will also reveal whether T cells directed solely against internal proteins are sufficient to reduce pathology and severe disease in a large natural host animal. In addition, further studies should investigate whether the more clinically deployable regimens of priming and boosting with the same viral vector or using a single immunization with ChAdOx2 provides similar protection. A final crucial issue is the duration of protection, whether antibody or T cell mediated. Even if protection is relatively short lived, a BPIV will be highly advantageous because it could be used without changing it annually or in the face of a pandemic. Lessons learned from these influenza studies may be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.MethodsChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 viral vectored vaccinesChAdOx2 is a replication deficient (E1 and E3 deleted) simian adenovirus46, which was engineered to express swine Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 1 (M1) as a fusion protein (NPM1) and NA2 separated from NPM1 by a 2A ribosome skipping sequence. The NP and M1 protein ORFs were derived from A/swine/England/1353/2009 (GenBank accession number KR701098 and KR701100). The neuraminidase (NA2) is from H3N2 strain A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (GenBank accession number MF801571)34. MVA is a replication incompetent poxvirus vector engineered to express the same NPM1 fusion protein under the control of the F11 promoter and the same NA2 under the control of the modified H5 promoter47.Immunization and challenge animal studiesAnimal studies were approved by the ethical review processes at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Pirbright Institute (study numbers PP9878849-2-001 and P47CE0FF2-1-015) in accordance with the UK Government Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.For the immunogenicity study, twenty 6-week-old female Landrace x Large White pigs were obtained from a commercial high-health status herd (average weight of 9.6 kg at the beginning of the study). Pigs were screened for the absence of influenza A virus antibody reactivity by HAI with four swine Influenza A virus antigens from H1N1pdm09, H1N2, H3N2 and avian-like H1N1 lineages and serum IgG titres against pH1N1 and H3N2 were assayed by ELISA. All pigs were inoculated intranasally with 3 × 106 PFU of A/swine/England/1353/2009 (pH1N1) MDCK grown virus in a total of 4 ml (2 ml per nostril) using a mucosal atomization device (MAD, Wolfe-Tory Medical) (Fig. 1a). The inoculation dose for pH1N1 was in agreement with previous studies, resulting in consistent reproducible infection, virus shedding, lung vial load and lung pathology34,36,48. Following pH1N1 challenge, daily nasal swabs were collected for 7 days to assess virus load by plaque assays and blood samples were collected weekly for PBMC isolation, as previously described30. Briefly, the nasal swabs were collected in 2 ml of virus transport medium, containing tissue culture medium 199 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No: M0650) and supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 0.035% sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% BSA, penicillin, streptomycin, and nystatin. For the viral titration with plaque assays on MDCK cells, the nasal swabs samples were 10-fold serially diluted in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco™) and 200 µl were overlayered on confluent MDCK cells in 12-well tissue culture plates. One hour later the plates were washed and 1 ml of % agarose/medium (1:3) was added. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 the plaques were visualized using 0.1% crystal violet. For the PBMC isolation blood was first 1:1 diluted in PBS and then subjected to a 30 min at 920 × g centrifugation on density gradient medium (Biolegend). PBMCs were then harvested, washed twice with PBS and once with culture media and then were cryopreserved in FCS with 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D2650). Four weeks post pH1N1 infection, the animals were randomly assigned tο four groups and immunized with 5 × 108 infectious units (IU) ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 as follows: 1) intramuscularly (IM) with 1 ml administered in each trapezius muscle behind the ear); 2) intranasally (IN) with 300 µl per nostril administered with a MAD, with the aim of restricting the vaccine to the upper respiratory tract;34,35 3) aerosol (AE) with 1 ml administered over 2–5 min using an Aerogen Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen, Dangan, Galway, Ireland), and 4) unimmunized controls. The animals in the IN and AE groups were anaesthetized prior to immunization with a mixture of 5 mg/kg Zoletil (2.5 mg/kg of Tiletamine + 2.5 mg/kg of Zolazepam) and 0.05 mg/kg Domitor (medetomidine). After four weeks, the animals were boosted with 1.5 × 108 PFU of MVA-NPM1-NA2 by the same immunization route as they were primed. Four weeks later the animals were humanely killed and blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung and spleen were collected.For the efficacy study twenty-four 6-weeks old female influenza virus free pigs were used (average weight 9.6 kg) and inoculated intranasally with 3 × 106 PFU pH1N1 as above (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Four weeks later the animals were randomly divided into groups and primed with 5 × 108 IU ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 either IM, IN or AE. The animals were boosted 4 weeks later with 1.5 × 108 PFU of MVA-NPM1-NA2 using the same immunization route. Two pigs assigned to the IN and C group, reached their humane endpoints 14 days post pH1N1 inoculation, which was 2 weeks prior to the first immunization, due to osteomyelitis of bacterial origin. A third pig was euthanized 2 days after ChAdOx2 IN immunization, because of bacterial polyserositis, unrelated to the vaccination. Thus, the IN and C groups were left with four and five animals, respectively. Although we were not able to identify the aetiology of the intercurrent infection that caused the 3 pigs to reach their human endpoints, as a precaution we administered a single dose of 20 mg/kg Engemycin 10% (oxytetracycline) to all pigs.Four weeks after the boost with MVA-NPM1-NA, all animals were intranasally infected with 9 × 107 pfu of A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (H3N2) MDCK grown virus by administration of 2 ml to each nostril using a MAD300 device. The H3N2 inoculation dose was chosen based on pilot studies and was also higher because the pigs were older and heavier by that time (average weight 66.7 kg). Pigs were culled four days later for assessment of pathology, virus load and immune responses. For logistical reasons, two H3N2 challenges were performed, with half of the animals challenged at 28 days post boost and the remainder at 30 days post boost. As the analysis of samples from pigs challenged at days 28 and 30 did not show any significant differences, for simplicity in presentation, the results of the assays carried out on pigs challenged on both days have been amalgamated in all figures. At postmortem blood, BAL and lung were collected and processed as described before30,31. Daily nasal swabs were collected after the H3N2 challenge for assessment of virus shedding by plaque assays, as described above. Viral load was also assessed in BAL and lung by plaque assays post H3N2 infection30,31.Lung pathology and immunohistochemistryGross and histopathological analyses were performed as previously described36. Briefly, the lungs were removed, and digital photographs were taken of the dorsal and ventral aspects. Macroscopic pathology was scored blind as previously reported49. The percentage of the lung displaying gross lesions for each animal was calculated using image analysis software (Nikon NIS-Ar) on the digital photographs. Lung tissue samples from cranial, middle, and caudal lung lobes were taken from the right lung and collected into 10% neutral-buffered formalin for routine histological processing. Formalin-fixed tissues were paraffin wax embedded, and 4-mm sections were cut and routinely stained with H&E30. Immunohistochemical detection of influenza A virus NP was performed in 4-mm tissue sections. Histopathological changes in the stained lung tissue sections were scored by a veterinary pathologist blinded to the treatment group. Lung histopathology was scored using five parameters (necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium, airway inflammation, perivascular/bronchiolar cuffing, alveolar exudates, and septal inflammation) on a five-point scale of 0–4 and then summed to give a total slide score ranging from 0–20 per lobe (∼1.5 × 3 × 1.5 cm2). and a total animal score from 0 to 6031. A mean score for the three lung lobes was calculated for each animal. The individual lung lobes were also scored using the “Iowa” method, which takes into account the amount of viral Ag present in the sample50.ELISAEndpoint titer ELISAs for pH1N1, H3N2 and recombinant NA protein from H3N2 A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (NA2) (sequence matched to the vaccine antigen, Genbank accession number: ATE49827, produced by The Native Antigen company) were performed for serum and BAL as described before34. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Sigma Aldrich, UK) were overnight coated either with 1 μg/ml of recombinant NA protein (N2) (sequence matched to the vaccine antigen, GenBank accession number: ATE49827, and produced by The Native Antigen Company) or with live pH1N1 or H3N2 viruses grown in MDCK cells (1 × 105 PFU per well). Two hundred microliters blocking solution of 4% (w/v) milk powder (Marvel) in PBS, supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) was used, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The starting dilutions for serum and BAL were 1:20 and 1:2, respectively, and the plates were incubated on a rocking platform. One hour later, the plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Bio-Rad, Cat. No.: AAI41P), diluted in PBS-T with 4% milk powder was added for 1 h. The plates were washed 4 times with PBS-T and were developed with 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) High Sensitivity substrate solution (BioLegend, London UK). The reaction was stopped with 100 μl 1 M H2SO4 and the plates were read with the Cytation3 Imaging Reader (Biotek, Swindon, UK). The quantities of antibody were determined as the reciprocal value of the dilution that gave the first reading above the cut-off value (end-point titer). Cut-off values were determined as mean blank ODs plus 2-fold standard deviations.IFNγ ELISpots and intracellular cytokine stainingCryopreserved cells from BAL, spleen and PBMC were used to assess the frequency of IFNγ-producing cells by ELISpot as described before34. Briefly, MultiScreen-HA ELISPOT plates (Merck Millipore) were coated with 0.5 µg/ml anti-pig IFNγ (clone P2G10; BD Pharmingen) overnight. The plates were washed with PBS and blocked with culture media [RPMI 1640 with stable glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all from Thermo Fisher)] for at least 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After washing with PBS, 3 × 105 cells per well were seeded in triplicates and stimulated either with live pH1N1 or H3N2 viruses (multiplicity of infection of 1), 3 µg/ml ConA (positive control, Sigma-Aldrich), culture medium (negative control), or with one of the pools of peptides at a concentration of 2 µg/well. The pool of peptides for NP1, NP2, M1, NA1, or NA2 are shown in Table 2. After 40-h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the plates were washed with PBS-T and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with 0.25 μg/ml biotinylated anti-pig IFNγ detection Ab (clone P2C11, BD Pharmingen). The cells were washed and incubated with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (1:2,000 in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature. To visualize the spots, 100 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphateitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added according to instructions of the manufacturer and the reaction was stopped 15–20 min later by using tap water. The spots were counted using the AID ELISPOT reader (AID Autoimmun Diagnostika) and the results from NP1 and NP2 or NA1 and NA2 were pooled and shown as NP and NA, respectively. Results were expressed as IFNγ-producing cell number per 106 stimulated cells after subtraction of the average number of spots in medium stimulated control wells.Table 2 Pools of peptides (15mers overlapping by 10) for each antigen.Full size tableIntracellular staining (ICS) was performed to analyze IFNγ, TNF and IL-2 production by CD4 and CD8b cells in BAL. Cryopreserved cells from BAL were thawed and seeded in duplicates in 1 × 106 cells per well and stimulated overnight with live pH1H1 or H3N2 (MOI = 1) or medium as a negative control or were stimulated with peptide pools covering NP and M1 proteins included in the vaccine (2 μg/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, as previously described34. One hour following the peptide stimulation, Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug™, BD Biosciences) was added in all wells and 4 h later, the cells were centrifuged for 4 min at 1500 rpm, washed twice with PBS and stained with the primary Abs listed on Table 3. Twenty minutes after the surface staining and incubation at 4 °C, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences, Cat. No: 555028) as per the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the directly conjugated Abs, afterwards washed twice and finally stained with the secondary rat anti-mouse IgG2a antibody for 20 min at 4 °C. The cytokine production from CD4 and CD8 T cells was analyzed using the flow cytometry antibody panel listed in Table 3. The cells were also stained for Near-Infrared Fixable LIVE/DEAD stain (Invitrogen, Cat. No: L34975), for identification of live cells. The frequency of cytokine production shown is after subtraction of the frequencies found in medium control wells (unstimulated).Table 3 Antibodies used for the intracellular cytokine staining.Full size tableStatistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States). The data sets were first analyzed for normality and then subjected to either a one-way or two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test when normally distributed or to a Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (the figure legends state the data sets/ graphs that were not normally distributed). Significant differences were either presented on each graph or listed on Table 1 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). Until 28 DPI, all animals were treated identically and significant differences between the groups were not identified.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Flu spreads easily from one person to another when a person sick with the flu virus coughs, sneezes or talks. The flu usually occurs in the winter in the US, but the time when it begins to appear in the community varies from year to year. Flu season can begin as early as October and last until May.

How can I prevent the flu? Vaccination is the best way to prevent the flu. Flu viruses change and new strains of flu often appear. Flu vaccine is made to protect against the strains of flu most likely to make people sick each year. This is why flu vaccine must be repeated every year. It takes a couple of weeks to get protection from the vaccine. For most people, September and October are good times to get vaccinated, before flu viruses start to spread. You can also follow these practices to prevent the spread of flu and other respiratory illnesses: Wash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, rub hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Throw the tissue away promptly and wash hands. Masks can provide additional protection. They limit the spread of germs from people who are infected. They also help keep people wearing them from breathing in germs from others around them. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs can spread on your hands. Avoid contact with people who are sick. Stay away from others if you are sick. Stay home, at least for 24 hours until you are feeling better and are fever free without the use of fever reducing medicines. Who should get flu vaccine? Wake County Public Health encourages everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated against the flu – especially people at higher risk of complications if they get the flu. There are some people who should not get flu vaccine and others who should talk with their healthcare provider first. Check with your vaccine provider to learn what time you can use or if you cannot get the vaccine. Which flu vaccine should I get? Flu vaccine is available in a shot and nasal spray (approved for people 2 thru 49 years of age). All flu vaccines for the 2024–25 flu season are designed to protect against 3 flu viruses (trivalent). Not everyone can get the same kind of vaccine and some people cannot get flu vaccine. Check with your vaccine provider to learn what type you can use or if you cannot get the vaccine. Where can you get a flu vaccine? You can get the flu vaccine at: Your health care provider Many pharmacies Urgent Cares Some grocery stores and churches. Other community flu shot locations near you: Vaccine Finder How much does it cost to get flu vaccine at Wake County Health & Human Services? Regular flu vaccine – The cost for regular flu vaccine is $30. High dose flu vaccine – The cost of high-dose flu vaccine is $60. You will be asked to pay when you get your flu vaccine. Wake County Health & Human Services accepts: Cash Checks Medicare part B (bring your card with you) NC Medicaid (bring your card with you) Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Health Care and Cigna (bring your card with you) North Carolina Health Choice (bring your card with you) There is no charge for flu vaccine this year for: Pregnant women without health insurance Children who qualify for the federal government's Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program To qualify for vaccine under the VFC program, children must be under 19 years of age AND one of the following: Uninsured or underinsured Medicaid eligible American Indian or Alaskan Native How do I keep from spreading the flu if I get it? Stay home when sick. Do not go to work, to school or run errands when you are sick. Keep children home from school and daycare when they are sick. Stay away from others as much as possible. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Throw the used tissue away and wash your hands. Wearing a mask helps keep flu virus from spreading to others. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after sneezing or coughing. If soap and water are not available, rub hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. DO go to the doctor if you need to. What are flu antiviral drugs? Flu antiviral drugs are medications that fight the flu virus. They are prescribed by a doctor and are most effective if you take them within 2 days after your flu symptoms start. Antiviral drugs are not the same as antibiotics. Antibiotics treat infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics don’t help treat infections like flu that are caused by viruses.

The results suggest that some neurodegenerative disease might be avoided by preventing infection with influenza and other viruses. Infection with certain viruses like influenza, shown here, could raise the risk of neurodegenerative disease. John Gallagher and Audray Harris, NIAID Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Neurodegenerative diseases can damage different parts of the nervous system, including the brain. This may lead to problems with thinking, memory, and/or movement. Examples include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). These diseases tend to happen late in life. There are few effective treatments. Previous findings have suggested that viruses may play a role in certain neurodegenerative diseases. For example, a recent study found a link between Epstein-Barr virus infection and the risk of MS. There are also concerns about cognitive impacts from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A research team led by Drs. Mike Nalls, Kristin Levine, and Hampton Leonard of NIH's Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias examined links between viruses and neurodegenerative disease more generally. To do so, they analyzed data from the FinnGen project. This is a repository of biomedical data, or biobank, from more than 300,000 people in Finland. The team searched the biobank for people who had been diagnosed with one of six different conditions: AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), generalized dementia, vascular dementia, PD, and MS. They then checked how many had been hospitalized for a viral illness before. To confirm their findings, they looked for the same associations in the UK Biobank, which contains data from almost 500,000 people in the United Kingdom. Results appeared in Neuron on January 19, 2023. The researchers found 45 associations between viruses and neurodegenerative diseases in FinnGen. Of these, 22 also appeared in the UK Biobank. The strongest association was between viral encephalitis—brain inflammation caused by a virus—and AD. A person with viral encephalitis in the FinnGen database was 30 times as likely to be diagnosed with AD as someone without encephalitis. Results were similar in the UK Biobank; people with viral encephalitis were 22 times as likely to develop AD as those without. The team also found, in FinnGen, the association between Epstein-Barr virus and MS that was described before. The association wasn’t seen in the UK Biobank, but this may reflect how the different biobanks use hospital diagnostic codes; Epstein-Barr viruses are common and so often not noted. Influenza with pneumonia was associated with all the neurodegenerative diseases except MS. The researchers only included cases of influenza severe enough to need hospitalization in the study. Thus, these associations only apply to the most severe cases of influenza. FinnGen contains data on the same people over time. The team used this to examine how the associations depended on the time since infection. They found that some viral infections were associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease as much as 15 years later. The researchers note that vaccines exist for some of the viruses they identified. These include influenza, varicella-zoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and certain pneumonia-causing viruses. Vaccination might thus reduce some of the risk of the conditions they examined. “The results of this study provide researchers with several new critical pieces of the neurodegenerative disorder puzzle,” Nalls says. “In the future, we plan to use the latest data science tools to not only find more pieces but also help researchers understand how those pieces, including genes and other risk factors, fit together.”Related LinksImmune Cells Control Waste Clearance in the BrainHow Proteins Connect Common Neurodegenerative DiseasesStudy Suggests Epstein-Barr Virus May Cause Multiple SclerosisCellular Defect Found in Inherited and Sporadic ALSTesting A Blood Biomarker for NeurodegenerationTest Distinguishes Parkinson’s Disease from Related ConditionALS-Related Mutations Prevent RNA Transport in NervesSenescent Cells Linked to Brain Disease in MiceRisk Factors for Heart Disease Linked to DementiaDormant Viral Genes May Awaken to Cause ALSReferences: Virus exposure and neurodegenerative disease risk across national biobanks.

Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn’t deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets. As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic. Scientist say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009. Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention: What is bird flu? Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are flus that occur in dogs, plus pig — or swine — flu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry. Swans pass behind an avian influenza prevention notice alongside the River Thames in Windsor, United Kingdom, Feb. 8 2023. Ornithologists have warned that migratory wild birds are likely to provoke a serious new outbreak of avian flu across the U.K. in the spring. Photo by Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images The bird flu virus drawing attention today — Type A H5N1 — was first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices. How often do people get bird flu? The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the first time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, six died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while.

Some people don’t have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe. life-threatening pneumonia. Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds. The first and only U.S. case occurred just last April. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue and he recovered. Can it spread between people? In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Pakistan, most recently in 2007. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people. It wouldn’t take much for that to happen “and then we would be in a really tough situation,” said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The CDC’s Uyeki said the most worried he’s been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said. What happened at the mink farm? Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said three sea lions found dead in November tested positive for the virus, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu.

The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink — a worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people. “That’s the real worry,” said Nuzzo.

(Jan. 10) (AP video: Teresa Crawford, Carrie Antlfinger)APOMAHA, Neb. – The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers’ pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus.In addition to the cost of the government response and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.Avian flu lessons learned The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn’t proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.“The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry’s history,” National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.Ohio train derailment latest: FEMA headed to East Palestine; state announces medical clinic for concerned residentsFor subscribers: Great Lakes ice cover reaches historic low. Here's what we know.In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm – which can number in the millions – must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa – the nation’s biggest egg producer – leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn’t have any birds on their farms.Food prices add to cost of bird flu outbreak This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what’s driving prices so high.The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That’s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.Farmers are frontline defense against bird fluThe key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.“We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that’s leading the government’s response.Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.“America’s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,” said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.“That’s really the key – early detection. It’s kind of like a forest fire – the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,” National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.Officials say bird flu doesn’t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.Bird flu can spread amongst humans, but is very rareWhile bird flu is rarely seen in humans, it shares many of the same symptoms as the regular flu.Damien Henderson, Getty ImagesDig deeperWorst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humansIs the U.S. prepared for a possible bird flu pandemic?

(CBS) -- Barrie Hovis loves her dog so much. She would never want Yogi to catch canine influenza, which happens to be on the rise in the Philadelphia region. But she's not worried because her dog already has the flu vaccine."Because he's around other dogs in the park and I want to keep him healthy," Hovis said. Since the region is seeing a spike in cases, the Mount Laurel Animal Hospital's Doctor Bathilda Lake says vaccines are short in supply. "The biggest thing to know about canine influenza is it's a highly contagious disease," Lake said. "And so the biggest risk is interacting with dogs that already are infected with canine influenza." Lake said dogs typically spread the virus by coughing or sneezing on other dogs. Not to worry though, canine influenza is not life-threatening. Dogs will typically get over the flu in about a week without any additional treatment. "The best thing you can do is limit their exposure to canine influenza; so don't take them to places like dog parks, try to limit their exposure to any new dogs," Lake recommends to dog owners.Jackie Santasiero says she's not too concerned about the virus. She already limits her dog Kona's interactions with other dogs during the winter. "If it was in the summertime, I'd probably look into the shots," Santasiero said. "But right now, he's not really around other dogs."If a dog gets canine influenza it can't be transmitted from dog to human or human to dog. Don't worry you can still cuddle up with your little loved one.

Not Now Turn OnH5N1 avian influenza: an old acquaintance that is changing fast Skip to main content Main navigation Contents Reactions Expert voices What we know Resource library Briefings Training SMC Studies Journalists Scientists Press offices About SMC ES About SMC ES The 5Ws +1 Statute Advisory Committee Working Method Governance Team FAQ Global network User account menu - Secondary Search ESEN Breadcrumb Home Briefings H5N1 avian influenza: an old acquaintance that is changing fast This article is 1 year old H5N1 avian influenza: an old acquaintance that is changing fast Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have been increasing since 2021, but in recent months have evolved into what is known as a 'global panzootic' affecting all types of wild birds and new continents, but also mammals such as mink and sea lions. At a briefing organised by SMC Germany, in collaboration with SMC UK and SMC Spain, three experts discussed the situation, the level of risk and possible next steps. SMC Spain 14/02/2023 - 12:10 CET Versión en castellano Danish officials kill and dispose of thousands of turkeys on a farm in Zeeland, Denmark, on 6 January 2023. EFE/EPA/MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN. "The main change seems to be that the virus is more adapted to wild birds and that the seasonality has been lost and is all over Europe," summarised the director of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology (Germany), Martin Beer, at the briefing organised by SMC Germany. In fact, the scientist highlighted the importance of the fact that H5N1 influenza has reached new continents such as South America with new species of birds that have never before come into contact with the pathogen. In other words, the outbreaks are already a global panzootic - a pandemic affecting animals. "What is important is the change in the epidemiology [of the virus] in wild birds and biodiversity," explained Ursula Höfle, contract professor in the SaBio Research Group at the National Institute for Game and Wildlife Research, University of Castilla-La Mancha. "It is very serious because these are unprecedented changes," she added. On the mink outbreak on a farm in Galicia that has gained international attention, Höfle explained that "transmissibility developed de novo on that farm", but that "so far it seems that it was an isolated event". As for the origin of the infections, the scientist theorised that it was most likely the seagulls, which "have access to the farm because they are open buildings", but that, although there is molecular evidence to support this hypothesis, it is still being studied. The researcher recalled that this event is still being analysed, but that the molecular evidence and the nature of the outbreak "suggest mink to mink transmission", which is consistent with previous research in China that "already showed that it is very easy for this virus to adapt to mink". Call for calm over possible human pandemic "It is not the right time to say that we are close to a human pandemic," Beer reassured, "but we have to keep a close eye on the situation, which is very dynamic, and it is difficult to predict what is going to happen. He also recommended vaccination of domestic poultry in Europe, even if this has not been allowed before. In addition, he warned of the dangers of farms such as mink farms: "We have to be careful about keeping animals in large numbers and in sub-optimal conditions because it is a continuous risk. It is not the right time to say that we are close to a human pandemic Martin Beer Ian H. Brown, head of virology at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (UK), said that vaccination will have "an important role to play in putting out the local fire", but that "on its own it will fail" because it has to be combined with other surveillance and control measures. Brown listed some of the tools needed to combat H5N1 outbreaks, such as having good detection systems and implementing restrictions to prevent the spread to other farms. "Any jump [between species] increases the risk, we can't just sit back because we know what happened with covid-19," he said. Still, he also reminded: "We are not at a point where we need to worry about it passing to humans" because "infection in people is still very rare".

Facebook Linkedin Threads Whatsapp Reddit Email Page link H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus carried generally by wild birds, has arrived in Latin America, causing unprecedented mortality in sea bird colonies along the west coast.The virus has killed tens of thousands of sea birds in Peru alone, including some species that are considered endangered in the country, and scientists worry other vulnerable species like the Andean condor might also become infected.Hundreds of sea lions and a dolphin have also been infected, which raises concerns regarding transmission to humans and is especially worrisome if it is confirmed that mammals can infect each other.The outbreaks also threaten Peru’s guano industry, which provides affordable fertilizer to many small-scale farmers in the region, and could expose people harvesting guano to H5N1.See All Key Ideas Since late 2021, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the type H5N1 has wreaked havoc on wild and captive birds across Asia, Africa, Europe and North America, killing millions. In November, it also arrived in Latin America, causing unprecedented mortality in sea bird colonies along the region’s west coast. “The first cases in Peru were confirmed on Nov. 13, 2022,” says Víctor Gamarra-Toledo, an ornithologist at the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa in Peru. “By now, outbreaks have been reported in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and Central American countries like Panama and Costa Rica.” The virus continues to spread southward: earlier in February, it was found in Ancud on the Isla Grande de Chiloé in Chile, about 1,125 kilometers (700 miles) south of Santiago. “I’ve been working with Peruvian sea birds for 30 years,” says Carlos Zavalaga, an ornithologist at the Universidad Científica del Sur in Lima, “and I’ve never seen such massive mortality due to disease outbreaks.” The occurrence of avian influenza in Peru is not unusual in itself, says Giancarlo Inga Díaz, wildlife veterinarian at the Peruvian National Service of Natural Areas Protected by the State (SERNANP), as variants of the virus have been found in the country before. “But in 2022, we’ve observed an unusual impact on wild populations of coastal sea birds. Our wildlife monitoring system recorded nearly 50,000 dead birds in eight protected areas [in Peru alone]. In the last week of January, we’ve observed a high mortality of resident birds in the Paracas National Reserve,” Inga Díaz tells Mongabay about the reserve located 265 km (165 mi) south of Lima. A dead Guanay cormorant (Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum) on a beach in Peru. Now confined to the Pacific coast of the continent, the species is considered to be near-threatened by the IUCN. It is one of three important species the excrements of which are harvested as guano. Image by Fernando Angulo. Some of the heaviest impact seems to be on the islands just off Peru’s coast. “Authorities have banned researchers from entering the islands close to the coast where the main areas of mortality are,” says Zavalaga. “But about a month ago, we sent a drone with cameras from the coast to two of them, Pachacamac and Asia, and counted thousands of dead birds.” The most affected species, he says, are Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus), Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata) and Guanay cormorants (Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum). The pelicans and boobies have been designated as endangered by Peruvian authorities, while Guanay cormorants are considered to be near threatened by the IUCN. “We know that the numbers of the Peruvian pelicans in Peru never exceeded 100,000 individuals in the last 20 years,” says Zavalaga. “So the death of at least 20,000 of them is quite significant.” The damage seems to go beyond birds. Hundreds of dead sea lions and a few dead fur seals have been discovered in several protected areas, including in Paracas National Reserve. Live sea lions there showed uncoordinated behaviors, a potential indication of infection of the nervous system, and had excessive mucus in their eyes, nose and mouth — possible symptoms of avian flu, says Inga Díaz of SERNANP. A team of the Peruvian National Service of Natural Areas Protected by the State (SERNANP) investigating a dead South-American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) on a beach in Peru. A recent study showed that sea lions and fur seals that died were infected by avian flu, causing concerns that mammals are infecting each other. Image courtesy of SERNANP. Still pending review, a recent analysis reveals that the sea lions had been infected by H5N1 — but whether this was also what killed them has yet to be confirmed. A dead dolphin found in the north in the region of Piura was also shown to be infected with the virus. The deadly infections increase concerns that the virus may be able to spread from one mammal to another — though that is also unconfirmed at the moment — and may be able to infect people as well. Farmers in trouble The outbreak affecting the pelicans, cormorants and boobies is also affecting a particular sector of the local economy: guano harvesting. The birds’ dried, compacted excrement is a prized fertilizer in agriculture. “These three species produce around 86,000 tons of guano per year, which is roughly worth $50 million,” says biologist Daniel Plazas-Jiménez, from the Unitrópico University in Colombia. Plazas-Jiménez says the guano’s importance far exceeds its monetary value. “In Peru, most guano is sold to organic or traditional farmers, many from Indigenous communities, at a price that is low in comparison to that of inorganic fertilizers. In 2021, the Peruvian authorities planned to extract around 25,000 tons to provide for more than 40,000 families. Many people need guano to keep their organic certifications and often have few economic resources to buy other fertilizers. So this also affects their food security.” “The guano industry in Peru is not industrial,” Zavalaga adds, “it’s very local. For example, last year only two islands in Peru were under guano harvesting. This year, I think they were planning [to harvest on] three or four [other islands].” He doubts whether the virus can survive in the harsh environment presented by the guano itself. “I’d be more afraid that live birds would pass the virus to humans, either on the islands or on the mainland beaches, where there are also dead animals. It’s summer now, so many people go there.” A team of the Peruvian National Service of Natural Areas Protected by the State (SERNANP) investigating a beach where dead birds have been reported. Image courtesy of SERNANP. In response to the outbreak, the Peruvian Ministry of Health has declared a 90-day state of emergency to prevent the virus from infecting people. According to Inga Díaz, measures include banning the collection of guano, advising against handling wild animals and using high-risk beaches, and training park rangers to monitor animal health. Condors at risk Local governments have sent teams wearing personal protective equipment to collect the carcasses found on beaches and bury them, says Zavalaga. He worries, however, that “on the islands, where the main colonies are found, there is a lack of adequate disposal of the carcasses.” As long as few people are allowed to go there, the risk of human infection is low. But in the meantime, dead and sick birds do pose an infection risk to other birds and mammals that share their habitat, and scavengers that feed on them. That includes a very iconic and vulnerable one, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), says Gamarra-Toledo, who is studying how the condor’s feeding behavior exposes it to pollution. “We are very concerned about the possible fatal consequences of this outbreak on this species.” Peruvian pelicans (top) (Pelecanus thagus) and Peruvian boobies (bottom) (Sula variegata) on the Islas Ballestas, off Peru’s south coast. Both species are considered to be endangered in Peru, and thousands have died in the recent avian flu outbreaks. Image via Wikimedia Commons. “We’ve found there is a population of Andean condors feeding mainly on sea lions, but sometimes also on dead pelicans,” says Sergio Lambertucci, an ornithologist at the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Argentina. “Andean condors may be feeding on the coastline in the morning and roosting in the high mountains in the evening, 4,000 meters [13,120 feet] above sea level.” He also worries about turkey vultures, which roam more or less across the continent and might spread the disease even if it doesn’t kill them. “We are trapping them in Argentina now to find out.” Bird migration is probably at the root of the outbreak, says Zavalaga, as the virus appears to have arrived with birds migrating from North America in spring, though the exact routes or culprits have not been identified. “Since the first report in mid-November, the deaths have not stopped,” he adds. “Animals are still dying on the islands. What kind of conservation measures are we going to take? I don’t see anything like a strategy for that yet.” Gamarra-Toledo agrees that monitoring outbreaks and burying dead birds may not be enough to save them. “We should also reduce human impacts that negatively affect them — environmental pollution, habitat loss and the overexploitation of resources — so we can give these birds a better chance of survival.” Citations: Gamarra-Toledo, V., Plaza, P.

Health inequity within ethnic minorities has been explained by factors such as higher prevalence of underlying disease, restricted access to care, and lower vaccination rates. In this study, we investigated the effect of cultural tailoring of communicators and media outlets, respectively, on vaccine willingness in an influenza vaccination campaign in the Netherlands. A total of 1226 participants were recruited from two culturally non-tailored media outlets (Dutch newspaper and Facebook), and one media outlet tailored to a large community in the Netherlands with Indian ancestry. The participants from all three media outlets were randomly exposed to a vaccination awareness video delivered by a physician with an Indian or Dutch background, followed by an online survey. Cultural tailoring compared to cultural non-tailoring of communicators showed no difference in improvement of vaccine willingness (13.9% vs. 20.7% increment, respectively, p = 0.083). However, the media outlet tailored to the community with Indian ancestry, resulted in a higher improvement of vaccine willingness compared to non-tailored media outlets (46.7% vs. 14.7% increment, respectively, p < 0.001, unadjusted OR = 5.096). These results suggest that cultural tailoring of media outlets may be critical to effectively reach out to ethnic minorities to help optimize vaccination rates and improve general health.

Influenza vaccination is not only an effective measure to prevent respiratory complications1, but could be even more effective than statins or antihypertensives for prevention of acute myocardial infarction2. Given the importance of this vaccine effectiveness, we were previously invited by the Netherlands Society of Cardiology to establish a call to action to cardiologists to promote influenza vaccination3. According to the annual Dutch flu vaccine campaign from 2021, vaccine coverage among people aged 65 years or older comprised 72.0%4, which is approximating the indicated numbers by the WHO, who advocates for an Influenza vaccination coverage of 75% among older people5.However, ethnic minorities have consistently shown lower vaccination rates. For instance, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the 2019–2020 flu season in the US, the white population had the highest vaccination coverage (53%), compared to non-Hispanic Black (41%), Hispanic (38%) and other population groups6. The ethnic minorities have also universally demonstrated vaccine hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and governments have struggled to better protect these vulnerable groups7. Also in the Netherlands people with a migration background, including citizens who migrated from Suriname, were less willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, more often admitted to the hospital, and showed a 1.5 times higher mortality rate per 100.000 persons8. These data are in line with the results of a large survey demonstrating higher vaccine hesitancy in the population with a migration background in the Netherlands9. However, with respect to the influenza vaccination, data on vaccine uptake are lacking, since migration background is not registered according to the annual Dutch flu vaccine campaigns in 2019 to 20214,10,11. Health inequity within ethnic minorities has been explained by factors such as the higher burden of underlying disease, limited access to health care, social deprivation, and health illiteracy12,13. It has been reported that COVID-19 health messages from a race or ethnic messenger aligned to the audience helped improve information-seeking behavior, specifically in Black participants14, and that a comprehensive coordinated community strategy tailored to the target population, resulted in the highest vaccination rate among American Indians (AI) and Alaskan Natives (AN) in the USA15.However, the question remains as to which specific elements of a comprehensive communication strategy define the success15. We have previously demonstrated the success of a data-driven public health campaign on hygiene, and also the effectiveness of a media intervention for debunking of vaccination myths16,17,18. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of cultural tailoring at the level of health communicators and at the level of media outlets on vaccine acceptance for an influenza vaccination awareness campaign.ResultsWe randomized a video message (1:1) containing information highlighting the benefit of Influenza vaccines, delivered by a communicator (study physician) with either an Indian or Dutch background. The vaccination awareness videos were distributed within three different media outlets, including two culturally non-tailored (generic) media outlets and one media outlet culturally tailored to the community of Indian ancestry (mostly migrated from Suriname) in the Netherlands (Fig. 1a). The culturally tailored media outlet consisted of a local radio station called Ujala, which presents news, views and music tailored to and presented by people from Indian ancestry. The culturally non-tailored media outlets consisted of a Dutch newspaper called Algemeen Dagblad (AD) and Facebook (FB). The success of the intervention, improvement of vaccine willingness, was defined as the proportion of participants who changed from being against to pro-influenza vaccination. Within the study we compared the impact of cultural tailoring on the improvement of vaccine willingness, a. at the level of the video intervention delivered by the Indian or Dutch communicator, respectively, b. at the level of the 3 different media outlets. Figure 1(a) Study flowchart. All participants were recruited from two culturally non-tailored media outlets (Dutch newspaper and Facebook (FB)) and one culturally tailored outlet (Indian radio station). (b) Improvement of vaccine willingness in all vaccine hesitant participants, divided by vaccine hesitant participants who watched the campaign video with an Indian versus Dutch communicator (OR1 = 1.183), and divided by vaccine hesitant participants who were recruited from different media outlets (Indian radio station vs. FB (OR2 = 7.520) and the Dutch newspaper vs. FB (OR3 = 6.875). (c) Improvement of vaccine willingness in all vaccine hesitant participants, vaccine hesitant participants who watched the campaign video with a tailored versus non-tailored communicator (OR4 = 0.621), and vaccine hesitant participants who have been recruited from a tailored versus non-tailored media outlet (OR5 = 5.096). Note OR1–5 are unadjusted Odds ratios and were generated using binary logistic regressions.Full size imageA total of 1226 participants were included and recruited from the Dutch newspaper (n = 266, 9.5% migrant and 90.5% non-migrant), FB (n = 824, 11.5% migrant and 88.5% non-migrant), and the Indian radio station (n = 136, 97.1% migrant and 2.9% non-migrant). In total, 624 participants were exposed to the campaign video with the Indian communicator and 602 participants with the Dutch communicator. Demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Demographic characteristics of participants at baseline, divided by Indian and Dutch communicators in our campaign video and by different media outlets.Full size tableAt baselineAt baseline (i.e. before introducing participants to the campaign video) a total of 382 participants indicated to be vaccine hesitant (31.2% of in total 1226 participants). The highest vaccine hesitancy was in those recruited through FB (37.3%), compared to the Indian radio station (22.2%) and the Dutch newspaper (16.9%). After showing the campaign video, vaccine hesitancy decreased across the formats but remained highest in participants from FB (36.5%), followed by the Indian radio station (17.8%) and the Dutch newspaper (13.2%) (Supplementary Table 1). The overall improvement of vaccine willingness after showing the campaign video, defined as the proportion of participants having switched from against to pro-influenza vaccination was 17.3%, i.e. 66 out of 382 participants (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Table 2). From the 66 participants who converted to pro-influenza vaccination, 78.8% had earlier indicated in the survey to not get the flu shot usually yearly.At the level of communicatorsIn a general comparison between the two communicators (i.e. Indian and Dutch communicator) no statistically significant difference was observed with respect to the improvement of vaccine willingness in the vaccine hesitant group (18.4% vs. 16.0%, respectively, p = 0.538, unadjusted OR = 1.183, 95% CI 0.693–2.017, Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 2, 3), neither when controlling for covariates using a binary logistic regression (adjusted OR = 0.912, 95% CI 0.495–1.679, Supplementary Table 3).When comparing cultural tailoring of the communicator (i.e. matching the background of the physician with the background of the participant) with non-tailoring of the communicators (unmatched backgrounds of the physician and the participant) we found no difference of the effect of the campaign video (13.9% for the tailored communicator vs. 20.7% for the non-tailored communicator, respectively, p = 0.083) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 4).These findings suggest that the participants did not show any preference for cultural tailoring of health care providers, as also was apparent from the results of our survey questions on the preference of having a culturally tailored healthcare provider (answers were tending towards ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’, Supplementary Table 2). We did observe a small difference in preference between the media outlets (the Dutch newspaper, FB and the Indian radio station) for instance in the statement ‘I value having a health care provider of a similar ethnicity/origin to myself’, with scores ranging from 1.86, 1.94 and 2.36, respectively, p = 0.001 (Supplementary Table 2, but the extent of the difference was small (mean scores belong to ‘disagree’). The predominantly migrant listeners to the Indian radio station tended to disagree with the importance of having a culturally tailored health care provider. These data support the findings that tailoring of the communicator might not be of decisive importance in convincing ethnic groups in our campaign.At the level of media outletsIn a general comparison between the three different media outlets, improvement of vaccine willingness in the vaccine hesitant group was highest in participants exposed to the campaign through the Indian radio station and the Dutch newspaper compared to campaign exposure via FB (46.7%, 44.4% and 10.4%, respectively, p < 0.001, unadjusted OR = 7.520 and unadjusted OR = 6.875, Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 2, 3). Upon controlling for different covariates (Supplementary Table 3), only media outlet was statistically significantly associated with improvement of vaccine willingness. More specifically, vaccine hesitant participants exposed to the campaign through the Indian radio station were most likely to be convinced for accepting vaccination against influenza (adjusted OR = 6.490, 95% CI 1.808–23.291), followed by the Dutch newspaper (adjusted OR = 6.103, 95% CI 2.935–12.699) compared to vaccine hesitant participants exposed to the campaign through FB. This high improvement of vaccine willingness initiated from the Indian radio station corresponds with the positive sentiment reported by the participants during the campaign in this group. A sentiment analysis of the invited feedback (comments) during the campaign (Supplementary Table 5) showed a more positive response from the Indian radio station compared with the Dutch newspaper or FB (percentage positive feedback 25.0%, 5.5% and 2.0%, p < 0.001, respectively). Examples of comments for each sentiment from all participants are described in Supplementary Table 6.When comparing the effect of a culturally tailored media outlet (a media outlet with a specific audience) to culturally non-tailored media outlets (media outlets without a specific audience i.e. generic), the data show that vaccine hesitant participants exposed to the campaign delivered by a tailored media outlet (n = 30) resulted in a higher improvement of vaccine willingness compared to vaccine hesitant participants exposed to the campaign delivered by non-tailored media outlets (n = 348), 46.7% versus 14.7%, respectively, p < 0.001, unadjusted OR = 5.096) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 4).DiscussionWithin the scope of strategies to overcome vaccine hesitancy, our study has shown that a culturally attuned messaging strategy using a tailored media outlet for the community with Indian ancestry resulted in the highest improvement of vaccine willingness. Although the video message was similar within all three media outlets, the success of the campaign within the Indian radio station may be explained by a messaging tactic which has also been described in Foxworth et al.15, by emphasizing the importance of vaccination to protect the community. The positive sentiments reported by the participants who were recruited from the Indian radio station, reflect the fact that the campaign was well received, as seen by the improvement of vaccine willingness.In contrast, our data also suggest that a generic approach in a culturally diverse population may even backfire, and harm the effect of national vaccination campaigns, given the negative sentiments reported by the participants during the campaign and the lower improvement of vaccine willingness, within the Dutch newspaper and FB groups.To expand upon the findings of Alsan et al.14, in which race or ethnic messengers (physicians) aligned to the audience helped improve information-seeking behaviour specifically in Black participants, within the context of our study, it seems that cultural tailoring of the communicator/health care worker might not necessarily improve vaccine willingness.The overall effect of the present vaccination campaign study may seem small, given the 17.3% change from being vaccine hesitant to vaccine willing. However, all participants, including those from the vaccine hesitant group were exposed only once to the intervention video. Repetitive exposure to an intervention, in which information about vaccination is provided, may help to increase the change from being hesitant to acceptance substantially19.Our tailored media outlet strategy may be part of the burgeoning, so-called precision public health strategy. Precision public health is described as ‘the right intervention to the right population at the right time’20. The successful vaccination campaign in Alaskan Indians and American Natives15, and our study in the Netherlands, may serve as examples to help protect vulnerable groups.Our study has various limitations. First, our study was conducted in the Netherlands, and thus, more evidence from across other countries is needed to substantiate the findings. Secondly, the tailored media outlet consisted of migrants recruited from only one ethnic group in the Netherlands. Although the community with Indian ancestry in the Netherlands is a large ethnic group, future research should demonstrate whether this strategy is applicable to other ethnic minorities and across other media outlets.In conclusion, our influenza vaccination awareness campaign study resulted in improved vaccine acceptance, especially in an ethnic group recruited from a tailored media outlet, as compared to generic media outlets, among the culturally diverse population of the Netherlands. Cultural tailoring of the communicator per se did not result in enhanced vaccine willingness. Our study also suggests that a sentiment analysis may be a good predictor of the campaign’s success. Therefore, one could envision that public health campaign strategists could use the sentiment analysis within pilot interventions to shape the final version of the public health campaign. If a pilot intervention (public health message) generates predominantly negative sentiments, one could argue that the public health campaign should be adapted such that it results in positive sentiments, to have a higher chance to obtain a successful campaign outcome.MethodsData collectionThe data from this study were collected between November 1st and December 31st in 2021. We used the online platform Qualtrics for the distribution of the surveys within the three different media outlets. The surveys were filled out by participants who were recruited from three different media outlets, a Dutch newspaper (called AD), Facebook (FB) and a local Indian radio station (Ujala). The total number of potential participants who clicked on the survey link, read the information sheet, and were age eligible (18 years or older) comprised 4577 participants, including 2692 participants from the Dutch newspaper, 1695 participants from FB, and 190 participants from the local Indian radio station. Participants were asked to sign an informed consent form, before participating in our campaign study. If participants did not provide informed consent, they were excluded from participation. Participants were also excluded from this study if aged < 18 years or if they did not complete the survey. In total, 1226 participants met our study criteria and were included in the campaign study. No compensation or incentives were provided to promote research participation. This study was reviewed by the Medical Ethical Review Board (METC) of the Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC), the Netherlands, and was exempted from the need for an IRB approval. Furthermore, this study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, followed the CONSORT 2010 guidelines for reporting randomized trials, and was registered at ISRCTN under reference number ISRCTN13441058.Recruitment of participantsParticipants were recruited from three different media outlets.Participants from the Dutch newspaper (called AD) were informed about our campaign study through a news article in the (online) newspaper, in which the importance of taking the Influenza vaccination was emphasized, especially for high risk people e.g. people with a particular migration background. People were subsequently asked to participate in an online survey, originating from Qualtrics, by clicking on the attached link.Participants recruited from FB were shown a Facebook advertisement indicating the risk of a myocardial infarction during an influenza epidemic, followed by the question “Does vaccination help?”. People were subsequently asked to fill out a survey, referring to the link to the online survey from Qualtrics.Participants from the local Indian radio station were recruited through the radio through an interview on the subject of vaccination, short radio spots, and an advertisement on their website and Facebook page. During the live interview, broadcasted twice, listeners were invited to fill out the survey with translation support from the radio presenter. The radio spot was broadcasted for 3 weeks (4 spots per day), and voiced by an Indian communicator (Dutch cardiologist from Surinamese origin with ancestors from India), by which influenza vaccination was promoted. In both the interview and the radio spot, the importance of vaccination in relation to protection of the community was emphasized, as supported by Foxworth et al.15. The advertisement on the website and Facebook page from the Indian radio station was equal to the advertisement on FB. During the interview and radio spots, potential participants were directed to the website or Facebook page, where a link to the online survey, originating from Qualtrics, was shown.Campaign video messageThe video message was based on the results from our diagnostic survey (not shown), as distributed at the beginning of the study period starting on November 1st. Through this diagnostic survey, largely based on the ‘WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy survey tool in Guatemala’21, we collected data about gaps in knowledge, attitude and practices concerning vaccination in the Netherlands.The video message was voiced by a voice-over and a communicator (study physician) with either an Indian or Dutch background.In the first part of the video message, participants received information about the importance of getting the influenza vaccine. For instance, during the influenza season 2021–2022, impairment of the immune response was expected due to the Covid-19 containment measures in the almost past two years. Furthermore, participants received information about the increased risk of developing a myocardial infarction during an influenza epidemic. Thereafter, influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing a myocardial infarction was emphasized.Secondly, information on vaccine accessibility, increased risk due to underlying disease, vaccine willingness, and governmental trust was provided, specifically among ethnic minorities.Thirdly, the vaccination myth of developing Autism Spectrum Disorder after vaccination was discussed and refuted, and hesitancy about new vaccines was discussed and refuted.The video message ended with a short story about the origin of the vaccine, which was either about inoculation (a non-Western invention) or vaccine development by Dr. Edward Jenner (a Western invention). We hypothesized that a narrative about vaccination as a non-Western invention (inoculation) would result in better improvement of vaccine willingness in the participants with a migrant background, compared to the narrative of vaccination as a Western innovation (discovered by Dr. Edward Jenner).Participants from the Dutch newspaper received the video message with either a Dutch communicator or an Indian communicator (digitally randomized 1:1 by Qualtrics), both ending with the inoculation part. Participants recruited from FB or the local Indian radio station also received the video message with either the Dutch communicator or the Indian communicator (digitally randomized 1:1), in which, in addition, the story about inoculation or Edward Jenner was digitally randomized 1:1 as well. In this way, a total of four different video messages were digitally randomized (1:1:1:1 by Qualtrics) and were shown to participants from FB and the Indian radio station.Side note: In the extensive analysis in this study, the video messages with the inoculation part and the Edward Jenner part, were treated as the same video message. The reason for this decision was that no difference in improvement of vaccine willingness was observed between the two versions of the video messages (i.e. the video message ending with vaccination as a Western invention (Edward Jenner part) or the version ending with vaccination as a non-Western innovation (inoculation)) within participants from FB and the Indian radio station.In addition, we performed a regression analysis to predict improvement of vaccine willingness, controlling for age, gender, migration background, education level, presence of chronic disease, watching the inoculation part or the Edward Jenner part, communicator (Dutch or Indian) and media outlet (FB or Indian radio station), which showed that only media outlet was significantly associated with improvement of vaccine willingness. Therefore, in the extensive analysis from this study, the inoculation part and the Edward Jenner part were considered to be comparable in impact, and were treated as the same video message. In the Supplementary information section, the subanalysis of the video message with the inoculation part and Edward Jenner part is extensively described (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary text 1).Survey developmentWe developed a survey to measure vaccine willingness, awareness and knowledge concerning influenza vaccination among the Dutch population, from which a large part of the survey originated from our previous research work17. The survey contained questions to evaluate demographic information (age, gender, migration background, education, presence or absence of any chronic disease, acceptance to annual flu shot, and influenza vaccine willingness). After the initial questions, one of the campaign videos was shown to the participants with an Indian or Dutch communicator delivering the video message, followed by additional questions concerning governmental trust22, vaccine hesitancy (mostly adapted from the WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy survey tool in Guatemala)21, racial fairness and consciousness23, and preferences for a culturally tailored (culturally concordant) healthcare provider.With regard to the questions about racial fairness and consciousness23, the scale of the answers were changed in line with previous questions, i.e. strongly disagree to strongly agree including the option ‘I don’t know’ instead of ‘never’ to ‘very often’. For the specific purpose of this study, scales to assess the domains ‘vaccine willingness’ and ‘preferences for a culturally tailored health care provider’ were developed within the research team for this particular RCT.Cultural tailoringIn the present study, 2 types of cultural tailoring have been discussed. First, cultural tailoring of the communicator means matching the background of the physician with the background of the participant. Cultural non-tailoring of the communicators means unmatching backgrounds of the physician and the participant. In this study we measured the effect on improvement of vaccine willingness comparing culturally tailored communicators with culturally non-tailored communicators, i.e. the Dutch communicator with a non-migrant participant and the Indian communicator with a migrant participant compared with Dutch communicator with migrant participant and Indian communicator with a non-migrant participant.Secondly, a culturally tailored media outlet is defined as a media outlet with a specific audience, including specific views, values and norms. On the other hand, the non-tailored media outlets are without a specific audience i.e. a generic media outlet. In this study, the tailored media outlet was represented by the Indian radio station (Ujala) and the non-tailored media outlets comprised the Dutch newspaper and FB.Definition of improvement of vaccine willingnessImprovement of vaccine willingness was measured as the proportion of people who switched from against to pro-influenza vaccination after watching the campaign video.OutcomesVaccine willingness was measured using a 4-point Likert scale within the survey distributed within the Dutch newspaper and Facebook group, and a dichotomous scale was used within the survey distributed within the Indian radio station group. The 4-point Likert scale answers were recoded into a dichotomous scale to match with the scale used in the survey distributed within the Indian radio station group, e.g. strongly disagree and disagree were recoded into disagree; agree and strongly agree were recoded into agree. Only the dichotomous scale was used in the statistical analysis. Ordinal data was collected through 3, 4 or 5-point Likert scales. These scales were subsequently converted into numerical values (e.g. 1, 2 and 3). Question 5 regarding migration background was recoded into a binary variable, as 1 for migrant and 2 for non-migrant. Question 6 regarding education level of the participant, was recoded into a binary variable, as 0 for lower education i.e. less than high school diploma, pre-vocational secondary education and secondary vocational education, and 1 for higher education for all remaining levels of education.Statistical analysesContinuous data were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney U test, or with the Kruskal–Wallis-test in case of comparing continuous data within three groups (three different media outlets). Binary, ordinal or nominal data were analyzed with the Chi-Square test. The outcome measure ‘improvement of vaccine willingness’ was defined as participants who answered ‘disagree’ to the question whether they were pro-influenza vaccination before watching the campaign video, and switched to ‘agree’ after watching the campaign video. Improvement of vaccine willingness, which means converted from against to pro-influenza vaccination, was coded by 1 and no improvement was coded by 0. Differences in improvement of vaccine willingness between participants who watched our campaign video with a Dutch versus Indian communicator or between different media outlets were analyzed with the Chi-Square test. A binary logistic regression was performed to analyze unadjusted and adjusted (with different predictors in the model) odds ratios concerning improvement of vaccine willingness. Within the adjusted regression model to predict improvement of vaccine willingness in the vaccine hesitant group, we controlled for media outlet, communicator, age, gender, migration background, education level, and chronic disease. We did not control for ‘flu shot each year’, because this relationship with vaccine willingness was too obvious. Overall, results are reported as frequencies (with percentages, and minimum and maximum) or medians (with quartiles 1 and 3, and minimum and maximum).Sentiment analysisWe performed a sentiment analysis, where we extracted all comments from the feedback section from our survey. In order to classify comments as either negative, neutral or positive, three researchers individually assigned comments to one of the three different sentiments based on words used by participants, and according to specific words indicated in the work of Pudaruth et al.24. The sentiment of a comment was subjectively scored as either negative, neutral or positive, as a reaction to the survey or the subject of vaccination in general. If discrepancy occurred between the sentiment score from each individual researcher to a specific comment, the sentiment was assigned to neutral. Sentiments were coded as 0 for negative, 1 for neutral and 2 for positive, and were analyzed with the Chi-Square test.

Canine influenza, also known as the dog flu, is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by specific Type A influenza viruses known to infect dogs, and is different from the seasonal influenza viruses that spread annually among people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the vast majority of cases, it is not considered life-threatening, the CDC said. Some regions have seen a rise in cases this winter, including Philadelphia, North Texas and Minneapolis. Symptoms for dog flu include a cough, runny nose, fever and reduced appetite, according to the CDC. Most dogs usually recover from canine influenza within 2 to 3 weeks, but in more severe cases some dogs can develop secondary bacterial infections that can lead to more severe illnesses or pneumonia, the CDC said. "We're really looking for changes of their behavior," veterinary microbiologist Stephen Cole told CBS News Thursday. "Are they acting listless, or lethargic, or not wanting to eat? In addition, keeping a close eye on their respiratory rate: Are they breathing faster? And their respiratory effort: Are they needing to take deeper breaths to catch their breaths?" Cole said that while dogs can contract other illnesses like COVID-19 from their owners, it is unlikely they can pass dog flu on to humans. "COVID-19 has been reported to pass from people to their pets, for sure," Cole said. "There's never been a report of canine influenza moving into people, but the risk isn't absolutely zero, so it's important to be prudent," he added.In addition, Cole said that pet owners in regions with larger outbreaks of dog flu should keep dogs away from congregate settings, and seek to get them vaccinated, if possible. "With canine influenza there are flu vaccines available," Cole told CBS News. "Those flu vaccines have been on short supply recently, so it's really important that you reach out to your veterinarian to see if it's available to them in the first place."'What's most important is keeping a close eye on our pets to make sure they're doing okay and seeking out veterinarian care whenever they need it," Cole added.

So, just like with humans, make sure your dog gets plenty of rest.PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- As more and more pets across our area are getting sick, veterinarians say the region is seeing a rare outbreak of canine influenza.Stephen Cole, a veterinarian with the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, told Action News it's not uncommon for dogs to get upper respiratory infections just like people. But he said in the last month or so, there's been an uptick in canine influenza, which has many dog owners concerned."Honestly, that makes me want to leave the dog park. I'm a little concerned about that," said Mary Dandrea, of Philadelphia.At the Schuylkill River Dog Run, there were a lot of dogs playing with each other on Wednesday afternoon, which could be a way for them to spread the flu."Canine influenza is considerably more infectious and transmissible than the typical bacteria viruses that we see, causing upper respiratory and tract infections in dogs. That's why it's more concerning," said Cole.Cole said a good way to keep your dog from getting the flu is to keep them away from other dogs."That spreads from dog to dog by coughing, barking, sneezing and can be shared on different surfaces and objects as well," said Cole."We also get concerned when they're like sharing water bowls," said Stacey Thomas, of Philadelphia.Cole says there is a vaccine available, but it's been on backorder in some locations. He's also heard reports that more is coming but recommends you speak with your vet to make sure it's available.He said it is important to remember, just like any vaccine, it's not 100% effective."There are vaccines available, but it takes some time just like any vaccine to be efficacious and there also might be some limited availability right now because of how much there's been going around the country," said Cole.Cole said most cases will be mild. So, just like with humans, make sure your dog gets plenty of rest.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 WPVI-TV.

Not everyone who contracts the flu visits a doctor, and not all flu deaths occur in the hospital, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention use mathematical modeling based on their surveillance data to estimate the total number of illnesses and deaths. The model considers factors such as testing frequency, the likelihood of seeking medical care and under-reporting on death certificates. Influenza can lead to death by pneumonia, congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – in which case, flu testing may occur too late or not at all. According to the CDC, counting deaths “only where influenza was recorded on a death certificate would be a gross underestimation of influenza’s true impact.” As an example, data from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, which is based on death certificate records, shows 9,435 people died from the flu in the 2019-20 season. This contrasts with the CDC estimate of 25,000 flu deaths over the same season. Still, unadjusted death certificate data can allow for an imperfect comparison of flu’s impact from year to year. During the 2017-18 flu season, 15,620 deaths were recorded via death certificates in the mortality surveillance system, the largest number of flu deaths in the last five years. In comparison, 932 deaths from influenza were recorded in the 2020-21 season. Aspects of the coronavirus pandemic have led to lower flu activity, health officials explained. Fewer people got routine health checks or tested for influenza in 2020 and 2021 than in previous years. Also, health measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19, such as quarantines, school closures and face masks, helped reduce the spread. The CDC provides mortality data at the state level, but data releases are delayed. The most current data available is from 2020, according to USA Facts. USA Facts is a nonprofit organization founded by Steve Ballmer, an American agnate and investor who served as chief executive officer of Microsoft from 2000 to 2014. That year, the states with the highest age-adjusted flu death rates were in Kansas, West Virginia and North Dakota, while Utah had the fewest, USA Facts reported. Most flu deaths occur among Americans aged 65 or older. For the 2021-22 season, Americans 65 and older died from influenza at a rate of 6.9 per 100,000. That mortality rate was more than three times higher than for any other age group. Vaccinations prevented an estimated 6,300 deaths in the 2019-20 flu season. In the past decade, vaccinations have prevented as few as 3,500 deaths in the 2018-19 season, and as many as 12,000 deaths in the 2013-14 season. Mandatory reporting has shown that 80% of children who die from the flu are unvaccinated, USA Facts related.

The rampant virus has jumped from Europe and Asia to North America — spreading shortly afterwards to bird populations in South and Central America. And it is no longer restricted to birds. In the United States, the list of wild mammals either killed by or culled over avian influenza outbreaks is growing: grizzly bears in Nebraska and Montana, a red fox in Montana, six skunks and raccoons in Oregon, a Kodiak bear in Alaska and more. Then in January, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported avian influenza in a young girl in Ecuador, the first such case ever in Latin America. The story of these outbreaks is playing out like the opening shots of a pandemic movie — with the scene-stealer from last October in Galicia, Spain. There, week by week, the mortality rate in a mink farm of 50,000 animals rose. Coming soon after another outbreak on the coast near Coruña, which left 27 seabirds sick or dead, avian influenza became a suspect. But sequencing revealed something more sinister: a mutation that had enabled the first-ever large-scale case of direct mammal-to-mammal transmission of bird flu. There have only been five human bird flu cases in the last year. But past human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have had a 53 percent mortality, according to the WHO. With the virus driving poultry shortages, killing droves of wild birds, and increasingly spilling over to mammals, the situation begs an overarching question: Could avian influenza evolve from an ecological disaster to a full-blown pandemic? The short answer: For the moment, the risk of consistent bird flu transmissions to — and between — humans is low, according to scientists. But the fast-proliferating avian influenza infection is becoming a contender virus that could drive the next pandemic, one with a mortality rate that, if it spreads among humans, could make COVID-19 seem mild in comparison. A woman steps on lime, set up by health workers who created a sanitation perimeter near chicken farms, as she walks home amid a health alert due to a bird flu outbreak in Sacaba, Bolivia, Tuesday, January 31, 2023 [Juan Karita/AP Photo] The mafia takes over Avian influenza is actually a catch-all term for several strains of flu. The strain typically of concern is H5N1, each letter-number pair classifying the types of bonding proteins the virus has on the surface. But to truly understand H5N1 and contextualise its recent proliferation, one has to rewind to the late 1990s in China. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Isabella Monne, a researcher with Italy’s Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie who recently studied the mink outbreak in Galicia, noted that in 1996, H5N1 emerged in Chinese poultry production. The dense quarters and high populations favoured the emergence of more virulent strains, which jumped to wild bird populations in 2005. This enabled the virus to spread further around Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Between 2003 and 2009, 468 human cases, primarily among poultry workers, resulted in 282 deaths. All the way through 2020, the number of host species and populations expanded exponentially. In all, the virus has killed 457 people in the last 20 years. Then, in 2021, a front-running clade, or family, of H5N1 variants executed a mafia-esque takeover. By the end of 2021, the 2.3.4.4b clade was not only behind the vast majority of new cases in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East — but had also jumped to Canada and the US. In 2022, the clan made its move to Central and South America, as well. With the rise in outbreaks among poultry and wild birds, the increase in mammalian infections is not surprising, Kaitlin Sawatzki, a molecular virologist and animal surveillance coordinator with Tufts University, told Al Jazeera, describing the cases of spillover to mammals as individual incidents. In birds, said Sawatzki, H5N1 is primarily a gastrointestinal infection that spreads through faeces. In order to infect humans, said William Schaffner, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University’s Division of Infectious Diseases, the virus has to attach to receptors in the lungs — receptors it lacks the ability to readily bond with. This forced adaptation to replicating in the lungs is why only poultry workers, who breathe in contaminated faecal dust, are typically infected. It is also why there had never been any large-scale cases of mammal-to-mammal transmission. Until Galicia.

In January 2023, a spike in deaths of seals in Dagestan triggered concerns over possible causes [Photo by Marine Mammal Research and Expedition Center/AFP] Minks, seals … humans? According to Monne, following outbreaks of H5N1 in local bird populations, the Galician minks were most likely infected by contact with wild birds. As Monne herself helped uncover, the virus, in the dense population of mammalian hosts, developed a mutation in a gene called PB2. While it is too early to know how much this contributed to the virus’ jump to minks, the PB2 mutation is known to increase the activity of an enzyme involved in viral replication in mammalian cells. This same mutation was also found in the strain of H1N1 swine flu that caused the 2009 pandemic, killing between 123,000 and 203,000 people worldwide. “The mutation is a signal that this virus is trying to cross the barrier between species and adapt to the mammalian population,” Wenqing Zhang, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) global influenza programme, told Al Jazeera. Sawatzki believes the mink case is not necessarily an example of sustained transmission. The PB2 mutation was concerning but did not enable the virus to jump to humans or other species. It was a dead end. No workers were infected. The minks were culled. The viral genome was sequenced and closely monitored. More concerning for her is last year’s mass mortality of harbour seals off the US coast of Maine, as well as the more recent deaths of 2,500 seals off the coast of Dagestan, Russia. Seals, she said, do not consume or get exposed to birds in quantities that would explain their high infection rates. The implication: While it has yet to be confirmed, the seals may have an as-of-yet unidentified, alternative route of infection in a wild population that cannot be as easily monitored or culled. A sign warning against entry to a white turkey farm is seen as part of an effort to prevent exposure to avian influenza on November 14, 2022, in Townsend, Delaware, the US (Nathan Howard/Getty Images/AFP) No immunity What does all of this mean for human health? There are two potential ways humans can get an H5N1 respiratory infection: from animals or through person-to-person spread. The latter has only been suspected in an exceedingly small and largely unconfirmed handful of cases — the most recent being from 10 years ago. Furthermore, many of the recent bird flu headlines have been a story of successful monitoring. According to Zhang, the WHO has been tracking influenza outbreaks and viruses for more than 70 years. The organisation actively sequences variants that arise worldwide, tracking mutations of concern as they arise — a capability that has only improved since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of an outbreak, the WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework mandates that a portion of any vaccines manufactured be donated to the organisation. Likewise, stockpiles of existing antivirals would likely be relatively effective against an outbreak. The threat of an H5N1 pandemic is not currently high. However, sooner or later, “there will be another influenza pandemic,” said Zhang. If the culprit of that pandemic is avian influenza, the consequences could be heavy. The flip side of H5N1 viruses rarely infecting humans is the complete lack of immunity to the virus, Zhang said. So if the virus did evolve a way to reliably transmit from animals to humans, or worse yet, between humans, it would almost certainly mean a pandemic. And there is a readily available mechanism for that evolution. Influenza viruses have an eight-segment genome. Each segment can potentially swap genes with other influenza viruses inside a host, a process known as reassortment. This, Schaffner told Al Jazeera, makes minks and swine — which can contract human, swine, and avian influenza viruses — potential mixing bowls. In, say, a pig simultaneously infected with a human-associated flu virus and avian influenza, this genetic reshuffling could result in a deadly new virus: one with H5N1’s virulence and mortality, and the receptors to precisely target humans. Partially empty shelves with eggs are seen at a grocery store Tuesday, January 10, 2023, in Orlando, Florida. The bird flu outbreak, combined with soaring feed, fuel and labour costs, has driven up egg prices significantly [John Raoux/AP Photo] Already a crisis Developing an entirely new vaccine would likely take six to seven months, said Schaffner. Existing stockpiles of antivirals, he said, would likely be consumed quickly. Thus, if the bird flu sweeping the world does lead to a pandemic among humans, it would probably fall on lockdown procedures to buy time for a vaccine. “COVID has told us about the effects of behavioural interventions,” said Schaffner. During lockdowns, “while we were social distancing and all wearing masks, we had a season with almost no influenza”. In the wake of COVID-19, people are practised at distancing procedures. Granted, another lockdown might be a hard sell to a weary public. Nevertheless, given the high mortality of historical H5N1 cases, Schaffner believes that once casualties start rising, people would likely toe the line — slowing the spread of a potential avian influenza outbreak. To be sure, there is only a slight risk of avian influenza targeting humans at the moment, but that comfort belies three concerning certainties. There will be an influenza emergency at some point; there are simply too many types of influenza, which mutate easily, and for which humans have limited resistance. Bird flu is a growing contender for the pandemic prize, threatening a mortality rate that far eclipses that of COVID-19. And in some ways, H5N1 is already a pandemic. It is a pandemic on the beaches of Peru, where more than 10,000 pelicans have washed ashore in recent months. It is a pandemic in the empty nests of seabird colonies the world over. It is a pandemic for those who rely on both the money and food provided by poultry production, who had to cull millions of animals in the past 15 months. Nutritionally, economically and ecologically, H5N1 is already a crisis. And despite the current low risks, the high-stakes threat of a bird flu pandemic among humans has the world at attention.

Video Ad Feedback (2017) What is bird flu? 01:12 - Source: CNN CNN — Avian flu has infected a record number of birds and some mammals across the United States, and scientists are keeping close watch. World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the risk to humans remains low but added, “we cannot assume that will remain the case.” Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Grizzly bears test positive for bird flu in Montana, officials say As with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 that is believed to have started in animals before spreading to humans, some animal viruses can mutate, jump species to make humans sick and spread quickly around the world. But highly pathogenic avian influenza is no Covid-19. Scientists are reassuring the public that, with a few rare exceptions, the virus hasn’t made the jump to humans at a large enough scale to trigger an outbreak. It has gone far beyond birds, though, and its recent spread among members of a separate species has some experts concerned about the way the virus is changing. What is bird flu? Avian flu is a type A influenza virus that originated in birds. The version that’s predominantly causing problems in the Americas and Europe is called H5N1. There are several subtypes, and H5N1 bird flu viruses commonly in circulation now are genetically different from earlier versions of the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since late 2022, scientists have detected this virus in more than 100 species of wild birds like ducks, seagulls, geese, hawks and owls in the US. Globally, this strain of the virus has actually been around a lot longer, said Richard Webby, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and director of WHO’s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. CALIPATRIA, CA - DECEMBER 18: Snow geese fly over the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, where some 30,000 geese winter each year in the Colorado Desert December 18, 2002 near Calipatria, California. Earlier this month, California's Imperial County rejected a historic settlement among state agencies that would have curbed the arid state's use of Colorado River water, allowing six other states to take their full share from the river. In response, U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton is threatening to cut California's share of Colorado River water if the dispute among water agencies isn't resolved by December 31.

By the 2000s, it had spread into parts of Europe and Africa and then got carried into the rest of the world through infected migratory birds. It came to the Americas more recently, Webby said. The first infection with this version of the virus was reported in wild birds in the US in January 2022, according to the CDC. The next month, the US Department of Agriculture announced an outbreak among turkeys in a commercial facility. Studies have shown that bird flu may spread to songbirds, but the ones that typically gather at feeders – such as cardinals, sparrows or blue jays – and those you may see on the street like pigeons or crows do not typically carry bird flu viruses that would be a threat to humans, according to the CDC. Ducks and geese can carry the virus without appearing sick. Poultry isn’t always so lucky. Fresh brown eggs sit in a carton in August 2010 in San Rafael, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Deadly avian flu sends egg prices soaring Highly pathogenic avian influenza carries “very high mortality rates” among chickens and turkeys. The disease can affect multiple internal organs, causing death in 90% to 100% of chickens within 48 hours of infection, according to the CDC. Because it can spread rapidly, farmers usually have to cull uninfected birds along with infected ones to prevent a wider outbreak. It is considered one of the largest known threats to domestic birds. As of Wednesday, 6,111 cases had been detected in wild birds in all 50 states, the USDA says. The virus has affected more than 58.3 million poultry birds in 47 states, according to the CDC. The sheer volume of cases means that the virus has a better chance of spilling over into other species, experts say. More animals getting sick Bird flu spreads through things like feces and saliva. It can also spread through contact with a contaminated surface. The virus has infected many mammals in the US, mostly in the West and Midwest, as part of the latest outbreak. In Alaska, cases have been reported among bears and foxes, according to the USDA. The virus has also been found in a bobcat in California, a skunk in Colorado, a raccoon in Washington, possums in Illinois and Iowa, a mountain lion and grizzly bear in Nebraska, seals in Maine and even a bottlenose dolphin in Florida. In total, 17 non-bird species have been infected in 20 states. Scientists say that all of those sick mammals probably caught the virus when they ate or otherwise interacted with infected birds. But in a concerning development last fall, the virus seemed to spread between mammals – perhaps for the first time – at a mink farm in Spain, according to a study published in the journal Eurosurveillance. The mink got bloody noses, developed tremors, lost their appetite and seemed depressed, the scientists said, and had to be killed to keep the threat in check. Baker's Lake From The Forest Preserves of Cook County Over 200 birds are suspected to have died from the avian flu at a Chicago-area forest preserve The virus did not spread to humans who worked at the mink farm, but what worried scientists were the multiple mutations found in the virus that made it distinct from sequences found in birds. One mutation made it better at replicating in mammals, although it’s not clear whether the mutation was in the virus before it got to the farm. “But it’s when it starts to spread from one mammal to the next mammal to the next mammal, it’s in those environments where we think it’s most likely that it will pick up these changes that allow us to switch hosts, and that’s why we get concerned,” Webby said. A handful of human cases There have been less than 10 known avian flu cases in humans since December 2021, and none has come from human-to-human transmission, the CDC says. The most recent US case was in a person in Colorado who got sick after culling infected birds in April. The person reported being tired for a few days. They were isolated and treated with an antiviral, according to the CDC.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) Morry Gash/AP Zoos are moving their birds indoors to protect them against a deadly strain of the avian flu The agency said at the time that the threat to public health remained low, but it urged people who had any kind of exposure to birds to take precautions. “People who’ve typically become ill are one of those individuals who have very intense interactions with wildlife either alive or dead,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity and the John Snow professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. “I wouldn’t say there’s another pandemic upon us, because it’s not. We’re not there. “What we need to do right now is to watch very closely the way this spreads. We need to contain it in farms and wildlife as best we can,” he added. How to stay safe Although the threat to people is low, the CDC suggests avoiding direct contact with wild birds. Webby says that if you need to handle a dead bird, such as removing it from a feeder, use gloves and a mask. Always wash your hands after touching birds or feeders. It’s safe to eat poultry and eggs that are properly handled and cooked, the CDC said. Bird flu is not a foodborne illness, and the poultry industry is closely monitored and has strict health standards that include monitoring and controlling bird flu. Always cook poultry and eggs to 165 degrees, a temperature that kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu. In the highly unlikely case that someone became sick, the CDC recommends getting treated right away. Most bird flu infections can be treated with currently available flu antiviral drugs, the agency says.

The US government also has a stockpile of vaccines, including against bird flu viruses, that could be used if this flu were ever to spread easily from person to person, the CDC says. “The chances are not zero that you could get this, and anything you can do to further reduce that risk is a good thing,” Webby said. “But you probably really have to work hard to be infected with this virus.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

CureVac is a global biotech company and a pioneer of mRNA technology. We have more than 20 years of expertise in using this versatile biological molecule for medical purposes. It started unexpectedly when our founder, Ingmar Hoerr, discovered that mRNA could be used as a vaccine or therapeutic agent after optimization when it was administered directly into tissue. This was a true breakthrough as, at the time, mRNA was thought to be too unstable for medical application. Since then, CureVac has built a broad pipeline across prophylactic vaccines, cancer immunotherapies, and molecular therapeutics. We are now in clinical development with our second-generation mRNA backbone for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, which was designed to improve intracellular mRNA translation for increased and extended protein expression. We plan to test the same backbone for therapeutic cancer vaccines soon.What prompted CureVac to work on a flu vaccine? As an infectious disease, seasonal flu is a promising target for prophylactic mRNA-based vaccines. The flexibility to encode different antigens is well suited to address seasonal changes in the influenza virus. mRNA vaccines can also be produced faster than protein-based vaccines, which need to be produced early in the year to be ready for the autumn flu season. If there is a change in the relevant flu strains after the start of vaccine production, vaccine efficacy for the season could be lower. For mRNA, vaccine production could theoretically start later in the year when it might be clearer which flu strains need to be targeted. This time advantage is one of the reasons why mRNA-based flu vaccines have the potential to be more effective.What makes mRNA so special as a vaccine? mRNA enables protein synthesis in the human body, carrying the genetic code required for cells to manufacture and express proteins. When used as a vaccine, specific proteins (antigens) are produced by the body’s own cells, enabling the immune system to mount a response and to prevent or fight disease.The plan for our flu program is to develop a multivalent flu vaccine that would allow the relevant flu strains expected to occur in the next flu season to be addressed. In the future, our technology has the potential not only to combine strains of flu but also other viruses, such as COVID-19, in one shot. What is the nature of CureVac’s collaboration with GSK? GSK is a key partner for CureVac in prophylactic vaccines. We first started working together in July 2020 to jointly develop new prophylactic vaccine products for infectious diseases, including flu, based on our second-generation mRNA backbone. This collaboration was later extended to the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, as well as modified mRNA vaccine technologies. The vaccine is progressing through the pharma pipeline – how far along is it and how smooth has the ride been? The flu program is currently in phase I clinical studies. Preliminary data from this study has been positive and we anticipate starting a phase I/II study in 2023.What else is CureVac working on? Our mRNA technology platform is very versatile and has many potential applications. We are particularly excited about its application in cancer vaccine development. Here, we can encode and combine different types of cancer antigens, such as mutation derived neoantigens or tumor associated antigens, that are strongly overexpressed by cancer cells versus healthy tissues in one vaccine. In short, this approach could enable the development of off-the-shelf cancer vaccines for specific patient populations sharing the same antigens but also a fully personalized approach where a vaccine can be tailored to a patient’s individual tumor profile. With our recent acquisition of Frame Cancer Therapeutics and our collaboration with myNEO, we are investing in cancer antigen discovery to create a strong basis for our cancer vaccine pipeline.

Now the poultry industry needs new measures to stop its spread.Photograph: LOIC VENANCE/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThis week, Argentina and Uruguay declared national health emergencies following outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, the fast-moving virus that destroys poultry flocks and wild birds, and for decades has been feared as a possible spark for a pandemic among people. That makes 10 South American countries that have recently marked their first-ever encounter with the virus, including Peru—where more than 50,000 wild birds died last fall, and more than 600 sea lions in January. Combine the sea lion infections with the revelation that H5N1 flu invaded a mink farm in Spain in October, and health authorities must now confront the possibility that the unpredictable virus may have adapted to threaten other species.To be clear, this does not yet include people. Although past decades have witnessed bird flu outbreaks that spread to humans, only two cases have been identified in the past 12 months: a Colorado adult last May, and a 9-year-old girl in Ecuador in January. (Neither died.) And there’s no evidence yet that the virus has been able to jump from newly infected mammals to people. But the fact that it was transmitted from bird to mammals, and then spread among them, indicates a disquieting trend.According to the World Organization for Animal Health, at least 60 countries have recently experienced outbreaks of H5N1, which is named for two proteins found on the virus’s surface. That includes the US, where 43 million laying hens were either killed by avian flu last year or slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading. Those losses took out almost a third of the national flock of laying hens; according to the US Department of Agriculture, they cut into egg supplies so much that prices at the end of the year were 210 percent higher than at the end of 2021. Overall, the USDA estimates just under 58 million birds—mostly layers, turkeys, and backyard poultry—died or were killed in 2022, and another half-million so far this year.The poultry industry is enormous. Just the US portion comprises more than 9 billion meat chickens and 216 million turkeys grown each year, plus 325 million laying hens; chicken is the most-consumed meat worldwide. That scale makes it difficult to put the losses from bird flu into context. But the ongoing epidemic has become the worst animal-disease outbreak in US history, as well as the largest poultry outbreak ever recorded in the UK, Europe, and Japan. And though surveillance is difficult, wildlife biologists say the damage to wild birds has been disastrous.There may be little that can be done to protect wild birds; avian flu is spread by seasonally migrating waterfowl, which carry the virus without being harmed by it. But the poultry industry relies on a complex set of behaviors and building features, broadly called biosecurity, that it developed or reinforced after a catastrophic outbreak killed more than 50 million birds in 2015. Given the virus’s relentless advance, people who study the industry are beginning to ask whether biosecurity can ever be hardened enough to exclude avian flu—and if not, what has to change to keep birds and humans safe.“We know that biosecurity can work and does work, but it’s a heroic effort, and it may not be sustainable given current building styles and current workforce,” says Carol Cardona, a veterinarian and professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine. “The reason I say it can work is that companies that had [highly pathogenic avian flu] in 2015 had fewer cases in 2022. So they learned some lessons and changed some things—but very few of them kept it out completely.”Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanThe relentless attack of H5N1 is important not just for its impact on poultry or wildlife, but for what it portends for people. Avian flu was long considered the animal disease most likely to break out into a global human pandemic, and even after the onslaught of SARS-CoV-2, many scientists still feel that way.The H5N1 subtype first spilled from birds to humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It sickened 18 people and killed six of them—small numbers, but a disturbing 33 percent mortality rate. Since then, variants of H5N1 have periodically infected people, causing 868 human cases through 2022 according to the World Health Organization, and 457 deaths. Those numbers represent a 52 percent mortality rate—but at the same time, an indication that the virus had not adapted enough to spread easily from person to person and ignite large outbreaks.Still, scientists are always watching for the virus to find situations that would encourage those adaptations. For instance: Spanish and Italian scientists disclosed last month that in October 2022, an H5N1 variant infected minks on a fur farm in northwest Spain. The virus might have been passed to a single mink by a wild bird, or via chicken carcasses used for feed. But once on the farm, it made minute adaptations that allowed it to spread from one mink to another. To stop the outbreak, all the farm’s minks—almost 52,000—were killed.That outbreak was unnerving, twice over. Not only had the virus begun adapting to mammals, but to a particular mammal that might have direct relevance for people. Minks belong to the same family as ferrets, which are already used by scientists for flu research because they develop symptoms in the same progression that humans do.But there’s a third reason why the mink outbreak was notable, something that is so normal in animal agriculture that it mostly goes unnoticed. The Spanish farm was not a property where minks gamboled freely while they grew their fur. Instead, it was an intensive farm where the animals were confined in cages. Most of the poultry farms affected in the US have been intensive confinement farms also, though what that means differs by bird species: large metal barns for broilers, barns and sometimes interior cages for layers, and mesh-curtained sheds for turkeys.Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanOperating in confinement doesn’t necessarily make a farm more vulnerable to infection, but once a virus penetrates the premises, confinement ensures that very many animals are exposed at once. That puts a lot of animals at risk—some of the egg farms wiped out by flu last year lost more than 5 million birds—and it also gives the virus a plethora of hosts to mutate in. This drives people outside the poultry industry to suggest that if very large farms pose a risk of amplifying a virus, maybe making them smaller should be part of viral defense.“When there’s public discussion of addressing zoonotic disease, it almost immediately turns to vaccination, preparedness, biosecurity—but no one discusses addressing the root cause,” says Jan Dutkiewicz, a political economist and visiting fellow at Harvard Law School’s Brooks McCormick Jr. Animal Law and Policy Clinic. “We would never have a debate about preventing cancer from tobacco products without talking about stopping smoking. Yet when it comes to zoonotic disease risk, there is a huge reticence to discuss curbing animal production.”That might be an unthinkable proposal, given that Americans ate an estimated 1.45 billion wings during the Superbowl last Sunday—and that as a culture, we’re not inclined to ask many questions about how our food arrives at our plates. “Industrial animal production operates and maybe even depends on a distance between the consumer and the realities and violence of industrial animal production,” says Adam Sheingate, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University who studies food and agriculture policy. “Most people really prefer not to know how their food is produced.” Still, he points out, when disease risks from food become clear, other nations respond rapidly—such as when the UK changed cattle-farming practices after Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, the human variant of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or “mad cow disease,” killed 178 people in the mid-1990s.“This is not to say we get rid of poultry,” says Andrew deCoriolis, executive director of Farm Forward, a nonprofit that works to improve farm animal welfare. “It's to say: We have to understand what are the factors that are the biggest risk drivers, and perhaps legislate changes to them. That could be moving farms out of flyways, it could be reducing the number of barns on a particular location, it could be reducing animal density within the barns.”Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanDreadful though it is, it’s possible to construe the current outbreak as an opportunity to begin gathering big data about what makes poultry production so vulnerable. Precisely because the disease has spread so widely, data could reveal patterns that haven’t been visible before—whether affected farms use certain feed or water systems, for instance, or buy just-hatched birds from specific breeding lines, or are sited in particular landscape features or lie under the migration routes of identifiable birds. “There isn't a lot of research to show what are absolute best practices, because viruses are stochastic—you don't know exactly when you're going to get an introduction,” says Meghan Davis, a veterinarian and epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.After the 2015 outbreak, which up to that point was the worst poultry producers could imagine, the industry focused on identifying the human networks that made its farms vulnerable. Companies tried to control how visitors might unknowingly expose them to the virus: through sharing housing with workers from another property, or driving a truck from an infected farm onto a clean one, or carrying mail or even a cell phone that might have been contaminated. The extraordinary expansion of H5N1 flu into wild birds now may mean that producers also have to think about how the environment itself invites exposure. Wetlands attract ducks. Copses shelter raptors that pursue rodents that scavenge spilled grain. It’s an approach that concedes that biosecurity can never be perfect, and that a production system can never fully seal itself off from the world.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each dayElection reaction: The manosphere wonThe Big Story: California will keep moving the world forwardTrump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's presidentEvent: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoMaryn McKenna is a former senior writer at WIRED.

Though the two companies are ending their Covid-19 collaboration, they’ll still work together on other respiratory programs, including a prophylactic influenza antibody drug that is in mid-stage clinical development. By Frank Vinluan on February 14, 2023 Share Share Options Share a link too this article Copy Link Copy Link Email Facebook LinkedIn X Vir Biotechnology’s Covid-19 research may yield more drugs and perhaps a vaccine, but no longer with the financial support of GSK. The collaboration agreement the two companies struck up in the early days of the pandemic has been amended, leaving Vir to either find another partner or continue its coronavirus research on its own. The alliance did successfully develop the Covid-19 drug sotrovimab. GSK and Vir will continue to share responsibilities for that drug, which is available under the brand name Xevudy in more than 40 countries. The U.S. is no longer one of them. Last April, the FDA withdrew emergency authorization for the drug due to its ineffectiveness against the omicron strains that became dominant. But in their announcement of the amended pact after the market close Monday, GSK and Vir said they will work together to ensure access to Xevudy in the markets where the drug is authorized.

By Eve McDavid - CEO of Mission-Driven Tech Vir and GSK began their alliance in the spring of 2020, a time when there were no FDA-authorized vaccines or therapies for Covid-19. The British pharma giant made a $250 million equity investment in Vir, beginning a partnership initially focused on developing two antibody-based antiviral drugs, one of which became sotrovimab. Less than a year after inking that deal, GSK committed another $345 million to expand the alliance to other respiratory viruses, including influenza. The respiratory programs stemming from the 2022 expansion of the alliance are still partnered. One of the programs, VIR-2482, is a monoclonal antibody intended not as an influenza treatment, but rather for preventing illness from the virus. This Vir antibody is designed to neutralize all major strains of influenza A, and it incorporates technology from Xencor that extends the drug’s half-life. That means VIR-2482’s protection could potentially last an entire flu season. Vir says VIR-2482 offers the potential to address limitations of current flu vaccines by providing higher protection through coverage of more flu strains without relying on an individual to generate an antibody response. The collaboration agreement gives GSK the exclusive license to lead development of this program after Phase 2 testing, which began last fall. Preliminary data are expected in mid-2023. VR-7832, the second of two Covid-19 antibodies from the original collaboration agreement, remains covered under the amended deal. Vir is now solely responsible for turning the collaboration’s research into next-generation Covid-19 products. If any of them reach the market, Vir would pay GSK royalties from sales. Vir is prepared to continue its coronavirus research alone, while also continuing to work with GSK on sotrovimab and other respiratory programs. Sponsored Post The Future of Hospitals and Pharma Companies Will Depend on Strength of Healthcare Analytics Insights PurpleLab® stands out from others in this sector by providing its data analytics services to several different groups of users across healthcare and pharma companies. By Stephanie Baum “Our collaborative efforts have also yielded a compelling portfolio of next-generation coronavirus solutions that, given Vir’s infectious disease expertise, we plan to pursue independently,” CEO George Scangos said in a prepared statement. “We look forward to advancing both efforts simultaneously and continuing to support urgent patient needs.” The ending of the coronavirus collaboration does not mean GSK is out of the hunt for new Covid-19 products. In 2021, the pharma giant entered messenger RNA research through an alliance with CureVac. Though CureVac faltered in its efforts to develop a messenger RNA-based vaccine for Covid-19, the new alliance aimed to leverage mRNA technology into multi-valent vaccines that could protect against multiple variants with a single shot. In GSK’s presentation of 2022 financial results earlier this month, Chief Scientific Officer Tony Wood noted that CureVac has encouraging early Phase 1 data for its flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. The data show potential for developing multi-valent vaccines. “We are excited about the potential of doublet vaccines and we are pleased with the progress we are making on both the Covid and influenza projects,” Wood said.

(Getty Images: Khaled Desouki)abc.net.auews/bird-flu-h5n1-global-pandemic-poultry-vaccination-wild-animals/101972756Link copiedShareShare articleA mountain lion, bear and skunk are some of the latest victims of bird flu virus spreading around the world.The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) known as H5N1 has scientists worried.Since 2021, the virus has gone gangbusters and made its way to every continent except Australia and Antarctica."We know the virus is extremely widespread in the Northern Hemisphere and is now starting to move into South America, which it's never done before," said Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza.The situation has become so dire that countries in the European Union and the US Biden Administration are now considering testing avian vaccines.Until now, many countries including Australia have been reluctant to vaccinate poultry because of the risk of bird flu spreading from vaccinated but asymptomatic poultry into other animals, as well as export trade implications.Experts believe the pandemic is so bad that vaccination is warranted — as long as it is done correctly. (Getty Images: China Photos)A spokesperson from the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) said the government was monitoring the international situation and supported vaccination when effective — and regularly updated — vaccines become available. "We encourage countries currently experiencing significant losses of poultry due to HPAI outbreaks to take up vaccination," they said.While routine vaccination for bird flu is currently banned in Australia, that could shift in the future."If Australia were also suffering or facing such losses, we would be encouraging our own industry to adopt vaccination," the spokesperson said.So why have things become so grim, so fast? And what is Australia doing to keep it at bay?Let's start with the virus itself.Evolution of H5N1 Bird flu is caused by a handful of viruses. Most of these are low-pathogenic viruses that circulate all the time in wild birds and cause little to no disease.Only certain strains of two subtypes — H5 and H7 — cause severe disease and death. These highly pathogenic subtypes first evolved in poultry then spread out to wild birds, then back again.Digitally colorised microscope image of avian influenza A H5N1 virus particles (seen in gold). (Supplied: CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith)H5N1 first appeared on the scene in 1996 but it only started to go global in 2003, according to Marcel Klaassen of Deakin University who has been monitoring avian influenza in wild birds over the past two decades.Then in 2014 a new lineage appeared in Korea and before long, it jumped from Europe into North America."Then I thought, 'Oh, man, now the shit has really hit the fan,'" Professor Klaassen said.Over the following four years there were more waves of bird flu, but nothing like the current wave that started in October 2021, driven by a new variant known as 2.3.4.4b.Professor Barr said there is now evidence this variant is hooking up with other bird flu viruses in North America, making it even more virulent."It's concerning that there's so much virus out there that has spread into so many species," Professor Barr said.How bad is bad?The death toll is staggering.Around half a billion poultry birds around the world — more than 58 million in the US alone in the past year — have died of H5N1 bird flu.And it's not just poultry. As headlines about turkey shortages in the lead up to Thanksgiving rang out in the US last year, veterinarians in Spain detected the virus in a mink farm that killed nearly 52,000 animals.Meanwhile, the official numbers only tell part of the story for wild birds, Professor Klaassen said.A pelican succumbs to deadly H5N1 bird flu in Peru. (Getty Images: Ernesto Benavides)"The number of wild birds recorded thus far is 100,000, but I think it's grossly underestimated."It's in the millions, rather than in the hundreds of thousands reported in the databases."Colonies of gannets have disappeared in Scotland, and at last count the disease has ripped through about 236 different wild bird species as diverse as bald eagles, vultures, pelicans and penguins."We have no idea how our wild birds are really impacted by this current lineage in the Northern Hemisphere," Professor Klaassen said, adding that COVID and the war in Ukraine had prevented monitoring of populations in Siberia.Why are we worried about the mink farm?The mink farm outbreak raised fears the virus had evolved to spread between mammals for the first time."If it is true, it's concerning because we haven't seen mammal-to-mammal transmission before," Professor Barr said.But, he said, it was still too early to tell if there had been mammal-to-mammal transmission, or if the minks, which were kept in open sheds, had come in contact with infected birds."I don't think you can jump to the conclusion, because there was an outbreak at the mink farm, that it was transmissible, even though it did affect a lot of animals."Mammals were known to be infected by H5N1 well before the mink farm outbreak.The spread of H5N1 bird flu in a mink farm has raised questions about intensive farming practices. (Getty Images: Mads Claus Rasmussen)"When this virus first broke nearly 20 years ago, it killed zoo animals like tigers when they were fed carcasses of birds that were infected," Professor Barr said.Since January 2021, there have been 186 outbreaks of H5N1 in mammals affecting 17 species including foxes, otters and seals, in addition to bears, mountain lions and skunks.Despite the name "flu", highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza cause more than a respiratory illness, often affecting the central nervous system and brain of mammals.The concern is if H5N1 becomes prevalent in mammals, it could mutate and spread more widely to humans.But so far the risk to humans from H5N1 is low, according to the WHO, which has registered a total of 868 cases and 457 deaths since 2003."Considering the number of wild birds and poultry that have been infected and disposed of, sometimes with not all the care you might like, the number of infections has been remarkably low in humans," Professor Barr said."It's concerning, but it's not panic stations at this time."Currently, another lineage of HPAI known as H7N9 is more of a problem for humans.What are we doing in Australia?If H5N1 entered Australia, it would decimate poultry and wild birds just as it has overseas, and there are fears some species, such the Australian black swan, could be wiped out. Why black swans are particularly susceptible to bird fluPhoto shows Close up of a black swanThe graceful black swan is a familiar sight in waterways across Australia, but it could disappear if avian flu ever takes hold here.Australia has had homegrown outbreaks of another type of highly pathogenic virus known as H7N7, which was caused by the evolution of low pathogenic viruses carried by local wild birds into a deadlier form.The latest in 2020 caused the culling of poultry on several free-range farms in Victoria.But Professor Klaassen said H5N1 would be harder to contain if it got into wild birds.Luckily, for now, Australia has a geographic advantage.Avian influenza in Europe, Asia and North America is mainly spread by large species of waterfowl that don't migrate to Australia.But there is a small chance H5N1 could be brought to Australia by migrating shorebirds.While a sick bird might struggle to find its way here from Siberia, the increasing amount of virus circulating in the Northern Hemisphere has upped the ante in the past 12 months.The chance of H5N1 flying in on the wings of a shorebird from Siberia are slim, but we still need to be vigilant, experts say. (Supplied: Queensland Department of Environment, Land & Water)Professor Klaassen and his colleague Michelle Wille of the University of Melbourne have been tasked with coming up with a risk assessment for Australia."We need to remain vigilant because even if only one shorebird migrates with HPAI onboard and arrives in Australia, this could trigger outbreaks," Dr Wille said.Their research on low pathogenic viruses identifies where and how wild birds could spread a highly pathogenic virus in Australia, and which species to target for surveillance. "We have essentially given ourselves a bit of a head start so that if things kick off, we don’t need to scratch our heads about how to best do surveillance," she said.What are the symptoms of bird flu in poultry?Sudden deathDifficulty breathing, such as coughing, sneezing, or raspingSwelling and purple discolouration of the head, comb, wattles and neckRapid drop in eating, drinking and egg productionRuffled feathers, dopiness, closed eyesDiarrhoeaSo far, the news is good. There have been no cases of H5N1 influenza found in migratory shorebirds that flew in before summer."That is remarkable that we didn't find this specific strain," Professor Klaassen said."And on top of that, there have not been any mass mortalities here." But this could change when the shorebirds return next spring after the breeding season in the Northern Hemisphere.Surveillance is also undertaken in commercial poultry flocks, and the disease is notifiable. "Commercial poultry producers should continue to have appropriate biosecurity measures in place to avoid wild birds coming into contact with their flocks," the DAFF spokesperson said."Strict border control measures and import conditions are also enforced to stop the disease from entering Australia via imported birds and poultry products."How effective is vaccination?While the European Union and the US are now considering vaccinating their poultry flocks, the practice is already used in Asia."The Western world has always shied away from vaccination because they want to eliminate any evidence of disease in the population and don't want these diseases circulating around," Professor Barr said."But if this virus is going to hang around and become endemic in some countries, I don't see any alternative, unless you have extremely good biosecurity in your animal husbandry."Professor Klaassen agreed, saying, "it's not looking good unless you do something dramatic like vaccination" but added that it must be done the right way.Research he conducted in Bangladesh shows vaccines wiped out signs of bird flu on poultry farms, but the virus continues to be spread by asymptomatic poultry, and circulate at high levels in live bird markets and wild birds."You can easily protect your poultry, but if you don't also protect your wild birds ... they become the victim."Dr Wille agreed, saying that vaccination reduced the amount of culling in the poultry industry and reduced spillover into other species."If we have learnt anything from the H7N9 outbreaks, it will likely decrease the number of human (and mammalian) cases," she said."But vaccines need to be effective, protective and administered properly, and post-vaccination surveillance needs to be done."Posted Thu 16 Feb 2023 at 7:00pmThursday 16 Feb 2023 at 7:00pmThu 16 Feb 2023 at 7:00pm, updated Thu 16 Feb 2023 at 8:59pmThursday 16 Feb 2023 at 8:59pmThu 16 Feb 2023 at 8:59pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBarron Trump and AOC give us clues about the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron stands with his mother and father Four foreign nationals found on Croker Island say they paid money to be taken to AustraliaTopic:Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander)Photo shows Croker IslandTeacher's aide may have saved lives of children in horror pre-school crash, police sayTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Floral tributes left outside a schoolRex given $80m lifeline, as ACCC warns Qantas controls 65pc of market and prices are upLIVEPhoto shows A Regional Express (REX) aircraft unloads at Charleville Airport in south-west Queensland.'I feel really ripped off': Artist slams Optus after alleged unconscionable sales conductTopic:Telecommunications Services IndustryPhoto shows An Aboriginal woman holding up a piece of fabric with artwork on itRelated storiesBlack swans are unusually vulnerable to bird flu.

The world’s largest northern gannet colony at the Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, Scotland has been recently decimated by avian influenza (H5N1) or bird flu. H5N1 has caused unprecedented loss of tens of thousands of birds in the U.K. The annual congregations on breeding grounds quickly turned into a super-spreader event as highly pathogenic H5N1 ripped through bird colonies, leaving many lying dead on the beaches or remote islands. The impact of this disease is very serious for bird conservationists. From epidemiological perspective, transmission from dead birds to scavenging animals such as sea lions, foxes, and gulls has posed serious risks. Recently, intra-mammal transmission of H5N1 in captivity in mink farms was recorded, posing a bigger concern in relation to zoonotic potential.In India, the latest major avian flu outbreak in 2020-2021 swept through many States causing mass mortality of wild birds which brought the concerns on the lack of active surveillance to the forefront, and how wetland and waterfowl habitats at the interface of poultry need to be monitored. India is a major wintering ground for many waterfowl that rely on the central Asian Flyway. While the avian flu outbreaks coincide with the peak migratory season leading to post-outbreak surveillance and culling, there are also reports of outbreaks in the off-season suggesting endemic transmission within the poultry sector. India is the fastest growing egg producer in the world, but unlike in Europe, poultry birds here are not vaccinated against flu. Furthermore, the farms with a diversity of animals or in the vicinity of nearby wetlands increases the potential for the viruses to undergo reassortment that can potentially generate more virulent strains — H5N1 or H7N9 — which could then infect humans. Despite this potential, there is no active surveillance in the poultry sector. There may be no efficient human-to-human transmission mechanism yet, however, the risk cannot be ruled out as the virus continues to evolve. We need an active and passive year-round surveillance network under One Health which connects monitoring of human and animals in a shared environment. The importance Wastewater-based epidemiology or pathogen surveillance has become an integral component of environmental surveillance providing near real-time information on health and community exposure to pathogens. While environmental surveillance is not a new concept and has been used widely for monitoring several pathogens, it offers an excellent tool.Birds infected with avian influenza virus shed large quantities of virus in their faeces, saliva and nasal secretions for about a week. Wild aquatic birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the primordial reservoir for the virus. The transmission of the virus within these wild bird populations is dependent on faecal/oral transmission via contaminated water. Avian influenza viruses have been isolated from unconcentrated water in lakes in the U.S., Canada and China. Recurrent infections of animal hosts with the virus have posed a persistent threat. Having a large-scale influenza A virus surveillance network in place across multiple sites is crucial for improving our understanding on the diversity, seasonal and geographical distributions of the virus in environments associated with poultry and wild birds. The surveillance needs to target the locations where spillover is most likely. Avian influenza viruses can remain viable for extended periods of time in surface water and carcasses, suggesting that lakes and wetlands can act as environmental reservoirs at variable temperatures for several months. In a study in Hong Kong, an H3N2 virus was isolated from faeces and pond water every month during a one-year period, and the maintenance of this virus was proposed to be dependent on environmental persistence and the continued introduction of susceptible ducklings. Domestic ducks are recognised as an important reservoir for H5N1. Environmental surveillance is an important area that can enhance the information on prevalence diversity of avian influenza viruses in free-ranging domestic flocks or under confinement conditions where faeces or other effluent are deposited into the environment.Virus surveillanceCurrently, virus surveillance is reactive and relies on sampling dead birds. Environmental surveillance would be a great non-invasive tool that can be done without disturbing the birds and can be used to obtain both host and viral genetic material. Most importantly, environmental surveillance should be complemented with effective carcass collection and testing, and better biosecurity on poultry farms to improve preparedness and response in the future.

The flu season is hitting its peak while there is still a significant amount of COVID-19 circulating, which creates an excessive burden on healthcare systems, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment across a broad spectrum of medical conditions. By addressing and preventing flu, it’s possible to deliver both a medical benefit and a broad public health impact.Has the pandemic affected how RQ Bio develops mAbs for influenza? Yes. We are using the pandemic as proof of concept for the value of mAbs in protecting vulnerable populations against a viral disease that drifts and mutates. We are applying these proof points to our development of antibodies to protect vulnerable populations against influenza.Though vaccines remain the cornerstone of active immunization, vulnerable populations that cannot build an immune response with vaccination can benefit from protection from other interventions, such as mAbs. We have seen this with COVID-19, and we believe that the same passive immunization approach will be valid for influenza. And that’s why we initiated a flu antibody discovery program.What’s involved in the discovery process? Finding a potent and broadly neutralizing antibody is extremely difficult because they are very rare. There are good reasons for this. It is in the virus’ interest to constantly mutate to evade our immune system. On the other hand, our immune systems favor potency, wherein we can fight today’s battles well, over breadth, wherein we can worry about tomorrow’s battle another day. These two factors explain why we can get infected multiple times by COVID-19 or flu. The beauty of our immune system is its potential to make millions of different antibodies. We look for extremely rare antibodies in human blood that have both breadth and potency against specific viruses. Millions of antibodies are scanned from multiple donors and we apply specific techniques for sieving these antibodies, including high throughput cell sorting and sequencing coupled with computational biology. Another way to increase our chances of finding them is to generate the antibodies by immunizing special strains of mice (which make human antibodies). Designing immunization strategies to increase the likelihood of finding these special antibodies is challenging as the immune system will naturally select for potency over breadth. Our team has specific expertise in both the immunization and the selection methods for identifying these needles in the immune haystack. What role has misinformation and/or mistrust played in the growing pressure on healthcare systems during flu season? On balance, I would say there has probably been improved trust in the biopharma industry following the scientific advances made during the pandemic. The industry came together – with other stakeholders – to produce effective vaccines, antibodies, and treatments in a timeframe that was previously unimaginable. I think many people realize it contributed hugely to saving lives and has been widely appreciated.That said, misinformation has long been the enemy of protection through immunization – going all the way back to the first vaccines. The role of education will continue to be a major contributor to public health. Improved education leads to better policy and improved vaccination rates across the eligible populations, which helps relieve pressure on healthcare systems.Will we ever see the end of flu? We are unlikely to see the end of the flu virus. But, as medical science continues to develop, we can hope that the impact of flu on public health – and society more broadly – will be less severe with the advent of new innovative preventions and treatments.

Monday, Nov. 11, 2024 | Today's Paper | 80.951° Hawaii News DOH: Hawaii keiki dies from flu By Hawaii Tribune-Herald staff | Sunday, February 12, 2023, 12:05 a.m. Share this story COURTESY PHOTO Hawaii Department of Health State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble. The state Department of Health on Friday announced its first pediatric influenza death of the season. The child was hospitalized at the time of death, but out of respect for the family’s privacy, the DOH said no other information about the child will be released. ADVERTISING “We are especially saddened to announce the death of a child in our community. Our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this difficult time,” said state Health Director Kenneth Fink in a press release. “If you or your loved ones have not received the flu vaccine this season, I hope you will consider doing so.” Hawaii’s last pediatric death from influenza occurred in January 2020. Over the last 10 years, the state has recorded six pediatric deaths due to influenza. “The restrictions we put in place for COVID-19 protected us from other respiratory viruses as well,” said state Epidemiologist Sarah Kemble in the release. “That’s likely the reason there were no pediatric influenza deaths during the last three years.” Nationwide, there have been 91 influenza-associated pediatric deaths this flu season. The latest influenza report from the DOH covering Jan. 15 through Jan. 21 confirmed outpatient visits related to influenza-like illness account for 3.3% of all health care provider visits for the state, with DOH noting this was lower than the previous week and is comparable to Hawaii’s historical baseline. “There has not been a significant increase over the past few weeks of flu cases in Hawaii County or the state overall,” DOH Epidemiologist David Johnston said in an email to the Tribune-Herald. “Rates have actually dropped over the last few weeks, but the season is not yet over.” The DOH added many respiratory viruses are circulating in Hawaii this winter, including flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus infection. With similar symptoms, the DOH noted it’s usually not possible to tell one from another without a test. Everyone six months of age and older is eligible for a flu vaccine, which is available at pharmacies, clinics, and health care facilities throughout the state. A list of locations can be found atvaccines.gov/. “Vaccination is one of the best ways to protect yourself against influenza, and it’s not too late in the season to get vaccinated,” Johnston said. “Flu vaccines for anyone 6 months or older are widely available from primary care providers and pharmacies.” PREVIOUS STORY S.

Before dying, the animals – majestic carnivores that can weigh up to 350 kilos – had been suffering from agonizing convulsions and struggling to swim. Nothing like this had ever been observed in the region. A scientific team of Peruvian and Argentine researchers has now confirmed that the mass mortality of the sea lions is due to the A(H5N1) bird flu virus, which has jumped from seabirds to these wild mammals. Researchers are not ruling out a terrifying hypothesis: that the virus may have learned to spread from mammal to mammal, as it apparently did on a Spanish mink farm. It would be the first time that this has occurred in nature.A total of 634 sea lions have been found dead in Peru. The leading theory is that the mammals were infected one by one, independently, by living with sick birds or eating their corpses, according to Argentine biologist Sergio Lambertucci, one of the leaders of the investigation. The scientist, however, points to a concerning episode on January 27, when a hundred dead sea lions were found floating in the waters of Isla Asia, less than 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Lima, the capital of Peru. “It wouldn’t be strange if a few of them had eaten infected birds, but all of them?” says Lambertucci, who is a researcher at the Biodiversity and Environment Research Institute in the Argentine city of San Carlos de Bariloche.Dutch veterinarian Thijs Kuiken, an expert on emerging diseases, is also skeptical of the hypothesis that each sea lion was infected independently. “Given the large number of specimens found dead, it seems more likely that there was direct transmission between sea lions,” says Kuiken, from the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam. “It’s worrying,” he continues. “This is the second mass mortality episode to suggest that this virus can readily adapt to efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission. If it can occur in mink and sea lions, why wouldn’t it happen in humans?”SERNANP technicians collect samples from a dead sea lion in Paracas National Reserve, on January 25.- (AFP)The A(H5N1) virus circulating around the world is a subtype of the highly pathogenic avian influenza. In Europe, it has caused the most devastating epidemic in history, with more than 50 million poultry slaughtered in just one year. The virus reached South America in late 2022, wreaking havoc in Peru, where it has killed more than 50,000 wild birds, mostly pelicans and boobies, according to data from Peruvian and Argentine scientists. The pathogen has jumped many times from bird to mammal, even to people in exceptional cases. In these case, however, there has not been mammal-to-mammal transmission. Scientists fear that the virus could mutate and cause a deadly pandemic among humans.Thijs Kuiken lists another reason for concern: “There is video footage showing people in Peru trying to rescue sea lions potentially infected with the virus. This close contact increases the chances of the virus being transmitted from sea lions to humans.” The Peruvian government has asked citizens not to approach the wild animals. On January 3, a nine-year-old girl from Ecuador – who was in contact with backyard poultry – was admitted to the intensive care unit in critical condition after being infected with the A(H5) virus. According to the World Health Organization, the girl recovered from the virus. It was the first reported case of human infection by this strain of the avian influenza in Latin America.In Peru, the 634 dead sea lions have been found on various beaches and protected areas in the country, such as the Paracas National Reserve. Researchers analyzed six specimens and found the virus in all of them. Autopsies of other specimens also detected traces of bird flu, i.e. hemorrhagic pneumonia in the lungs and hemorrhagic encephalitis in the brain. Lambertucci points out that sea lions are very social animals, living in colonies that are often overcrowded. “If you have to think of wild species with the highest probability of mammal-to-mammal transmission, you would look to social animals such as sea lions, which live very close to each other,” says Lambertucci.Sea lions in the Paracas National Reserve, in Peru, on January 25.- (AFP)Before publishing their findings on the sea lions, the team of Peruvian and Argentine scientists had warned that the arrival of the bird flu virus posed a threat to protected birds in South America, including the Andean condor. Faced with the mass mortality of the sea lions, the researchers decided to urgently publish the first draft of their study on the mammals, without waiting to complete it. “We wanted to raise the alert as soon as possible due to the worrying nature of the situation. It is the first case of mass mortality of wild mammals in South America and could be the first event of intraspecies transmission in wild mammals in the world,” explains Lambertucci. The Argentine biologist stresses that they will need to carry out genetic studies of the virus to confirm or rule out their hypotheses – work that will take weeks.Peruvian ornithologist Víctor Gamarra, co-author of the study, laments the slow reaction of the authorities. “We published the letter in Science precisely to draw the attention of Latin American governments to the need to do monitoring, an epidemiological analysis and to see what other species were affected,” explains Gamarra, from the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa. “There was an epidemiological silence, in which the public institutions stated that everything was under control. And suddenly these reports appeared of people finding dead sea lions all over the Peruvian coast. That is when the institutions began to take some samples,” says Gamarra. Among the Peruvian co-authors of the study, seven are members of the National Service of Natural State-Protected Areas.In Spain last year, there were 37 outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and another 138 cases in wild birds. In one of the outbreaks, on a farm with 150,000 laying hens in the city of Guadalajara, two workers became infected without developing symptoms. In October, the virus entered a fur farm with 52,000 American mink in Carral, a few minutes’ drive from the city of A Coruña. Mortality in this outbreak exceeded 4% in a single week. A study led by Montserrat Agüero, from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture’s Central Veterinary Laboratory, suggested that the avian virus mutated at the mink farm and was then transmitted from mammal to mammal. The Spanish outbreak set off alarm bells around the world. Even the British doctor Jeremy Farrar, newly appointed scientific director of the World Health Organization, warned on social media of the risk of “a devastating flu pandemic.”Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

It’s called HPAI: highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka “bird flu.”HPAI has been in the news for months, mostly in connection with commercial fowl. As Matt Cameron of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency emailed me: “The poultry industry has had to euthanize tens of millions of turkeys and chickens due to avian influenza … and there’s a definite correlation between wild and domestic birds.”I’ve been posing bird disease questions to wildlife officials since early January. That’s when Bill Nix told me about a boating trip he made with his grandsons on Fort Loudoun Lake. Their destination was a small island near Lakeshore Park.(Geography 101: The vast majority of Knoxvillians have never heard of, let alone seen, this island, even though it’s in plain view to thousands of daily commuters. Maps list it as “Lyons Island.” It’s a brushy, tree-covered dot in the main channel, about 400 yards downstream from the mouth of Fourth Creek. The best view is from Maloney Road, on the Blount County side of the lake. On the Knox County side, it’s briefly visible while traveling west on Lyons View Pike, just beyond Cherokee Country Club.)Nix and his grandsons found something bizarre: dozens of dead vultures.“Several were still on land,” he said, “and about 50 were in the sand 5-20 feet from shore on both sides of the island. We counted 55, and I’m sure there were many more (in thick vegetation) on the island.”Nix’s initial suspicion of the culprit (mine too) was the Christmas arctic blast. As he noted, “An 8-degree night with 20 mph wind might have been too much.”But then we both got to thinking about other vulture roosts in this area, none of which appeared to be affected by the weather.TWRA’s Cameron didn’t hesitate: HPAI.“We’ve also had reports of dead black vultures on the pedestrian trail that starts at Haw Ridge and runs along Edgemoor Road in Oak Ridge. We believe it’s because vultures are colonial birds and also more noticeable because of their size. We sent samples to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. They were confirmed positive for avian flu.”He added that HPAI has been confirmed in 26 wild ducks, a Canada goose and a bald eagle in Tennessee.Could some devious person have poisoned the roost, endangering animals that ate the carcasses?“It’s a possibility,” said Cameron. “But I don’t think poison is the issue. Avian flu has been known to spread to mammals that come in contact with sick birds. There are so many sick animals and scare food right now, a lot could be going on.”If anybody has other theories, I’d like to hear them. I suspect TWRA would like to know as well.Sam Venable’s column appears every Sunday. Contact him at sam.venable@outlook.com.

Some mammals are getting sick after eating dead birds. Carsten Koall / Getty Images Share On Thursday, Feb. 9, Colorado Parks and Wildlife published a press release detailing three recently-confirmed cases of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI or “avian flu”) in mammals; one black bear, one skunk, and one mountain lion. These cases join a growing list of instances in which the latest bird flu outbreak has infected wildlife other than birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is maintaining this list in a database on their website. So far, avian flu has infected at least 121 wild mammals in 21 states (that we know of). Here are the current numbers on the 16 non-bird species that have contracted avian flu since March 2022: American black bear (2) Amur leopard (1) Amur tiger (1) Bobcat (4) Bottlenose dolphin (1) Coyote (1) Fisher (1) Grey seal (1) Grizzly bear (3) Harbor seal (16) Kodiak bear (1) Mountain lion (2) Raccoon (8) Red fox (57) Skunk (8) Striped skunk (13) Virginia opossum (3) Of course, the next question is whether this strain of bird flu will jump to humans. Less than 10 human cases of H5N1 have occurred globally since December 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first case in the U.S. was reported on April 28, 2022. That person made a full recovery after a few days of fatigue. But while the World Health Organization considers the risk to humans low, that doesn’t mean things couldn’t change in the future. “Since H5N1 first emerged in 1996 we have only seen rare and non-sustained transmission of H5N1 to and between humans,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual press conference on Feb. 8. “But we cannot assume that will remain the case and we must prepare for any change in the status quo.” Bird Flu Outbreak in Colorado Wildlife On Oct. 8, 2022, a CPW official euthanized a black bear in Huerfano County, Colorado after he saw the bear having seizures, the press release reads. Officials froze the remains and sent them to a lab for a necropsy, which revealed signs of HPAI. “The decision to humanely euthanize the animal by our wildlife officer was made following the abnormal behavior and knowledge that numerous infectious diseases cause neurological symptoms,” CPW area wildlife manager Mike Brown said. “Extremely ill animals have difficulty moving and often act abnormally. While clinical signs of numerous diseases may be observed, diagnostic laboratory testing and necropsy services help determine the actual cause of death.” A month later, a striped skunk from Weld County tested positive for HPAI. Then, a dead mountain lion was discovered just outside Gunnison on Jan. 15, 2023. The mountain lion had necrosis, or excessive cell death, in its liver. It also had bronchointerstitial pneumonia, meaning its respiratory system was in bad shape. Domestic cats with HPAI showed both these symptoms. This prompted CPW to test the big cat, according to the press release. How Wildlife Get Infected Even though the list of infected mammal species is long and varied, they all share one common trait: birds and/or scavenging are part of their diet. That helps explains why some aquatic mammals are getting sick. As one example, a marine animal rescue team from the University of Florida discovered an infected bottlenose dolphin in Horseshoe Beach, Florida, in March 2022. UF veterinary students collaborated with state and federal labs to test the dolphin for avian flu, and they believe it must have interacted with a dead, infected bird at some point. “Although avian flu infection had never been documented in a dolphin, the high incidence of the virus in wild birds within the state in the spring—specifically aquatic bird species such as ducks, gulls, terns and herons—suggested that encounters between dolphins and dying or dead birds near the shoreline was not out of the realm of possibility,” UF assistant veterinary virology professor Andrew Allison said in a UF news release. The H5N1 virus is infecting mammals around the world. Smith Collection/Gado / Getty Images CPW points out that not all animals that consume an infected bird will get sick. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight direct consumption as the primary way other animals become victims of the current avian flu outbreak. This is also why the CDC has cautioned pet owners against letting dogs, cats, and other critters come in close contact with dead animals, especially birds. Current Bird Flu Outbreak Numbers According to the CDC, as of Feb. 8, the virus has infected 6,111 wild birds and 58,349,754 poultry birds. All 50 states have infected wild birds and 47 states have infected poultry. (In case you were curious why eggs are so hard to come by right now, the avian flu outbreak is the culprit.) Read Next: We’re Experiencing the Deadliest Bird Flu Outbreak in History. Here’s What All Bird Hunters Need to Know Of course, these numbers dwarf the current tally for infected non-avian wildlife species. But as more birds become sick, their position in the food chain spells trouble for all the species that feed on them. Summary The H5N1 virus doesn't discriminate against mammals. Here are some non-bird species the avian flu outbreak is impacting.

(Courtesy Kraft Heinz)Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest food companies with a very diverse product portfolio.It’s a company we at WATT Global Media cover primarily because it is the parent company of Oscar Mayer and is the sixth largest turkey producer in the United States, having slaughtered 308 million pounds of live turkeys in 2021.While more than 220 commercial turkey flocks in the United States have been depopulated in 2022-23 because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak, Kraft Heinz, at least to my knowledge, has not disclosed whether any of its flocks have contracted the virus.However, during the company’s quarterly earnings call on February 15, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, president of the Kraft Heinz North America Zone, spoke of at least one way the company is mitigating the HPAI outbreak.Abrams-Rivera did not mention the company’s live turkey operations, nor did he mention products that include turkey as an ingredient. He also didn’t specifically mention any of the sauces or products that contain eggs as an ingredient.What he did mention was a product in which consumers are expected to supply their own eggs. Just Crack an Egg, introduced by Kraft Heinz in 2018, offers consumers a hot egg scramble in less than two minutes, just by adding their own fresh egg.“Our team is making sure that we are adapting to every situation that’s happening,” said Abrams-Rivera. “I’ll give you an example of that. … The price of eggs got so high, we need to make sure that we are also adapting the products that go with eggs. So, a product like Just Crack and Egg, we needed to make sure we actually brought down the inventories and make sure we understand that consumers may be having a reduced demand on that type of product.”That was an interesting analysis, and one that makes me wonder. If Kraft-Heinz is scaling back its production of that product, what other companies are scaling back on production of food kits that require consumers add eggs?You know it’s happening, and possibly more than we may even realize.To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

The department said the strain is highly contagious and can spread and mutate between wild and domestic flocks of birds.The disease rarely infects humans. It poses a threat to poultry operations, however. Bird flu has been detected in wild birds as well as poultry in every state in New England.The Maine wildlife department said residents who raise domestic birds should contain and separate them from wild birds whenever possible. Residents should also be cautious about about getting bird waste on clothing or boots, and should sanitize thoroughly after encountering it, the department said.The hooded merganser is a small diving duck that is popular with bird-watchers.(Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Photo by CDC on Unsplash)VANCOUVER — This study will make you think twice about stepping outside for a breath of fresh air. A team of scientists from around the world confirmed millions of viruses rising into the atmosphere, traveling — sometimes for thousands of miles — and falling back down to the surface. The study, carried out by researchers from the U.S., Canada, and Spain, is the first of its kind to confirm viruses are being swept up into the free troposphere — the layer of atmosphere between the area where Earth’s weather systems develop — and below the stratosphere, where airplanes fly. The numbers are “astonishing” the researchers say; but remember, a virus is a tiny particle, little more than a strand of DNA and a mechanism for attaching to organic matter. Scientists aren’t suggesting the slightest bit that we should all return to spending our lives in lockdown again. Countless studies continue to point to the great health benefits from spending more time outdoors. “Every day, more than 800 million viruses are deposited per square meter above the planetary boundary layer — that’s 25 viruses for each person in Canada,” says University of British Columbia virologist Curtis Suttle, lead author of the study, in a media release. Scientists have been finding genetically similar viruses in disparate parts of the planet. “Roughly 20 years ago we began finding genetically similar viruses occurring in very different environments around the globe,” says Suttle. “This preponderance of long-residence viruses travelling the atmosphere likely explains why—it’s quite conceivable to have a virus swept up into the atmosphere on one continent and deposited on another.” Suttle and his team found that viruses and bacteria are often swept up into the atmosphere by attaching themselves to particles in soil dust and sea spray. The researchers used platforms in Spain’s Sierra Nevada Mountains to detect how many viruses and bacteria were settling there every day. They found billions of viruses and tens of millions of bacteria being deposited there per square meter every day. “Bacteria and viruses are typically deposited back to Earth via rain events and Saharan dust intrusions. However, the rain was less efficient removing viruses from the atmosphere,” adds study author Isabel Reche, a microbial ecologist from the University of Granada. The full study is published in International Society for Microbial Ecology Journal.

The viruses are sprayed 24/7/365 mostly by passengers jumbo jet airplanes however the pilots has no idea what the plane does when it reaches certain altitude then these viruses with many liquid chemicals mentioned in comments by other user(s)sprayed in the sky, then are brought down by rain. Only an idiot will believe in viruses flying 100s of miles up in the sky looking for some fresh air and soulmate to mate and reproduce and then come down and attack human ! Surely these dishonest scientists know a-lot more, not only about Chemtrails , they know about Aliens, Free energy technology, other interesting life in miklyway and other galaxies. scientists get paid and made scared to the powerful elites to sign a non disclosure agreement and keep quiet, These narratives provided and controlled by matrix as usual Watch a true story on youtube how a polish Dr was abused, black mailed then taken to court by FDA for 30 or 40 years due to his treatment would have screwed elite’s profits from Radiotherapy patients will die from radiation and chemotherapy, Basically the Scientists and FDA are working in one way or another way for alites’ interest who owns the pharmaceutical companies around the world, also the elites fund and invest in other pharma and universities across the globe, this is very large investment run and controlled by the elites loyal people known as friends who has common goal and interest to make as much profits as possible no matter if they make people or destroy this planet.

The trip landed avian flu in his chicken yard.He said the toll was immediate. One day his flock looked fine. The next day, hundreds were dead. Other birds staggered like they were drunk. Cottrell still gets a bit misty as he looks out at his near-empty chicken yard.“Losing that many birds, that much of an investment, you can’t claim it on insurance,” he said. “It was just a loss.”Bird flu has had a devastating effect on flocks this year across the country, not just in the Northwest. With more than 58 million birds affected, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, most Americans have seen egg prices surge – and there may not be much relief on the horizon.Chicks are selling fast and it's not even spring yet. High egg prices and spotty availability has many starting up their own backyard flocks. Courtesy of Spring Creek Heritage FarmsChicka-boomSome Americans are turning to backyard flocks, and that’s led to a boom in chick sales.Suzanne Chandler, north of Bellingham, Washington, showed off her chicks in their brooder box on a recent February day. The box is where the small birds arrive right out of the hatcher. They're whisked under a heat lamp and nestle into a pile of their friends.”Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep!” Chandler exclaimed. “What’s that scary camera thing? They’re so cute!!!”Chandler hatches more than 100 chicks a week at Flower Feather Farm during the peak season. This year – like many hatcheries and feed stores across the country – she's seen a dramatic increase in orders.“It’s up 300%from last January,” Chandler said. “January is usually kind of a slow month. People aren’t really interested in it yet. January is still winter and chicks are seen as a spring thing. But man, we hit Boxing Day and the inquiries started coming in.”Right now, she and other chick breeders have a chick-before-the-egg situation.“We’re at where every chick is spoken for before the egg has even been laid,” she said.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorMany of the families Chandler sells to have never owned chickens before. She’s had people from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Montana come in person to get chicks.“That’s part of the joy of what I do, is getting new families kind of educated and mentored. I even rent them the equipment so they don’t have to buy all the brooder equipment,” Chandler said, “so that they can get started having their own chickens, and their own hens, and their own food supply.”That new-chick-education these days is requiring a heavy dose of reality about biosecurity and avian influenza.BiosecurityAnother nearby Washington farm, called Spring Creek Heritage, sends chickens across the United States via the mail. Spring Creek owner Matthew Nelson tends to some very rare breeds of chickens.“With these flocks that we have, some of them have been challenging to get over the years. Like the Hungarian yellows for example,” he said.He said the yellows are the perfect color to blend in with their surroundings in the field – they’re a hearty, wily bird – able to evade hawks and coyotes. The birds originally came over to America decades ago. But there are not many of them left in the world, according to Nelson.“They consider that one of their national treasures – the Hungarian yellow and the naked necks,” he explained. “The naked neck has been pretty well preserved but the Hungarian yellows have gone through a couple of bottlenecks in the genetics where it’s gotten pretty thin – and you get down to such a low number of birds it’s hard to replicate that.”Nelson said he is trying to get 300 females and around 40 males to increase genetic diversity. And that’s even more pressing because of the ongoing influenza wave.Nelson is strict about the biosecurity at his place. He said he’ll invite very few visitors to his farm. Chicken fan hangs? That happens at a local coffee shop. He says sometimes that’s tough to explain to people who are used to touring farms, but others enjoy the cluck and dagger.“Some people enjoy it because it’s almost like, ‘Hey I’ll meet you in the parking lot behind McDonald’s and we’ll do the chicken exchange there,’” Nelson said. “A lot of people think that’s fun. As much as I would love to have them over – we can’t because once it’s gone, it’s gone.”Chicks are in short supply as more people seek to have their own egg layers. But biosecurity concerns with avian influenza have to be top of mind, state veterinarians say. Spring Creek Heritage Farms Oregon’s state veterinarian, Ryan Scholz, said people should really consider the risks before turning to backyard flocks as a way to relieve the high egg prices.“Maybe you should pause one extra time,” Scholz said. “When you think you’re ready to go get those chicks, give yourself one extra day to think through that disease risk.”With spring migration coming up, more birds will soon be moving around with the virus. And bird flu isn’t the only thing to worry about, Scholz said. Baby chicks often carry salmonella.“Making sure if you’re handling those chicks; washing your hands really well,” he said. “And supervising small children – both for their safety and for the little chicks as well. I know my daughters have to be supervised very closely – otherwise those chicks end up in a mouth, or getting dropped on their head if you’re not careful.”Scholz advised new chick owners to keep nest boxes clean, wash eggs in tepid water, and to cook home-laid eggs properly.Still, Chandler, the chick grower, said nothing beats the cuteness of few-day-old chicks off to their new homes with a loving family. She usually places the baby birds in plastic milk cartons, so children have an easy-grip handle and can see their chicks through the fuzzy plastic.“They are picking at the shavings that are under them, they are looking at what’s around them,” Chandler said. “If someone puts their hand in and rests it gently on the chicks they will just kinda melt under it. They just feel like it’s mommy’s wing and they’re like ‘Oh mommy, we’ve been looking for you.’ And they’ll just say, ‘peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.’ And it’s so cute.”THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

ReutersAt least 60 countries have killed poultry in response to bird flu outbreaks since October 2021, according to data the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health provided to Reuters. Countries ranging from the United States and Britain to France and Japan have suffered record losses of poultry in outbreaks of avian flu in the past year. The disease, which experts said is being spread by migratory birds, reached South American nations such as Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia for the first time.

Among the countries affected are India, Taiwan, Nepal, Peru, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Niger, the intergovernmental group has said. WHAT BIRDS CAN BE INFECTED?Wild birds including waterfowl like ducks can carry bird flu viruses without appearing sick and easily spread them to domesticated poultry like chickens and turkeys, experts said. CAN OTHER SPECIES BE INFECTED?Mammals including bears, seals, foxes and skunks have been infected with H5N1 avian flu, authorities said. WHAT HAPPENS TO POULTRY THAT BECOME INFECTED?Highly pathogenic avian flu, such as the type that is circulating globally, can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs, with mortality up to 90% to 100% in chickens, often within 48 hours, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If one bird in a flock has avian flu, farmers usually cull all their birds to prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT FOOD SAFETY?As part of government response plans, infected birds are excluded from the food supply. Additionally, avian flu is not transmissible by eating properly cooked poultry and eggs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. HOW DID THE OUTBREAK GET SO BAD?The ongoing global outbreak of H5N1 avian flu traces back to the first detection of the goose guangdong lineage of the H5 virus in Hong Kong in 1996, disease experts said. Dabbling ducks in Asia adapted over time so they could carry the virus without dying, said John Clifford, a former chief veterinarian for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The virus then made its way into breeding grounds and through migratory pathways around the world, said Clifford, now the veterinary trade policy advisor for the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, an industry group.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onavian flubird flubird flu indiaH5N1 avian fluindia bird flu(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

(Reuters: Ronen Zvulun)abc.net.auews/australian-experts-worried-mammals-died-from-bird-flu-in-europe/101975148Link copiedShareShare articleMillions of birds have died from a new strain of avian flu sweeping the globe and while it has not been detected in Australia yet, experts are worried the virus also has been detected in mammals. Key points:Authorities have confirmed seals that died on the Scottish coast had avian fluA Deakin University study has found shorebirds and waterfowl are common carriers of avian flu virusFederal biosecurity authorities say migratory birds and commercial flocks are being monitoredThe new H5N1 avian influenza strain has ripped through birds across every continent except for Australia and Antarctica, killing hundreds of millions of wild and farmed birds globally in the past year.This week authorities confirmed four dead seals in Scotland died last year of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and so far about 70 other mammals including otters and foxes have tested positive for the strain of the virus.New research has revealed migratory birds could transport the virus to Australia, with wider worries the virus could be transmitted to humans.In 2020 and 2021 six Victorian farms, including an emu farm, were forced to cull almost half a million birds after multiple outbreaks of bird flu involving three different strains of the virus.Avian flu variant 'needs tighter biosecurity'Deakin University chair of ecology Marcel Klaassen said the new foreign variant was highly pathogenic and a potential threat to Australia, and more monitoring was needed."You should think about it the same way as with COVID-19. Coronaviruses are omnipresent but certain strains can cause a problem," Professor Klaassen said.A Deakin University study reviewed more than 10,000 birds over the past decade and found waterfowl and shorebirds were common carriers of avian influenza virus, but it could be passed on to other bird species as well.Professor Klaassen warned millions of shorebirds migrated between Australia and Asia and "they could form the bridge for this virus to come to Australia"."We really have to be on guard," he said.What is bird flu and how dangerous is it?Photo shows A close-up of a brown chicken with a red combThe COVID-19 pandemic may have crushed seasonal flu to historically low levels, but another type of flu — avian influenza or bird flu — has shown no signs of slowing.Professor Klaassen said stopping bird migration was not possible, but additional biosecurity measures should be implemented to prevent the virus from infecting the poultry industry.He said 70 per cent of global bird population was farmed poultry, "and they are ultimately the ones that keep the nasty viruses going"."So we should be on the ball to monitor our wildlife."The federal Department of Agriculture's website states "eggs, meat and poultry products in Australia are safe to eat"."Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 globally have increased our level of risk for incursions of HPAI viruses of global concern," the website states."Migratory birds returning to our shores annually between September and November may introduce HPAI viruses." Three wet years have boosted wild waterbird populations. (Supplied: Kerry Vickers)Virus can move between animals and humansProfessor Klaassen said the virus was a zoonotic disease, meaning it could be transmitted between species from different animals to humans."There are already a lot of cases where it has jumped from birds to seals, minks, foxes, all kinds of animals, and unfortunately there are also people that become infected," he said.While he stressed there was currently no threat to Australia, he urged authorities to monitor birds entering Australia when the next migration season started in September.A federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry spokesperson said the department was "closely monitoring the evolving international situation", but said the risk of HPAI viruses being introduced to Australia was low.The department has a national wild bird surveillance program that collects samples from "wild birds, including waterfowl and shorebird species, at targeted sites such as wetlands and tested for avian influenza viruses".It also monitors commercial poultry flocks.The department spokesperson said to date "thousands of Australian wild bird samples have been tested with no high pathogenic strains of avian influenza detected in our wild birds"."A recent study has also confirmed that there continues to be no evidence of HPAI in inbound migratory birds at the end of 2022."Australia is well prepared to respond to an avian influenza outbreak," the spokesperson said.Low risk but vigilance is needed, chief vet saysVictoria's chief veterinarian Graeme Cooke managed the 2020-2021 avian flu outbreak in that state, which was Australia's largest-ever breakout.He said the current strain in the northern hemisphere was particularly troubling because "normally it would be seasonal, and it is now showing it can persist throughout the entire year".However, he said Australia was not on the path of major migratory birds so the risk to Australia was low.But he warned poultry farmers to be vigilant."It's always important for poultry farmers to have good levels of biosecurity to keep their birds separate from wild birds where possible," Dr Cooke said."For example don't let them feed from the same source as the wild animals."Get the latest rural newsVisit ABC Rural for agriculture and mining news, including weather and the marketsSign up for Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, in your inbox every Friday, or for Rural news daily.

Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP Follow usnews Copy A+ A- AFP Washington: US biotech company Moderna said Thursday it had mixed results from a large-scale trial of its mRNA flu shot, based on the same technology used in its successful Covid-19 vaccine. Moderna's experimental mRNA-1010 flu shot is "quadrivalent," meaning it targets four strains of flu: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria -- selected based on recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Massachusetts-based company said that its flu shot generated an immune response against influenza A strains that was equal or superior to that of already licensed vaccines. However, it fell short of the already approved vaccines against strains of the less-common influenza B, Moderna said in a statement. "Today's results represent an important step forward in the development of mRNA-based influenza vaccines," Moderna president Stephen Hoge said. "We have already updated the vaccine that we believe could improve immune responses against influenza B and will seek to quickly confirm those improvements in an upcoming clinical study." The Phase 3 trial of the mRNA shot involved 6,102 adults in Argentina, Australia, Colombia, Panama, and the Philippines during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season. Participants received a single dose of mRNA-1010 or a single dose of a licensed influenza vaccine. Moderna said 70 percent of the mRNA-1010 recipients reported adverse reactions such as headaches, swelling and fatigue compared to 48 percent in the other group. Virus strains have to be selected six to nine months before the vaccines are intended to be used, and their efficacy is approximately 40 to 60 percent. Moderna is simultaneously conducting an efficacy trial of its vaccine. Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers, including Sanofi, hope that mRNA technology -- which provokes an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells -- can accelerate immunization development and production, and heighten efficacy. There are some three to five million severe influenza cases annually worldwide and between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths, the WHO says. Moderna's stock price was down more than six percent in after-hours trading in New York.

Image used for representational purpose only GURUGRAM: The H3N2 influenza virus is behind the sudden spike in cases of viral infection and respiratory issues across Delhi-NCR, doctors have said.The symptoms are cough, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, fever, body ache, and diarrhoea in some cases. The infection usually lasts for about five to seven days. The fever goes away at the end of three days, but the cough can persist up to three weeks, according to doctors.âWe are witnessing 40% of the viral fever cases with H3N2 currently,â said Dr Amitabh Parti, director of internal medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram.âSeveral people are coming to the hospital with post-viral bronchitis because of H3N2. This occurs when an immune reaction in the airways in the lungs after the acute infection of the virus settles down, and that produces spasm, shortness of breath, persistent dry cough with heaviness in the chest,â he said. Doctors recommend patients to wear masks to curb the spread of the infection as it can lead to complications in people with comorbidities.HaryanaJammu & KashmirHaryanaAlliance ViewiParty ViewSeats: 90ResultsMajority: 46BJP48CONG37INLD2AAP0OTH3Results: 90/90BJP WONJammu & KashmirAlliance ViewiParty ViewSeats: 90ResultsMajority: 46JKNC42BJP29CONG6PDP3OTH10Results: 90/90HUNG ASSEMBLYSource: PValueâYes, there is definitely a spike in viral cases at present. This is not unusual. Every year during January and February, the viral cases rise because of weather conditions. People need to take precautions. Most of them are getting better within a week,â said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.People who are at higher risk of developing complications if they get seasonal flu are children younger than five years, people aged 65 years and above, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems and neurological conditions). Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, said, âWe see a rise in viral infection every year during this season.

We may earn a commission if you buy through links on our site.Noam Galai/Getty ImagesGive It a ShotPeak time for seasonal flu in the United States generally falls in January or February, but activity can erupt as early as October. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone over six months get a flu shot, and with the coronavirus pandemic still in the mix, it's more important than ever to prepare for flu season. When scheduling your shot, you probably have a few questions: Will it hurt? Can I get it at Costco? What does a Walgreens flu shot cost without insurance?Under the Affordable Care Act, all marketplace insurance plans must cover the cost of the vaccine — although some set limitations on where free flu shots are administered. Free flu shots are also available under Medicare and many other health plans. But getting a flu shot without insurance at a doctor's office or health center can be costly, and cheaper trivalent vaccines have all but disappeared in favor of quadrivalent vaccines, which protect against four strains of influenza instead of three.To find the cheapest place to get a flu shot — as well as which retailers are administering flu shots — Cheapism checked vaccine prices at some of the country's largest pharmacy chains. We also checked prices at Costco and Sam's Club, which are known for low prices and allow non-members to use their pharmacies. Note that prices, services, and availability may vary by location.jetcityimage/istockphotoKroger: $90Both quadrivalent flu shots and the high-dose vaccine that is recommended for adults 65 and older are available at Kroger pharmacies this year, though at a much higher price than other pharmacies on our list. The quadrivalent flu shot is $90, while the high-dose shot is $128. One sliver of good news: You'll receive a coupon for $5 off your next grocery purchase if you get your flu shot by Nov. 5.Related: 31 Things to Know About Cold and Flu SeasonKen Wolter/shutterstockWalmart: $36Walmart pharmacies are offering a quadrivalent vaccine for $36 this year, while a high-dose flu shot is available for just over $80. With a discount card, however, the costs of a flu shot dip to around $27 and $79, respectively.slobo/istockphotoRite Aid: $50A quadrivalent flu vaccine at Rite Aid is competitively priced at $50. But to get vaccinated with a high-dose flu shot, the cost is $90 without health insurance, which is higher than many other retailers.City of Angels/shutterstockWalgreens: $43Wondering how much a flu shot is at Walgreens without insurance? A Walgreens flu shot costs $43 for the quadrivalent option. The high-dose flu shot for seniors, with four times more antigen than standard-dose flu vaccines, is $70.Related: 15 Simple Ways to Protect Against Colds and Flu This SeasonNoDerog/istockphotoCVS/Target: $50CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores, offer quadrivalent flu shots for about $50. Immunization with a high-dose flu shot for seniors costs $95. However, according to pharmacists we spoke with, you can get a flu shot for less at most locations by asking for a discount card, which lowers the price to about $30 to $35 for the quadrivalent vaccine and $50 for the high-dose vaccine. Plus, if you schedule your appointment online, you can get a $5-off-$20 coupon after your vaccination.Related: America's Healthiest States for Seniors, Rankedjmoor17/istockphotoSam's Club: $20-$23Members of Walmart-owned Sam's Club with pharmacies can get quadrivalent flu shots for $20 to $23 and high-dose flu shots for $45 to $50.

The chain is advertising a coupon for 10% off your next grocery purchase up to $200 with any immunization, which could make this the best deal for Safeway shoppers who need to stock up. A high-dose shot for seniors can cost in the $70-to-$100 range, depending on location and availability of the discount card, according to pharmacists we spoke with.Related: 130+ Senior Discounts on Products and Services (Some Starting at Age 50!)Jonathan Weiss/shutterstockMeijer: $25The Meijer chain offers quadrivalent flu shots for $25 with a coupon card. Immunization with the high-dose vaccine costs $68 at Meijer stores, which are found in the Midwest.Jonathan Weiss/shutterstockCostco: $20As it has in years past, Costco offers one of the cheapest seasonal flu shots. Members and non-members alike pay $20 out of pocket for a quadrivalent vaccine — half the price of most other places. Seniors in need of the high-dose flu vaccine should also head to Costco for the lowest price by far: just under $47.Related: Health Products and Services That Cost Less at CostcoByjeng/istockphotoSome Employers: FreeAnother option (and the cheapest) is to get a free flu shot through an employer. To help keep employees from getting sick, many companies organize seasonal-flu-shot days for employees and their family members, and the vaccine is often free. Check before heading to a pharmacy to get your yearly dose this season.There are also other ways to save money. Many free clinics, local health departments, and other organizations offer low-cost or free flu shots. Military personnel can call their local Veterans Affairs clinic, and many colleges offer free shots to their students.Editors' PicksScientists Urgently Warn: Stop Drinking Bottled WaterDoes the Infinity Hoop Work?
