Influenza Pandemic of 1918-19: The influenza pandemic of 1918-19, also known as the Spanish flu, caused approximately 40 million deaths globally. Misinformation and conspiracy theories regarding the origin and spread of the virus emerged, including rumors that German submarines or German agents spread the disease. The pandemic coincided with the end of World War I, and rumors circulated that aspirin produced by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer was responsible for the outbreak. The use of aspirin in high dosages during the pandemic may have worsened symptoms, though this was not due to intentional tampering. The naming of the pandemic as the "Spanish flu" caused controversy, as it did not originate in Spain and the name likely emerged due to misinformation. Addressing misinformation and conspiracy theories is crucial in fostering public trust and compliance with preventive health measures. Lessons from past pandemics, including the 1918 flu and COVID-19, highlight the importance of public compliance with health measures such as vaccination, social distancing, and hygiene in reducing virus transmission.
