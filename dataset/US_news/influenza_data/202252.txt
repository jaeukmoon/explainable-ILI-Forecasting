Although the interactions between a single antibody and a single virus are routinely characterized in exquisite detail, the inherent tradeoffs between attributes such as potency and breadth remain unclear. Moreover, there is a wide gap between the discrete interactions of single antibodies and the collective behavior of antibody mixtures. Here we develop a form of antigenic cartography called a ‘neutralization landscape’ that visualizes and quantifies antibody–virus interactions for antibodies targeting the influenza hemagglutinin stem. This landscape transforms the potency–breadth tradeoff into a readily solvable geometry problem. With it, we decompose the collective neutralization from multiple antibodies to characterize the composition and functional properties of the stem antibodies within. Looking forward, this framework can leverage the serological assays routinely performed for influenza surveillance to analyze how an individual’s antibody repertoire evolves after vaccination or infection.

However, it is difficult to quantify the inherent tradeoff between antibody potency (how well a virus is neutralized) and breadth (how many different viruses are neutralized). This tradeoff is especially important for rapidly evolving viruses such as influenza, where we seek antibodies that are both highly potent and broadly neutralizing1,2,3. Because these goals can be mutually exclusive, and because characterizing new antibodies is time- and resource-intensive, we need a framework that extrapolates the behavior of a few antibodies to describe other phenotypes.The situation is further complicated in the context of multiple (polyclonal) antibodies, as in our immune system. With every infection or vaccination against the influenza virus, our antibody repertoire is reshaped, leading to a complex immune landscape whose ability to protect us from past and current strains is difficult to quantify4,5. Although much effort has been devoted to measuring individual antibodies and predicting the effectiveness of their combinations6,7,8,9, the inverse problem using a mixture’s collective behavior to characterize the antibodies within is intractable without a framework to enumerate all antibody–virus interactions. In this Article we create such a framework, which provides a unique perspective to computationally dissect mixtures.To that end, we characterize antibody–virus interactions based on the techniques of antigenic cartography10,11 and antibody fingerprinting12. Antigenic cartography creates a low-dimensional map from hemagglutination inhibition titers that quantifies the tradeoffs in how potently and broadly sera can inhibit different groups of viruses. Although this technique imposes a structure for how sera can behave, it is unable to characterize the antibodies within a given serum nor predict the level of inhibition offered when sera are pooled together. Moreover, hemagglutination inhibition only characterizes antibodies binding to the head of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neglects antibodies targeting the HA stem, which generally inhibit a broader set of viruses1 and which are being assessed in clinical trials as therapeutics13.A complementary method that partially offsets these drawbacks is antibody fingerprinting, which links the behavior of individual antibodies and antibody mixtures. The neutralization of large panels of antibodies is first clustered to identify patterns or ‘fingerprints’12. By applying this process in reverse, neutralization from polyclonal sera can be decomposed to identify constituent antibodies from the original panel.In this Article we create a neutralization landscape that characterizes the interaction between HA-stem-targeting antibodies and influenza viruses. This approach pushes beyond cartography and fingerprinting in three key ways. First, as in cartography, we apply multidimensional scaling to antibody–virus measurements and project them into two dimensions (2D), but we do so at the level of individual antibodies rather than sera. By shifting the focus to antibodies, we quantify neutralization in absolute units without normalization factors, and we avoid the tendency of polyclonal sera to disrupt the map structure by drawing together antigenically distinct viruses. Moreover, whereas the composition of sera is generally unknown, and hence antigenic maps represent an amalgam of antibodies targeting multiple antigenic sites, the composition and binding site of an individual antibody can be precisely quantified, resulting in a more accurate and interpretable landscape.Second, this landscape serves as a discovery space for new antibodies and viruses. We empirically demonstrate that a 2D distance function (or metric) characterizes the >1,000 antibody–virus interactions we measured. By positing that other stem antibodies and viruses will be well characterized on the observed landscape, we can enumerate the range of antibody behaviors. For example, we can visualize the potency–breadth tradeoff (quantifying how antibodies inhibiting more diverse viruses must have decreased neutralization) and predict the maximal potency of an antibody against any set of mapped viruses.Finally, inspired by antibody fingerprinting, we develop a technique to decompose the collective neutralization from a mixture and characterize the antibodies within. Whereas previous efforts only detected specific patterns from known antibodies14, our approach considers a range of stem antibody behaviors extrapolated via the landscape. Using this rich set of behaviors, we determine the minimal number of stem antibodies (along with their full neutralization profile and stoichiometry) that could generate the observed signal from a mixture. Moreover, the neutralization landscape can remove the effects of non-HA-stem antibodies, and we validate such decompositions against 14 mixtures of HA head + stem antibodies. In this way, the neutralization landscape can peer into the influenza antibody response and quantify the stem antibodies within.ResultsQuantifying the spectrum of influenza antibody neutralizationAntigenic cartography utilizes metric multidimensional scaling to coalesce individual interactions (the ability of one antibody to inhibit one virus strain) into a global map15. As a helpful geographic analogy, multidimensional scaling transforms pairwise distances between cities to create a state map (Supplementary Fig. 1). When cities are replaced by viruses and antibodies, the same procedure generates a map where the concentration of an antibody required to neutralize a virus is solely dictated by its distance to that virus, with smaller distances signifying more potent neutralization.We assembled a virus panel comprising 24 H1N1 influenza strains collected between 1933 and 2018 and 27 H3N2 strains collected from 1968 to 2019 (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Neutralization was measured against 27 HA-stem-targeting antibodies (Fig. 1a; 17 previously published in ref. 16 and 10 newly measured antibodies) representing major lineages of broadly neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination17,18,19. We determined the concentration of each antibody needed to neutralize every virus by 50% (the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50), and the available reagents were sufficient to measure most antibody–virus pairs (1,148/1,377 = 85%, raw data are presented in Supplementary Fig. 1c). These measurements allow us to construct a neutralization landscape where the relative distance between an antibody and virus dictates the antibody’s potency (Fig. 1b). As more viruses and antibodies are added, they lock into a fixed configuration, aside from global translations, rotations and reflections.Fig. 1: Neutralization landscape for the influenza hemagglutinin stem.a, Virus neutralization was measured for antibodies targeting the influenza HA stem. b, Example showing how neutralization is transformed into a distance d on the landscape. An antibody with greater neutralization (smaller IC50) against a virus is placed closer to that virus. The light-gray antibody is positioned 1, 2 or 3 units away from the viruses, and the dark-gray antibody is 1 unit away from all three viruses. c, Neutralization landscape of the HA stem quantifying the interactions between monoclonal antibodies (gray) and viruses (hues of green/blue, with darker hues representing more recent viruses). Throughout this work, landscapes are portrayed using a 2D Euclidean coordinate system where distance d between each antibody–virus pair corresponds to a neutralization IC50 = 10−10 + d M, so that gridlines represent a 10× drop in neutralization. Average error represents the mean fold-difference between the landscape IC50 values and measurements. Supplementary Fig. 1 presents the raw data and the correspondence between shading and virus name; this color scheme is used consistently throughout this work. d, Examples of how a virus or antibody is positioned. Red circles represent the expected distance d = 10 + log10(IC50/1 M), and an antibody or virus must lie as close as possible to the intersection of all circles.Source dataFull size imageUsing these antibody–virus interactions, we created a neutralization landscape for the HA stem, with H1N1 and H3N2 viruses colored from lightest-to-darkest hues (oldest to more recent strains, Fig. 1c). A distance d between an antibody and virus translates into an IC50 of 10−10 + d M (where 1 μg ml−1 = 6.6 × 10−9 M for the immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies considered here), so that greater distance represents exponentially decreasing inhibitory action. We quantified the error of the antibody and virus coordinates by computing the fold error between the landscape IC50 values and the measured IC50 values for all antibody–virus pairs (for example, \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{Predict}}}}} = {10}^{ - 9}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\) and \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{Measure}}}}} = {2} \times {10}^{ - 9}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\) has a fold error of two), with a lower limit of 1-fold error for a landscape that perfectly represents the data (Methods). The 2D stem landscape had an 〈error〉 of 2.4-fold, comparable to the approximately 2-fold accuracy of the neutralization assay.Surprisingly, when we remade the landscape in different dimensions, the error only decreased by 10% in 3D, although it more than tripled in 1D (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, as described in the following section, the 2D landscape has better predictive power than higher dimensions. Accordingly, we opted to represent the data in 2D. We further showed that our method outperforms other dimensionality reduction techniques (Methods).The resulting 2D landscape is described by 2 × (27 antibodies + 51 viruses) = 156 coordinates representing the 1,148 antibody–virus measurements (compressing the data to 156/1,148 = 15%). To visualize the structure of the data that enables this compression, we draw circles of radius d = 10 + log10(IC50/1 M) around several antibodies measured against a virus. This virus must lie as close as possible to all circles, and its location can be determined via least-squares minimization (Fig. 1d, left panel). Antibodies and viruses are treated symmetrically, so an antibody is similarly fixed using its neutralization against multiple viruses (Fig. 1d, right panel). We note that the circles shown in Fig. 1d represent a small fraction of available data, with each virus constrained by 20 measurements and each antibody constrained by 40 measurements, on average. Error analysis shows that antibody and virus coordinates are tightly determined (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).Predicting the neutralization of new antibodies or virusesThe success of multidimensional scaling suggests that the interactions between stem antibodies and influenza viruses have a simple underlying structure. As with all dimensionality reduction techniques, this approach is expected to interpolate accurately (for example, given an antibody’s neutralization against several mapped viruses, we can predict its behavior against all other mapped viruses) yet extrapolate poorly (for example, predicting neutralization against a new antibody or virus). Previous efforts have focused exclusively on interpolation10,20, but we postulated that a neutralization landscape constrains the space of antibody–virus interactions sufficiently to make extrapolation possible.To test this hypothesis, we withheld all measurements from one antibody and recreated the neutralization landscape. We then quantified whether some point on the map could still describe this antibody. In other words, do the unoccupied regions of the landscape predict the behavior of potential antibodies? Using six measurements, we triangulated the withheld antibody and compared its predicted versus measured neutralization against the remaining 45 viruses (Fig. 2a and Methods).Fig. 2: Extrapolating new antibody behavior.a, Left: we withhold an antibody (315-23-1C09, boxed in red) from our dataset and recreate the neutralization landscape. Middle: the location of the withheld antibody is triangulated on the new landscape using a few measurements. Right: the neutralization against the remaining viruses is predicted using antibody–virus distance. Gridlines represent a 10× drop in neutralization. b, The 600 predicted versus measured IC50 values after withholding every antibody in our panel. c, We withhold either antibodies or viruses (1 or 10 of each), triangulate each entity using a subset of measurements, and predict the remaining measurements. In b and c, the shaded band represents ≤4-fold error, where 1-fold error represents an exact prediction.Source dataFull size imageWe repeated this analysis, withholding each of the 27 antibodies in turn and predicting the left-out antibody’s complete neutralization profile (taking special care with the bounded measurements; Methods). Collectively, 65% of the 600 predicted IC50 values had ≤2-fold error, and 90% had ≤4-fold error (Fig. 2b and left distribution in Fig. 2c). When we similarly withheld and triangulated a virus, we found that 80% of the resulting predictions had ≤4-fold error (Fig. 2c). Moreover, we found that a 2D landscape predicts a withheld antibody or virus better than lower or higher dimensions (Supplementary Fig. 3a).As a more ambitious test, we next withheld multiple antibodies and viruses. We removed the ten most recent viruses (isolated between 2010 and 2020), representing the practical scenario where past strains are used to infer the behavior of future variants. In addition, we assessed whether the landscape remained stable when antibodies from an entire region were depleted. Thus, we removed ten antibodies (37% of our set) from either the left half or right half of the map. In each scenario, we triangulated every entry as described above, using six measurements to predict the remaining data. In all cases, we found that 80% of predictions had ≤4-fold error, demonstrating that the map can robustly infer new antibody or virus behavior (Fig. 2c).In our initial dataset of 1,148 antibody–virus measurements, most predictions fell within 4-fold of the measurements (much smaller than the 2,000-fold range of IC50 values across the dataset). However, 16 measurements exhibited >10-fold error, suggesting that those few measurements may be outliers. To test this, we remeasured these 16 interactions and found that, upon remeasurement, their error decreased from 22-fold to 6-fold on average, much closer to the landscape predictions (Supplementary Fig. 4; all figures in this Article utilize these remeasured values). To test for false negatives, we also remeasured 54 interactions with <10-fold error (already in line with our predictions) and found that the measurements were mostly identical and their error minimally changed from 2-fold to 3-fold on average (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, by quantitatively analyzing the dataset with our landscape, we could identify and correct outliers.Although the above analysis suggests that our specific dataset is well described by a 2D landscape, we cannot know how these results will generalize as more antibodies and viruses are added. In particular, stem antibodies that are not broadly neutralizing or viruses from other subtypes may require a landscape with different dimensionality or a different distance metric. As a first step to testing the generality of our approach, we analyzed an external dataset, where the neutralization of four additional stem antibodies not in our panel were measured against 13 viruses21. We first showed that triangulation with six viruses could predict the remaining measurements with 2.6-fold accuracy, demonstrating that these antibodies conform to the underlying structure of our landscape (Supplementary Fig. 5). We then used the positions of our mapped viruses to extend their dataset, predicting 36 new IC50 values for each antibody (Supplementary Fig. 5).Antibody–virus distance quantifies the potency–breadth tradeoffAlthough it is well known that stem antibodies tend to neutralize a broader set of viruses than head antibodies22, precisely quantifying the inherent tradeoff between antibody potency and breadth remains an open problem. Using the neutralization landscape, we transform this challenging biological question into a straightforward geometry problem (Supplementary Fig. 1e).A key mathematical property of the landscape is that the antibody–virus distance forms a metric. In other words, our intuition for Euclidean geometry applies—for example, the antibody with the most potent neutralization (lowest IC50) against two viruses would lie exactly between them, minimizing the distance to either virus.This set-up is readily generalized to multiple viruses to answer a question that is intractable without a reference set for antibody behavior: how potently could any antibody neutralize N viruses? (Formally, what is the minimum \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{min}}}}}\) such that an antibody only exhibits \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}{{{\mathrm{s}}}} \le {{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{min}}}}}\) against all N viruses?) On the landscape, this optimal antibody lies at the center of the smallest circle bounding all N viruses.To demonstrate this process, we considered the optimal antibody targeting all H1N1 or H3N2 vaccine strains from the 2004–2005 to 2018–2019 seasons (Methods). The optimal H3N2-specific antibody (blue in Fig. 3a) has a predicted \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{min}}}}} = {4}\times {10}^{ - 10}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\), around 20× better than the best antibody in our panel (gray antibody 315-09-1B12) with a measured \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{panel}}}}} = {70}\times {10}^{ - 10}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\) (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the optimal H1N1-specific antibody (green) has \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{min}}}}} = {3}\times {10}^{ - 10}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\), only 2.5× better than the \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{panel}}}}} = {10}\times {10}^{ - 10}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\) from our best antibody (gray, antibody CR9114). If each point on the map describes a potential antibody, then groups searching for better stem antibodies against these viruses should expect only marginal gains from additional H1N1-targeting antibodies, but far greater potential for finding more potent H3N2-targeting antibodies.Fig. 3: The neutralization profile of an optimal antibody against any set of mapped viruses.a, Positions of the hypothetical highest-potency antibodies with the smallest IC50 against all H1N1 (green) or H3N2 (blue) vaccine strains from the 2004–2005 to 2018–2019 seasons, compared to the best antibody in the panel (gray, labeled below with their names). A circle corresponding to the minimal IC50 enclosing all relevant viruses is drawn around each antibody. b, Predicting the highest-potency antibody (purple) that neutralizes both the H1N1 and H3N2 strains compared to the best antibody in our panel (gray).Source dataFull size imageWe can similarly assess how well a single antibody simultaneously neutralizes both the H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine strains. Because of the differences between these two subtypes, we expect that this enlarged breadth must come at the cost of decreased potency. Indeed, the neutralization landscape predicts that a stem antibody can only exhibit \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{min}}}}} = {30}\times {10}^{ - 10}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\) against these vaccine strains, at least 10× less potent than the \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{min}}}}}\) values for the H1N1-specific or H3N2-specific antibodies described above. As expected, the best panel antibody that simultaneously neutralizes these H1N1 and H3N2 viruses has \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{panel}}}}} = {140}\times {10}^{ - 10}\,{{{\mathrm{M}}}}\) (FI6v3); that is, ~5× worse that the predicted optimal antibody (Fig. 3b). These results emphasize that even broadly neutralizing antibodies may have a ‘neutralization ceiling’ against sufficiently diverse viruses, and that there is an inherent cost to neutralizing more strains.This process is readily extended to any group of viruses, as well as to the more general question of how potently N1 antibodies could neutralize N2 viruses. Using the landscape, we can not only compute the optimal IC50, but also the specific neutralization profile against each virus on the panel.As a technical note, a metric requires a triangle inequality. Because we only define the distance dAb–V = 10 + log10(IC50/1 M) between an antibody (Ab) and virus (V), the usual triangle inequality becomes the quadrilateral inequality$${d}_{{{{\mathrm{Ab}}}} - {{{\mathrm{V}}}}} \le {d}_{\overline {{{{\mathrm{Ab}}}}} - {{{\mathrm{V}}}}} + {d}_{\overline {{{{\mathrm{Ab}}}}} - {\overline{\mathrm{V}}}} + {d}_{{{{\mathrm{Ab}}}} - {\overline{\mathrm{V}}}}$$ (1) where \({\overline{\mathrm{Ab}}}\) and \({\overline{\mathrm{V}}}\) represent any other antibody or virus (Supplementary Fig. 6a). As with the traditional triangle inequality, this relationship codifies the notion that the distance between any Ab and V must be shorter than the next shortest route through \({\overline {{{{\mathrm{Ab}}}}}}\) and \({\overline{\mathrm{V}}}\). Altogether, there are 400,000 combinations of Ab, \({\overline {{{{\mathrm{Ab}}}}}}\), V and \({\overline{\mathrm{V}}}\) that can be directly tested against equation (1) using the antibody–virus measurements (without requiring the neutralization landscape). We find that this inequality is satisfied in 99% of cases, demonstrating that our measurements are well described by the Euclidean metric. This empirical observation must be continually affirmed with future measurements.Isolating the neutralization of a stem antibody within a mixtureBy enumerating the behaviors of a stem antibody, the neutralization landscape can also detect neutralization patterns from non-stem antibodies and remove those signals. For example, given the combined neutralization from an HA head + stem antibody mixture, we can isolate the stem-derived neutralization (Fig. 4a). This represents a key step towards serum deconvolution (characterizing the epitopes and neutralization profiles of antibodies within serum), which is a necessary step in the many ongoing efforts to elicit broad antibodies that can grant potent and durable protection against infection.Fig. 4: Characterizing a single stem antibody within head + stem mixtures.a, We created mixtures of two or three antibodies targeting the HA head and stem. Using a mixture’s neutralization titers, we predict the behavior of the stem antibody within. b, The virus–virus distance on the landscape constrains how differently any stem antibody can neutralize two viruses. c, Left: the neutralization from a head + stem mixture (#7 in Supplementary Fig. 10) cannot be described by any point on the landscape due to the head antibody. The gold disk represents a lower bound on neutralization (for example, IC50 > 10−7 M, d > 3); an antibody should lie outside all gold disks but on every red circle (representing exact IC50 values). Right: after using equation (2) to remove the neutralization from the head antibody, the IC50 values of all blue viruses become lower bounds (gold disks), and we can infer the position of the stem antibody (red). The insets at the top left show the number of head (brown) and stem (gray) antibodies in each mixture, and whether the head signal has been removed (antibody icon crossed out). d, Examples showing additional mixtures combining one stem antibody with one or two head antibodies (additional decompositions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 10). Average error quantifies the fold-difference between the predicted antibody’s IC50 values and measurements.Source dataFull size imageAlthough antibody–virus distance on the landscape corresponds to neutralization, the distance between two viruses (V1 and V2) can be interpreted as constraining how differently any stem antibody can neutralize both strains. In the extreme example where these viruses have identical HA stems and lie on the same coordinate (dV1–V2 = 0), every stem antibody will identically neutralize V1 and V2. Thus, if a head + stem antibody mixture neutralizes V1 far more potently than V2 (for example, with IC50 values of 10−10 M and 10−7 M, respectively), this discrepancy must be caused by the head antibody increasing the mixture’s neutralization (decreasing its IC50) against V1. The stem antibody alone should exhibit the same IC50 value of ≥10−7 M against both viruses (a value larger than 10−7 M is possible if the head antibody increases the mixture’s neutralization against both viruses).More generally, given a distance dV1–V2 between two viruses, any stem antibody (Ab) will obey |dAb–V1 − dAb–V2| ≤ dV1–V2 (Fig. 4b) or equivalently$${\frac{{{{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50,\,{{{\mathrm{V}}}}1}}}{{{{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50,\,{{{\mathrm{V}}}}2}}} \le {10}^{d_{{{{\mathrm{V}}}}{1}-{{{\mathrm{V}}}}2}}}.$$ (2) Given the combined neutralization from a head + stem mixture, we consider every pair of measurements (IC50, V1, IC50, V2) and determine whether their ratio exceeds \({10}^{d_{{{{\mathrm{V}}}}{1} - {{{\mathrm{V}}}}2}}\). If equation (2) is satisfied, the measurements remain unchanged. Otherwise, the smaller value (say IC50, V2) is bounded below as per equation (2) (IC50, V2 ≥ IC50,V1 × \({10}^{ - d_{{{{\mathrm{V}}}}1-{{{\mathrm{V}}}}2}}\), Supplementary Fig. 6b,c; see Methods for how we account for noise in the measurements by requiring more than a 10-fold discrepancy).To test this process, we created nine antibody mixtures (seven containing 1 head + 1 stem antibodies and two containing 2 head + 1 stem antibodies) and measured them against our virus panel (N = 321 data points, Supplementary Fig. 7). As an example, we consider one mixture where the stem antibody is H1N1-specific and does not neutralize any H3N2 viruses, whereas the head antibody neutralizes a few H1N1 and H3N2 strains (head antibody C05 + stem antibody CR6261). In combination, these two antibodies moderately neutralized some H3N2 viruses with an IC50 of ≤10−8 M (Fig. 4c, left panel, red circles around the blue viruses), whereas others showed no detectable neutralization (a gold disk around a virus represents the lower bound measurement, IC50 > 10−7 M, outside our range of detection). The stem antibody should lie outside any gold disk while lying on the red circles representing IC50 values within our range of detection. As expected, no point on the landscape can satisfy these constraints in the left panel of Fig. 4c, demonstrating that a stem antibody alone cannot give rise to the neutralization from this head + stem mixture.As described above, we use the neutralization landscape to remove the effects of the head antibody. Given the proximity of the H3N2 virus with no detectable neutralization (gold disk) to the H3N2 viruses with moderate neutralization (red circles), we correctly predict that the head antibody is responsible for this moderate neutralization. Thus, we apply equation (2), which increases the H3N2 IC50 values and changes them to lower bounds (represented by gold disks in the right panel of Fig. 4c). Notably, the H1N1 IC50 values were unchanged by this process, because the stem antibody’s neutralization dominated against these viruses, and hence the mixture’s H1N1 neutralization obeyed the constraints of the landscape.With the head neutralization removed, we can triangulate the stem antibody on our map, as discussed in the previous section (Fig. 2a). In this way, we can characterize a stem antibody without knowing its individual neutralization profile nor the number or properties of the head antibodies in the combination. For our example mixture, the predicted stem antibody (Fig. 4c, red antibody) lies near the true position of the stem antibody (gray), with an average 1.5-fold error between the predicted and measured IC50 values across the virus panel. We repeated this analysis for our nine antibody mixtures, combining either one or two head antibodies with a stem antibody, and found an 〈error〉 ranging between 1.5- and 5.2-fold (mean of 3.4-fold; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10).Characterizing antibody mixtures with multiple stem antibodiesGiven the range of behaviors for a single stem antibody (represented by each point on the landscape), we can predict how multiple stem antibodies act in concert, paving the way to explore a polyclonal antibody response (the purview of this section). In the reverse direction, we can use the collective neutralization from multiple stem antibodies to determine the number, stoichiometry and neutralization profiles of the constituent antibodies (discussed in the following section).To that end, we construct a biophysical model that calculates a mixture’s neutralization based on the neutralization of each individual antibody. Because the stem antibodies in our panel all target the same region of the HA stem17,23,24, we treat their binding as competitive, where only one antibody can bind to an HA monomer at a time (Fig. 5a). For two stem antibodies with individual neutralizations \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{(1)}\) and \({{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{(2)}\), a mixture containing a fraction f1 of the first antibody and f2 = 1 − f1 of the second antibody will have$${{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{{{{\mathrm{Mixture}}}}} = {\left( {\mathop {\sum}\nolimits_j {f_j/{{{\mathrm{IC}}}}_{50}^{(j)}} } \right)^{ - 1}},$$ (3) with this same equation holding for mixtures containing more antibodies (Methods).Fig. 5: Characterizing mixtures with multiple stem antibodies.a, Biophysical model for mixtures of stem antibodies binding competitively to an HA monomer. b, Stem + stem mixtures were measured against the virus panel. Mixture IC50 values are predicted using the neutralization of each individual antibody. The gray shading represents ≤4-fold error, where 1-fold error represents an exact prediction. c, Regions of ≥50% neutralization for a two-antibody mixture (outlined in solid lines) versus the neutralization of each individual antibody (dashed lines). The legend shows the concentration of each antibody in the mixture. d, Using a mixture’s neutralization titers, we predict the number, stoichiometry and neutralization profiles of the stem antibodies within. One such stem + stem mixture is shown (gray antibodies, mixture 8 in Supplementary Fig. 10), together with the predicted decomposition (red). Circles around each antibody represent ≥50% virus neutralization when the total antibody concentration is 10−8.5 M, while factoring in antibody stoichiometry within the mixture (Methods). Average error represents the fold-difference between the collective neutralization predicted by the inferred stem antibodies and the measured neutralization of only the stem antibodies in the mixture, with 〈error〉 = 1 representing exact predictions. e, Mean + s.e.m. for the decomposition of 27 monoclonal antibodies, 11 mixtures containing two antibodies (stem + stem or head + stem) and three mixtures containing three antibodies (head + head + stem or head + stem + stem). The fractions of decompositions that predicted the correct number of stem antibodies are shown above each bar. Experimental noise is ~2-fold (dashed line). f, Examples showing additional mixtures combining two stem antibodies with and without a head antibody (additional decompositions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 10). Neutralization of two nearby antibodies is expanded because either can neutralize a virus, analogous to the solid lines in c. The insets at the top left show the number of head (brown) and stem (gray) antibodies in each mixture.Source dataFull size imageTo test this competitive binding model, we created four stem + stem antibody mixtures and measured them against our virus panel (N = 165 data points). Using the individual IC50 values against each virus, we find tight agreement between the predicted and measured mixture IC50 values, with 98% of predictions exhibiting ≤4-fold error (Fig. 5b). On the landscape, such mixtures will neutralize a larger region (Fig. 5c, solid lines) than either antibody alone (dashed lines). In this way, we can use the competitive binding model to predict and visualize the behavior of general stem mixtures.Characterizing the stem antibodies within general mixturesBy combining the results from the two previous sections, namely removing the neutralization of head antibodies and enumerating the behavior of multiple stem antibodies, we can decompose antibody mixtures with multiple head or stem antibodies. In essence, decomposition detects neutralization signatures that are impossible for a monoclonal antibody to achieve (for example, potent neutralization against viruses far apart on the landscape). In such cases, we search for the minimum number of antibodies that give rise to the apparent neutralization profile.As an example, we measured the collective neutralization from a mixture of two stem antibodies against our virus panel (Fig. 5d, gray antibodies; CR6261 + CR8020, 50/50% composition). The algorithm scans through all possible configurations of n = 1, 2, 3… antibodies on the landscape and determines which one best describes the mixture, terminating once the fold error no longer appreciably decreases with additional antibodies (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9 and Methods). This correctly predicted two stem antibodies (Fig. 5d, red), although with a 10/90% composition. The circle surrounding each antibody represents this fractional composition, so that the gray circles have the same radius whereas the red circle of the antibody on the left of the landscape (representing 90% composition) is larger than the red circle of the antibody on the right (10% composition). The areas covered by these circles represent ≥50% neutralization when the total mixture concentration equals a fixed amount we chose as 10−8.5 M. The deviation between the predicted and actual coordinates is partially compensated by predicting an uneven composition, so that the average fold error between the measured and predicted IC50 values against all viruses is 1.9-fold, comparable to experimental error. This demonstrates that the antibody response can be partially degenerate—where different mixtures exhibit similar behavior—as both the 50/50% composition of gray antibodies and the 90/10% composition of red antibodies exhibit similar neutralization.We performed a similar analysis for all our antibody mixtures, which included (1) 27 monoclonal stem antibodies, (2) 11 mixtures containing two antibodies (four stem + stem and seven head + stem) and (3) three mixtures containing three antibodies (two head + head + stem and one head + stem + stem; Supplementary Fig. 7). As above, we blinded ourselves to both the number and type of antibodies in each mixture, computationally removed any head antibody neutralization (even for mixtures containing only stem antibodies), determined which set of stem coordinates best characterized the neutralization profile, and compared the resulting neutralization against the true mixture compositions.Across all mixtures, the collective neutralization from the stem antibodies was well characterized by these decompositions, with ~3-fold error for the monoclonal antibodies and two-antibody mixtures and 4‒5-fold error for the three-antibody mixtures (Fig. 5e,f). For 23/27 monoclonal antibodies, the decomposition correctly predicted a single stem antibody, although four antibodies were overfit as two-antibody mixtures due to deviations between landscape distances and measurements. Decompositions for 10/11 of the two-antibody mixtures and 3/3 of the three-antibody mixtures predicted the correct number of stem antibodies. Notably, in every mixture containing more than one stem antibody, we identified the unique antibodies, even when they were as close as 1.5 units apart on the landscape (mixtures 8–11 and mixture 14 in Supplementary Fig. 10).For the 13/14 mixtures with the correct number of imputed stem antibodies, we can further assess the predicted stoichiometry and neutralization profile of each stem antibody within the mixture. Because we remove neutralization from HA head antibodies, our algorithm computes the abundance of each remaining stem antibody relative to the stem-directed response. Hence, the eight mixtures with a single stem antibody were (by definition) correctly predicted to have that antibody comprise 100% of the stem response (Supplementary Fig. 10d). The remaining mixtures all had two stem antibodies with 50/50% stem-targeting composition; four mixtures were predicted with ~75/25% and one with 90/10% stoichiometry. In addition, the distance between the predicted stem antibodies and their true landscape positions was 0.8 ± 0.4 map units (corresponding to six-fold deviations in IC50), which we note is relatively small compared to the 2,000-fold range of IC50 values across our dataset.Collectively, these results suggest that, in most cases, a mixture’s neutralization profile can uniquely identify the number of stem antibodies within (36/41 ≈ 90% of cases). However, distinct mixtures can give rise to similar neutralization profiles, even when measured against a panel of 51 diverse viruses. The frequency of such degenerate mixtures, as well as the positions of additional viruses whose measurements would break these degeneracies, can be quantified by enumerating all possible mixtures on the landscape.DiscussionSince the advent of Fourier analysis in the 1800s, the ability to break signals into simple underlying components has revolutionized scientific disciplines ranging from complex analysis to image reconstruction. Recently, live cells were imaged using six fluorescent probes whose emission spectra heavily overlapped, so that the net luminescence was a cacophony of signals25. By characterizing each probe’s spectrum, the total signal could be unmixed, enabling six regions of live cells to be simultaneously imaged. In the context of antibody–virus interactions, the challenge of unmixing lies both in enumerating the spectrum of antibody–virus behaviors as well as in decomposing the collective inhibition of multiple antibodies.The neutralization landscape we create quantifies the limits of antibody–virus interactions. Universal vaccine efforts aiming to elicit broadly neutralizing HA-stem antibodies should consider how broad they want this response to be, given the inverse relationship between breadth and potency. As another application, identifying which amino acids in the HA stem are associated with changes in virus antigenicity (that is, changes in the virus position in the neutralization landscape) will facilitate the design of HA-stem-based vaccines able to elicit specific immunological phenotypes.By systematically enumerating the range of behaviors for individual stem antibodies, the landscape can decompose simple polyclonal mixtures—even if they include antibodies binding to other epitopes such as the HA head—and quantify their fractional composition and neutralization profiles. Fundamentally, the information driving these predictions is in the positions of the viruses on the landscape. When a mixture’s neutralization diverges from the possible profiles of a monoclonal antibody, it not only suggests that the mixture must be polyclonal, but also presents a way to quantify the functional properties of the antibodies within the mixture.With this approach, we take a step towards one of the central challenges in immunology, namely, using the collective neutralization from a mixture of antibodies to characterize the specific antibodies within. Although in this work we only decomposed mixtures with two or three antibodies, the success of the similar antibody fingerprinting methodology12 suggests that our approach can be applied to more complex polyclonal sera. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the human antibody response against one strain of influenza is often dominated by ≤5 antibody clonotypes26 and in extreme cases by approximately one antibody27, and such ‘approximately monoclonal’ sera could be decomposed to characterize the dominant antibodies within. This opens a number of applications, including the following. (1) HA-stem vaccine performance could be quantified in terms of both the fraction of elicited antibodies that are on-target as well as the neutralization profile of those antibodies28,29,30,31,32. (2) Combining a neutralization landscape with a binding landscape (using antibody–virus dissociation constants) could quantify both neutralizing and non-neutralizing components of an antibody repertoire33. (3) Given the inherently limited supply of each serum sample, we could rationally design the closest approximating antibody mixture using known antibodies, enabling broader studies of promising mixtures and facilitating the development of therapeutics.This decomposition is inherently limited by the diversity of viruses used to probe a mixture. Our approach uses each virus as a ‘sensor’ for nearby antibodies, so viruses should be widely spaced across the landscape to detect all possible antibodies. Due to experimental noise and the inaccuracy of the 2D representation, decomposition may only detect the dominant and distinct antibody signatures. An antibody comprising a small fraction of serum will minimally affect its neutralization and hence cannot be reliably detected. Moreover, antibodies with similar neutralization profiles may be represented by a single effective antibody. These cases add to degeneracy—a highly understudied feature of the antibody response—where combinations of different antibodies give rise to similar functional responses.An open question is whether the 2D Euclidean landscape presented here will suffice as more viruses and antibodies are added to the map. More complex datasets may require higher-dimensional maps, a more complex metric or separate maps for antibodies binding to different antigenic sites.Although the HA-stem neutralizing antibodies used in this study all bind to the canonical stem super-epitope17,23,24, antibodies targeting a new membrane-proximal stem epitope have recently been discovered34,35. Future work can explore whether their behavior is captured by the existing landscape, or if a separate map is required for each epitope. It also remains to be seen whether there are portions of the landscape that antibodies or viruses cannot occupy (for example, because of viral fitness or antibody polyreactivity).Looking forward, the analysis presented here serves as a stepping stone to track the stem antibody response over time and predict how antibody repertoires respond to a pathogen. How will the stem response evolve after multiple vaccinations or infections, and is there a path dependence to antibody development or is all the relevant information contained within the current antibody repertoire27,36,37,38,39,40? The neutralization landscape reframes this biological problem into a geometry problem, where antibody evolution can be studied as a dynamical system with perturbations imposed by vaccinations and infections.MethodsThe following sections briefly describe the steps to create the neutralization landscape and decompose antibody mixtures. The Supplementary Information contains more extensive descriptions.Measuring virus neutralizationWe utilized existing antibody–virus neutralization measurements from ref. 16 (which measured (17 antibodies) × (49 viruses)) with new antibody–virus measurements carried out in this work. The development of replication-restricted reporter (R3) influenza viruses has been described in ref. 16. Briefly, the influenza PB1 viral segment was modified to encode a fluorescent reporter (mKate2 or TdKatushka2S), which replaced most of the coding region of the PB1 gene. R3 viruses can be propagated only in cells expressing PB1 in trans. For the influenza neutralization assay, PB1-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells suspended in OPTIMEM (Thermo Fisher) were seeded in 384-well plates (Greiner) at 150,000 cells ml−1 (20 μl per well), 1–2 h before infection. A 25-μl volume of each neutralization mixture, consisting of equal parts pre-titrated R3 influenza virus and four-fold serial dilutions of antibodies prepared in OPTIMEM containing 2 μg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin (Millipore Sigma), was transferred to wells in quadruplicate. The initial antibody concentrations after virus dilution were 25 μg ml−1.Control wells of virus-alone and diluent-alone were included on each plate. Fluorescent foci were counted at 18–24 h post infection using a Celigo instrument (Nexcelom) with customized red filter to detect mKate2/TdKatushka2 reporter signals. Percent neutralization was calculated by constraining the virus-alone control to 0% and the diluent-alone control to 100% neutralization. We fit a curve of antibody concentration versus neutralization using a four-parameter nonlinear model in Prism (GraphPad), which determined the 50% inhibitory concentration, IC50. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes. We included as many antibodies and viruses as possible, given the available reagents.Constructing the neutralization landscapeWe transformed each neutralization IC50 into map distance (d = 10 + log10(IC50/1 M)) and performed multidimensional scaling, numerically minimizing the mean-squared difference between each antibody–virus pair’s landscape distance and desired distance. The resulting 2.2-fold error (shown in the bottom right of Fig. 1c) means that given any measured IC50 between an antibody–virus pair, the corresponding neutralization determined by the landscape will lie between IC50/2.2 and IC50 × 2.2, on average.Decomposing defined antibody mixturesUsing the neutralization landscape, we can decompose the collective neutralization from antibody mixtures to characterize the individual antibodies within. We first use the landscape to remove the neutralization signature of antibodies that do not target the HA stem. Next, we determine the optimal antibody mixtures (combination of points on the map) that recapitulate the resulting neutralization profile. Decomposition proceeds by characterizing a mixture using an increasing number of antibodies, halting once the addition of another antibody no longer markedly decreases the decomposition error.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this Article.

Dr. Truswell was the first in his area in Western Massachusetts to have an accredited private office surgical suite. learn more Close Having the flu might sound like a minor inconvenience, but in some cases, the viral illness can cause serious problems. Despite the medical community's best preventive efforts—including the annual flu vaccine—many people become sick, are hospitalized, and die from the flu yearly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated nine million to 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths yearly between 2010 and 2020. Unfortunately, there's no cure for the flu. Antibiotics, which fight bacterial infections, are useless against viral illnesses. And for the most part, you can only manage your symptoms and wait for the infection to pass. But there may be ways to soften the blow if you become sick. "[The flu] is one of the few viral respiratory illnesses that we can actually treat specifically," Susan J. Rehm, MD, infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, told Health. Here's what you should know about treating the flu with antiviral medications, when to seek treatment for optimal recovery time, and other essentials to remember when you're sick. Take Antiviral Medication “Antiviral medications are specific to the influenza virus, and they inhibit the virus from reproducing. And in that way, [they] can help people have a milder case of flu and get better faster,” said Dr. Rehm. “They are the only things that are proven to make a difference in terms of the severity or duration of illness.” The following antiviral medications are available by prescription: Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate), an oral antiviral drugRelenza (zanamivir), an inhaled antiviralRapivab (peramivir), administered intravenouslyXofluza (baloxavir marboxil), an oral antiviral drug Who Should Take Antiviral Medication Antiviral medications can be a lifesaver for people with a high risk of complications from the flu, including: Older adults Young children Pregnant people People with underlying health conditions (such as diabetes, cancer, or heart or lung disease) But antiviral medications may not be necessary for people with a low risk of complications. “Most healthy people who develop influenza infection do just fine by getting plenty of fluids and rest and do not need an antiviral medication unless they have severe infection,” Pritish Tosh, MD, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., told Health. That said, in some cases, antiviral medications may still be helpful. “I have no reservations about prescribing it to low-risk patients,” Scott Bernstein, MD, an internist at Bon Secours Medical Group. “There is a rapid flu test that gives the results in 10 minutes. So, a [healthcare provider] can easily wait for the test to return before prescribing the drug.” When To Take Antiviral Medication The key to the effectiveness of antiviral medications is when you begin taking them. Antiviral medications work best within the first 48 hours of illness. Although, it can still be beneficial to take antiviral medications after that timeframe. “What it will probably do is shave off at least a day from the illness,” explained Dr. Rehm. “That illness that might normally last five to seven days hopefully would last a day or two less.” Know the Signs of the Flu Knowing some of the most common flu symptoms is essential to ensure that you seek treatment in time. For that, there's a mnemonic: FACTS, which stands for fever, aches, chills, tiredness, and sudden onset, said Dr. Rehm. Other flu symptoms can include: CoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseHeadachesVomiting (more common in children)Diarrhea (more common in children) "The typical flu, in most patients, causes fever and achiness for two to four days. But they are often left with a dry cough and tiredness that can last awhile," said Dr. Bernstein. Drinking plenty of fluids and taking fever-reducing medication is essential to treating your symptoms, added Dr. Bernstein. How Many People Die From the Flu Each Year? Other Tips for Fast Recovery Other than antiviral treatments, there are different ways to help yourself feel better sooner. Stay Hydrated It can be easy to become dehydrated when you're sick. Whether you're vomiting or your appetite is low, it's important to stay hydrated by consuming clear liquids like water or soup. You'll also want to avoid drinking alcohol or anything with caffeine, such as soda, coffee, tea. Go to a Healthcare Provider Getting help is easier than ever, emphasized Dr. Rehm. "There are so many ways to access care these days, whether it's a phone call to [a healthcare provider's] office, a virtual physician visit, or virtual healthcare provider visit, or a trip to urgent care," added Dr. Rehm. You should seek immediate medical attention if you or your child experiences any of the following: DehydrationSeizuresFever (for children younger than 3 months) Stay Home Staying home from work or school and avoiding going out in public while recovering from illness is also important, noted Dr. Rehm. "That's both for yourself and the other people around you," explained Dr. Rehm. "The reality is that you really do need to stop and allow yourself to get better because if you keep going with the flu, that probably increases your risk for complications, as well as exposes everybody around you to the virus." The CDC recommends staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone without using medication that reduces your fever. Best Foods To Eat When You're Sick A Quick Review If you want to get rid of the flu, seek treatment as quickly as possible. Then, be prepared to stay put until you’ve recovered. In the meantime, all you can do is rest, stay hydrated, and wait for the symptoms to go away. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

AP Fact Check Combination COVID and flu test does not prove they are the same virus By GRAPH MASSARA Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print CLAIM: An at-home rapid test that can detect both the coronavirus and influenza A and B is proof that COVID-19 and flu are the same disease. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The flu and the coronavirus are distinct viruses, and the product in the photo on social media tests separately for each. Such tests detect specific proteins that differ between the viruses, allowing them to discern between COVID-19 and flu infections, medical experts confirmed to The Associated Press. THE FACTS: U.S. COVID-19 cases have again spiked in tandem with influenza, as a wave of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, cases this year has threatened a winter “tripledemic.” But in recent days, some social media users have pointed to a photo of an at-home test kit that can detect influenza A and B and COVID-19, incorrectly suggesting it shows that the coronavirus pandemic is just another wave of seasonal flu. A post circulating on Instagram shows a box labeled “COVID-19/Influenza A&B Antigen Test Kit,” with a teal-colored illustration of a coronavirus on the side. Text above the image reads, “Covid or flu.. ahhh.. doesn’t matter.” RELATED COVERAGE FACT FOCUS: A multimillion vote gap between 2020 and 2024 fuels false election narratives FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims surrounding the 2024 election FACT FOCUS: Trump repeated election lies in his interview with Joe Rogan. Here are the facts “The flu’s back y’all after disappearing for over 2 years,” one user captioned the image. “It’s always been the flu…” But the kit in the photo tests for each virus separately, and medical experts confirmed they are distinct viruses that are detected differently. “While flu and Covid may feel similar, the viruses that cause these diseases are as different as night and day,” said Dr. Benjamin Neuman, chief virologist at Texas A&M’s Global Health Research Complex.Instructions for the test in the Instagram post available online, as well as photos of the product, show it comes with a cartridge that contains two “specimen wells,” one to check for COVID-19 and the other to check for influenza. Users are instructed to swab their nostrils, insert the swab into a test liquid, then put drops of the liquid into each well. Different lines will show up on the test strip in each well depending on what the user tests positive for. The test, sold under the name Fanttest, has been approved by the agency that regulates medical therapies for use in Australia, but it is not available in the U.S. Thomas Denny, a professor of medicine and chief operating officer of Duke University’s Human Vaccine Institute, said rapid antigen tests are developed by using a “recombinant protein” that mimics a specific virus. Before such tests are authorized for use, they are measured for sensitivity and specificity, Denny said. Specificity refers to ensuring the tests provide positive results for the given virus, and not for samples from uninfected people or those infected with a different virus.It’s common for antigen tests to check for multiple things simultaneously, Neuman said in an email. The proteins usually targeted by COVID-19 and flu tests, respectively, “have nothing in common,” making a two-in-one antigen test possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any influenza tests for home-only use. In May, the agency authorized a triple testing kit for COVID-19, influenza A and B and RSV, but those results must still be processed at a lab. It is possible to be infected with both COVID-19 and the flu simultaneously. ___Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in Philadelphia contributed this report.___This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

Until the Covid-19 pandemic, adult vaccinations were not considered a routine practice in India, with priority for vaccinations only to the children. The pandemic taught that vaccines are required across the life course. Young adults, adults and the elderly also need vaccines for better health, productivity and wellbeing. PREMIUM With the evidence of Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, (the virus that causes COVID-19), causing severe disease in pregnant women and endangering pregnancy, the Government of India in July 2021 approved and administered COVID-19 vaccines to all pregnant women as part of their standard antenatal care programme. However, when adults and elderly were taking Covid-19 vaccines in the middle of pandemic (early 2021), pregnant women were not allowed to take, citing potential risk of vaccine due to lack of safety data from Covid-19 vaccine trials, since pregnant women were denied access to participate in vaccine trials. We witnessed in-equality in access of essential vaccine in this high-risk group. With the evidence of Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, (the virus that causes COVID-19), causing severe disease in pregnant women and endangering pregnancy, the Government of India in July 2021 approved and administered COVID-19 vaccines to all pregnant women as part of their standard antenatal care programme. Now, one hundred twenty countries recommend COVID-19 vaccination to pregnant women. This indicates that the severity and burden of the disease is critical to influence vaccine recommendations. Unfortunately, vaccination of pregnant mothers has not been utilized to its full potential. The vaccines for influenza and pertussis (whooping cough) are available. These can be given during pregnancy. However, these are not still given under the national programme. India has the largest burden of deaths in children under-5 years from lower respiratory infections. The major viral cause of lower respiratory infections in children is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza and bacterial causes are streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The pneumococcal and Hib vaccines are routinely given to Indian children. Seasonal influenza virus (flu or swine flu-H1N1), similar to Covid-19, is spread by the droplets produced from coughing and sneezing and produces symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, and headache. As compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women with influenza are at a greater risk of developing severe illness and hospitalisation and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the developing baby. Pertussis (whooping cough/KAALI KHANSI) caused by a bacteria bordetella pertussis, can cause severe illness and complications in children under three months of age, with initial symptoms of cold that progress to severe cough, struggle in breathing or breathing stops. Pertussis can even become deadly. Indian children get pertussis vaccines as part of the diphtheria “pertussis” tetanus (DPT) vaccine series starting at 1.5 months of age, but this immunity is not sufficient to protect during the first three months of life when their immune system is still developing and are at most risk. Pertussis immunity wanes down with age. So, when a woman enters pregnancy with a weak anti-pertussis immunity, her baby is not protected from the deadly disease during the early months of life. Vaccination during pregnancy is a simple and effective tool to protect the mothers, developing baby, newborns and, young babies before they can get their own vaccines. Vaccine generated immunity (antibodies) gets transferred through placenta to the developing baby or via breastmilk to the babies during the most vulnerable months of life. Therefore, the mother’s risk of getting sick and of passing the disease to the babies gets reduced by vaccination. Usually the toxoids (inactivated toxins) and inactivated vaccines are considered safe during pregnancy. Inactivated vaccine contains killed pathogen which does not produce disease when administered. These include tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis, inactivated influenza vaccine, Covid-19 vaccine (Covishield; recombinant viral vector), hepatitis B vaccine (protein). Live vaccines such as influenza nasal spray vaccine, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, human papillomavirus vaccine, varicella (chicken pox) vaccine, yellow fever vaccine and Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine are not recommended during pregnancy. In India, all pregnant women are administered two doses of tetanus toxoid (TT) or tetanus diphtheria (Td) as part of the government’s antenatal care (ANC) programme. With this, India successfully achieved the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT) – lockjaw in 2015, and, has significantly reduced the deaths of mothers and neonates (babies under 1 month), with which the yearly MNT is now <1 per 1,000 live birth. The World Health Organization recommends pregnant women as the most priority group for influenza vaccination. Inactivated influenza vaccines (flu shot) can be given to pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy to protect from influenza viral strains that predominantly circulate in that year, for example swine flu-H1N1pdm, H3N2 and Influenza B for the year 2022. Children <6 months of age are not eligible to receive flu shots. Pregnant women are routinely administered flu vaccines in the US, UK, Australia and Canada. The Government of India recommended flu shots for pregnant women in 2016, but it has not yet been introduced in the national immunisation programme. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) recommend reduced diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and “acellular pertussis” (dTaP/Tdap) vaccination to pregnant women in second trimester (28-32 week) of pregnancy. However, the Government is yet to recommend that. Maternal Tdap vaccines are routinely given in the US, UK and Australia. There is insufficient data on the burden of influenza in children and pregnant women in India which comes from the non-availability of routine diagnostics of influenza and pertussis in the government health systems. Cost is a concern, but given the severe complications flu can cause in pregnant women and children, vaccination can prevent these complications and health care expenses. Influenza vaccine is available in private sector at a cost of INR 1200-2000, which is beyond the reach for economically weaker sections. The rate of maternal vaccination against influenza has been extremely poor, with published reports from Kashmir and Maharashtra. A part of this is due to poor knowledge and sensitisation among the obstetrician-gynaecologists in India about the severity of influenza and the need for vaccines. Awareness is also very low among public. Even coverage is very low among health workers. There is a misconception that flu is just a “cold” and vaccines are not needed or needed only during outbreaks. Maharashtra introduced maternal influenza vaccine in their immunization program in 2015, however, the uptake was poor, largely driven by the outbreaks. Further, the availability of vaccine is a deterrent since vaccines are modified every year and then imported during April-May for the flu season. Similarly, the uptake of Tdap is negligible in pregnant women and Indian adults. The idea of maternal immunisation brings concern about vaccine safety. Therefore, the obstetrician gynaecologists, paediatricians, general physicians and health workers must be periodically informed, educated and counselled about the risk and severity of disease in infants and pregnant women, the need for vaccines and vaccine safety to dispel misinformation and develop vaccine confidence for supporting national recommendations. Pregnant women should also enquire about vaccines with their gynaecologists during routine check-ups. Seasonal influenza and pertussis vaccines must be included in the national immunisation programme for pregnant women and given as part of the ANC to improve the pregnancy outcomes and reduce the burden of lower respiratory infections in children. Health systems need strengthening for disease diagnosis to build the evidence for arriving at recommendations for maternal vaccines.

Here’s what experts have to say. By Nicole Harris Updated on December 26, 2022 Medically reviewed by David L. Hill, MD Influenza season is typically between fall and spring every year, peaking between December and February most seasons. Flu season trends may be different every year, but for the 2022-2023 flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicts that there may be as many as 14 million flu illnesses and up to over 8,000 flu-related deaths. Anyone can experience severe cases of the flu, but children younger than 5 years old may be especially at risk for developing pneumonia, dehydration, and other complications. Getting the flu shot is the best way to protect your family. The vaccine reduces your risk of flu illness by 40 to 60%, and it also decreases the severity of symptoms if you do happen to contract influenza. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated each year, ideally in September or early October to get full protection before flu season hits. And while every vaccination may come with potential side effects, it's important for parents to know that overall, the benefits of the flu shot outweigh any potential side effects that may arise. This Is The Best Time for Your Family to Get the Flu Shot "The side effects (of the flu shot) are about as minimal as the side effects for any vaccine," explains Amina Ahmed, M.D., FAPP, a hospital epidemiologist and professor of infectious disease at Atrium Health's Levine Children's Hospital. Keep reading to learn more about the side effects of the flu shot and nasal spray vaccine, and why they shouldn't prevent your family from getting vaccinated. Getty Images Flu Shot Side Effects for Children and Toddlers The flu shot is made with an inactivated (dead) flu virus, so it can't give you influenza, says Daisy Dodd, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease doctor for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California. Even so, people can have minor side effects after receiving the shot. Child and toddler flu shot side effects include: Soreness, redness, or discomfort in the injection site. This localized reaction is the most common side effect, says Dr. Ahmed. Body aches Low-grade fever Headache. "This can usually be alleviated by taking pain medication like Tylenol, but in my opinion, it's very minor," adds Dr. Dodd. Nausea Fatigue Fainting in rare cases These side effects generally last between one and two days. "The most common reactions people have to flu vaccines are considerably less severe than the symptoms caused by actual flu illness," stresses the CDC. The Flu Vaccine for Children and Toddlers Side Effects of the Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine When it comes to flu vaccines, shots aren't the only option. Some people receive the live attenuated flu vaccine (nasal spray) instead of the shot. A lifesaver for those who hate needles, this vaccine is only given to those over 2 years old who don't have asthma, diabetes, or other health issues that compromise the immune system. That's because it contains the live flu virus—but in such weakened quantities that it can't cause a full-blown flu, says Dr. Ahmed. Side effects of the nasal spray flu vaccine include: Congestion Runny nose Headache Wheezing Vomiting Sore throat Low-grade fever Cough Are Severe Flu Vaccine Side Effects Possible? It's unusual to have serious side effects from the flu shot. Life-threatening anaphylactic reactions (usually due to egg protein in the vaccine) are also rare, and "the new vaccines are actually very safe for those with egg allergies," says Dr. Dodd. Symptoms of an allergic reaction show up within minutes to hours, according to the CDC, and they include breathing trouble, weakness, fast heart rate, dizziness, hives, sweating, hoarseness, and paleness. Find emergency assistance immediately if you suspect an allergic reaction from the flu vaccine. Flu Symptoms in Babies and When to Call the Doctor What's more, the flu shot may have a small association with a rare disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), in which the immune system attacks your nerves. Some studies found that GBS occurs fewer than 1 or 2 times out of every one million vaccinations; others didn't find any link, says the CDC. It's important to note, though, that GBS may also occur after getting the flu. In fact, "you have a greater chance of getting GBS from influenza than by the vaccine itself," says Dr. Dodd, adding that it's still highly unlikely. The Bottom Line The flu shot may cause minor side effects in toddlers and children, but the benefits of vaccination vastly outweigh the risks. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Advertisement The next time you're at the grocery store, buying organic eggs instead of regular ones may actually save you money.The US egg producer Cal-Maine Foods said in an earnings report on Wednesday that the average selling price for specialty eggs in its latest fiscal quarter rose to $2.370 a dozen. That's lower than the $2.883 average price for conventional eggs over the same period. "Specialty" eggs include the kinds of eggs that have historically been more expensive, such as organic eggs and cage-free eggs.Grocery shoppers have taken note: Cal-Maine said sales volumes of its specialty eggs increased 24% in the quarter that ended November 26. Sales volumes of regular eggs fell about 2% over the same period. Cal-Maine is the largest US egg producer. Advertisement "Conventional egg prices exceeding specialty egg prices has occurred for the past three quarters but is atypical historically," Cal-Maine said in a statement outlining the earnings for its second fiscal quarter. Pasture-raised eggs. Vital Farms Avian flu has taken a toll on chicken flocks, leading to fewer eggs and higher pricesInflation has driven prices for a variety of foods higher over the past two years. But the story behind egg prices involves another factor: avian influenza.The latest US outbreak started in February 2022. Since then, it has affected as many as 58 million chickens, according to data updated Thursday by the US Department of Agriculture. Avian flu spreads rapidly and is often fatal, killing 90% to 100% of the chickens it reaches within a couple of days of infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Advertisement Many commercial farms that raise chickens for regular eggs have sought to contain outbreaks by killing birds when the disease appears in their flocks. That has led to a drop in the number of egg-laying chickens in the US, according to the USDA.Prices have moved higher as a result. In November, egg prices rose 49% over the same month in 2021, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. No other food product tracked by the bureau's Consumer Price Index saw prices increase as much during that period.The higher prices for eggs on grocery-store shelves have continued into the holiday season, which is traditionally a time of high egg demand as people bake seasonal sweets. Grocery stores normally tout their egg prices to consumers as a way to get them in the door, but avian flu "has led to a virtual halt by grocery retailers in including shell eggs in their weekly circulars," a December 23 USDA report on the egg market said. Advertisement Farms that raise organic and other specialty eggs haven't been as hard-hit by avian flu, leading to a more stable supply and pricesBut farms that produce cage-free and other specialty eggs tend to be smaller than their mainstream counterparts. As a result, they haven't been as hard-hit by avian flu and have been more reliable suppliers, Phil Lempert, a grocery-industry analyst, told NPR's "Marketplace" on Monday. Related stories Organic and other specialty eggs still make up a minority of the eggs sold in the US. They accounted for just over one-third of the eggs Cal-Maine sold during its latest quarter, the company said in its earnings report.Cal-Maine said avian flu "will continue to exert downward pressure on the overall supply of eggs." That pressure, and higher prices, could last well into 2023 as farms grow their flocks back to pre-outbreak levels. Advertisement Some people have started buying more-expensive egg brands as prices on conventional eggs have gone up. Vital Farms, which sells pasture-raised regular and organic eggs for several dollars a dozen at grocery stores, has attracted new customers who previously bought eggs at midlevel prices."We're capturing some of those people in the middle, and the cheapest eggs are capturing some of the people in the middle," Russell Diez-Canseco, Vital's president and CEO, said on an earnings call in August.Are you a consumer who has been affected by rising egg prices?

The latest figure for deaths from COVID-19 on Dec. 27, as tallied by The Asahi Shimbun, came to 438. This compares with 347 set at the height of the seventh wave of infections. The daily average of deaths for the week ending Dec. 27 came to 313.7, a roughly 1.5-fold increase over the past two weeks. The daily average exceeded 200 on Dec. 12. A panel of experts advising the health ministry on measures to combat the public health crisis met on Dec. 28 and noted that daily deaths will likely remain high for some time to come as the cause of the surge remains unclear. They called for a more detailed analysis of the ages of patients newly found to have COVID-19, the rate of vaccinations and the cause of death to determine what was leading to the increase. Other possible factors cited behind the sudden increase in novel coronavirus-related deaths concerned a government decision to no longer require a detailed count of all COVID-19 cases as well as a crunch on local medical institutions. Health ministry officials said the number of new COVID-19 cases had increased by about 1.1 times over the most recent week, a decline in the rate over past weeks. There were 215,966 new cases nationwide on Dec. 28, an increase of 9,522 over the previous Wednesday. But there were also 412 deaths on Dec. 28, the second highest number after the record of the previous day. Health ministry officials also warned that an influenza epidemic had developed, the first in three years. No flu epidemic was reported during the novel coronavirus pandemic that first struck Japan in early 2020, but officials are now alarmed by a simultaneous increase in COVID-19 and influenza cases. The average number of influenza patients at about 5,000 medical institutions around the nation for the week of Dec. 19-25 stood at 1.24 per medical institution, according to the health ministry. A flu epidemic is considered to have begun if the average number of patients per medical institution exceeds a benchmark of 1.0. (This article was written by Kai Ichino and Yuichiro Yoneda.)

I still can't wrap my head around it. I still can't believe it happened, and it happened so fast," she said.Her 13-year-old son, Gavin McCleery, came home with a sore throat and slight fever. Brittani took him to the doctor, who told them it was just influenza and sent them home with medicine.Related stories from 2NewsBoy diagnosed with cancer while visiting Utah in 2018 dies at age 10Utah mom says COVID-related syndrome nearly killed her son, wants others to look for signsCOVID-19 made an Idaho boy so sick they feared the worst, rushed him to Utah hospitalGavin's condition worsened, so they decided to take him to the emergency room."They said your son is very sick," Brittani said.They immediately rushed him to Primary Children's Hospital."When they got him there, they couldn't even get a pulse. I didn't know at the time, but he had already gone into toxic shock, or what they call septic, and he couldn't feel his legs," Brittani said. "I just remember him pleading and begging for the doctors to help him."Brittani said Gavin remains heavily sedated. He has tubes in his chest, and he may have to have some of his toes amputated because of the blood pressure medicine.The presents are still under the tree and the family said they decided to wait to celebrate Christmas until he's home.Gavin's still in the ICU and he's not out of the woods yet. His fever's been spiking, and infectious-disease doctors are working with him. The family was told later on that when Gavin arrived at the hospital, there was a 20% chance he would survive.Brittani said she has a message to other parents."If your kids have a fever and they have a sore throat, tell the doctor you want a strep test because it may save someone's life," she said.There is a GoFundMe to help the family.

Read our privacy policyA Boston family was left devastated after a young mother who was a successful athlete abruptly died of flu despite having no history of health issues. Price Merepol McMahon, 36, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, died on Tuesday in a hospital where doctors called her a “one-in-a-million case of influenza”.McMahon was preparing to compete in her first Boston Marathon and ran almost 13kms to prepare for the race just two days before her death. Her health suddenly declined on Monday evening when started feeling feverish and she died by Tuesday afternoon, reported the Boston Globe.She was rushed to the hospital after complaining of trouble breathing.Her oldest brother, Ian Meropol, said: “The doctor’s words, I’ll always remember this. This is a one-in-a-million case of influenza.’”“She was always incredibly smart, hardworking, driven, she was the one that everyone knew would be successful,” he said.Her family said McMahon had no underlying health condition and was a sports enthusiast, skiing playing tennis, and even completing the New York City Marathon in under four hours.The flu is typically dangerous to young children and elderly people while other adults only have risk if they have underlying health problems, such as asthma, heart disease, or diabetes, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The annual virus has reemerged this year after laying dormant for much of the Covid pandemic. Experts have described this flu season as the worst since the 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic.Annually, roughly 12,000 to 50,000 die from complications after getting sick from the flu. This year influenza cases emerged weeks earlier than normal, infecting people at rates not seen before January, the state’s health official said earlier this month.The severity of flu has been categorised as “very high” and 4.3 per cent of hospitalisations have been blamed on influenza in the latest weekly flu report.McMahon spent Sunday at her parent’s house where they celebrated Hanukkah and cheered for Argentina’s victory in the World Cup final.She leaves behind her husband of nine years, Jimmy, and their children, seven-year-old Rosie and five-year-old James. The family has set up a GoFundMe to help them navigate an “unexpected” loss. It has raised $159,173 as of Thursday morning.Her brother said an open house is planned to take place Friday from 10am to 5pm, and they are expecting a number of guests which would be “a true testament to Price” and her impact.More aboutBostonFamilyMassachusettsFluInfluenzaJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Boston mother, 36, dies of the flu in tragic ‘one-in-a-million’ caseBoston mother, 36, dies of the flu in tragic ‘one-in-a-million’ casePrice Merepol McMahon, 36, from Boston died of flu on 20 December GoFundMe✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Photograph: Lyndon Stratford/AlamyInfectious diseases This article is more than 1 year oldExplainerFlu, Covid, RSV: why is Britain so very ill?This article is more than 1 year oldTwo years of barely being exposed to such bugs seems to have disrupted their usual patternsLinda Geddes Science correspondentFri 30 Dec 2022 12.52 GMTLast modified on Thu 5 Jan 2023 06.38 GMTShareNew Year’s Eve gatherings, drinks with the neighbours: with zero restrictions on mixing, and almost three years of catching up to do, it’s perhaps no surprise that many of us have been struck down with a mysterious lurgy that causes fever, sore throat, headache and other decidedly Covid-like symptoms – perhaps more than once.But if you are consistently testing negative for Covid on a lateral flow test, what else could it be? And are we really more vulnerable to getting sick this winter, or have we just forgotten what life was like before Covid restrictions stopped the usual merry-go-round of seasonal infections?December 2022 has been party season not only for humans but for influenza, metapneumovirus, RSV and all manner of other bugs that spread through snot, respiratory droplets, and sloppy kisses under the mistletoe.Flu continues to spread in England with number of hospital patients up 79%Read moreCovid continues to circulate, with a 22% increase in hospital admissions recorded in England between 7 and 14 December. Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “The difficulty is that we don’t have freely available PCR tests any more, and a lot of people who are vaccinated [against Covid] don’t necessarily show up on LFTs if they are infected.”Testing several times as your illness progresses may be the only way to rule out Covid – and even then you may never know for sure. But although Covid may be the first thing we think of when we feel seriously unwell, it is by no means the only bug capitalising on the heady pre-Christmas cocktail of social events.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Figures from the college’s research and surveillance centre show that rates of influenza-like illnesses, respiratory conditions and the common cold have been rising – and we are currently seeing cases of strep, tonsillitis and upper respiratory infections above the seasonal average.”The biggest problem at the moment is flu. The number of patients in hospital with flu has risen 79% in the past week, according to new data. An average of 3,746 people with flu were in hospital across the seven days to 25 December, up from 2,088 the previous week, according to NHS England.The winter of 2017-18 was a really bad flu season, with the highest number of excess winter deaths recorded in England and Wales in more than 40 years – although below-average temperatures may also have contributed.“This year’s flu season started earlier than in 2017, and it seems to be tracking a similar kind of trajectory, with cases still going up,” said Dr Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious diseases and clinical senior lecturer at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.Flu can be severe, even in younger, healthy people. “It can be like a bad cold, but it can also be drenching night sweats, really severe joint pains, and older people in particular are vulnerable to pneumonia,” Ho said.“Another dangerous thing is that flu, in particular, predisposes to secondary bacterial infections. A lot of the group A strep that is currently circulating in children is probably linked to preceding respiratory virus infections.”Indeed, the UK also experienced higher than usual numbers of scarlet fever and invasive strep A infections after the 2017-18 flu season.Current data suggest that the main strain of influenza circulating in the UK is H3N2, which tends to be associated with more severe disease, particularly in vulnerable groups such as elderly people and young children. The current flu vaccine broadly covers this strain, but even during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well matched to the vaccine strains, vaccination only reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60%.Although uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine among adults has been similar to the last couple of years, uptake among children has been lower, with just a third of two- to three-year-olds having been vaccinated by late November; typically, children receive their vaccine through a nasal spray. At present, about 650 children under five are in hospital with flu in England, roughly 44% more than at same time in 2019-20.However, influenza isn’t the only virus doing the rounds that can cause flu-like symptoms. Infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are higher than normal, and, although babies and young children are at greater risk of hospitalisation and death, RSV can also trigger symptoms such as a bad cough and fever in adults.“There was a big peak of rhinovirus not long ago, and then you have things like metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and seasonal coronaviruses,” said Griffin. “Upper respiratory tract viruses, such as rhinoviruses, tend to be associated with a runny nose, but everyone responds differently so it’s really hard to symptomatically define which respiratory virus you’ve got.”Like influenza, most of these viruses peak during winter, as they replicate faster and stay infectious for longer when it is cold. Exposure to cold air also reduces the innate immune defences in our noses, making it easier for us to be infected with airborne viruses, and we are exposed to more of them when we spend more time socialising indoors.Two years of barely being exposed to such bugs appears to have disrupted their usual patterns. Typically, a certain number of people will get infected each year, due to immunity from past exposure wearing off in adults, and a fresh batch of young children never having encountered them before. But if these seasonal waves are suppressed, for example due to school closures and restrictions on mixing, then the number of susceptible individuals in a population will increase – particularly if vaccine uptake for some of these viruses is low.Now that people are mixing more, wearing masks less and paying less attention to ventilation and vigilant hand hygiene, opportunities for these susceptible individuals to be infected – and to pass these infections on – are great.This does not mean that we should routinely try to get infected with such viruses to keep our immune systems strong. Ho said: “The fact that some kids are encountering a lot of these bugs later on is not necessarily a bad thing. For example, a lot of kids under the age of one have real breathing difficulties with RSV. The fact that they won’t have encountered it during their first year of life is probably a good thing, because they will now have a more mature immune system that’s better able to deal with it.”A further complication is that some people may be infected with more than one virus – or a virus and a bacterium – at the same time. According to a study of hospital patients published in the Lancet earlier this year, those who tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 and influenza were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, or to die, compared with those who only had Covid. Patients who were co-infected with Sars-CoV-2 and an adenovirus – another virus that can cause common cold or flu-like symptoms – were also at greater risk of death.The likelihood of viral co-infections may be greater this winter, because various respiratory viruses appear to be peaking at the same time, rather than sequentially as happened pre-pandemic. “In a normal year, RSV would tend to peak before Christmas, and then flu would happen around Christmas or just afterwards. Now we’ve also got Sars-CoV-2 happening at the same time, so a lot of things are different,” Griffin said.The good news is that many of these illnesses are preventable, through good public hygiene such as regular handwashing, throwing tissues away once they’ve been used, and staying away from other people if you’re unwell.“It’s also essential that vulnerable patients such as elderly patients, those with underlying health conditions, and young children come forward to receive their flu vaccinations and Covid-19 boosters when they are invited for them,” said Hawthorne. “Getting vaccinated is the best possible protection that we have against these winter viruses, and it is not too late.”Explore more on these topicsInfectious diseasesCoronavirusFluHealthexplainersShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘Long flu’: study finds flu patients at higher risk of longer-term illness14 Dec 2023UK detects its first human case of swine flu strain 27 Nov 2023Respiratory infection clusters in China not caused by novel virus, says health ministry26 Nov 2023England to deny Covid and flu jabs to under-65s despite fears for NHS this winter8 Aug 2023Flu and pneumonia deaths a quarter higher than usual in England and Wales20 Jan 2023Universal flu vaccine may be available within two years, says scientist25 Nov 2022Flu season in England is worst for a decade, says health secretary9 Jan 2023Ambulance staff reportedly urged to conserve oxygen amid ‘twindemic’30 Dec 2022Flu continues to spread in England with number of hospital patients up 79%30 Dec 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldUS elections 2024UKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Many people tend to equate having the flu to catching the common cold, and not influenza, says one doctor.

Old wives’ tales speak of developing a fever after getting drenched in the rain, or catching a chill after spending too much time in a cold air-conditioned environment. Do these things really cause you to fall ill? Since they have similar symptoms, how do you know if you’ve caught a cold or have the flu? CNA spoke to doctors to find out. What’s the difference between a cold and the flu? When your colleague on medical leave says they’ve caught a cold, this usually refers to the common cold, which is a mild viral upper respiratory tract infection, said Dr Tan Teck Shi, who leads the respiratory workgroup at SingHealth Polyclinics. Colds are caused by many viruses, with the most common being the rhinovirus. They can also be caused by the parainfluenza virus and coronaviruses, said medical director of Parkway Shenton Dr Edwin Chng. Both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are also caused by coronaviruses. Catching a cold and having the flu have different meanings to different people, so doctors often have to clarify with patients what they mean, said Dr Derek Li, a senior family physician with Raffles Medical. The common cold is an umbrella term that applies to all infections that cause symptoms involving the upper respiratory tract – the nose, throat and ears – like a sore throat, cough, phlegm, runny or blocked nose, blocked ears and so on, he added. "The same virus can cause different symptoms in different people,” he added. On the other hand, the flu, or influenza, is a specific viral respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus, said Dr Tan. Influenza is more well-known because it causes seasonal outbreaks and accounts for a significant number of deaths each winter from viral pneumonia, said Dr Li. “It also happens to be one of a very small number of pathogens for which vaccines exist,” he added. Influenza symptoms typically include a high fever of 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, body aches and a dry cough. The fever may come before the onset of cough, sore throat and runny nose, doctors said. Many people tend to equate having the flu to catching the common cold, and not influenza, he shared. What about catching a chill? You might have also heard people around you say they’ve caught a chill after getting caught in the rain. Is this also caused by a virus? According to doctors, catching a chill is more of a symptom, and is usually a sign that you’re running a fever. Chills are a feeling of coldness that you may experience during a high fever, said Dr Tan. “It occurs during fever due to the release of chemicals as part of the inflammatory response to the infection, when the brain sets the body temperature higher. The patient feels cold or chills when the body temperature rises,” he added. “Shivering also occurs along with chills because the patient's body produces heat during muscle contraction in a physiological response during fever.” Running a fever on its own does not give a lot of insight into the cause, said Dr Li. “Many non-infectious conditions including severe allergic reactions, auto-immune conditions and arthritis flare-ups like gout can also cause a fever.” As for what might lead to catching a chill, Dr Tan said that there is no scientific evidence that getting wet or being in a cold environment increases your risk of infection. Both the common cold and influenza are caused by viruses transmitted through air droplets from person to person, he added. But according to Dr Li and Dr Chng, exposing the body to sudden drops in temperature can weaken the immune system, but the infection “has to come from somewhere”. “To put it another way, if I stand in the middle of an empty field and jump into a tub of iced water, I cannot fall sick unless I am also concurrently ​being exposed to a virus or bacterium," Dr Li explained. "That is not to say that we will never fall sick in a vacuum. “Our bodies are naturally harbouring thousands of germs in our airways and gastrointestinal tract all the time, so we can still fall ill if the immune system gets weakened enough for one of these germs to overpower our defences and manifest as a new illness.” When the weather is cold, the tiny hairs in our nostrils, which trap and filter viruses, are less efficient in cold weather, said Dr Chng. Blood vessels in the nose also constrict, resulting in fewer white blood cells from the immune system reaching the nose to wipe out any viruses, he added.

Year-end flu season back as doctors in Singapore see rise in respiratory infections Between a cold and the flu, which is more serious? The common cold is usually milder, with less severe complications, doctors said. Generally, flu symptoms are more intense and start more abruptly, said Dr Chng. Influenza poses the greatest health risks and can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, inflammation of the heart or brain, and even death, he added. It also has the highest mortality rate compared to other viruses that cause cold symptoms, said Dr Li, noting that seasonal influenza strains in Singapore account for a few thousand deaths each year. “The elderly, those with multiple chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and young infants under one year old are most at risk of bad outcomes from an influenza infection,” he added. What should I do if I think I have a cold or the flu? Should I see a doctor? Most patients with the common cold or influenza should feel better within about a week, doctors said. Getting enough rest, eating well and drinking enough water are all important to recover from a common cold, they stressed. Symptoms such as coughing may be mild or may last for one to two weeks, said Dr Andrew Lee, a family physician with the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics. On most occasions, individuals can choose to recover at home if their symptoms are mild and do not last more than three to five days, he added. "It also depends on whether they feel strong or confident enough to look after themselves at home," said Dr Lee, who is an advisor for infectious diseases and immunisation at Yishun Polyclinic. "They should be able to eat or drink, especially fluids, while they recover at home, and have support readily available should they fall ill." The treatment is usually symptomatic, said Dr Chng. For example, analgesics - or painkillers - can be used for fevers, sore throats or headaches. There are also antitussives for cough and anti-histamines for runny or blocked noses, he added. Chills can be relieved with paracetamol or muscle relaxants, said Dr Chng. “The speed of recovery is the same whether or not you take any medicines at all,” said Dr Li. Symptomatic medicines serve to make you feel better during the recovery process but make no difference to the time taken to recover, he added. Patients should also avoid alcohol and caffeine as this may cause dehydration, and they can use a salt-water gargle to soothe a painful throat, said Dr Lee. "To help with nasal congestion, drink enough warm water, which can increase mucus flow and loosen the congestion in the nose, or try using an air humidifier, which may help," he added. They should also frequently wash their hands, and wear a mask or cough and sneeze into the inside of the elbow, to prevent spreading the infection to others, said Dr Lee. Dr Tan encouraged people to take the flu vaccination every year to protect themselves against influenza. However, you should see a doctor if you have severe symptoms like a high fever, persistent cough with breathlessness, chest pains or poor appetite and fatigue, he added. Those who have asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease or kidney disease should see a doctor, he continued. Patients below the age of five or elderly above the age of 65, as well as patients undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy, should also visit the doctor if they experience common cold symptoms.
