The study focuses on the structure-based design of stabilized recombinant influenza neuraminidase (NA) tetramers.
Recombinant NAs across non-bat subtypes adopt various tetrameric conformations, including an "open" state.
The researchers used homology-directed protein design to stabilize multiple recombinant NAs in the "closed" state, resulting in improved thermal stability.
Stabilization of the NA tetramers also improves their affinity to protective antibodies elicited by viral infection.
The findings provide insights into NA structure, stability, and antigenicity, and offer design strategies for reinforcing the conformational integrity of recombinant NA proteins.
