Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are reported to be at risk for respiratory and nonrespiratory complications. What is added by this report? Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration had a more than five times higher risk for in-hospital death and increased risk for 17 respiratory and nonrespiratory complications than did hospitalized patients with influenza. The risks for sepsis and respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications of COVID-19 were higher among non-Hispanic Black or African American and Hispanic patients than among non-Hispanic White patients. What are the implications for public health practice? Compared with influenza, COVID-19 is associated with increased risk for most respiratory and nonrespiratory complications. Certain racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionally affected by COVID-19.

Data that examine all in-hospital complications of COVID-19 and that compare these complications with those associated with other viral respiratory pathogens, such as influenza, are lacking. To assess complications of COVID-19 and influenza, electronic health records (EHRs) from 3,948 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (March 1–May 31, 2020) and 5,453 hospitalized patients with influenza (October 1, 2018–February 1, 2020) from the national Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health care system in the United States,* were analyzed. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, complications in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were compared with those in patients with influenza. Risk ratios were calculated and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions; proportions of complications were stratified among patients with COVID-19 by race/ethnicity. Patients with COVID-19 had almost 19 times the risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than did patients with influenza, (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 18.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.40–28.00), and more than twice the risk for myocarditis (2.56; 1.17–5.59), deep vein thrombosis (2.81; 2.04–3.87), pulmonary embolism (2.10; 1.53–2.89), intracranial hemorrhage (2.85; 1.35–6.03), acute hepatitis/liver failure (3.13; 1.92–5.10), bacteremia (2.46; 1.91–3.18), and pressure ulcers (2.65; 2.14–3.27). The risks for exacerbations of asthma (0.27; 0.16–0.44) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (0.37; 0.32–0.42) were lower among patients with COVID-19 than among those with influenza. The percentage of COVID-19 patients who died while hospitalized (21.0%) was more than five times that of influenza patients (3.8%), and the duration of hospitalization was almost three times longer for COVID-19 patients. Among patients with COVID-19, the risk for respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications, and sepsis was higher among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) patients, patients of other races, and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) patients compared with those in non-Hispanic White (White) patients, even after adjusting for age and underlying medical conditions. These findings highlight the higher risk for most complications associated with COVID-19 compared with influenza and might aid clinicians and researchers in recognizing, monitoring, and managing the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations. The higher risk for certain complications among racial and ethnic minority patients provides further evidence that certain racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionally affected by COVID-19 and that this disparity is not solely accounted for by age and underlying medical conditions. The study population comprised two cohorts of hospitalized adult (aged ≥18 years) VHA patients: 1) those with nasopharyngeal (90%) or other specimens that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during March 1–May 31, 2020, and 2) those with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B by rapid antigen assay, real-time RT-PCR, direct or indirect fluorescent staining, or viral culture, during October 1, 2018–February 1, 2020. Patients who received an influenza diagnosis after February 1, 2020, were excluded to minimize the possible inclusion of patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were restricted to those with a COVID-19 or influenza test during hospitalization or in the 30 days preceding hospitalization (including inpatient care at a nursing home). Patients who were still hospitalized as of July 31, 2020, or who were admitted >14 days before receiving testing were excluded from the analysis. Data from EHRs were extracted from VHA Praedico Surveillance System, a biosurveillance application used for early detection, monitoring, and forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks† and Corporate Data Warehouse. Data included age, sex, race/ethnicity, ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, hospital admission and discharge date, and, if applicable, date of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and date of death. Thirty-three acute complications (not mutually exclusive) were identified using ICD-10-CM codes from the hospitalization EHR (2). Underlying medical conditions were identified using ICD-10-CM codes from inpatient, outpatient, and problem list records from at least 14 days before the specimen collection date (3). Categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test and continuous variables with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Among patients with COVID-19, the risk for complications was compared among racial/ethnic groups using log-binomial models, adjusting for age and underlying medical conditions, with White patients as the reference group. Relative risk for complications in patients with COVID-19 compared with those with influenza were estimated using log-binomial models, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. To assess bias from seasonality in complications unrelated to influenza or COVID-19, a sensitivity analysis restricted to cases diagnosed during March–May of 2019 (influenza) and March–May of 2020 (COVID-19) was conducted. All analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). The data used in this analysis were obtained for the purpose of public health operations in VHA.§ Because no additional analyses were performed outside public health operational activities, the activity was determined to meet the requirements of public health surveillance as defined in 45 CFR 46.102(l)(2), and Institutional Review Board review was not required. During October 1, 2018–February 1, 2020, 5,746 hospitalized patients received a positive influenza test result and during March 1–May 31, 2020, 4,305 hospitalized patients received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. For both groups, testing occurred during the 30 days preceding hospitalization or while hospitalized. A total of 132 patients admitted >14 days before testing were excluded, as were 518 patients who were still hospitalized as of July 31, 2020, leaving 5,453 influenza patients and 3,948 COVID-19 patients for analysis. Patients with COVID-19 were slightly older than were those with influenza (median = 70 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 61–77 years versus 69 years; IQR = 61–75 years) (p = 0.001), but patients with influenza had higher prevalences of most underlying medical conditions than did those with COVID-19 (Table 1). Black patients accounted for 48.3% of COVID-19 patients and 24.7% of influenza patients; the proportion of Hispanic patients was similar in both groups. The percentage of COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU (36.5%) was more than twice that of influenza patients (17.6%); the percentage of COVID-19 patients who died while hospitalized (21.0%) was more than five times that of influenza patients (3.8%); and the duration of hospitalization was almost three times longer for COVID-19 patients (median 8.6 days; IQR = 3.9–18.6 days) than that for influenza patients (3.0 days; 1.8–6.5 days) (p<0.001 for all). Among patients with COVID-19, 76.8% had respiratory complications, including pneumonia (70.1%), respiratory failure (46.5%), and ARDS (9.3%). Nonrespiratory complications were frequent, including renal (39.6%), cardiovascular (13.1%), hematologic (6.2%), and neurologic complications (4.1%), as well as sepsis (24.9%) and bacteremia (4.7%); 24.1% of COVID-19 patients had complications involving three or more organ systems. Among COVID-19 patients, nine complications were more prevalent among racial and ethnic minority patients, including respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications, even after adjustment for age and underlying medical conditions (Table 2). Compared with patients with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had two times the risk for pneumonia; 1.7 times the risk for respiratory failure; 19 times the risk for ARDS; 3.5 times the risk for pneumothorax; and statistically significantly increased risks for cardiogenic shock, myocarditis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cerebral ischemia or infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, acute kidney failure, dialysis initiation, acute hepatitis or liver failure, sepsis, bacteremia, and pressure ulcers (Figure). Patients with COVID-19 had a lower risk for five complications (asthma exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina, acute congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertensive crisis), although acute MI or unstable angina, acute CHF, and hypertensive crisis were not statistically significant when restricting to patients diagnosed during the same seasonal months. Top Discussion Findings from a large, national cohort of patients hospitalized within the VHA illustrate the increased risk for complications involving multiple organ systems among patients with COVID-19 compared with those with influenza, as well as racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19–associated complications. Compared with patients with influenza, those with COVID-19 had a more than five times higher risk for in-hospital death and approximately double the ICU admission risk and hospital length of stay, and were at higher risk for 17 acute respiratory, cardiovascular, hematologic, neurologic, renal and other complications. Racial and ethnic disparities in the percentage of complications among patients with COVID-19 was found for respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications, as well as for sepsis. Persons from racial and ethnic minority groups are increasingly recognized as having higher rates of COVID-19, associated hospitalizations, and increased risk for severe in-hospital outcomes (4,5). Although previous analysis of VHA data found no differences in COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity (4), in this analysis, Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic patients of other races had higher risks for sepsis and respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications than did White patients. The disparities in acute complications among racial and ethnic minority groups could not solely be accounted for by differences in underlying medical conditions or age and might be affected by social, environmental, economic, and structural inequities.¶ Elucidation of the reasons for these disparities is urgently needed to advance health equity for all persons. The risk for respiratory complications was high, consistent with current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza pathogenesis (1,6). Notably, compared with patients with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had two times the risk for pneumonia, 1.7 times the risk for respiratory failure, 19 times the risk for ARDS, and 3.5 times the risk for pneumothorax, underscoring the severity of COVID-19 respiratory illness relative to that of influenza. Conversely, the risk for asthma and COPD exacerbations was approximately three times lower among patients with COVID-19 than among those with influenza. The risk for certain acute nonrespiratory complications was also high, including the risk for sepsis and renal and cardiovascular complications. Patients with COVID-19 were at increased risk for acute kidney failure requiring dialysis than were patients with influenza, consistent with previous evidence of influenza- (2) and COVID-19–associated (7) acute kidney failure. The frequent occurrence and increased risk for sepsis among patients with COVID-19 is consistent with reports of dysregulated immune response in these patients (8). The distribution of cardiovascular complications differed between patients with influenza and those with COVID-19; patients with COVID-19 experienced lower risk for acute MI, unstable angina, and acute CHF but higher risk for acute myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. There were no significant differences in occurrence of acute MI, unstable angina, and CHF among patients with COVID-19 or influenza diagnosed during the same months, suggesting potential confounding by seasonal variations in cardiovascular disease. Other less common (<10%), but often severe complications included hematologic and neurologic complications, bacteremia, and pressure ulcers. Whereas other viruses, like influenza, might cause proinflammatory cytokines and clot formation (6), the findings from this study suggest that hematologic complications are a much more frequent complication of COVID-19, consistent with previous reports of COVID-19–related thromboembolic events (1,9). A New York City study reported that the odds of stroke were 7.6 times higher among COVID-19 patients than among those with influenza (10), which is consistent with the present findings of a twofold increase in the risk for cerebral ischemia or infarction. Patients with COVID-19 might be at increased risk for pressure ulcers related to prolonged hospitalizations, prone positioning, or both. The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, administrative codes might have limited sensitivity and specificity for capturing conditions and might misclassify chronic conditions as acute. Extreme obesity was defined based solely on ICD-10-CM codes and not body mass index, resulting in potential misclassification and residual confounding. Second, clinician-ordered testing could potentially underestimate some complications in patients with less typical respiratory symptoms. Third, the analysis of racial differences was limited by the small sample size within the non-Hispanic Other race group. Fourth, the generalizability of results might be limited by the diversity and moderate severity among adults of the predominant circulating influenza type/subtype during the period of this analysis (A H3N2 in 2018–2019 and A H1N1 and B in 2019–2020).** Fifth, influenza vaccination or treatments for COVID-19 or influenza that might affect these outcomes were not examined. Finally, this analysis did not adjust for region or facility size or type, and further research is warranted to assess the impact of these factors on the risk for COVID-19 complications. Hospitalized adult VHA patients with COVID-19 experienced a higher risk for respiratory and nonrespiratory complications and death than did hospitalized patients with influenza. Disparities by race/ethnicity in experiencing sepsis and respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications, even after adjustment for age and underlying medical conditions, provide further evidence that racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionally affected by COVID-19. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms and signs of a spectrum of complications among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 so that interventions can be instituted to improve outcomes and reduce long-term disability.

These viruses cause systemic infection in poultry and accidental human infection leads to severe pneumonia, associated with high mortality rates. The hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 HPAIV possesses multiple basic amino acids, as in the sequence RERRRKKR at the cleavage site; however, the role of this motif is not fully understood. Here, we showed that a 33-amino acid long peptide derived from HA of H5N1 HPAIV (HA314-46) has the potential to penetrate various cells and lung tissue through a sialic acid-independent endocytotic pathway. Mutant peptide analyses revealed that the cysteine residue at position 318 and multiple basic amino acids were essential for the cell-penetrating activity. Moreover, reassortant viruses possessing H5 HA could enter sialic acid-deficient cells, and virus internalisation was facilitated by cleavage with recombinant furin. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the HA314-46 motif exhibits cell-penetrating activity through a sialic acid-independent cell entry mechanism.

These viruses have a segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome within the envelope1. Among many subtypes, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) are a serious threat to public health and the global economy2. Since the first human infection in Hong Kong3,4, H5N1 HPAIVs have caused hundreds of hospitalisations and deaths with a high fatality rate5,6. Furthermore, the emergence of other neuraminidase subtypes such as H5N6 and H5N8, arising from the same ancestral H5N1 virus, has threatened human and animal health7,8. Hence, a better understanding of the interspecies transmission mechanism is crucial to prevent and control the spread of HPAIVs with H5 subtypes.Influenza A virus infection is initiated by the binding of hemagglutinin (HA) to cell surface receptors, sialylated glycoconjugates9. There are two main forms that determine the host tropism: sialic acid-α(2,3)-galactose for avian cells and sialic acid-α(2,6)-galactose for mammalian cells10. Following cell entry through endocytosis, the HA proteins change conformation under low pH conditions in the endosome, which causes fusion of viral-endosomal membranes9. For membrane fusion to occur, the precursor protein HA0 must become proteolytically cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits in the trans-Golgi network or on the plasma membrane11. In contrast with the HA proteins of low pathogenic viruses, the HA proteins of H5N1 HPAIVs contain multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site12. This characteristic sequence is cleaved by ubiquitous cellular proteases, such as furin and proprotein convertase 613,14, suggesting systemic infection in poultry15. Thus, the amino acid sequence of HA cleavage site is a key determinant for organ tropism and pathogenicity of influenza A viruses.The HA cleavage site motif of H5N1 HPAIV resembles cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as trans-activator of transcription (TAT) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)16. The representative amino acid sequence of HA cleavage site motif from H5N1 HPAIV is RERRRKKR and that of TAT peptide is YGRKKRRQRRR. CPPs can efficiently transport a wide variety of biologically active conjugates including proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, small chemical compounds, and nanoparticles into cells via energy-dependent endocytosis and/or energy-independent direct penetration17,18. In addition to TAT peptide19,20, peptides with cell-penetrating activity have been found in other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 121, dengue virus22, hepatitis B virus23,24, and human papillomavirus25,26. However, little is known about the functional roles of these peptides during virus infection. For example, TAT is secreted by HIV-infected cells, but the role of the secreted TAT in virus replication or pathogenesis remains elusive27.In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the cell-penetrating activity of HA cleavage site motif stimulates a sialic acid-independent cellular entry of H5N1 HPAIV.ResultsThe C-terminal domain of HA1 protein from H5N1 HPAIV has an ability to internalise into cellsIn general, the activities of CPPs are not selective17. We first investigated whether the C-terminal domain of H5N1 HPAIV HA1 protein has cell-penetrating activity. For these experiments, HA314-46 peptide comprising the wild-type C-terminus of HA1 protein from H5N1 HPAIV and the HA314-38 peptide lacking the multiple basic amino acids were used (Fig. 1a). TAT peptide was used as a positive control for CPP assay. These peptides were labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Confocal microscopic examination of COS-7 cells incubated with HA314-46 or TAT peptide showed that the spotted fluorescence signal was localised in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, there was no internalisation of HA314-38 peptide. To confirm the CPP activity of HA314-46 peptide, KU812 cells were also treated with these peptides. Similar to TAT, the HA314-46 peptide could also penetrate into the cells. However, HA314-38 peptide was not cell-permeable. To quantify the intensity of cell penetration, geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in viable cells was measured by flow cytometry. Cells incubated with HA314-46 or TAT peptide displayed a significant increase of MFI, while HA314-38 mutant peptide lost the ability to penetrate cells (Fig. 1c). We further evaluated the duration of peptide uptake. The HA314-46 peptide uptake was maximised at 120 min and remained until 240 min (Supplementary Fig. S2). Conversely, the cell-penetrating activity of TAT peptide peaked at 30 min. HA314-38 mutant peptide was not internalised following incubation for 240 min. Cationic CPPs are known to non-specifically bind to the outside of the cell membrane, leading to false-positive results28. To remove the peptides absorbed to cell surface, KU812 cells were treated with 0.1% trypsin after peptide uptake. The increase of MFI in the case of HA314-46 or TAT peptide persisted even after trypsin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating the intracellular localisation of the peptide.Figure 1H5N1 HPAIV-derived HA314-46 peptide exhibits cell-penetrating activity. (a) Three-dimensional structure of HA protein and amino acid sequences of H5N1 HPAIV-derived HA314-38, HA314-46, and HIV-1-derived TAT peptides. The structure and sequence were obtained from the SWISS-MODEL Repository50 (https://swissmodel.expasy.orgepository/uniprot/D9I6N5) and the UniProt database (Protein ID; D9I6N5), respectively. Red-coloured residues represent multiple basic amino acids in HA314-46 and TAT peptides. (b,c) Cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 peptide in COS-7 and KU812 cells.

Representative images from three experiments are shown. Green, peptide; Blue, nucleus. Scale bar, 10 μm. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FITC in viable cells was measured by flow cytometry (c).

Asterisks indicate significant increase by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. **p < 0.01.Full size imageH5N1 HPAIV-derived HA314-46 peptide exhibits a broad cell tropismNext, we examined the cell specificity of H5N1 HPAIV-derived HA314-46 peptide using a wide variety of cell lines of different origins. Cells were incubated with HA314-38, HA314-46, or TAT peptides and then geometric MFI in viable cells was determined by flow cytometry. The results showed that HA314-46 peptide was non-selectively internalised into adherent (A549, HeLa, NIH/3T3, J774A.1, COS-7, and MDCK), and non-adherent (KU812, Jurkat, Raji, U937, THP-1, and HL-60) cell lines, as is the case with TAT peptide (Supplementary Table S1). In non-adherent cell lines, HA314-46 peptide was observed to be highly permeable in KU812 cells, whereas it showed low incorporation into HL-60 cells at the same dose. To investigate the incorporation of HA314-46 peptide into primary cells, mouse splenocytes were prepared and subjected to cell penetration assay. Cell surface markers were utilised for the separation of cell populations: macrophages, CD11b+F4/80+MHC class II+; CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD4+; CD8+ T cells, CD3+CD8+; and B cells, CD19+B220+ (Supplementary Fig. S4). These cell surface markers could be stained with antibodies even following a 0.1% trypsin treatment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that HA314-46 peptide was able to penetrate immune cells including macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B cells (Fig. 2a). We further tested the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 peptide in vivo. For this purpose, anaesthetised mice were intranasally administered with peptides to monitor the distribution in lung tissues. Tissue sections showed the wide distribution of HA314-46 and TAT peptides in lungs (Fig. 2b). In the same model, non-permeable HA314-38 peptide was not detected in the lungs as the peptide was washed out during the preparations of tissue sections.Figure 2HA314-46 peptide penetrates several different types of cells and mouse lung tissue. (a) Cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 peptide in mouse primary cells. Splenocytes were freshly isolated from C57BL/6 N mice and were incubated with or without 10 μg/mL of FITC-conjugated peptides for 60 min at 37 °C. MFI of FITC in each cell population was analysed by flow cytometry. Data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 4). Asterisks show significant increase by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. **p < 0.01. (b) Peptide distribution in the lung tissue of mouse intranasal inhalation model. C57BL/6 N mice were intranasally exposed with 25 μg of FITC-conjugated peptides or saline (-). Lung frozen sections were stained with anti-fluorescein/Oregon Green polyclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody for eliminating autofluorescence in the sections. The distribution of peptides was examined by confocal microscopy. Representative images from five experiments are shown. Red, peptide. Scale bar, 100 μm. Counterstaining of the serial section was done with H&E dyes.Full size imageCysteine residue and multiple basic amino acids are necessary for HA314-46 peptide internalisationUsing several peptides, we attempted to determine the essential motif of the HA314-46 peptide. The amino acid sequence of each peptide is summarised in Table 1. In this screening, KU812 cells were exposed to HA peptides of various lengths. After washing and trypsinisation, geometric MFI was measured using flow cytometry. Two HA peptides (HA318-46 and HA314-46) permeated through the plasma membrane and resulted in an increase of MFI in viable cells (Fig. 3a). These peptides included a 29-amino acid residue region, spanning from 318 to 346 of HA protein from H5N1 HPAIV. Meanwhile, the shorter HA peptides, such as HA339-46, did not exhibit cell-penetrating activity. To identify amino acid residues essential for the activity of HA314-46 peptide, we replaced the cysteine residue at position 318 with serine (C318S) or alanine (C318A). Strikingly, C318S or C318A mutations abolished the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 peptide (Fig. 3b). In UniProt protein knowledgebase (Q5EP31), cysteine residues are known to form disulphide bonds at position 294 and 318. To determine whether disulphide bond formation affects the cell-penetrating activity, HA peptides were incubated in the presence or absence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)29. In contrast to the C318S- and C318A-mutant peptides, HA314-38 and HA314-46 peptides produced homodimers by DMSO oxidation (Supplementary Fig. S5a and S5b). Mass spectrometry analyses showed that the peak area ratio of homodimer/monomer in HA314-46 peptide was increased by DMSO oxidation (DMSO (-) 0.11 vs DMSO ( +) 0.91). In HA314-46 (C318S) mutant peptide, no difference was observed in peak area ratio of homodimer/monomer between DMSO (-) and DMSO ( +). DMSO-treated HA314-46 peptide exhibited a twofold increase in MFI compared to the non-treated peptide (Supplementary Fig. S5c), indicating the uptake of homodimers containing two FITC molecules.Table 1 List of peptides for CPP assay.Full size tableFigure 3Cysteine residue and/or multiple basic amino acid mutations impair the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 peptide. (a) Screening of membrane-permeable HA peptide sequences. KU812 cells were incubated with different lengths of HA peptides or a TAT peptide. (b) Cell-penetrating activities of cysteine-substitution mutants of HA314-46 peptide. KU812 cells were incubated with cysteine-substitution mutants of HA314-46 (C318S or C318A), HA314-46, or TAT peptide. (c) Cell-penetrating activities of C-terminal basic amino acid deletion mutants of HA314-46 peptide. KU812 cells were incubated with HA314-38, HA314-44, HA314-45, HA314-46, or TAT peptides. (d) Cell-penetrating activities of C-terminal amino acid mutants observed in naturally occurring isolates of H5 subtype. KU812 cells were incubated with intact or mutant HA314-46 or TAT peptide. After incubation with 10 μg/mL of FITC-conjugated peptides at 37 °C for 60 min, the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis to measure MFI of FITC. Data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 3 or 4). Asterisks indicate significant increase by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. **p < 0.01.Full size imageNext, we examined the functional importance of multiple basic amino acids in greater detail. For this experiment, we deleted one or two basic amino acids from the C-terminus of HA314-46 peptide and found that the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 was markedly decreased (Fig. 3c). Specifically, it was reduced to one-third in HA314-45 peptide, while HA314-44 peptide was unable to permeate cells. In addition, we investigated whether HA314-46 activity was affected by the mutations of multiple basic amino acids found in naturally occurring isolates of H5 subtype. All HA314-46 mutant peptides retained the ability to enter cells, yet the cell-penetrating activities were attenuated by the diverse mutations (Fig. 3d).HA314-46 peptide utilises endocytosis to penetrate cellsNext, we examined the cellular uptake mechanism of HA314-46 peptide. To determine whether this peptide is internalised by endocytosis or direct penetration, KU812 cells were incubated with peptides at 37 and 16 °C. The internalisation of HA314-46 peptide was markedly reduced at 16 °C, which was consistent with the case of nona-L-arginine (R9), the prototype of cationic CPP (Fig. 4a). To reveal the major endocytic pathway of HA314-46 uptake, we tested the effect of 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a macropinocytosis inhibitor. When the cells were treated with EIPA, the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4b). Similarly, the cell-penetrating activity of R9, which is partially mediated by macropinocytotic pathway30, was also inhibited by EIPA.Figure 4HA314-46 peptide is internalised through an energy-dependent endocytotic pathway. (a) Influence of incubation temperature on HA314-46 peptide uptake. KU812 cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL of FITC-conjugated HA314-38, HA314-46, or R9 peptide for 60 min at 37 or 16 °C. (b) Effect of EIPA on HA314-46 peptide uptake. KU812 cells were pre-treated with vehicle (DMSO) or EIPA (10, 20, 40 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL of FITC-conjugated HA314-38, HA314-46, or R9 peptide for 60 min at 37 °C. MFI of FITC in viable cells was analysed by flow cytometry. Data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 3 or 7). Asterisks indicate significant decrease by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. **p < 0.01; ns, not significant.Full size imageSialic acids are not necessary for HA314-46 peptide internalisationWe further investigated the uptake mechanism of HA314-46 peptide using sialidase and sialic acid-deficient cells. To determine the levels of cell surface sialic acids, which bind to influenza HA proteins, KU812 cells were stained by Maackia amurensis (MAA) lectin for sialic acid-α(2,3)-galactose or Sambucus nigra (SNA) lectin for sialic acid-α(2,6)-galactose. MFI was significantly increased in the cells stained with MAA lectin, but not SNA lectin (Supplementary Fig. S6a). Consequently, KU812 cells predominantly express sialic acid-α(2,3)-galactose on the cell surface. Next, KU812 cells were pre-treated with bacterial sialidase to test whether sialic acid residues are associated with HA314-46 incorporation. As expected, sialidase treatment led to a marked reduction in MAA-binding (Supplementary Fig. S6b), showing that α2,3-linked sialic acids were removed from the cell surface. However, the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 was not blocked by desialylation with sialidase (Supplementary Fig. S6c). To confirm these findings, CHO-K1 and Lec8 mutant cell lines were used. We also utilised A549 cells as a positive control for lectin staining31. In CHO-K1 cells, high level of sialic acid-α(2,3)-galactose was expressed, while sialic acid-α(2,6)-galactose was not detected on the cell surface (Fig. 5a). The expressions of these sialic acid residues were absent in Lec8 cells, which is defective in the transport of UDP-galactose32. When these cells were incubated with HA314-46 or R9 peptides, peptide uptake was not decreased in Lec8 cells (Fig. 5b). Following these experiments, we assessed the effect of trypsin pre-treatment on HA314-46 incorporation. Pre-treatment with TPCK-trypsin inhibited the uptake of HA314-46 peptide in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S7). Proteoglycans play a critical role in the cellular uptake of oligo-arginine peptide33; and to evaluate that role, we used pgsA-745 cell line which is deficient in xylosyltransferase34 and does not produce proteoglycans. In comparison to CHO-K1 cells, HA314-46 and R9 uptakes were greatly reduced in pgsA-745 cells (Fig. 5b).Figure 5HA314-46 peptide internalisation is unconstrained by sialic acid residues. (a) Cell surface levels of α(2,3)- and α(2,6)-linked sialic acid-galactose on A549, CHO-K1 and Lec8 cells. The cells were stained with FITC-conjugated MAA or SNA lectin for 15 min at 24–28 °C. (b) Cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 peptide in CHO-K1, Lec8 and pgsA-745 cells. These cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL of FITC-conjugated HA314-38, HA314-46, or R9 peptide for 60 min at 37 °C. MFI of FITC in viable cells was determined by flow cytometry. Data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 3).

Several reassortant viruses were generated by reverse genetics (Table 2). PR8, comprising all A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) genes, served as a parental control virus. UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 carried an R339G-mutated HA gene of the A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 (H5N1) virus and the remaining genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). These viruses were expanded in MDCK cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin or furin. Furin cleaves many protein precursors at the C-terminus of a consensus sequence (R-X-R/K-R)11. Hence, the arginine residue at position 339 of UT3040HA was replaced with glycine to avoid being cleaved at the centre of multiple basic amino acids by furin. In UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 viruses, trypsin would cut multiple basic amino acids at random, whereas furin was predicted to cleave precisely at position 346. Using CHO-K1 and Lec8 cells, we investigated the ability of reassortant virus to invade these cells. As expected, fluorescent microscopic and flow cytometric analyses showed that CHO-K1 cells were susceptible to all reassortant viruses (Fig. 6a). In comparison with trypsin-treated UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 virus, viral nucleoprotein-positive cells were elevated in furin-treated one. A similar result was obtained when Lec8 cells were incubated with the H5-subtype reassortant viruses (Fig. 6b). Furin processing significantly enhanced the internalisation of UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 virus compared to those with trypsin digestion. Although sialic acid-deficient Lec8 cells were highly resistant to invasion of PR8, UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 viruses were able to enter these cells.Table 2 Origin and partial amino acid sequences of HA proteins of reassortant viruses.Full size tableFigure 6Cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 drives sialic acid-independent virus internalisation. (a, b) Entry of reassortant viruses into CHO-K1 and Lec8 cells. CHO-K1 (a) and Lec8 (b) cells were incubated with trypsin- or furin-treated reassortant viruses at 37 °C for 1 h at MOI of 10. After washing and incubation for 8 h in the culture medium, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. (c) Effect of EIPA on sialic acid-independent entry of furin-treated UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 viruses. Lec8 cells were pre-treated with vehicle (DMSO) or EIPA (10, 20, 40 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C and then were incubated with furin-treated UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 viruses as described in (b). After washing, the cells were further incubated for 8 h in the culture medium containing vehicle or EIPA. (d) Propagation of UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 virus in Lec8 cells. Lec8 cells were treated with reassortant viruses as described in (b). After washing, the cells were incubated in the culture medium at 37 °C for 24 and 48 h. The fixed cells were permeabilised and stained with anti-influenza A nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (a-d). Localisation of the viruses was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. Representative images from four or six experiments are shown. Green; viral nucleoprotein, Blue; nucleus. Scale bar, 20 μm. The graphs in the bottom panels indicate the proportion of viral nucleoprotein-positive cells by flow cytometric analysis. Data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 4 or 6). Asterisks indicate significant difference by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05; ns, not significant.Full size imageWe further investigated the role of proteoglycans in the UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 virus entry using the pgsA-745 mutant cell line. The percentage of nucleoprotein-positive cells was not impaired in pgsA-745 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). Next, we examined the effect of EIPA on the entry of furin-treated UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 virus into Lec8 cells. The analyses using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry indicated that the nucleoprotein-positive cells were significantly reduced in the presence of more than 20 μM EIPA (Fig. 6c). Total cell number and cell viability were not affected by EIPA treatment (Supplementary Fig. S9a).To determine if reassortant viruses can replicate in Lec8 cells, the virus-inoculated cells were cultured in serum-containing medium for 24 and 48 h. In this experiment, Lec8 cells became confluent at 24 h and total cell number was comparable between 24 and 48 h cultures (Supplementary Fig. S9b). PR8 could not proliferate in this condition as HA protein was not cleaved. In contrast, exposure of UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 to Lec8 cells considerably expanded the proportion of nucleoprotein-positive cells at 48 h post-infection (Fig. 6d), indicating that UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 viruses are able to replicate in Lec8 cells and infectious progeny viruses are released these cells.DiscussionHere, we demonstrated that HA314-46, 33-amino acids in the C-terminus of H5N1 HPAIV HA1 protein, functioned as a CPP in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, both the cysteine residue at position 318 and multiple basic amino acids were of determined to be of critical importance for cell-penetrating activity. We also demonstrated that HA314-46 activity might contribute to H5N1 HPAIV entry through sialic acid-independent endocytotic pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that CPP is involved in the cellular entry of influenza A virus.CPPs are short protein fragments that can pass through cell membranes and tissue barriers17. Since their first discovery in 1988, numerous CPPs have been reported35. However, there are several pitfalls in this field. One of the most critical issues is the insufficient experimental methods to evaluate the localisation and amount of uptake36,37. For example, flow cytometry is frequently used to quantitatively measure the uptake of peptides, however, it is difficult to discriminate between internalised and cell surface bound peptides using only this method. Here, using two different techniques, namely confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we showed here that the C-terminal domain of H5N1 HPAIV HA1 protein functioned as a CPP. In this study, the HA314-46 internalisation was further confirmed using 0.1% Trypsin–EDTA treatment for 10 min at 37 °C after peptide incubation to circumvent the non-specific binding of the peptides on the cell surface. Although our findings were inconsistent with those of a recent brief report that described the shorter sequence (SPQRESRRKKR) of H5 HA cleavage site acts as a CPP38, the controversial results may have been due to their evaluation of cellular uptake using flow cytometry without efficient treatment with a protease, such as trypsin. The discrepancy should be carefully evaluated in further studies. Additionally, in a screening assay for HA peptide with cell-penetrating activity, we demonstrated that the cysteine residue played a pivotal role in the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46. Although our findings indicate that disulphide-linked HA314-46 homodimers also possess the cell-penetrating activity, the functional role of the cysteine residue at position 318 remains unclear.The cellular uptake mechanisms of CPPs are the subject of intense investigation37. First, we conducted a temperature dependent assay to assess the involvement of endocytosis. Similar to R9, the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 was attenuated at 16 °C which blocks energy-dependent processes without affecting membrane fluidity36,39. Moreover, HA314-46 internalisation was inhibited by the treatment of EIPA. Together, these results suggest that the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 is mediated by an energy-dependent endocytic pathway, such as macropinocytosis. Cationic CPPs have been thought to electrically interact with anionic plasma membrane components such as proteoglycans33. In addition, two reports that show interaction of oligo-arginine with CXC chemokine receptor type 440 and binding of CendR peptide to neurophilin-141 must be noted. In our study, HA314-46 internalisation is not abolished in sialic acid-deficient cells, however, it is markedly reduced by trypsin pre-treatment of cell surface. These results suggest the existence of proteinaceous receptors on the host cells for HA314-46. Although HA314-46 is able to penetrate into various types of cells, there was marked difference in uptake efficiency between KU812 and HL-60 cells. This result may be useful in identifying the specific receptor. In the present study, proteoglycans were associated with HA314-46 peptide uptake, however, it remains uncertain whether proteoglycans act as a host cell receptor in the sialic acid-independent cellular entry of H5N1 HPAIV. The reason might be the abundance of sialic acid-α(2,3)-galactose on pgsA-745 cells. The interactions of proteoglycans with HA314-46 during H5N1 HPAIV infection may be covered by the predominant pathway through sialic acid on the cell surface. Therefore, this warrants further investigation to fully elucidate the cellular entry mechanism of HA314-46.The mechanism of viral transmission has been garnering attention in influenza virus research42. In H5N1 HPAIVs, many studies have focused on the affinity and specificity of HA for sialic acid receptor42,43,44. However, the tropism of H5N1 avian influenza viruses does not necessarily correlate with the distribution pattern of sialic acid45,46. Moreover, H5N1 viruses are shown to have an ability to infect sialidase-treated human bronchial epithelial cells47. H5N1 HPAIV viruses can also infect epithelial cells of the human upper respiratory tract, such as nasopharynx, adenoid and tonsil, despite the lack of sialic acid-α(2,3)-galactose48. These reports suggest that other viral factors may affect the transmission of H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Using reassortant virus with H5 HA and recombinant furin, we found that the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 might contribute to sialic acid-independent cellular entry of H5N1 HPAIV. The reason why this alternative entry route has not been noted before, might be accounted for by the partial cleavage of HA314-46 sequence by proteases at the multiple sites or the total degradation; that is, to exert the cell-penetrating activity of HA314-46 during H5N1 HPAIV infection, multiple basic amino acids, which are crucial domains for cell-penetrating activity, need to be cleaved accurately at the C-terminus of HA1 protein (RRRKKR/GLF) by proteases such as furin. Another possible reason may be the location of the cleavage site within the HA protein. Although the cleavage site protrudes from the surface, it is located in a prominent loop distant from the receptor binding site in the globular head region11. Similar to HA314-46 peptide, the alternative virus entry pathway occurred by endocytosis, and virus replication was observed in sialic acid-deficient cells. Therefore, our findings propose a sialic acid-independent mechanism in which H5N1 HPAIV invades host cells by using CPP activity. Additional studies expanding our findings to animal models are needed to understand the significance of HA314-46-mediated cellular entry in the infectivity and pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAIVs.In conclusion, we discovered that H5N1 HPAIV has the potential to infect host cells by using CPP activity of the C-terminal domain of the HA1 protein. These findings provide novel insights into the role of HA cleavage site motif during virus infection and may help us to better understand the mechanism of H5N1 HPAIV infection.MethodsPeptidesAll peptides were synthesised and purified to greater than 95% for in vitro and in vivo applications (Toray Research Center, Inc., Kamakura, Japan). The qualities were confirmed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. For detection of peptide internalisation, FITC was conjugated at the N-terminus of a peptide through a 6-aminohexanoic acid linker. FITC-conjugated peptides were dissolved in sterile deionised water at 1 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use.CellsCell lines were purchased from JCRB Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan), RIKEN BRC (Tsukuba, Japan) or ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA).

These cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In the experiments using mouse primary cells, splenocytes were freshly isolated from surgically excised spleens of naïve C57BL/6 N mice (CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). All mice experiments were approved by the animal experiment committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science (Permission number: 13075) and were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines for animal experiments of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science.Confocal microscopy imagingCOS-7 cells (6 × 104 cells) were cultured overnight on glass slides (Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) using flexiPERM slide (SARSTEDT AG & Co. KG, Numbrecht, Germany). After washing with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS), cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL FITC-labelled peptides or serum-free Opti-MEM (Gibco) for 60 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 34580 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). After washing, the localisations of fluorescent peptides were observed in living cells without fixing. KU812 cells (2.5 × 105 cells) were incubated with 10 μg/mL FITC-labelled peptides or Opti-MEM in 96-well plates for 60 min. To remove peptides non-specifically bound on cell surface, cells were treated with 0.1% trypsin–EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing, cytospin slides were prepared and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA). Slides were examined by a LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope (ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were processed using the ZEN 2.3 SP1 software version 14 (https://www.zeiss.co.jp/microscopy/products/microscope-software/zen.html).Flow cytometric analysisCOS-7 cells (2 × 104 cells) were cultured in 24-well plates for one day. CHO-K1, Lec8 and pgsA-745 cells (3 × 104 cells) were grown in 24-well plates for two days. After washing with D-PBS, these adherent cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL FITC-labelled peptides or Opti-MEM for 60 min at 37 °C and then harvested by 0.25% trypsin–EDTA treatment. KU812 cells and splenocytes (2.5 × 105 cells) were incubated with 10 μg/mL FITC-labelled peptides or Opti-MEM in 96-well plates for 60 min and then treated with 0.1% trypsin–EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. After Fc-receptor blocking by incubation with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), splenocytes were stained with antibodies against CD8α, CD19, B220, F4/80, I-A/I-E (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), CD3e, CD4, and CD11b (BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice. For experiments with macropinocytosis inhibitor, KU812 cells were treated with 10, 20, and 40 μM EIPA for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated with 10 μg/mL FITC-labelled peptides in the presence of EIPA. Data were obtained using BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and geometric MFI of FITC in 7-aminoactinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich)-negative viable cells was analysed using FlowJo software version 10 (https://www.flowjo.com/solutions/flowjo) (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).Immunohistochemical analysis of murine intranasal inhalation modelIsoflurane-anaesthetised C57BL/6 N mice were challenged with intranasal administration of 25 μg of FITC-conjugated peptides or saline. Lung tissues were isolated at 15 min after inhalation and fixed in 10% formalin neutral buffer solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The tissues were embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek Japan Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and sectioned continuously at 10-μm thickness. After washing, sections were permeabilised with 0.3% PBS-T, blocked with normal rabbit serum, and stained with Fluorescein/Oregon Green polyclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at 24–28 °C. Serial sections were counterstained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) dyes (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Fluorescent images and bright-field pictures were obtained using an LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope and a BZ-9000 microscope (KEYENCE Corp., Osaka, Japan), respectively.Sialic acid-galactose levels on cell surfaceA549, CHO-K1, and Lec8 cells were stained with FITC-conjugated MAA or SNA lectin (EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA) at 24–28 °C for 15 min. Data were acquired using BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer and analysed using FlowJo software version 10.Generation of reassortant viruses by reverse geneticsHA gene of A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 (H5N1) virus was cloned to generate reassortant viruses by reverse genetics. Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatant containing infectious virus using ISOGEN II (NipponGene Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Then, full-length HA gene of A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 was amplified with gene-specific universal primer sets as described by Hoffmann et al.49. The amplified HA gene was directly cloned into BsmBI-digested pHW2000 expression vector using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc. Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The pHW2000 vector for the expression of A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 HA mutant (UT3040HA (R339G)) was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. All constructs were sequenced and analysed with ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).For generating reassortant viruses and parental A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, MDCK and 293 T cells were co-transfected with eight pHW2000 vectors (1 μg of each vector) using 16 μL of TransIT-293 Reagent (Takara Bio USA, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, Opti-MEM containing 1 μg/mL trypsin acetylated from bovine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich) or recombinant human furin (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) was added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The collected viruses were further propagated in MDCK cells grown in DMEM (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 1 μg/mL trypsin acetylated from bovine pancreas or recombinant human furin and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 48 h. The culture supernatants were titrated by plaque assay using MDCK cells and were stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. HA genes of the collected viruses were sequenced to verify the absence of undesired mutations. All procedures using reassortant viruses were performed in biosafety level 3 facilities by personnel wearing powered air-purifying respirators.Virus infection assayCHO-K1 and Lec8 cells (2 × 104 cells) were cultured for three days in 12-well plates. These cells were incubated with reassortant viruses at an MOI 10 for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 unit/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin for 8, 24, or 48 h. For the macropinocytosis inhibition study, Lec8 cells were pre-incubated with 10, 20, and 40 μM EIPA for 30 min at 37 °C and infected with furin-treated UT3040HA (R339G)/PR8 reassortant virus as mentioned above. Cells were incubated for an additional 8 h in the presence or absence of EIPA. The infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.5% Triton-X for immunofluorescence or BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) for flow cytometry, and stained with anti-influenza A nucleoprotein antibody (Clone HB65) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) for 60 min at 24–28 °C. Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI, and fluorescent images were acquired with a BZ-9000 microscope. The percentages of influenza nucleoprotein-positive cells were analysed by BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer and FlowJo software version 10.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean + standard error of the mean (SEM).

As school, work and weather drive people indoors this fall and winter, health officials expect flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 to spread. Get your flu shot early. It takes about 2 weeks for the immunization to fully protect you. Because both flu and COVID-19 will be circulating this winter, it’s more important than ever to do what you can to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. “We have all had to adapt our daily lives to slow the pace of COVID-19 spread because we don’t yet have an effective and widely available vaccine for this virus,” said Health Officer Dr. Jennifer Vines. “But we do have a vaccine against the flu. It’s not perfect, but it’s the best way to prevent the flu. Even if you are using masks and keeping your distance.” Influenza viruses circulate year-round, but cases typically rise by December, remaining high through the winter. Last season 504 people in the Tri-County region were hospitalized with the flu. Getting a flu shot can lower your chances of catching the flu. And if you do get the flu, symptoms are often more mild thanks to partial protection from the vaccine. But it takes the vaccine about two weeks to fully protect you. So get it now. Get your Flu Shot today! COVID-19 precautions at clinics might make getting your flu shot a bit more complicated, but this year it’s more important than ever to keep families healthy and keep healthcare running smoothly. Multnomah County is planning community flu vaccination events for later this fall. But there are many ways residents can get their flu shots today: Check with your health care provider about how to get a flu vaccine this year. Most large-chain pharmacies can also provide the flu vaccine and accept many forms of insurance. Check flu.oregon.gov for information about locations near you. If you don't have a regular doctor, call Multnomah County's Primary Care Clinics to learn about becoming a patient. Vaccines and primary care services are provided to patients, regardless of ability to pay or insurance. Call to learn more: 503-988-5558. Any Multnomah County youth ages 5 to 18 can get a flu shot at any of the following Student Health Centers.

Influenza, or the flu, is a contagious, respiratory illness caused by a number of flu viruses. The flu can cause mild or serious illness. The very young, the elderly and people with underlying conditions are at higher risk of severe flu, including hospitalization. How is flu spread? Flu viruses spread mainly through coughing or sneezing. Sometimes people become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose. People are most contagious for the first three to four days after they begin to feel sick, but it’s possible to pass the flu to someone else before someone feels sick. Some healthy people can infect others a day before symptoms develop and up to a week later. Others, especially young children and people with weakened immune systems, might be contagious for even longer. What’s happening with COVID-19? COVID-19 is spreading through our community. The virus seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people, especially the elderly. The same precautions that can prevent you from getting and spreading COVID-19 can also prevent you from getting and spreading flu viruses: Wear a face covering Keep 6 feet from others not in your household Wash hands often for at least 20 seconds Cover coughs and sneezes Stay home when sick What are the symptoms of flu? There are differences between symptoms of flu, COVID-19, a common cold and allergies, although many symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar. Symptoms of the flu include: Fever Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Body aches Headache Chills Fatigue vomiting and/or diarrhea What should I do if I become ill? If you become ill with fever and other flu-like symptoms, you may have influenza. Most people will recover at home with self care. Stay home, rest, and drink plenty of fluids. You can treat symptoms like fever with non-prescription medicines. Read the labels and talk to your health care provider for advice if needed. People who test positive for the flu should stay home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever or signs of a fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. Before going back to your usual activities after being sick, you should make sure you are fever-free for 24 hours and that other symptoms are definitely improving. If you are unsure and think you may have COVID-19, wait for 10 days to pass since your symptoms started. This is especially important before having close contact with someone who is high risk for serious COVID illness. How can I protect myself and my family? The same things that protect people from COVID-19 will help prevent the spread of flu. It’s important to wear a face covering around people who don’t live in your home and stay home if you begin to feel ill. Here are the four key ways to prevent flu: Get a flu shot. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself from getting the flu. Stay home when sick. By staying home you can help reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Cover your cough. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or the crook of your elbow, not your hands. Wash your hands. Hand washing is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of disease. Washing hands thoroughly and frequently is important every day, not just when you are sick. We are still learning about COVID. There is no evidence that getting a flu shot makes you more likely to get sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19. When should I call the doctor? If you are experiencing flu-like symptoms and you have a medical condition or are over 65, call your medical provider today. Your provider will decide whether you should go in for an exam and treatment or not. It is especially important to talk to your provider if any of these apply to you: Pregnant Cancer Blood problems Lung problems Diabetes Heart, kidney or liver disease Nervous System or muscle diseases Weakened immune system Obese (over about 250 lbs for women and 300 lbs for men) You get sicker after flu-like symptoms seemed to get better If you are experiencing any of the following serious warning signs, you should get emergency care right away. Call 911 if necessary: In Adults and Children Confusion or can’t be woken up Difficulty breathing Pain or pressure in chest or abdomen Blue lips Skin rash Unable to drink or keep liquids down In Children Fever in an infant under three months old Unusual fussiness Influenza Getting a flu shot is the best way to prevent the flu.

At its worst, it can be fatal. As North America enters its first full flu season since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many are wondering about the intersection of these two respiratory viruses. In the following Q&A, Assoc. Prof. Allison Bartlett of the University of Chicago Medicine examines what might happen if we wind up facing a “twindemic”—the collision of the COVID-19 pandemic and a particularly bad seasonal flu. A leading infectious diseases expert and associate director of the Infection Control Program at the University of Chicago Medicine, Bartlett has some good news: Many of the steps we take to protect ourselves from the coronavirus are the same things we need to do to remain safe from influenza this winter. How will COVID-19 impact North America’s flu season? We base our flu season predictions on influenza activity the Southern Hemisphere where the seasons are reversed. Their flu season was more mild than usual, and I remain optimistic we’ll see that here. But most people believe the Southern Hemisphere’s mild influenza season was actually due to all of the safety precautions that were in place because of the coronavirus. Masking, washing hands and staying at least 6 feet away from other people are very effective at preventing the spread of both COVID-19 and the flu. Plus, most children were home from school, which helped minimize flu transmission. How concerned are health care providers about the intersection of a bad flu year and COVID-19? We’re very concerned about the potential impact of these two viruses. A bad influenza season can have a major impact on our hospitals and hospital bed capacity, and that’s without the impact of the pandemic. Layer in a sharp uptick in patients from the coronavirus, and there could be a severe problem across the country. Does COVID-19 or influenza pose a greater risk for people this season? Either virus can make you very sick or lead to death, but with influenza we have the opportunity to focus on prevention because we have additional tools in our arsenal that help decrease overall infections. There are definitely patient populations that are more at risk for severe complications for each infection. Elderly patients and those with chronic underlying conditions seem to be much more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19. And kids, especially infants under 1, and pregnant women are more likely to have severe infections with influenza. Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time? What happens if you do? There’s no biological reason you can’t get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time, and we really don’t have a great answer to what that could look like. Flu alone is going to make you miserable. COVID-19 alone is going to make you miserable. It’s not an unreasonable assumption that the two of them together could make someone very, very sick. Does having COVID-19 give you any antibodies against a respiratory virus like the flu? There are some infections that are less likely to happen after you have the flu. However, we don’t know if COVID-19 is going to be one of those. Unfortunately, there is no antibody level cross protection from flu and COVID-19. Your ability to fight off one is independent of the other. What we don’t understand, on a biological basis, is what happens if you’re exposed to COVID-19 or influenza after your lungs/airways have already been damaged by a recent infection. The science just isn’t out there yet. How can you tell if you have flu or COVID-19? The best way to tell if you have influenza or the coronavirus is to get tested. Symptoms are virtually indistinguishable, with the notable exception that some people with COVID-19 lose their sense of taste and smell. Add in the fact that people can have either infection without symptoms, and it’s basically impossible to tell one from the other on your own. Testing determines the best treatment and whether there needs to be contact tracing. The good news is that many health care providers who are doing coronavirus tests should be able to test you for flu at the same time. Will the flu shot protect me against the coronavirus? The flu shot will help prevent people from becoming sick from influenza but won’t provide specific protection against COVID-19. However, the fewer people who are sick at once, the better things are on a community level—whether that’s from flu or from the coronavirus. It’s why we’re pushing the flu vaccine so hard this year and pushing people to get it earlier than usual. If there’s a resurgence of COVID-19, it may be hard to access health care providers to get flu shots later in the season. Can Tamiflu or the flu shot treat COVID-19? Tamiflu or a flu shot will not directly treat or lessen the symptoms of COVID-19. And, unfortunately, we don’t have vaccine or a readily available treatment for COVID-19 that’s accessible for patients. At this point, all we can do is treat the symptoms of COVID-19. But you can get vaccinated against the flu, which can prevent an infection or lessen its severity. And if you get sick with influenza or have been exposed to it, you can take antiviral medication like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to prevent getting sick. What should you do if you develop influenza or COVID-19 symptoms? If you have any respiratory symptoms, stay home, stay away from other people and try to isolate yourself to prevent the spread to others. If you have access to testing, try to get tested within 48 hours of the start of your symptoms. If it’s influenza, your health care provider can prescribe medication to help your symptoms improve faster. We used to encourage people to wait several days before getting COVID tests, but new research shows tests can be accurate early on. It’s also helpful to get tested for COVID-19 as soon as you can to expedite contact tracing. Will the pneumonia vaccine protect me against the flu or COVID-19? The pneumonia vaccine helps protect against a variety of bacteria that can cause bacterial pneumonia, which can develop several days to a week after a viral infection. The pneumonia vaccine won’t prevent flu or COVID-19, but it can help prevent complications that may come after. Can I boost my immune systems to protect against flu or COVID-19? I wish there were a list of things we could do to help our immune systems to keep us from getting sick with the flu or the coronavirus. But there’s no magic immune-boosting drug. Instead, focus on eating a healthy, varied diet and getting enough sleep. Also, make sure you’ve got any chronic medical conditions under control. Can I do anything to decrease my chance of getting very sick if I’ve been exposed? Once an exposure to influenza or COVID-19 has happened, there’s not a lot we can do to modify who gets sick from it. If you’ve got influenza, your physician may give you some medication like Relenza (zanamivir), Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Rapivab (peramivir). The best thing you can do is focus on prevention. —A version of this story was first published by the University of Chicago Medicine.

Published October 20, 2020 COVID-19 Epidemiology Health Policy Infectious Diseases Q&A WITH ANDREW PEKOSZ There’s a refrain that “COVID-19 is just the flu,” which is not at all accurate. Andrew Pekosz, PhD, says it can be hard to differentiate the two based on symptoms alone. But large numbers of susceptible people and increased rates of severe disease and death set COVID-19 apart from seasonal influenza. Pekosz, a leading virologist who works on both diseases, breaks down key differences between COVID-19 and influenza to show why this pandemic is so critically—and catastrophically—dangerous. What would you say to someone who insists to you that COVID-19 is “just the flu”? Since December 2019, COVID-19 has killed more people in the U.S. than influenza has in the last five years. Influenza is a significant burden on the population, but COVID-19 has had a vastly larger effect. Are people more susceptible to COVID-19 or the flu? Many more people are susceptible to COVID-19 because there is little preexisting immunity to the virus that causes it—SARS-CoV-2. Through vaccinations and previous infections, a portion of the population has some immunity to influenza, which helps limit the number of cases we see each year. There is a lot of similarity between how the two viruses are spread, but the number of susceptible people is really what allows SARS-CoV-2 to spread so easily. If infected, which has the higher rate of severe disease and mortality? How much higher? COVID-19 has a higher severe disease and mortality rate than influenza in all age groups, except perhaps children under the age of 12. Are the populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease the same as the populations at higher risk for severe flu? There is some overlap. The elderly and individuals with cardiovascular disease or a high BMI have more severe disease with both infections. It looks like children and pregnant women are more susceptible to severe disease with influenza, but it’s not clear why that is. What makes COVID-19 particularly dangerous? First, little preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 means that virtually everyone is susceptible to infection. Second, we don’t have good treatments or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 like we have for influenza. Third, COVID-19 causes more severe disease than influenza overall. Are there long-term health effects of the flu? How do they compare to increasing evidence about long-term health effects of COVID-19? This is another area where the two viruses differ. COVID-19 survivors report many more long-term effects of the infection than influenza survivors. Lingering symptoms like weakness, shortness of breath, trouble focusing and, in some cases, kidney and heart problems are much more common after COVID-19 than after influenza. “Mild” COVID-19 illness has been described as “flu-like.” It’s important to remember that the flu is a pretty debilitating disease so “mild” COVID-19 is still a pretty significant disease. If so many people get only “mild” illness with COVID-19, how can it be more dangerous than the flu? With all infectious diseases, we focus on two main objectives: Treat the infected people Limit the spread of the infection in the population. A large number of COVID-19 patients present with no or very mild symptoms, but those individuals can still transmit the virus to others, some of whom could have a much more serious course of illness. Every person who gets infected keeps the “chains of transmission” going, which can bring COVID-19 to those who are more vulnerable. Is it possible to contract COVID-19 and the flu at the same time, and if so, how dangerous would that be? There have been very few reports of one person infected with both viruses. But we know that COVID-19 has been spreading when influenza has not been detected, so it’s still not clear how big of a risk a co-infection would pose. There was very little influenza in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter (corresponding to the Northern Hemisphere’s summer), but that could be because public health interventions like social distancing and masks worked against influenza. Here in the U.S., we aren’t controlling COVID-19 well enough with public health interventions, so that may open the door for spread of influenza. Since the symptoms are difficult to differentiate, you need to be tested to see if you have SARS-CoV-2, influenza, or perhaps one of the other half dozen or so respiratory infections that usually circulate in fall and winter.

The researchers identified that broadly neutralizing antibodies are commonly polyreactive and are preferentially induced by novel and pandemic-level influenza viruses.The research is inspired by the limited efficacy of the annual flu vaccine, which must be adjusted each year to provide the best protection against commonly circulating strains of the virus, and why it so rarely induces broadly neutralizing antibodies.“For whatever reason, when we are exposed to the flu virus, the antibody response mounted targets the parts of the virus that want to change, so you have to get vaccinated every year to keep up,” said Jenna Guthmiller, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago. “But there are some parts of the virus that don’t change. So why doesn’t the seasonal flu vaccine produce antibodies that target those?”This study has implications for the development of a universal flu vaccine that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and that would only need be administered once or twice during a person’s lifetime, instead of every year.These polyreactive antibodies, like all antibodies, are produced by the body’s B cells. When a person receives their annual flu vaccine, B cells will bind to the inactivated virus and begin generating antibodies against it, preparing the body to fight off the pathogen if it encounters the live flu virus in the environment.This vaccine-induced immune response tends to produce very specific antibodies that target those frequently-changing portions of the antigen on the surface of the virus, in contrast to broadly neutralizing antibodies that can identify the conserved regions that are the same every year.It’s not clear why these polyreactive antibodies aren’t produced by the annual vaccine.“Our research is trying to understand the features of broadly neutralizing antibodies, and why they’re so rarely induced by the seasonal flu vaccine,” said Guthmiller. “In this case, we were interested in understanding what gives polyreactive antibodies the ability to bind to multiple antigens, and the implications of that polyreactivity for the overall immune response.” The new study found that these polyreactive antibodies tend to bind to the portions of the flu virus that are conserved, and that they are preferentially produced when the body encounters a novel flu strain. Importantly, their unique ability to bind to more than one antigen is potentially due to their flexibility; the antibodies themselves can slightly adjust their conformation, allowing them to imperfectly bind to multiple similarly-shaped antigens.This means that polyreactive antibodies are broadly neutralizing due to their ability to attach to and block the portions of influenza virus that are similar across strains and from year to year. Polyreactive antibodies are therefore ideal candidates for developing a universal flu vaccine — one that can not only protect against common annual strains, but also novel influenza viruses, like the H1N1 strain seen during the 2009 pandemic.The flexibility and strength of these polyreactive antibodies may make it seem like the ideal immune solution to protect against the flu, so why doesn’t the seasonal flu vaccine tend to trigger their production?In the study, the investigators also found that these polyreactive antibodies can sometimes bind to the body’s own antigens, causing the polyreactive B cells to be destroyed to avoid an autoimmune response.“What we’re seeing is that there’s this balance. Polyreactivity provides these beneficial features, like broader and better binding, but that comes at the cost of binding to self, which can cause issues,” said Guthmiller. “Our seasonal flu vaccine keeps calling back the same specific antibody response because it’s effective against these limited strains. To get these broadly neutralizing antibodies, like we’d want in a universal flu vaccine, we’ll need something very different, but now we know this has the potential to be self-defeating because of this self-binding.”These results speak to the challenge of developing such a vaccine. “We already know it is difficult to target influenza in a universal fashion,” said Patrick Wilson, PhD, a professor of medicine at UChicago. “For better or worse, this paper provides important insights into properties of antibodies that can more universally target many influenza strains.”The researchers are now working to understand how and why these polyreactive antibodies are self-reactive, and whether or not the immune system actively works to prevent them from being produced. Clarifying their role in the immune response will determine if these polyreactive antibodies can be leveraged safely and effectively and how they might be leveraged to produce a universal influenza vaccine.The study, “Polyreactive Broadly Neutralizing B cells Are Selected to Provide Defense against Pandemic Threat Influenza Viruses”, funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); National Institutes of Health grant numbers U19AI082724, U19AI109946, U19AI057266, P01 AI097092, R01AI145870-01, and T32AI007244-36; the NIAID Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) grant number HHSN272201400005C and HHSN272201400008C; the NIAID Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVIC; 75N93019C00051); and the Austrian Science Fund grant number P30565.

BSIP/UIG Via Getty ImagesWe’ve seen the devastating effects of a pandemic firsthand: the loss of human life, the economic toll, and the impact on everything from mental health to children’s education.Which is why, as Covid-19 spread, people looked for a way to prevent future outbreaks.In the US, people started to call for the closure of “wet markets” overseas. Some research suggested that the many different species living closely together in these markets might have allowed the virus to mutate and jump to humans.But Martha Nelson, who studies viruses at the National Institutes of Health, says that if we’re really serious about preventing a future pandemic, we also need to look closer to home.Sign up for the Meat/Less newsletter courseWant to eat less meat but don’t know where to start?

We’ll send you five emails — one per week — full of practical tips and food for thought to incorporate more plant-based food into your diet.“I think it’s really easy to think that pandemics come from other places,” she explains, “I think it’s really easy to think that they’re foreign invaders coming from other people who were doing things in a bad way. And I certainly would never underplay the importance of wet markets and all the opportunities for novel pathogens to emerge there. But I think it’s sometimes hard to see things in your own backyard.”On this episode of the Future Perfect podcast, Nelson explains the pandemic risk lurking on factory farms in the US.Nelson has studied our system of raising pigs closely, and she argues that by moving pigs across the country and raising large numbers of pigs in very close proximity, we’re creating ideal conditions for a dangerous influenza virus to develop. And since she’s also seen how easily pigs can spread novel viruses to humans, she’s even more concerned.Given the frequency of pig to human transmission, she says, we’re “playing Russian roulette” with our current system of factory farming animals.Further reading:Sigal Samuel wrote an in-depth explainer on the pandemic risks of factory farms earlier this year. She’s also written about “wet markets.” For more on how viruses can spread in the pig population, Martha Nelson has an excellent paper, “When Pigs Fly.”The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations wrote a 2013 report on the health risks of factory farming.Sonia Shah’s book, Pandemic, is a great primer on how pandemic strains emerge.This podcast is made possible thanks to support from Animal Charity Evaluators.

But flu experts say that, while the low numbers could portend a similar scenario in the Northern Hemisphere, it would be a foolhardy not to prepare for high caseloads this winter.Edward Belongia, MD, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Marshfield Research Institute in Wisconsin, said that he doesn't think anyone can predict how severe the flu season will be or how it will co-circulate with COVID-19, because much is still unknown about the novel coronavirus and there is no clear relationship between events in the hemispheres."We don't have many [non-influenza] pandemics to study," he said. "The message is be prepared for a bad flu season on top of a bad COVID season."Strict lockdowns, fewer COVID, flu casesCraig Dalton, MD, MMSc, who founded Flutracking.net, an online surveillance system tracking flu-like symptoms in 150,000 people across Australia and New Zealand, attributes low rates of flu—and COVID-19—in those countries to their swift and strict coronavirus lockdowns, border closures, massive testing efforts with 24-hour average turnarounds, and rapid contact tracing and quarantine.For example, 7 million people live in New South Wales, home to Sydney, but the state had only 66 cases of flu in July and August. (See graphed data on respiratory illness symptoms provided by Dalton at right.)"The rates of [influenza-like illness] have dropped even lower in areas with active COVID-19 cases like Victoria, when the higher-level lockdowns were implemented," he said. "New Zealand, with no COVID except for the brief spillover, also has no flu. The only virus that seems to be circulating apart from COVID-19 is rhinovirus," which causes the common cold.In Australia, police regularly visit homes to ensure compliance with stay-at-home orders, as they did for Dalton when he was quarantining in his home in New South Wales for 2 weeks after visiting another part of the country. Nightclubs have been shuttered since March in New South Wales and Victoria, people who flout stay-at-home orders are fined, protestors are arrested, and, in Victoria, no one could even have a lawn service cut their lawns for several months, Dalton said.Locally acquired COVID-19 cases that are part of large outbreak in Victoria, home to Melbourne, have slowed, with a rolling 2-week average of fewer than 10 cases per day, and only 1 or 2 cases are recorded daily, Dalton said.Also, Australians tend to be more compliant with public health measures and other government mandates than Americans are. Dalton encountered that while working in the United States years ago. "I talked to people and told them that they were exposed to rabies, and they didn't trust me because I was from the government," he said.Most years, about 3% of Flutracking.net participants report cough and fever in the peak of winter, but this year, it fell to about 0.2%, Dalton said. And while Australia does not have a good flu death surveillance system, "the data we do have suggests that it's really down to a low level," Dalton said.In viral competition, advantage COVID-19Richard Webby, PhD, a virologist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, pointed out that Southern Hemisphere countries that haven't followed strict face covering and physical distancing protocols, such as Peru and Chile, also had very low flu activity over the winter. "If we extrapolate that activity to the Northern Hemisphere, we could also have a light influenza season," he said.Webby said that, while no one can predict the severity of any given flu season with accuracy, "my gut feeling is we're not going to have both [flu and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19] circulating extremely widely," due to viral competition, in which the pandemic virus has the advantage.While humans can be coinfected with the viruses, it appears to be relatively rare, he said, because when a virus infects a host, it stimulates a lot of nonspecific immunity against other pathogens for a period. "If you get one infection you might limit the opportunity to have viruses replicating at the same time," Webby said, while emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated against the flu each year.Belongia cited the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic virus, which dominated flu seasons for a couple of years, with "radio silence" from other respiratory viruses immediately after the pandemic. "It was just very quiet, not very much respiratory illness of any type, but there's a lot we don't understand about this virus," he said, adding that the flu and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are very different. "We just don't know."Low flu rates in the Southern Hemisphere may have been influenced by factors other than lockdowns, including substantial changes in protective behaviors, Belongia said. "Changes in contacts, social distancing, mask use, number of contacts that were taken either by governments or just by people themselves to protect themselves against COVID-19 could also dramatically affect transmission of the flu," he said.Or some flu cases may have gone undetected because healthcare facilities stopped providing nonemergent care for a time, and people may have been afraid to visit a healthcare setting for fear of infection, especially if they were not very sick, Belongia said. "Certainly at our healthcare system here, pretty much all routine outpatient visits were shut down," he said.Safe or sorryIn the United States, with no coordinated national response to the coronavirus, high rates of noncompliance with physical distancing, low rates of annual flu vaccine uptake, and many states reporting alarming COVID-19 case surges—in contrast to countries with stringent lockdowns and higher flu vaccine uptake—there may be no flu reprieve, experts say."Because you have low levels of social distancing, you probably will get a lot more transmission than we have," Dalton said. "I think it will reduce it, but I think you might not get anywhere near the reduction that we've gotten."Belongia wants to debunk dangerous misinformation on the Internet that says that flu vaccination could render people more vulnerable to COVID-19. He strongly urges everyone to get vaccinated against the flu and be prepared for a severe flu season."I worry quite a bit about a severe flu season on top of COVID activity that could overwhelm our hospitals that are trying to care for both COVID and flu," he said. "I hope we have a mild flu season, but I absolutely don't think we should count on that."

The other reported fatalities were all elderly. At least eight were in their 70s or 80s with underlying conditions."I understand and regret that people are concerned about the vaccine," Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said, but confirmed the free programme would go ahead."We're looking into the causes but will again thoroughly examine the entire process in which various government agencies are involved, from production to distribution."Professor Kim Jun-kon, who is leading the damage investigation team, has tried to reassure South Koreans about the safety of the vaccination programme. He said that the probe so far had concluded the deaths were not a result of the flu jab. Post-mortem examinations are under way and will also test for Covid-19.Meanwhile, the head of South Korea's Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Jeong Eun-kyeong, told parliament that "our team sees low possibility that the deaths resulted from the shots".This is the second time trust has been shaken in South Korea's vaccination programme.It was earlier suspended for three weeks after it was discovered that around five million doses, which need to be refrigerated, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported to a medical facility.None of the people who have died received the recalled vaccine.Professor Kim has recommended that the vaccination programme continue.

This year, it’s more important than ever to get a flu shot to protect against the spread of influenza (the flu), especially for those who have a higher risk of getting sick. There’s no COVID-19 vaccine yet, but we do have influenza vaccines. Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that can lead to serious illness, hospitalization and death. If influenza spreads rapidly in communities at the same time as COVID-19, it can overwhelm our healthcare system and put our loved ones at risk. The best protection is to get the flu shot this fall and stay home if you’re sick. Northern Health flu clinics start the first week of November Most Northern Health flu clinics will start the first week of November, and flu shots will also be available from pharmacies and doctor’s offices throughout the region. To find a flu clinic or provider nearest you, visit ImmunizeBC’s website, or call 8-1-1 if you don’t have access to the internet. Flu shots are on the way Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recently reassured that there will be enough flu vaccine for British Columbians this year. Vaccine is currently being shipped and distributed to vaccine providers in the North. Here are some things to keep in mind when getting your flu shot this year. Things to keep in mind when getting your flu shot this year: Making an appointment is strongly encouraged to help reduce line-ups and maintain safe physical distancing, due to COVID-19. Plan ahead. Northerners are asked to plan ahead and schedule a time to get their flu shot. It’s ok if it takes a couple weeks to get a flu shot. If it takes a week or two for you to get an appointment with pharmacist, physician, or public health clinic, that’s okay - the best time to do it is end of October and into November. That’s the optimal time to be immunized because then we know that the immunity that you get from the vaccine will carry you through the influenza season. NH public health clinics will be encouraging mask use (for those aged two and up), and implementing physical distancing measures. Please follow the instructions of clinic staff, and respect COVID-19 safety protocols put in place by other flu shot providers. In some communities, the NH Check In app is available to make physical distancing easier while waiting for your flu shot appointment (to download the app, visit: northernhealth.ca). Please note, the NH Check In app is optional to use, and is not for the purpose of making flu shot appointments. Who should get a flu shot Flu shots are recommended for everybody older than six months of age. Flu shots are safe, effective, and free for many people in BC including: children, seniors, pregnant people, Indigenous people, those with underlying medical or chronic health conditions, those who work with or come in close contact with higher-risk groups. Where to get a flu shot To find a flu clinic or provider nearest you, visit ImmunizeBC’s website, or call 8-1-1 if you don’t have access to the internet. Remember: Stay safe, stay calm, and be kind We’re only now just approaching the optimal time to get flu shots. It’s okay if your appointment isn’t right away. It’s also never too late to get your flu shot – there will be opportunities to get immunized whether by public health or other providers, well into the season. As Dr. Henry has said throughout this pandemic, “Be kind, be calm, and be safe” ­– we’ll all get through flu season together!

Have one? Email him at paging.dr.hamblin@theatlantic.com.Dear Dr. Hamblin,I’m perfectly healthy. I’m 42 and I exercise routinely, eat a whole-food, plant-based diet, and have excellent biomarkers. If I get the flu, chances are it will be mild and run its course. So why risk any potential negative side effects of a vaccine? To protect me against something that I might still get even with the shot? Even though I’m sure the risk is low, why should I potentially jeopardize my health? I guess I see only downsides and no upside.Todd KellyPhiladelphia, Pa.Your concerns are widely shared, and your question is important. The answer is especially worth considering because the same logic that guides your decision will apply to the coronavirus vaccines in coming years.Let’s start with the downsides. Any moral decision starts with accurately assessing the risk of taking an action. In this case, it’s as close to zero as anything modern medicine has to offer. If I were going to focus on risks, I’d be more worried about you getting hit by a car on your way to the pharmacy or doctor’s office than anything that might happen because of the shot.Influenza vaccines come in a few types. For healthy American adults like you, the most commonly used variety is the shot. It contains an inactivated form of the virus—either segments of an actual influenza virus’s genetic material or synthetic mimics of those segments. In any case, it can’t cause the flu. Getting the flu from a segment of the virus’s genetic material is impossible. It’s like the difference between inhaling a bee’s wing and inhaling an actual bee.The only type of flu vaccine that contains a living virus is the nasal spray. But even that can’t cause the flu. The nasal vaccine contains a “live attenuated” virus, meaning it can’t invade human cells and replicate, so it’s like inhaling a bee without its stinger and genitals. Why inhale a whole bee at all, you ask? Well, compared with shots, these live-virus vaccines can more reliably induce a broader immune response. Generating a sufficient immune response is, of course, the goal.It’s also the source of any symptoms that might arise after the shot. Most people will have some mild soreness or redness at the injection site. A significant minority will have some fatigue or a headache. These symptoms are a result of your immune system reacting to the proteins that have just been injected into your muscle. Unpleasant as they may be, you could think of them as a sign of your immune system getting stronger, like being sore after one of your workouts. Even if you feel a little uncomfortable, none of these symptoms is comparable in scale or severity to having the flu itself. Like COVID-19, influenza is not a disease that completely spares healthy young adults. Some years it largely does, but other years see thousands of hospitalizations and even deaths. In 1918, to take the worst example, influenza killed millions of young, healthy people.Vaccination carries nothing close to that level of risk. The one scary-sounding, longer-term complication that has been associated with the flu shot, if not definitively linked to it, is something called Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune condition that results when the immune system misfires and attacks parts of the nervous system, causing muscle weakness. In some cases it leads to temporary paralysis of certain muscles. It can happen in the days and weeks after all sorts of viral or bacterial infections (including COVID-19)—any of a menagerie of things that trigger the immune system to go into attack mode. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and global-health agencies suggest that the odds of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after receiving the flu shot are about one or two in a million. And if that sounds too risky to countenance, consider that you’re much more likely to get Guillain-Barré after an actual case of the flu than after getting a vaccine.Read: Why the government pays billions to people who claim injury by vaccinesSo, really, this is sort of like talking about how seat belts may cause redness or irritation on bare skin and, in rare cases, can cause internal bleeding and organ damage during a serious car accident. If you focus on those risks, wearing a seat belt sounds like a bad idea. Why take a chance? But the value of seat belts becomes obvious when you shift your focus to the danger of going without a device that saves tens of thousands of lives every year.Likewise, when weighing the risks of getting a flu shot, you have to consider the much more relevant risks of not getting vaccinated. We get used to health risks—such as deaths from car accidents, heart disease, gun violence, and influenza—as they lose their novelty and start to take them for granted, but that doesn’t make them any less dangerous. Somewhere between 10,000 and 60,000 Americans die of the flu each year. Combine that with the effects of so much illness and missed work, and the virus’s annual impact on the U.S. economy is about $90 billion.This brings us to the upside: If everyone got a flu shot, we could bring those numbers down to about zero. Vaccination is a measure that we undertake to remove ourselves from the pool of susceptible people who can become vectors of disease. You have a great opportunity to do an essentially risk-free thing to play your part in saving thousands of lives. And there’s really no opting out. Whatever you choose, it affects everyone. It’s a personal decision in the same way that driving on the sidewalk is a personal decision.Read: America should prepare for a double pandemicThis is true of getting any vaccine, but especially flu shots, because of the nature of the virus. Influenza mutates so rapidly that each year’s vaccines are based on modeling predictions about which strains will spread most widely. Some years those models work pretty well, and other years they don’t. Even in a good modeling year, a flu shot offers only partial immunity: Some people who get the shot will still be susceptible to the flu. The imperfection means it’s especially important that everyone gets vaccinated to achieve some degree of herd immunity. When you have a more reliably effective vaccine, you can get to herd immunity with a smaller percentage of the population being vaccinated. But with the flu vaccine, we always need to aim for 100 percent participation. Each year, about half of Americans get vaccinated.A partially effective vaccine has one other important effect: It can make the disease milder even if it doesn’t prevent an infection. That means a lower likelihood of going to the hospital and fewer days of being sick. Even if that doesn’t matter to you personally—maybe you have unlimited sick days, or maybe you like being sick (I don’t know)—a shorter course of disease means you’re less likely to infect other people. That’s ultimately what vaccination is about.Paging Dr. Hamblin: What if the vaccine works only half the time?The flu is a global disease that kills more than 500,000 people every year. Someday it will again become a pandemic that kills millions. The rates of death are much higher in countries with less developed health-care systems. The currently available influenza vaccines are difficult to use in low- and middle-income countries without the systems required to vaccinate everyone every year. You and I are lucky to live in a wealthy country and have easy access to a free vaccine. For people like us to forgo it is morally unconscionable.“Paging Dr. Hamblin” is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

One infection can make you more susceptible to others by weakening your immune system.But it will not protect you from COVID-19. Here's a look at how to differentiate the two viruses:The flu vaccine reduces the severity and risk of serious complications, according to the Mayo Clinic.How are they transmitted?According to World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 and influenza viruses can occur through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through secretions.The smallest particles may linger in the air, and another person can inhale them and become infected.Droplets from a sick person can transmit the virus to other people nearby.What symptoms do COVID-19 and seasonal flu have in common?How do flu and coronavirus symptoms typically develop?The first symptom of the flu is more likely to be a cough while for COVID-19 it is a fever. <br><br>COVID-19 can also be distinguished by the loss of taste and smell.However, symptoms vary from person to person. Some COVID-19 Patients experience muscle weakness, inflammation, arrhythmia, and even heart attacks.In 40% to 45% of COVID-19 cases, there may not be any symptoms at all. Most likely order of symptoms:How long does it take for symptoms to appear?When a person is exposed to COVID-19, it can take up to two weeks before symptoms show up.It takes even more time for additional people to become ill after being exposed to that person. So several cycles of infection can occur before public health officials notice signals in data used to track the pandemic. How long do symptoms last?Some COVID-19 cases become much worse at around the 10 to 14-day mark. These individuals often need to go to the hospital.In severe cases, the recovery time may take up to six weeks or more and there may be lasting damage to the heart, kidneys, lungs and brain. Is there a vaccine for either?Currently, there is no approved vaccine for COVID-19. There are antiviral medications and other therapies available to treat symptoms and shorten the illness.A flu vaccine is available. It effectively prevents the most dangerous types of influenza and reduces the duration of infection.Learn more about the differences between COVID-19 and the flu at USATODAY.COM Read the articleRead the articleWhat you need to know about this flu season from the B.C.

Centre for Disease ControlDr. Monika Naus, medical director of the communicable diseases and immunization service at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, joins CBC's The Early Edition with the influenza facts you need to know.Dr. Monika Naus on vaccines, the impact of COVID-19, and why this year could be better than othersCBC News · Posted: Oct 20, 2020 5:30 PM EDT | Last Updated: October 20, 2020Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of serious illness from influenza, such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly, people with certain medical conditions and those able to transmit or spread influenza to those at high risk. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Social SharingDemand is higher than normal for the flu shot in B.C. this year because of COVID-19 concerns and appointments at clinics are filling up fast, but the province's top doc says not to worry.According to Dr. Bonnie Henry, the province has been preparing for this flu season since February and there should be enough of the vaccine available this season for everybody who wants it.To arm British Columbians with the latest facts about the flu, and what they need to know to protect themselves from it, CBC's The Early Edition spoke with Monika Naus, medical director of the communicable diseases and immunization service at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.How important is it for people to get the seasonal flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic? It's important every year for people who are vulnerable to complications of influenza to get their flu shot, and this year is particularly important because we've got this concurrent occurrence of both COVID and influenza.Getting the vaccine will reduce the overall burden of respiratory illness in the population and potentially prevent people who may get infected with COVID from having both it and influenza at the same time, which can be particularly serious.British Columbians face long waits for flu shots as public clinics, pharmacies see high demandThe high dose vaccine for seniors, Fluzone, isn't expected to arrive until at least the end of November. Some seniors may consider going ahead with the standard shot, should they wait?No, I think it's important to get vaccinated when influenza vaccine is available.In the province, we're distributing several types of influenza vaccines. For seniors, Fluzone is available for long term care residents and those in assisted living residences.We also have Fluad, which is specially formulated for an older person and is available in the public health programs. A syringe of high-dose flu vaccine typically given to people over the age of 65 is shown Thursday, Oct. 15, 2020. (Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press) Should people be concerned if they don't get a vaccination until the end of November or even December?You can get vaccinated right up until the end of the flu season. However, we recommend people get vaccinated by the beginning of December if they're in a vulnerable group, because circulation of the flu usually picks up during that month.Considering the high demand for the vaccine, do you recommend people who are low risk who don't interact with many others put off getting a flu shot, so higher risk people can have the limited amount that's available right now? I wouldn't say there's a limited amount of vaccine available. We've distributed almost all of it with a few hundred thousand doses left to come.But, early in the season, vaccinations begin in residential care facilities, and for health-care workers and individuals with high-risk medical conditions such as chronic heart or lung disease or cancer. There should be enough vaccine in the province for that.Many of us are still limiting our activity, wearing masks, washing hands and staying home. Should we expect a quieter flu season?Yes, I think that's a very likely possibility because all the measures that we're taking to prevent transmission of COVID are also effective against influenza.Watch| A breakdown of the vaccination options available in British Columbia:Getting a flu shot this year? Here's what you need to know4 years agoDuration 1:12According to health officials, getting vaccinated for influenza is more important this season because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our health care system.Australia's flu season already proved to be milder and it is possible we will see the same.For children under five in B.C., pharmacists can only administer the vaccine through a nasal spray and not every pharmacist has that. Should the province have done more to make sure the vaccine is available in all forms?Private pharmacies are supplied by their local health units through the B.C. Center for Disease Control and pharmacists are not permitted to administer injectable vaccines to children under five.The intranasal vaccine is approved for use for children aged two and older, and pharmacists can administer that product. Bonnie Henry has said we are in our second wave of the pandemic. What are you watching for?A main concern, much like during the first wave, is overwhelming the health-care system. Do you think it will get to the point again where the provincial government will set up another COVID-19 treatment centre?It remains to be seen.Tap here to find a flu clinic near you.Looking for a flu shot in B.C.?

Blogs You Should Get a Flu Shot if You’ve Had COVID-19: Here’s Why Coronavirus Resources Public Health You Should Get a Flu Shot if You’ve Had COVID-19: Here’s Why October 21, 2020 | Authored by: AdventHealth | Estimated read time: 5 minutes Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Choose the health content that's right for you, and get it delivered right in your inbox Subscribe Now Hide Do you need a flu vaccine if you have COVID-19 or if you’ve had it in the past? The short answer is an emphatic yes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has different recommendations on the ideal timing for getting a flu vaccine, depending on whether you currently have COVID-19 or you have recovered, as well as the severity of your illness. Why the Flu Shot Still Matters If you’ve had COVID-19, you still need a flu shot because different viruses cause the two diseases. A novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, causes COVID-19, and several influenza viruses that change every year cause the flu, the CDC explains. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) determines the three or four flu viruses that are most likely to circulate in the next flu season, and vaccine manufacturers update the flu shot accordingly. In the United States, updates that address genetic changes in two influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and one or two influenza B viruses are included in each season’s flu vaccines. Flu Symptoms and Dangers Recovering from coronavirus does not protect you from catching the flu. Even if you had a mild course of illness, remember that the flu and COVID-19 share some uncomfortable symptoms: Cough Fatigue Fever or feeling feverish and experiencing chills Headache Muscle pain or body aches Runny or stuffy nose Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sore throat Vomiting and diarrhea sometimes, although these symptoms are more common in children than in adults Most people recover from the flu without serious complications while missing work, family time and other activities for up to 14 days. But for some people, the flu leads to hospitalizations and deaths, according to the CDC. Flu complications are similar to many seen with COVID-19: Additional bacterial infections Difficulty breathing due to fluid in the lungs, called acute respiratory distress syndrome Heart attack and stroke Inflammation of the brain, heart or muscle tissues Multiple-organ failure, including respiratory failure, kidney failure and shock Pneumonia Respiratory failure Sepsis Worsening of chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and nervous system disorders In general, people who have a higher risk of serious complications from the flu include adults over the age of 65, pregnant women, very young children, and those with asthma, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease and other chronic medical conditions, the CDC says. People with a weakened immune system due to a disease also have a higher risk of more severe illness with the flu. As the pandemic unfolds, scientists have learned that COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness, even in young adults who were otherwise healthy. Flu can spread before you have symptoms and for several days after you catch it. People with weakened immune systems who have the flu might be able to infect others for even more extended periods, the CDC advises. Postpone Your Flu Shot if You Have COVID-19 Now The best way to protect yourself and others against seasonal flu infection this fall or winter is to get a flu shot. According to the CDC, the flu shot reduced the risk of flu by 40% to 60% when the vaccine was well matched to the viruses estimated to be spreading in previous flu seasons. But if you have a suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection, the CDC advises postponing a flu shot until after your symptoms have resolved. This recommendation is essential if you are very sick, but it also applies if you tested positive for COVID-19 and do not have any symptoms. Post-Coronavirus Flu Shot Timing Use the CDC’s criteria for discontinuing home isolation after COVID-19 to determine your best time for a flu shot: If you never had any COVID-19 symptoms, wait 10 days after the date of your first positive coronavirus test If you had symptoms, wait at least 24 hours after your last fever — without the use of fever-reducing medications — and your symptoms show signs of improving If you were severely ill with COVID-19, you should stay in home isolation for up to 20 days after your symptoms began and consult your doctor about the best time for a flu shot. Technically, it’s OK to have a flu shot if you only have a mild case of COVID-19, the CDC says. However, it recommends postponing getting vaccinated until you are well to minimize the risk of spreading the virus to health care workers and others while you are still contagious. Stay Safe, Get Vaccinated The CDC says it takes about two weeks for protective antibodies to develop in response to the flu shot. It recommends having a flu shot in September and, ideally, by the end of October. But if you’ve had coronavirus and need to wait until you meet the CDC’s criteria for determining when to get vaccinated, rest assured that you can still get a flu shot later in the season, well into January and the early spring months. The CDC expects vaccines will be available for a longer period this flu season because vaccine manufacturers are producing a record number of doses. Protect Yourself, Protect Others From the Flu Getting a flu shot is the most critical step you can take to avoid catching the flu and becoming seriously ill if you do come down with it. Getting vaccinated also helps protect your loved ones, co-workers and members of your community from getting sick, too. Nothing Matters More to Us Than You If you have COVID-19 or had it in the past and have questions about getting a flu shot, speak to your doctor about timing. Flu vaccines are available through AdventHealth primary care physicians and at Centra Care Urgent Care locations.

AcceptRoosevelt Hospital NYC Influenza 1918 | Ephemeral New York Ephemeral New York Chronicling an ever-changing city through faded and forgotten artifacts Posts Tagged ‘Roosevelt Hospital NYC Influenza 1918’ A teacher aids flu victims in a 1918 hospital ward October 19, 2020 Influenza arrived in New York in August 1918, reportedly brought to the East Coast by ocean liners (though how the flu got here is still up for debate). After the first cases were diagnosed, New York City’s health commissioner told the public, “the city is in no danger of an epidemic,” wrote Edward Robb Ellis in The Epic of New York City. “He was wrong,” stated Ellis. In the next few months, the highly virulent and contagious disease dubbed the Spanish flu infected thousands of New Yorkers. Residents safeguarded their health by wearing masks, hospitals were inundated with the sick, and volunteers were desperately needed to replace ill doctors and nurses. Answering this call in 1918 was a young woman named Marion Lynch. At 23 she began traveling from her home in Darien, Connecticut to Manhattan to volunteer at Roosevelt Hospital on 59th Street and Ninth Avenue (below, in 1925), which had an influenza ward. We don’t know exactly what motivated Lynch to volunteer at the hospital, and many of the details of her experience are unknown as well. (Lynch died in 1989 after a long career as a teacher in Rye, New York.) But toward the end of her life, she began to jot down memories. One focused on what she saw at Roosevelt Hospital; it’s a small glimpse that reveals how dire conditions were. “There must have been at least 15 beds on each side of the ward and the same on the long porch (perhaps more),” wrote Lynch. “There was no room for the dead. Blanket rooms and all available spaces were used.” “There was such a shortage of blankets that patients were covered with paper instead, and that there was a horrifying rattling of the paper as they breathed,” Lynch reportedly told a cousin years later. Lynch’s story came to me through her great nephew, an Ephemeral reader who thought his aunt’s diary snippet echoed what hospital workers saw in ERs across the city last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. What hospital workers witnessed in chaotic ERs several months ago will probably haunt them forever. What will they recall and write down about the coronavirus epidemic in New York City decades later?

There has been some alarm after a number of deaths following flu shots in the country. At least 32 people have died after getting the vaccine.Health officials say there is no link to the state-run vaccinations programme, which will continue. So far, some 13m people have been vaccinated.They are hoping to prevent a mass flu outbreak as the country battles Covid.The 17-year old boy was among the first reported to have died after receiving the vaccine. Now, the country's forensic agency says it has found no evidence that the flu shot caused his death.Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun expressed condolences to the families of those who died, calling for a thorough investigation into the exact cause of deaths. But he reiterated that the vaccines were unlikely to be the reason."So far, experts said there was low possibility that the shots and deaths were related but many citizens remain anxious," he said. The Korean Vaccine Society has also advised that the flu shots should continue.Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winterYouTube bans misleading Covid-19 vaccine videosCan a vaccine from 1921 save lives from Covid-19?However, the Korean Medical Association, a health workers' union, said the government should consider postponing the nationwide program. "We agree that flu vaccinations should continue," KMA official Min Yang-ki said according to news agency Yonhap. "We are not calling the government to completely halt the vaccination, but to temporarily suspend it for about one week to find out the exact cause [of death]."South Korea wants its vulnerable population groups like senior citizens vaccinated against seasonal flu this year. The influenza season usually begins by the end of November and there are fears that if it runs parallel with the coronavirus pandemic, it would increase the risks for those vulnerable groups.

Video Ad Feedback How sleep protects us from Covid-19 03:05 - Source: CNN CNN — We all know how much better we feel after a good night’s sleep. It turns out that sleep may be vital to arm us in the fight against influenza and Covid-19. Medical professionals are recommending that people make sure to get their flu shots this year, in part because some Covid-19 and flu symptoms are similar. A flu shot reduces the likelihood that your symptoms (if you get sick) are from the flu. To make that flu shot effective, sleep specialist Matthew Walker, the bestselling author of “Why We Sleep,” told CNN’s Christiane Amanpourpracticing “good sleep hygiene” is important. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer received her flu vaccination on live television Tuesday, August 25, 2020. Julia Pickett/Michigan Executive Office of the Governor Related article This might be your most important flu shot ever Insufficient sleep in the week before getting a flu shot can lead to the production of less than 50% of the normal antibody response – a reaction that would render the flu shot largely ineffective, Walker told Amanpour. Walker specializes in the relationship between sleep and human health at the University of California, Berkeley. Walker cited a 2002 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, and a 2020 study in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine supports those findings, suggesting that sleep on nights prior to vaccination could be critical to vaccine efficacy. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research does have ongoing studies investigating the relationship between sleep and immunity and future planned studies to investigate sleep and vaccine efficacy. For Walker, examinations like this could represent a huge breakthrough for our resistance to the coronavirus. “We then need to study, is there that same relationship between sleep and your successful Covid immunization, because if there is, then that could also be a game changer,” he said. Sleep strengthens our immune systems Lack of sleep doesn’t just reduce the effectiveness of the flu shot. That’s because your body is actually repairing and restoring itself on a cellular level while you sleep. PBS host Stephanie Mansour of "Step It Up With Steph" shares a nighttime yoga routine for better sleep. Shown here is pigeon pose. Photo Courtesy of Stephanie Mansour Related article Try this 5-minute yoga routine before bedtime “Individuals who are sleeping less than seven hours are three times more likely to become infected by the rhinovirus, or the common cold,” Walker said. “We know that individuals who are sleeping five hours or less a night are 70% more likely to contract pneumonia.” We’re supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night, depending on age. A variety of health conditions – including mood swings, paranoia, depression, high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain and lower libido — have been linked to lack of sleep in studies. It’s also linked to a higher risk of some cancers, dementia, diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease. Sleeping less than the recommended amount on a regular basis could even double your risk of dying early, according to a longitudinal study of 10,308 British civil servants. People who reduced their sleep from seven to five hours or fewer a night were nearly twice as likely to die from all causes, researchers found, but especially from cardiovascular disease. Is it hard to sleep right now? It can be hard to get good sleep right now. There has been reported uptick in people sleeping badly during the pandemic. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 36% of Americans reported difficulty sleeping this summer due to stress about the pandemic. It’s clear, Walker said, that the economic instability and anxiety about catching the virus has significantly contributed to an increase in sleep disruption. But it’s not all bad news. Some people’s sleep has actually slightly increased, Walker said. A survey conducted by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, suggested why this may be the case. Initial results taken by around 1,600 people from 60 countries showed that 42% said they were getting better sleep, reporting a sleep-wake behavior more in line with their body clocks. These findings will publish later this year.

If you’re having trouble sleeping, here are some steps you can take. (It’s worth consulting your doctor if you’re worried about your sleep.) Need more sleep? Here’s how You can train your body to get more restful sleep with a few key steps: Make sure your bed and pillows are comfortable and the room is cool: Between 60 and 67 degrees is best. Don’t work or watch TV in your bedroom, so your brain knows that your bedroom is just for sleeping. Avoid coffea, tea and other stimulants after 3 p.m. and fatty foods before bedtime. Eliminate the blue light of cellphones or laptops and all other lights for bedtime (and dull sounds, too). Use earplugs or a white noise machine if you need to (but you can also get a white noise effect with a humidifier or fan). Get good exposure to natural light during the day, since that will help regulate your circadian rhythm. Establish a nightly bedtime routine. Taking a warm shower or bath, listening to calm music, reading a book, meditating or doing light stretches are all good options.

This flu had a high mortality rate for university-aged people, among other demographics.By late October 1918, the second wave of the flu was at its peak. Newspapers across Canada plastered headlines like The Toronto World’s “ ‘Flu’ Has Claimed Thousand Victims” on its pages. In another one of The Toronto World’s articles, a plea was printed for people to start wearing masks. “Why wait until all the Toronto citizens have influenza… or are dead, before starting the mask campaign?” Indeed, the Toronto local government took many measures: it closed theatres, cinemas, bowling alleys, and pool rooms, and Charles Hastings, then the medical officer of health for Toronto, made “Emergency Appeals” for additional aid for flu victims in the papers. The pandemic slowed the coal industry — a frightful prospect with winter looming and coal being one of the primary means of heating one’s home. In addition, hospitals were at full capacity. Nurses and doctors were overworked and also falling ill.In light of the pandemic, U of T closed its doors on October 18, 1918 and stayed closed until November 5. “The entire life of the University is naturally disrupted” On October 9, The Varsity reported that nearly one third of the men living at Burwash Hall had “contracted the disease with varying severity.” By October 18, St. Michael’s College reported more than 60 cases. The Varsity wrote that the Women’s Literary Society of Victoria College, despite a “long casualty list occasioned by the ‘flu,’ ” held its opening meeting on October 10.On October 16, The Varsity reported that a hazing ritual of sorts for first-years was held at University College, but “due to… the prevalence of the ‘flu’ they were let off without a ducking [into the pool].”Like elsewhere in society, the flu had muted usual campus activities. Some events were cancelled or rescheduled even before the school closed.Alongside the announcement in The Varsity that the university would close, there was a call for medical and nursing students to help combat the outbreak.There was also an article on the symptoms, prevention, treatments, and precautions: “The sick should be separated from the healthy… Wash the hands frequently… Those attacked should not, on any account, mingle with other people for a period of at least ten days.” This seems familiar. The dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the time would later report that “many of the students put themselves at the service of the communities sorely in need of them, and thus did humanitarian work, while acquiring useful clinical experience.” When the school reopened, perhaps ill-advisedly, The Varsity put out calls for staff because of further enlistment during World War I and because “a considerable proportion” of its current staff was “absent from College from causes of sickness.” The call did not specify which illness, but it is safe to assume that it was influenza.A Halloween party at Annesley Hall was held in spite of the pandemic. Only 15 women were left at the residence, including two who were still ill. Also in attendance at this party were little “flu bugs.” Except, these were cut from brown paper and had “fortunately lost their power for one night at least.”The war ended, but the flu continued Following the armistice on November 11, 1918, questions swirled about how former soldiers, who were students once more, would be integrated back into school at U of T. Residences and dining halls that had been occupied by the Royal Air Force were slowly given back for student use. Reports of casualties still trickled in. The “Varsity’s Roll of Honour” was a regular update of U of T alumni who were in military service. In November, The Varsity included an entry on Captain Charles Sparling, who succumbed to influenza. In December, it reported two more men as flu deaths.It seemed a rather macabre posting but was nonetheless informative on how the war and pandemic were intertwined. Wartime injuries were coupled with the disease. Even in postings that were primarily about the flu, articles noted when the afflicted were military personnel. Separating the two events was impossible in the public mind. Even today, when we think of the year 1918, these two events inevitably creep up. Making a vaccine The Connaught Antitoxin Laboratory at U of T was established in 1914 in order to create a diphtheria antitoxin. Through the war years, the lab worked to provide tetanus and smallpox antitoxins. The lab developed a vaccine for the flu during the pandemic. It was developed in “very large quantities” and was offered across the country for free. It was even sent to some US states and to the United Kingdom. It was, however, “emphasized that vaccination against influenza… was an experiment” but that participation was needed to “determine the possible value of such a vaccine.” To create the vaccine, the team at Connaught worked “day and night” for two months. The flu continued into 1920, so the vaccine was perhaps not as efficacious as hoped. But it represented a concerted effort to mitigate the flu not just in Canada, but also in other parts of the world.The silver lining? The 1918 influenza pandemic and the response to it have some characteristics in common with COVID-19: the precautions, health care personnel fatigue and illness, disruptions to ‘normal life,’ and urge to create a vaccine. The feeling that there was no end in sight was likely felt then as it is now. We can learn a lot from 1918. Most importantly, COVID-19 will eventually end.And you should wear a mask.

Picture used for representational purpose only BENGALURU: Even while several private hospitals are promoting the influenza vaccine, commonly called flu shot and have even made it mandatory for all employees, doctors warn that is not for everybody and have cautioned the general public to take it only on the advice of a family doctor â or one familiar with the health history of the family.The vaccination, administered once a year, is said to be effective in preventing influenza A (H1N1) infections.Besides their employees, many hospitals are urging people to take the shot. Fear of Covid-19 is also prompting many to opt for the vaccine, although it does not prevent SARS-CoV2 infections. The shots cost between Rs 1,100-1500 and experts say one should exercise caution before paying up.âSeveral advertisements put out by private hospitals propagating flu shots are only misleading,â said a leading public health expert and pulmonologist in Bengaluru. âThey are only trying to encash on pandemic fears. A flu shot is not a vaccine for Covid. It has nothing to do with Covid.âDr Shashidhar Buggi, former director, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, said he only prescribes shots for those who need it. âIt is advised only for senior citizens who may have fragile immunity and often get fever. Pregnant women, those on dialysis and those with compromised lung capacity need it,â Dr Buggi, a leading cardio-thoracic surgeon, said.Dr Sunil Kumar K, consultant, interventional pulmonology, Aster CMI Hospital, said people suffering from structural lung disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD, which affects a part of the lungs and leads to breathing difficulty), cardiac failure, bronchitis and diabetes should consider getting flu shots as it increases the capacity to fight influenza.âIt does not mean people who take the flu vaccine will never get the flu,â Dr Sunil said. âItâs just that the severity will be less. We also advise those above 65 years of age with respiratory infections, comorbidities or diabetes and those who have recovered from cardiac failure to take the shot.âHe said the flu shot is recommended for children between six months and four years of age. âThey are the ones who are most vulnerable to infections. For all others itâs only an option,â he said. However, Dr Satyanaraya Mysore, pulmonologist and member of the Covid-19 taskforce, said the flu vaccine reduces the burden of influenza and consequently the strain on the healthcare system. Resources, therefore, can be channelized to fight the pandemic.âHowever, flu shots must not be given to children younger than 6 months of age,â he said. âIt should also not be given to people with severe, life-threatening allergies to the flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. This might include egg allergy, gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.âHe went on to say, âThe influenza vaccine has its own benefits. It has shown that it can reduce the risk of contracting flu illness, hospitalization and even death. Getting a flu vaccine this fall is more important than ever, not only to reduce oneâs risk from flu, but also to help conserve potentially scarce health care resources.âEnd of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousHow to make easy dump & dine Tofu Salad for dinnerFoodHow to grow Blueberries in home garden or balconyLifestyle9 ways to magically improve your communication skills (without any books)Lifestyle10 most beautiful temples in India perfect for weddingstravel10 delicious dishes made with fresh coconutFoodEasy-to-make Bengali-style Macher Chop (Fish Chops)FoodHow to make one-pot dry-fruit Veg PulaoFood10 reasons to drink anjeer water every morningLifestyle10 baby girl names from Greek and Roman mythologiesLifestyle10 inspiring quotes by Swami Vivekananda that are excellent tips for successLifestyle Next123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveEY Employee DeathSri Lanka New PresidentPakistan Bomb BlastScandinavian Airlines Emergency LandingTirupati Laddu RowDelhi Waqf Board CaseTOP TRENDINGFilms to Inspire and Motivate StudentsAnne AllenPM Modi in New YorkUsherCEO Pat GelsingerLindsey GrahamRishabh PantChess OlympiadGarena Free Fire Max Redeem CodesTirupati LadduTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteWho is Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's new presidentEarly-century Lord Ganesha, Buddha statues: Images of stolen antiquities US handed over to India during PM Modi's visit'My daughter would have been dead by now': When a âmonkey attackâ in UP foiled manâs bid to rape 6-year old girl'Will kill them and ...': Israel, Hezbollah vow to intensify cross-border attacksEx-Google employee looking for job in Canada: âI've been reducing my India experience on my resume because â¦âHow India prices of iPhone 16 series compare with that in the US, Canada, Singapore and Dubai'Detonators' put on way of Army train set off alarmGarena Free Fire MAX redeem codes for September 21, 2024: Win free pets and vouchers todayIntel's biggest-ever restructuring: Read the complete memo sent by CEO Pat Gelsinger to employeesUS Space Force to help set up semiconductor plant in IndiaWatching, downloading child pornography are offences under POCSO Act: SCAtishi takes charge as Delhi CM, places empty chair for Arvind KejriwalWhy Project Cheetah's biggest successes are also its biggest worry'Laapataa Ladies' is India's official entry for Oscars 2025Virat Kohli's 'bat chahiye?' moment: Akash Deep shares storyCongress, other casteist parties only remember Dalits during their bad days: MayawatiWhy HC stopped govt's attempt to muzzle independent mediaiPhone 16 series record sales on Day 1 in India, could help Apple to set milestoneSri Lanka gets Leftist prez, India a challenge in a man itâs not acquainted withShots fired outside Gardens Galleria Mall in Noida, 3 arrestedAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorMX PlayerHindi PodcastPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosTechnology NewsHot on the WebTest EyesightTirupati Laddoo ControversyAishwarya RaiDaily HabitsAditya PancholiTrishaRiya SenKaun Banega Crorepati 16Raj KapoorPreity ZintaTop TrendsRadhika GuptaYahya SinwarRishabh PantIsrael Hezbollah WarPakistan Bomb BlastAnura Kumara DissanayakeJetblue Flight Emergency LandingPM Modi with Tech CEOAwadhesh PrasadUGC NET Result LiveBengaluru Mahalakshmi MurderRohit SharmaStolen Antiquities USShoaib AkhtarTirupati LadduPM Modi US VisitLive Cricket ScoreTrending TopicsAishwarya RaiZodiac SignsBigg Boss 18 PromoThe Great Indian Kapil ShowChia SeedS ShankarOptical IllusionSharp Eye TestChiranjeevis FarmhouseSana KhanDevaraStree 2 CollectionAnupam MittalHealthy RaitasUrvashi RautelaColdplay India tour 2025Best Laptops For CodingPM Narendra ModiAnupam MittalWordle AnswerLiving and entertainmentETimesTravel DestinationsCricbuzz.comTVLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsCareersColombiaLatest NewsEC team in Jharkhand to review poll preparednessElon Musk's SpaceX to send uncrewed Starships to Mars by 2026: âOne of my biggest concerns right now..âCommonwealth Master's Scholarship application open for Sept 2025: Check benefits, eligibility and how to applyGhosts Season 4: Premiere date, plot, and cast revealedWhat is the 30-30-30 weight loss method?

Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19.Earlier this year, Medical News Today released two articles designed to bust some common myths associated with COVID-19: one was initially published in February and the other in June.As the impact of COVID-19 progresses, and our understanding of the disease and its causes improves, the shape of online discussion has shifted.So, almost 11 months into 2020, we asked our medical experts, once again, to revisit the gap between truth and fiction. We asked them to address new myths that have only recently surfaced and persistent misunderstandings that are still circulating.Coronavirus resourcesFor more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.The answers below comprise a combined effort from the following Healthline experts: Dr. E Hanh Le, Chief Medical OfficerDr. Lindsay Slowiczek, Drug Content Integrity ManagerDr. Jenny Yu, Senior Manager of Medical Integrity1. In the United States, COVID-19 cases are rising, but the death rate is relatively low — this means the virus is less deadly, and we shouldn’t worryInfection case rates, hospitalization rates, and death rates often track each other. For example, as one goes up, the others go up, too. However, that is not always the case.A lot depends on the overall health of the people in the community, how quickly and broadly they were able to access testing and treatment for the disease, and how prepared the communities are to handle the most severe cases.In many areas, we’ve seen a high case number but low death rate. The likely explanation is related to the fact that people in the community have better access to testing, which increases case numbers, and treatments, which decreases death rates. Back when the COVID-19 pandemic first arrived in the U.S., very few communities had testing available. Now, testing is more accessible, plus we know a lot more about the virus, so we are able to treat it better, preventing severe cases that would lead to death.That said, we are seeing that younger people are developing COVID-19 (even in their 20s) and passing the virus on to others in the community. However, the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 increases with a person’s age and is more common in people with underlying medical conditions.In fact, we are still seeing that people are dying and experiencing complications from the COVID-19 infection. We still do not have a cure or definitive treatment that works for everyone. We still do not have a clear recipe for successful treatment, especially in vulnerable populations, such as older adults who have chronic conditions, including asthma, diabetes, and cancer.Unfortunately, because we are still learning more about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we do not know what the long-term complications are for people who have had the infection and recovered.Yes, we’re so grateful that these individuals have survived the infection, and we’re hopeful that they won’t have any long-term negative effects from the infection. However, we have seen that some people are still experiencing difficulties with breathing and other symptoms several months after the infection and hospitalization.We are also seeing cases where people who have had COVID-19 before are getting the infection a second time.So our best strategy is still to avoid getting the infection and prevent the transmission to others. Infections, such as the one that the new coronavirus causes, are opportunistic. They often explode and spread easily the moment we become relaxed and lower our guard. 2. The virus’s deadliness was overstated in the first placeWith any rapidly developing event, particularly one that has such global impact, it can be difficult to determine how deadly the disease really is. When it comes down to it, it is hard to wrap our heads around the statistics, such as case rates, hospitalization numbers, and death rates, when they are in the millions. Instead, I think of it like this:What other condition did I know of in clinical medicine where spending time in a small room with a person with an infection for just a few minutes could lead to an infection that could cause you to be hospitalized and put on a ventilator?Before COVID-19, I would have said meningitis, pneumonia, influenza, etc. And as such, most doctors would never discount how deadly meningitis, pneumonia, or influenza can be.What other infectious disease do we know of that has led to more than 38 million cases worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths over the course of 8 months? In our modern age, with the medications and technology that we have, even Ebola, swine flu, or avian flu could not bring the world to a standstill in the way that COVID-19 has. In fact, COVID-19 has killed more people (more than 218,000) in the first 8 months of 2020 in the U.S. than influenza has in the last several flu seasons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there have been 12,000–61,000 influenza-related deaths annually since 2010.What other infectious disease do we know of in modern medical history that has left the U.S. scrambling for ventilators because we were about to run out and would not have enough for people who needed them? Though COVID-19 has struck certain communities more disproportionately than others, it has also reminded us that we are all vulnerable. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have affected many in our communities: young and old, and rich and poor.We are very lucky that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not kill everyone who has had the infection, but by most data measures, doctors like myself do not underestimate how deadly it has already been or how deadly it can continue to be if we are not diligent and conscientious about protecting ourselves, our loved ones, and others in our community.3. It’s just a bad fluSome people who have developed COVID-19 were fortunate because they either did not notice any symptoms or only experienced mild symptoms. However, to say, as a blanket statement, that COVID-19 is just like a bad flu is dangerously inaccurate because it discounts the hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. alone who have died from COVID-19.It also does not take into account that we have seen reports of people who have experienced residual symptoms from their bouts of COVID-19, including ongoing respiratory problems, which we typically do not see in seasonal flu cases. Additionally, while influenza itself can be deadly, the seasonal flu does not typically have such high rates of hospitalization as COVID-19. Part of the reason for this is that we have vaccines and treatments for the flu. These help prevent people catching the flu or, if they do catch it, help reduce the severity of symptoms. We have neither vaccines nor consistent, dependable treatments for COVID-19.We are also concerned that, as winter approaches, people might get both influenza and COVID-19 — either at the same time or one after the other. There are particular concerns that having one of the conditions may put someone at a higher risk for the other, and having both at the same time could be particularly dangerous, if not deadly.4. We are getting close to herd immunityHerd immunity is when the majority of people are immune to a disease so that it makes the spread unlikely. Herd immunity can be achieved through either vaccination or natural infection. In total, 70% of the general population (about 200 million people) will need to recover from COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity. However, this is conditional on whether the COVID-19 immunity is long lasting. Unfortunately, we have not seen clear evidence as to whether contracting and recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 infection will lead to long-term immunity that is protective. We are currently at 7.8 million cases in the U.S. and more than 38 million cases worldwide. We are not near the rates needed for herd immunity.Also, it is too early in this disease to know whether immunity is long lasting. Therefore, it is not recommended to create mass infections to achieve herd immunity.Last but not least, herd immunity only happens when the community is diligent about employing infection control strategies. When many people stopped taking the measles vaccine, the herd immunity and the control that we had over the disease disappeared, leading to outbreaks of measles in the states of Washington and New York in 2019. We cannot assume that herd immunity, even if we did achieve it, would be everlasting. We must always remain vigilant and conscientious about how we protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities.5. Physical distancing is making our immune systems weakerPhysical distancing is necessary to decrease the risk of transmitting a disease. In fact, we’ve been employing physical distancing for generations (if not for thousands of years as a human race) to prevent the spread of diseases. It’s the basic logic behind why we instinctively avoid people when they are sick and why we ask people to stay home when they are not feeling well. All the while, our immune systems (the natural defense that protects our bodies from infections) have been continually developing and adjusting to our environment. Research has also demonstrated that we can help our immune systems better fight off infection via controlled techniques, such as vaccination, which is more successful than allowing our immune systems to encounter illnesses in an uncontrolled way through random personal exposure.Even with vaccination, however, transmittable diseases, such as colds, flu, and pneumonia, are caused by viruses and bacteria that are highly contagious, so we work tirelessly to limit the exposure of healthy people to people who are ill. This approach to infection control helps protect everyone in the community, including the people who are ill, because it preserves medical care and services for those who are sick. If we did not contain infections and everyone in our community were sick at the same time, our medical systems would be overburdened, and there would be a danger that people would not be able to get the medical care that they need.6. COVID-19 is caused or exacerbated by 5G5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks. It is a type of radio wave that is digitized, so it improves the transmission and capacity of data.There is no evidence to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between radio waves, their frequencies, and viral transmission.7. Masks do more harm than goodMasks are a protective barrier that decreases the transmission of airborne diseases for both the person wearing the mask and the people around them. It prevents the transmission of infection through droplets from the mouth and nose.Notably, doctors and nurses wear masks in surgeries to protect all of us from infection during our operations and have done so for several decades. A prolonged use of masks does not decrease oxygenation or increase carbon dioxide levels for medical professionals, and it does not cause either of those concerns in the general population today. Beyond healthcare, for decades, industrial and construction workers have also used masks to protect themselves from dangerous microorganisms and chemicals. Research has not shown prolonged mask usage to have negative effects on a person’s overall health.8. Doctors can already cure COVID-19There is still no cure for COVID-19. However, healthcare workers and researchers are learning more about this illness every day, and there is accumulating evidence regarding which supportive treatments can help reduce the length and severity of illness. For example, doctors often give steroids to critically ill people, and many are also receiving remdesivir, a medication that treats viruses. Conversely, evidence has now conclusively shown that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. Clinical trials are still underway to determine the effectiveness and safety of other treatments, such as convalescent plasma. There has been exciting progress in COVID-19 treatment research, but we still have much to learn.The good news is that, as we know more about the virus that causes COVID-19, we are better able to treat people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection so that fewer people die from it.However, without a cure, it is still very important to do what we can to prevent the transmission of the virus, including practicing proper hand washing, wearing masks, and being diligent about physical distancing when in public. There is still no cure, so we can help protect ourselves, our loved ones, and everyone in the community with our preventive measures.9. “Big Pharma” is withholding the vaccineNo. The clinical trial process required to identify safe and effective vaccines takes years in most cases. The development of a COVID-19 vaccine is no different. This timeline is necessary to determine how well a vaccine will work on a large-scale population basis. It is also necessary to identify side effects that may occur weeks or months after a person receives a vaccine. Additionally, once a suitable vaccine candidate is identified, the companies will require time to scale up their manufacturing processes so that the vaccine is available for as many people as possible.It is also important to remember that, even once the vaccine becomes available, it should first be given to those who most need it, including healthcare workers who provide medical services to patients who might have COVID-19. In addition, priority should be given to those in the community who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications, including the elderly and those with chronic conditions, such as cancer, lung diseases (asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or other conditions that weaken the immune system. As successful COVID-19 vaccines become available, it is important to keep an eye on when it would be appropriate for you to receive it based on your risk factors. This means that if you are among the populations that are at risk, you should be ready to get it when it is available for you, but if you have a lower risk, keep an eye out for when the vaccine is made available to the broader population.10. Antivirals and steroids can cure COVID-19 and cytokine stormAntivirals fight the virus causing COVID-19, and steroids will help decrease the chances of an overzealous immune response, which contributes to some COVID-19 deaths.Scientists have shown that steroids reduce the severity and impact of a hyperinflammatory state, which is also called a cytokine storm. However, evidence supporting these treatments is not conclusive, and more research is needed to determine who would most benefit from them.How well any treatment option works also depends on a person’s underlying medical status and conditions. An individual with serious preexisting comorbid conditions and a severely weakened health status will still have a difficult time fighting the infection, no matter how strong the treatment options are and how effective they have been in clinical trials in the general population.TakeawayThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world. As a result, the mental and physical health of the global population has taken a hit. Our understanding of and approach toward the condition slowly morph as the months roll on, and we must maintain our focus on science.Beyond politicians and “influencers,” it is medical research that will shepherd us away from this challenging time. Listening to those who know the deep science and have hands-on medical experience is our best bet to navigate our way through these rough seas.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesCOVID-19Share this articleWritten by MNT News Team on October 21, 2020Latest newsClassic and green Mediterranean diets may help slow brain agingRheumatoid arthritis linked to changes in the gut microbiome in new studyDaytime sleepiness may be a sign of higher dementia riskCould taking fish oil supplements help lower cancer risk?Can a combo of “active” therapies help lower dementia risk?Related CoverageAsthma and COVID-19: What to knowMedically reviewed by Marc Meth, MD, FACAAI, FAAAIAs COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, people with moderate to severe asthma who develop COVI-19 may experience more severe symptoms…READ MOREComparing COVID-19 with previous pandemicsThis article looks back on previous pandemics, discussing similarities with COVID-19 and potential insights they can offer on how to handle this…READ MORE'Unifying' definition of long COVID is set to aid diagnosis, but will it?The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have recently announced a new 'consensus definition' of long COVID, which aims to…READ MOREAbout UsContact UsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyPrivacy SettingsAdvertising PolicyHealth TopicsHealth HubsMedical AffairsContent IntegrityNewsletters© 2024 Healthline Media UK Ltd, Brighton, UK.

It will be used as part of the UK’s 2020/21 seasonal flu programme from December. Flublok is made by Sanofi and is licensed for use in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has been used there since 2016 and has been distributed to over 9 million people. The FDA considers the vaccine safe and acceptable for use. Flublok has been given authorisation for temporary supply by the UK Department of Health and Social Care and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for immunisation against flu in this year’s seasonal flu programme to meet public health need. Scientific assessment The MHRA assessed the available scientific evidence for Flublok relating to its safety, quality and effectiveness. Their assessment was based in part on evidence from another closely related Sanofi flu vaccine, Supemtek. This was recommended for approval by the European Medicines Agency in September 2020. The MHRA assessment showed the two products are fundamentally similar on the basis of a review of the manufacture, control, quality, non-clinical and clinical evaluation. The regulator also sought advice from the government’s independent expert scientific advisory body – the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM). The CHM agreed with the MHRA’s assessment and concluded that Flublok protects against flu and meets high standards of safety and quality. Advice for the general public Flu can spread very fast and can have serious consequences. Having a flu vaccine can protect you and helps reduce transmission to others. Your doctor can recommend the best time to be vaccinated. Please read the patient information leaflet (PIL) carefully before you get a flu vaccine. Like all medicines and vaccines, Flublok can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. If you get any side effects, even if suspected, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the PIL. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system run by the MHRA known as the Yellow Card Scheme. Or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of medicines.

GambardelloPosted on October 21, 2020 Quick Take A video posted by a European-based group called World Doctors Alliance falsely claims the novel coronavirus is “a normal flu virus” and there is no COVID-19 pandemic. Actually, COVID-19 is deadlier than the seasonal flu, and some European nations are combatting a second wave of cases. Full Story According to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we remain in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, with an uptick in case numbers and hospitalizations straining the ability of medical centers in some areas to cope. Some European governments have imposed more restrictions to fight another wave of cases. Yet on Oct. 10, Heiko Schöning, a German physician and head of a group known by the German acronym ACU2020, announced formation of an organization called World Doctors Alliance to challenge the veracity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alliance website claims it is “abundantly clear that the ‘pandemic’ is basically over and has been since June 2020.” An 18-minute video announcing the group’s formation was posted on the ACU2020 website but has since been taken down by YouTube for violating its terms of service. Still, portions of the video featuring two doctors challenging the science behind the pandemic are circulating on Facebook with false assertions and statistics. Staking out the group’s position, Elke De Klerk, a Dutch general practitioner, says on the video, “We do not have a pandemic” and calls COVID-19 a “normal flu virus” – claims flatly rejected by the WHO, CDC, and other experts. De Klerk claims the pandemic designation was based on poor testing, with the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, molecular test returning false positive results in “89 to 94%” of the cases. That’s not true. While the false positive rate remains an area of continued examination, preliminary studies show the test’s false positive rate is far less than De Klerk claims. A recent article in the British medical publication The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, said estimates in the U.K. place the false positive rate in the 0.8 to 4% range, while false negatives could run as high as 33%. As for the virus that causes COVID-19, scientists universally agree it is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, not a strain of influenza. While the death rate for COVID-19 remains uncertain, as we have reported, evidence suggests it is higher than for seasonal influenza. In De Klerk’s own country, the Netherlands, there have been more than 6,800 deaths attributed to COVID-19 so far this year, compared to 2,900 due to flu and pneumonia in 2018-19. In the U.S., where COVID-19 has caused more than 220,000 deaths, the worst flu season in the past decade killed an estimated 61,000 people in 2017-18, as we’ve reported. In fact, COVID-19 so far has killed more people in the U.S. than the past five flu seasons combined, and hundreds more die each day. In addition, a CDC study released Oct. 20 found hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration had a five times higher risk of death than patients with the flu. The other speaker in the video circulating on Facebook is Dolores Cahill, a professor at the medical school at the University College Dublin in Ireland. Cahill, who has become something of a lightning rod as a COVID-19 denier, claims on the video that there have only been 98 deaths in Ireland due to the coronavirus since April. But according to Ireland’s Central Statistics Office, more than 1,800 people have died of COVID-19 in the country, all but 200 since April. And with cases on an upswing, the Irish government announced Oct. 19 that it was imposing tough new restrictions to slow the spread of the disease. The measures, which will last until at least Dec. 1, require all non-essential retail businesses, barbers, hairdressers, and salons to close and ban gatherings in homes. Restaurants and pubs will be limited to takeout and delivery service. Cahill has found herself under fire from both her university, which issued a statement disassociating itself from her views, and the European Union, which asked her to resign from an EU medical panel.

Here’s How the Symptoms Differ, According to DoctorsIs It COVID-19 or the Stomach Flu? Here’s How the Symptoms Differ, According to DoctorsCOVID-19 is a respiratory illness, but it can spur all sorts of digestive troubles.By Korin MillerPublished: Oct 22, 2020 12:49 PM EDTSave ArticleIn pre-pandemic times, suddenly running to the bathroom due to diarrhea or vomiting would be a tip-off that you might have food poisoning or the stomach flu. But given that COVID-19 can present with various stomach-related symptoms, it might be trickier to understand what you’re dealing with—and what you’re supposed to do next.It’s important to remember that a stomach flu isn’t the same as influenza, which is responsible for the typical “flu” as you know it—fever, achy muscles, sore throat, and generally feeling crummy. Instead, it’s a term usually used for gastroenteritis, a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the stomach or intestines, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Related StoriesDo You Have Food Poisoning or the Stomach Flu?This Symptom Is Now “Very Common” With COVID-19There are various causes behind a stomach flu, but one of the most common is norovirus, which can make a person incredibly ill between 12 and 48 hours after being exposed, the CDC says. In the U.S., norovirus causes up to 21 million cases of viral gastroenteritis every year. While they can cause similar symptoms, norovirus and the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 often spread differently. For example, you can develop norovirus after coming into contact with particles from an infected person’s poop or vomit, breathing in vomit aerosols, or eating contaminated food or water. Most people develop COVID-19 by inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected person they had close contact with.So how can you differentiate a case of the coronavirus from the stomach flu? The symptoms can overlap, but they also have some differences. Here’s what doctors want you to know.What are the symptoms of the stomach flu?The symptoms can vary slightly, depending on what causes your stomach flu. In general, the CDC says you may experience the following symptoms, and start to feeling better within one to three days:DiarrheaVomitingNauseaStomach painFeverHeadacheBody achesWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?The following are the major symptoms of COVID-19, according to the CDC, which “does not include all possible symptoms.” Many people who contract the novel coronavirus tend to feel ill for about two weeks.Fever or chillsCoughShortness of breath or difficulty breathingFatigueMuscle or body achesHeadacheNew loss of taste or smellSore throatCongestion or runny noseNausea or vomitingDiarrheaHow to tell the difference between stomach flu and COVID-19Unfortunately, this isn’t an easy thing to figure out—even for doctors, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “I don’t think it is possible to differentiate COVID-19 from other viral illnesses in the midst of the pandemic on clinical symptoms alone,” adds Richard Watkins, M.D., an infectious disease physician and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University. The problem is, some people with COVID-19 just have gastrointestinal symptoms, Dr. Watkins adds. “Diarrhea is one of the most common symptoms we see,” he says. “Sometimes people have no respiratory symptoms.” One study found that, of 117 people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 experiencing GI symptoms, about 20% experienced diarrhea as their first symptom, and it lasted anywhere between one and 14 days. “Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom,” the authors wrote.But there is one major sign that you may be dealing with coronavirus instead of the stomach flu: developing a sudden loss of taste or smell. This symptom can occur with any viral illness, but seems to be much more common with COVID-19, says Lewis Nelson, M.D., chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. That, paired with other symptoms that don’t typically present with the stomach flu—such as a dry cough, sore throat, or runny nose—could mean that you’re dealing with coronavirus. A typical case of the stomach flu also tends to be short-lived—most people feel better in three days or less, per the CDC. What should you do if you have stomach flu or COVID-19 symptoms?Given how widespread and highly contagious COVID-19 is, Dr. Adalja says it’s a good idea to assume you may have a case of coronavirus and act accordingly. Isolate at home, call your doctor to ask about getting tested, and wear a face mask if you need to come into contact with others (which you should already be doing anyway). Like COVID-19, there is no specific treatment for norovirus. Since both the stomach flu and gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 can lead to dehydration due to diarrhea, it’s important to drink plenty of liquids until you start to feel better. Get plenty of rest, use fever-reducing medication like Tylenol if needed, and call your doctor ASAP if your symptoms start to get worse.When you start to feel better, Dr. Adalja says it’s a good idea to continue with bland foods (think: soup, toast, oatmeal) and ease back into your normal diet slowly—otherwise you could risk upsetting your stomach again.Support from readers like you helps us do our best work.

Our verdict This is a flawed comparison, as the number of deaths from Covid-19 far exceeds the number of deaths from flu in a given season, despite the much stricter controls in place. “The politicians and the media have a very, very poor understanding of science and mathematics and they’ve pursued and pushed a narrative that the coronavirus—Covid-19—is far, far worse and more dangerous than it actually is. The reality is that it’s no worse than a bad flu season.” David Kurten, video posted to Facebook, 13 October 2020. “The truth is that the science and the maths and the statistics show that this whole made up coronavirus pandemic is no worse than in a normal flu season.” David Kurten, video posted to Facebook, 20 September 2020. London mayoral candidate David Kurten has variously claimed that Covid-19 is “no worse” than a “bad” or a “normal” flu season. Mr Kurten, who founded the Heritage Party and is standing for mayor as an independent candidate, made the claims in two videos shared on his Facebook page, one addressing an anti-lockdown rally in Trafalgar Square in September and one at the World Doctors Alliance launch in Berlin in October. We have been asked to check this claim by users on WhatsApp. Mr Kurten is incorrect to make these claims. The number of deaths caused by Covid-19 so far is much greater than the number of deaths caused by flu in a given flu season. If we were to include the increased number of deaths that occur during winter (when flu season happens) then the number is more comparable with the number of deaths due to Covid-19. But this is only comparing years with a higher number of excess deaths and not all these deaths will be down to flu. Covid-19 has killed far more people than flu alone would in a bad season. It’s also important to note that the Covid-19 death rate has been kept lower than it might otherwise be due to the various restrictions on public movement which aren’t in place during the flu season. If these restrictions had not been put in place, it is very likely that the Covid-19 death toll would be considerably higher. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email Sign up How many people have died of flu and Covid-19? The most recent figures from Public Health England, published in June, show that the average number of deaths associated with influenza in the past four flu seasons for which complete figures are available (2015/16 to 2018/19) was 12,117. This varies from a low of 3,966 deaths to a high of 22,087 deaths. The latest Covid-19 government figures (as of 19 October) show there have been 38,783 deaths of people in England who tested positive with Covid-19 in the 28 days before their death. This figure doesn’t include people who may have died of Covid-19 without a positive test, especially during the early part of the pandemic when testing was not widely available. In England, between January and August, 45,797 people died and had Covid-19 listed as the underlying cause of death on their death certificate. This means twice as many people have died from Covid-19 in England than died of flu during the worst season in recent years. Excess deaths It is possible that Mr Kurten was referring to any increase in deaths during a flu season, rather than those specifically caused by flu. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that there were 46,030 excess winter deaths in England in 2017/18 (the year with the most excess deaths since at least the early 1990s). Excess winter deaths are the number of deaths in any given winter above the average. These deaths can be from any cause though, so they are not just deaths related to flu. Excess deaths have also been reported during the Covid-19 pandemic. ONS figures show that, between 7 March and 1 May 2020, non-Covid-19 deaths were 15.3% above the five-year average for this period. However, from this point until 10 July (the most recent date we have data for), non-Covid-19 deaths were 6% below the average. The ONS has suggested this may be because the deaths of some people were “brought forward” by the pandemic, meaning they died a few months earlier than they may have otherwise.

They have other states and territories they ship to as well, but we’re hoping to receive more shipments from them."Carrera said Public Health has been getting a lot of questions about the flu vaccine as well as the non-existent COVID-19 vaccine.Carrera said the combination of the COVID pandemic and the threat of the better known "traditional" influenza, which kills many thousands of people every year is unique. “We’re facing a COVID-19 pandemic which in itself is a dangerous and life threatening condition. Couple that with another potentially life threatening virus such as the (traditional) flu, that’s like double jeopardy.”Carrera said the odds can be improved by using what’s available and getting a flu shot.“Without a vaccine available for COVID-19, if we can protect ourselves from one virus with the flu vaccine and then protect ourselves through other measures such as wearing your mask, social distancing, hand washing and other hygiene measures, we would have a better chance of surviving any viruses that may be lingering out there.”Carrera said Public Health is particularly concerned that those with underlying conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity among them— need to get their flu shots. These are the conditions called “co-morbidities” that show up on COVID-19 death reports.“If you want to avail yourself of a flu shot through Public Health, there is no cost associated with it,” Carrera said.This article originally appeared on Pacific Daily News: Public Health has the 2020 flu vaccine and it's free for the asking Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Guam Dphss Influenza (flu) Vaccine Covid-19 Testing Guam × Post a comment as anonymous Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Chief vets from the four nations warned that the cases of avian influenza, known colloquially as bird flu, were detected on Thursday but said the risk of transmission to people remains low. Wild birds migrating westward from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. A statement from the four chief veterinary officers said: “Following two confirmed cases of H5N8 avian influenza in the Netherlands we have raised the risk level for incursion to the UK from migratory birds to medium ahead of the winter migration season. “The risk of the disease being introduced to poultry farms in the UK remains low. “We are monitoring the situation carefully and bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.” A farm in 2016, when a suspected case of bird flu was identified in chickens (Danny Lawson/PA) The vets also advised avoiding mixing ducks and geese with other poultry species. This strain of the virus can be very virulent in birds, but there are no recorded cases of it causing disease in humans. The UK was previously declared free of avian flu in September 2017 and has remained free of highly pathogenic avian influenza since then.

More infoJoin us on WhatsApp A Welsh Ambulance Service manager who thought he had a bout of "man flu" would later be told he had hours to live after it turned out to be the flu virus. Pete Brown was 27 when he developed flu-like symptoms but his rapid deterioration saw him admitted to intensive care and put in an induced coma. His condition was so critical that his family held a bedside vigil after doctors warned he may not survive the night. Pete, from Abergavenny, said: "The flu had a massive impact on my life in a way I can't begin to explain both in terms of my physical health and my mental health. "I was actually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) afterwards because of the flashbacks to the intensive care ward and the awful dreams. "I'll always remember being told by the consultant to get my family to come to the hospital really quickly because her confidence in me surviving that night wasn't great." Pete, a business manager based in Cwmbran, was working as a head of operations for NHS England when he first became ill in 2014. He said: "I was a fit and healthy 27-year-old in my 12th year in the ambulance service and thought I didn't need to have the flu jab. "That autumn I developed what I thought was 'man flu' and it got progressively worse over the course of a week. "I remember being sat in a café in Sainsbury's just feeling awful. I had a high temperature yet I felt freezing. I also had a cough and a runny nose. I just wanted to sleep. "That evening I felt so unwell that we called 999 and I ended up in the emergency department at Nevill Hall Hospital where they discovered that my oxygen saturation levels were at 9%, which is actually considered unsurvivable. "I was admitted onto the intensive care at the Royal Gwent Hospital where I spent four days in total, two of which were in an induced coma."

The most common symptoms include high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. For most people it is mainly unpleasant but for some it can be very serious and even fatal. In an unfortunate twist Pete also passed the virus to his partner and she spent two weeks unwell. He said: "The worst thing about it all was knowing I gave it to my partner. The impact I saw that have on her and others was huge and can’t ever be underestimated." Pete said it took two years for him to get his confidence back (Image: Welsh Ambulance Service) Pete, who is originally from Berkshire, was eventually discharged from hospital to begin his recovery, which would include physiotherapy and counselling. He said: "I had many months off work in order to recover, which was painful and slow. Even walking up a flight of stairs was really difficult for me. More than anything it was the fatigue and exhaustion. "I couldn't sleep at all and I’d have the most horrific nightmares about the intensive care ward, which I’d later get some professional help for following my PTSD diagnosis. It actually took around two years in total for me to get my confidence back."

He said: "Whilst the decision of mine to not have the jab really cost me it also cost others around me. "Even if you think you’re indestructible watching that kind of illness falling on someone that you love and are really close to is heartbreaking and not something you’d ever wish to put our family and loved ones in that position of. "It takes only a couple of minutes to be vaccinated. By getting the flu jab we can all work together to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our community."
