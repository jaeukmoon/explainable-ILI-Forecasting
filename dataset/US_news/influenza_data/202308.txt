Effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies by season, influenza virus subtype, and antigenic match with circulating viruses. What is added by this report? Data from two concurrent studies in Wisconsin found that effectiveness of the 2022–23 influenza vaccine was 54% for preventing medically attended influenza A infection among persons aged <65 years and 71% for preventing symptomatic influenza A illness among children and adolescents aged <18 years. What are the implications for public health practice? The 2022–23 influenza vaccine provides substantial protection against circulating influenza A viruses and remains the best way to protect against influenza. Influenza vaccination is recommended as long as influenza viruses are circulating.

Influenza A(H3N2) represented most influenza viruses detected and subtyped during this period, but A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses cocirculated as well. Most viruses characterized were in the same genetic subclade as and antigenically similar to the viruses included in the 2022–23 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (1,2). Effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies by season, influenza virus subtype, and antigenic match with circulating viruses. This interim report used data from two concurrent studies conducted at Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS) in Wisconsin during October 23, 2022–February 10, 2023, to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Overall, VE was 54% against medically attended outpatient acute respiratory illness (ARI) associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A among patients aged 6 months–64 years. In a community cohort of children and adolescents aged <18 years, VE was 71% against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection. These interim analyses indicate that influenza vaccination substantially reduced the risk for medically attended influenza among persons aged <65 years and for symptomatic influenza in children and adolescents. Annual influenza vaccination is the best strategy for preventing influenza and its complications. CDC recommends that health care providers continue to administer annual influenza vaccine to persons aged ≥6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating (2). VE against medically attended influenza was estimated using a test-negative case-control design. Patients aged 6 months–64 years were actively recruited during or after outpatient medical care for ARI (i.e., telehealth, primary care, urgent care, or emergency department), and before or during appointments for clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 at selected MCHS facilities. Patients were eligible if they had a cough of ≤7 days’ duration and had not taken an influenza antiviral medication. Participants completed a brief survey and provided a respiratory specimen for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Participants who received a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from VE estimation. Participants were considered vaccinated if MCHS health records indicated receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations ≥14 days before illness onset† (2). VE against influenza A viruses and against influenza A(H3N2) viruses was estimated as 100% x (1 − adjusted odds ratio [aOR]). The aOR is the ratio of the odds of vaccination among those who received a positive influenza test result (case-patients) to the odds of vaccination among those who received negative test results for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (control-patients). Estimates were adjusted for age, month of illness onset, and self-reported presence of one or more higher-risk condition§ using logistic regression. VE against symptomatic influenza in children and adolescents was estimated from an ongoing, prospective, community-cohort study in central Wisconsin (3). Each week, participants (or their guardians) reported the absence or presence of specific symptoms during the previous 7 days. An anterior nasal swab was self- or guardian-collected for research testing when participants reported one or more of the following: fever, cough, loss of smell or taste, sore throat, muscle or body aches, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nasal congestion or runny nose, or nausea or vomiting. Influenza infection was defined as a positive result from research testing or a positive result from clinical testing (results extracted from MCHS health records). Unvaccinated person-time was defined as the time from October 23, 2022 (7 days before occurrence of the first influenza case), until receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccinated person-time began ≥14 days after receipt of influenza vaccine (based on health records) according to ACIP recommendations. Person-time for the 13 days after receipt of vaccine was excluded from the analysis. Hazard ratios comparing the rate of influenza A virus infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying influenza vaccination status, age, the presence of one or more higher-risk condition, and COVID-19 vaccination status. VE was estimated as 100% x (1 − adjusted hazard ratio). Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing and genetic characterization of influenza-positive specimens for both studies were performed at MCHS research laboratory. Protocols for both studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at MCHS and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ During December 2, 2022–February 10, 2023, a total of 545 children, adolescents, and adults with medically attended ARI were included in the test-negative design case-control study; 116 (21%) received a positive test result for influenza A virus, and none received a positive test result for influenza B virus. Among 115 (99%) influenza A virus subtypes determined, 29 (25%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 86 (75%) were A(H3N2) viruses (Table 1). All of the 43 characterized viruses were genetically similar to vaccine components; 34 A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclade 2a.2 and nine A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to subclade 5a.2. The proportion of patients with influenza differed by month of illness onset. Among ARI patients, 186 (34%) had documentation of receipt of 2022–23 influenza vaccine; the percentage vaccinated differed by sex, higher-risk condition, and COVID-19 vaccination status. A large majority of vaccinated participants (84%) received cell culture–based vaccine (ccIIV4). Among the 116 participants who received a positive influenza test result, 26 (22%) received the 2022–23 seasonal influenza vaccine, compared with 160 (37%) of 429 participants who received negative test results for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). The overall adjusted VE against outpatient medically attended ARI associated with influenza A was 54% and 60% against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Among 241 community cohort participants aged 1–17 years, 94 (39%) had documented receipt of the 2022–23 influenza vaccine (Table 1); 84% received ccIIV4. Among community cohort participants who received the 2022–23 influenza vaccine, 65% had documentation of receipt of ≥2 COVID-19 vaccine doses. During October 23, 2022–February 10, 2023, 37 (15%) participants received a positive test result for influenza A virus infection; however, three of these occurred ≤14 days after influenza vaccination and were excluded from the study at the time of vaccination. Among the remaining 34 influenza virus infections included in the analysis, 29 were caused by A(H3N2),** one by A(H1N1)pdm09, and four by influenza A viruses with unknown subtype. Six children (18%) with influenza A had received the 2022–23 seasonal influenza vaccine. Among 15,678 unvaccinated person-days, 28 influenza A virus infections occurred (incidence = 1.79 per 1,000 person-days), and among 7,292 vaccinated person-days, six influenza A virus infections occurred (incidence = 0.82 per 1,000 person-days) (Table 2). VE against symptomatic influenza A virus infection was 71%. Top Discussion Influenza activity for the 2022–23 winter season increased earlier than usual, with high rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations among children (2). The interim estimates of 2022–23 influenza VE from two concurrent studies in Wisconsin suggest that the current season’s influenza vaccines are providing substantial protection against influenza. These findings are consistent with estimates reported in the Southern Hemisphere for the 2022 season and Canada for the current season, where similar viruses predominated (4,5). However, influenza vaccination coverage in the United States this season has been lower than during pre–COVID-19 pandemic seasons, particularly among children, pregnant women, and in rural areas (6). Increased vaccination coverage is needed to realize the full potential of seasonal influenza vaccines. The interim estimates reported reflect early season VE and might differ from end-of-season VE estimates with additional enrollments, or if a change in circulating viruses would occur later in the season. Through the week ending February 4, 2023, influenza activity was low nationally. However, CDC continues to monitor influenza activity through routine surveillance for any indications that activity might increase again; two waves of influenza activity have occurred during many previous seasons (7). Seasonal influenza vaccines protect against influenza A and B viruses, both of which might continue or begin to circulate later in the season, resulting in potentially serious complications. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the studies were restricted to participants from a single geographic area (central Wisconsin). However, viruses that predominated in the study population were similar to those that predominated across the United States (1). Second, older adults aged ≥65 years were excluded from the test-negative study. Age-specific VE estimates against influenza virus infection caused by A(H3N2) viruses are generally lower for older adults (8). Third, sample sizes were small for the interim analysis, which limited the precision of VE estimates, and VE against illness associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections and age-specific estimates could not be determined. Finally, confounding and bias are of concern with observational studies; however, estimates were comparable across two study designs, and the test-negative study design yields valid estimates of influenza VE in most scenarios (9). Annual influenza vaccination is the best strategy for preventing influenza and its complications. During the 2022–23 season to date, influenza A viruses that predominated are genetically and antigenically similar to current vaccine components. Interim VE estimates from this report indicate that the current season’s influenza vaccine substantially reduces the risk for medical visits among persons aged 6 months–64 years and symptomatic illness associated with influenza A virus infection among children and adolescents aged <18 years. Influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months for as long as influenza viruses are circulating in the community.

Top * Routine influenza surveillance in the United States indicated that influenza viruses began to circulate and outpatient visits for influenza-like illness were increased above seasonal baseline levels in epidemiologic week 40 (the week ending October 8, 2022). † Persons aged ≥6 months are recommended to receive annual influenza vaccination. Certain children aged 6 months–8 years need 2 doses of influenza vaccine, depending on influenza vaccination history. Persons aged ≥9 years are recommended to receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine each year, regardless of influenza vaccination history. For the test-negative case-control design analysis, children aged 6 months–8 years were excluded if they needed 2 doses and, at the time of illness, they had received only 1 dose of influenza vaccine ≥14 days earlier, meaning that they were partially vaccinated. For the cohort study, children aged 6 months–8 years were excluded from the study at the time of the first dose if they needed 2 doses and they had received only 1 dose of influenza vaccine. § Based on self-report of asthma or another chronic lung disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease including high blood pressure, immunocompromising condition, kidney disease, liver disease, obesity, or pregnancy in the 12 months preceding the test-negative case-control study enrollment and self-report of asthma, immunocompromised state, serious heart condition, or other chronic lung disease for the community cohort study. ¶ 45 C.F.R. part 46; 21 C.F.R. part 56. ** Six A(H3N2) viruses from the community cohort study were genetically characterized and belonged to subclade 2a.2.

The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans. The WHO recommends that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2023-2024 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:Egg-based vaccines an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus; anda B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccines an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus; anda B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.WHO recommends that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2023-2024 influenza season in the northern hemisphere contain the following: Egg-based vaccines an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccinesan A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like vi;an A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus Media Contacts WHO Media Team World Health Organization Email: mediainquiries@who.int Related Seasonal influenza Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOInfluenza-trained mucosal-resident alveolar macrophages confer long-term antitumor immunity in the lungs | Nature Immunology Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

However, the potential function of virus-trained macrophages in antitumor immunity in the lung, a preferential target of both primary and metastatic malignancies, is not well understood. Using mouse models of influenza and lung metastatic tumors, we show here that influenza trains respiratory mucosal-resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) to exert long-lasting and tissue-specific antitumor immunity. Trained AMs infiltrate tumor lesions and have enhanced phagocytic and tumor cell cytotoxic functions, which are associated with epigenetic, transcriptional and metabolic resistance to tumor-induced immune suppression. Generation of antitumor trained immunity in AMs is dependent on interferon-γ and natural killer cells. Notably, human AMs with trained immunity traits in non-small cell lung cancer tissue are associated with a favorable immune microenvironment. These data reveal a function for trained resident macrophages in pulmonary mucosal antitumor immune surveillance. Induction of trained immunity in tissue-resident macrophages might thereby be a potential antitumor strategy.

Such phenotypes in innate myeloid cells are now collectively termed ‘trained immunity’8,9. Owing to the lack of strict antigen/pathogen specificity of the response, trained innate cells have enhanced immune responses to a variety of heterologous stimulants8. Depending on the nature and route of introduction of primary stimulation, trained immunity can develop either systemically in hematopoietic progenitors and circulating monocytes or locally in tissue-specific macrophage populations3,10,11. Although trained macrophages have been widely studied for their anti-infectious functions in both humans and experimental animals, the potential function in antitumor immunity (particularly at specific tissue sites) is less clear12,13,14,15.Tissue-resident macrophages have been shown to be a major source of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in both humans and mice, and resident macrophage-derived TAMs have critical functions in oncogenesis at specific tissue sites, such as the lung, liver and pancreas16,17,18,19. As the most abundant leukocyte subset in tumor lesions, TAMs can have protumor functions via a variety of mechanisms, including immunosuppression and angiogenesis20. Alternatively, TAMs can be conditioned for antitumor functions via phagocytosis, presentation of tumor antigens and secretion of antitumor molecular mediators21,22. Therefore, the functional status of resident macrophages via generating resident macrophage-derived TAMs is a deciding factor of tumor development and progress at specific tissue sites. Current macrophage-targeting therapies rely on the short-term effect of therapeutics23,24,25. Little is known about whether long-lasting antitumor reprogramming can be achieved in macrophages, in particular in self-sustaining resident macrophages.The lungs are a preferential target organ of both primary and metastatic malignancies26,27,28. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), a subset of lung-resident and self-sustaining macrophages of embryonic ontogeny, have been shown to have critical effects in lung malignancies17,18,29. Meanwhile, the lungs are often exposed to a variety of respiratory pathogens, including viral pathogens such as influenza virus, adenovirus (AdV) and coronavirus30,31. Respiratory viruses typically cause acute infection and have been shown to induce trained immunity in AMs with long-lasting anti-infectious functions11,32. Despite these important findings, the potential role of respiratory viral infection-induced trained AMs in lung malignancies is not well characterized.Here, we show (in mouse models) that after recovery from influenza A virus (IAV) infection, the lungs are capable of long-lasting antitumor immunity. IAV-exposed resident AMs have cardinal features of trained immunity and have enhanced phagocytic and tumor cytotoxic functions. Together, these findings show that tissue-resident trained macrophages have long-lasting antitumor innate immune functions at specific tissue sites and indicate that modulation of trained immunity in tissue-resident macrophages might be an antitumor strategy with long-term effects.ResultsAcute IAV infection induces long-lasting pulmonary antitumor immunityTo study the long-term effect of acute IAV infection on pulmonary antitumor immunity, wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with a sublethal dose of IAV. As previously described33, IAV infection induces respiratory inflammation, characterized by acute leukocyte infiltration, production of proinflammatory cytokines and transient body weight loss, that was resolved by around 2 weeks after infection (Extended Data Fig. 1a–e). At 30 d after infection, mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with luciferase-expressing B16 melanoma cells (B16-luc) to inoculate tumor cells in the lungs (Fig. 1a). Compared to uninfected mice (PBS), significantly prolonged survival was observed in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 1b). Lung tumor burdens were also found to be lower in IAV-infected mice, as demonstrated by reduced B16-luc-specific gene transcripts of premelanosome (Pmel)34 and luciferase in the lung (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and reduced luciferin tumor signals in the lung area (Fig. 1c,d). Consistent with in vivo tumor imaging observations, macroscopic evaluation of the lungs at the experimental endpoint showed a drastic reduction of visible B16 tumor nodules in lung lobes in IAV mice compared to that observed in PBS mice (Fig. 1e,f). Lung histopathology also showed lower percentages of lung area occupied by tumor lesions in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 1g,h). In IAV-infected lungs, we observed sporadic consolidation of lung tissues where collagen deposition was evident (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To assess whether reduced lung tumor burden in IAV mice is due to reduced initial tumor inoculation in the lung, we quantified tumor cells in the lung at 30 min and 24 h after i.v. injection of B16-luc cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)27,35. By quantifying gene transcripts of premelanosome (Pmel), dopachrome tautomerase (Dct)34 and luciferase as well as the numbers of CD45–GFP+ B16 cells, we showed comparable early tumor burdens in the lungs between PBS-treated and IAV-infected mice (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). These data suggest that the antitumor phenotype in IAV-exposed lungs is not due to reduced initial delivery or inoculation of tumor cells.Fig. 1: Acute IAV infection induces long-lasting pulmonary antitumor immunity.a, Schema of i.n.

A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups. A log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used for comparison of survival curves.Source dataFull size imageImportantly, such an antitumor phenotype was consistently observed when tumor cells were inoculated on days 60 and 120 after IAV infection (Extended Data Fig. 2e–h and Fig. 1i–l), suggesting a long-lasting antitumor immunity induced by acute IAV infection. Moreover, we found that acute AdV infection induced a comparable antitumor phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 2i–l), suggesting that such a virus-induced antitumor immunity is not limited to IAV. IAV-induced antitumor immunity was not observed when tumor cells were subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated (Extended Data Fig. 2m–p). In a mouse s.c. 4T1 breast cancer model with spontaneous lung metastasis, we further showed that IAV-infected mice had reduced metastatic tumor burdens in the lung compared to uninfected mice, although tumors at primary injection sites were comparable between the two groups of mice (Fig. 1m–o and Extended Data Fig. 2q). To exclude the roles of systemic trained immunity, such as trained granulopoiesis in bone marrow (BM) progenitors with antitumor functions15, in IAV-induced antitumor protection, we transplanted BM cells from naive or day 30 IAV-infected mice to naive syngeneic hosts (Extended Data Fig. 2r). Host mice were inoculated i.v. with B16 cells after donor BM reconstitution (Extended Data Fig. 2s). There was no difference in B16 tumor burden in the lungs of mice receiving BM from naive versus IAV mice (Extended Data Fig. 2t,u). These data collectively indicate that respiratory viral infections induce antitumor immunity specifically in the lung tissues long after resolution of primary acute anti-infectious immune responses.Virus-exposed AMs respond to tumors in the lungsTo study whether IAV-induced antitumor immunity is dependent on adaptive T cells, in particular activated T cells with bystander defense activities, we depleted both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo from day 29 after IAV infection to the experimental endpoint, with B16 cell inoculation on day 30 after infection (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We found that IAV-induced antitumor immunity in the lung was intact after T cell depletion, as demonstrated by lung macroscopic and histopathological observations (Fig. 2b–e). These data suggest that IAV-induced antitumor immunity in the lung is independent of adaptive T cells.Fig. 2: Virus-exposed AMs respond to tumors in the lungs.a, Schema of continuous CD4+ and CD8+ T cell depletion in IAV-infected mice inoculated i.v. with B16 melanoma cells. b,c, Macroscopic evaluation of the lungs (b) and number of macroscopically visible B16 tumor nodules on the surface of lung lobes after tumor inoculation from uninfected (PBS) or IAV-infected mice or IAV-infected mice with T cell depletion (IAVTdepl; c). d,e, Representative lung histopathology images (d) and percentage of lung area occupied by tumor lesions in mice shown in b (e). f, Schema of AM depletion in PBS-treated (PBSAM depl) and IAV-infected (IAVAM depl) mice at day 30 followed by inoculation of B16 melanoma cells in the lung. g,h, Macroscopic evaluation of the lungs (g) and number of macroscopically visible B16 tumor nodules on the surface of lung lobes after tumor inoculation from PBS- or IAV-infected mice with or without AM depletion (h). i,j, Representative lung histopathology images (i) and percentage of lung area occupied by tumor lesions in mice shown in g (j). k, Schema of adoptive transfer of AMs isolated from PBS- or IAV-infected mice at day 30 i.t. into naive recipient mice followed by inoculation of B16 melanoma cells in the lungs of recipients. l,m, Luciferin-based in vivo tumor imaging (l) and average radiance of luciferin signals in the lung area in mice receiving PBS AMs or IAV AMs (m). n,o, Macroscopic evaluation of the lungs (n) and number of macroscopically visible B16 tumor nodules on the surface of lung lobes from mice shown in l (o). p,q, Representative lung histopathology images (p) and percentage of lung area occupied by tumor lesions in mice shown in l (q). Bar graphs are presented as mean ± s.d. Data are representative of two independent experiments, with the numbers of mice per group indicated (n = 5 mice per group in c, e, h and j; n = 4 PBS AM mice and n = 5 IAV AM mice in m, o and q). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups. A one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test was performed to compare more than two groups.Source dataFull size imageMacrophages play critical roles in tumor progress, and respiratory viral infection was shown to induce trained immunity in AMs with enhanced responsiveness against heterologous stimulants11,17,18. To directly examine the role of virus-exposed AMs in antitumor immunity, we administered clodronate liposomes intratracheally (i.t.) on day 29 after IAV infection to deplete resident AMs, followed by tumor cell inoculation on day 30 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3c). Additional doses of clodronate liposomes were administered i.v. to deplete potential monocytic progenitors of AMs (Fig. 2f). Lung macroscopic and histopathological analyses at the experimental endpoint showed that depletion of AMs abrogated the IAV-induced antitumor phenotype (Fig. 2g–j), suggesting a critical requirement of virus-exposed AMs in mediating antitumor immunity.To further show the critical role of virus-exposed AMs in antitumor immunity, we isolated AMs from naive or IAV-infected mice on day 30 after infection (Fig. 2k). Isolated AMs were immediately adoptively transferred i.t. into naive syngeneic host mice, followed by inoculation with luciferase-expressing B16-luc cells i.v. (Fig. 2k). On day 17 after tumor inoculation, luciferin-based in vivo tumor imaging showed significantly reduced tumor signals in the lung area of mice receiving IAV-exposed AMs compared to those receiving naive AMs (Fig. 2l,m). Reduced tumor burden in the lungs was also evident in lung macroscopic and histopathological analyses (Fig. 2n–q). Our data thus far indicate that IAV induces long-lasting antitumor innate immunity in the lung, which is mediated by virus-exposed AMs.IAV infection induces trained immunity in AMsTo characterize AMs from virus-exposed mice, AMs from uninfected or IAV-infected mice were analyzed on day 30 after infection by using a multitude of approaches (Fig. 3a). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in purified AMs showed differentially expressed gene transcripts between PBS and IAV AMs, with the transcription of 1,916 genes markedly upregulated and 1,679 downregulated in IAV AMs (Fig. 3b). Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes revealed upregulation of gene transcripts associated with immune activation and effector functions in IAV AMs (Fig. 3c). In addition to drastic changes in transcriptional profiles, flow cytometry analysis showed that IAV-exposed AMs expressed higher levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) than those from uninfected mice (Fig. 3d). Importantly, IAV-exposed AMs secrete higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), following ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or live Streptococcal pneumoniae that is antigenically irrelevant to IAV (Fig. 3e). By using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) in purified AMs, we showed that chromatin accessibility in 1,725 genes was increased, and chromatin accessibility of 328 genes decreased in IAV versus PBS AMs (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4a). GO enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes showed increased chromatin accessibility of genes related to immune activation and effector functions of macrophages in IAV AMs (Fig. 3g). In support of upregulated MHC class II and enhanced potential of proinflammatory mediator production (Fig. 3d,e), ATAC-seq also showed increased chromatin accessibility of genes including MHC class II genes, Tnf and Cxcl2 in IAV AMs (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for ATAC-seq signal changes of genes showed enrichment of pathways closely related to trained immunity in AMs, including glycolysis process and the PI3K–Akt, HIF-1 and mTOR signaling pathways (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). Moreover, IAV AMs showed markedly increased ex vivo oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) compared to PBS AMs, indicating prolonged metabolic rewiring (Extended Data Fig. 4g–j). These data collectively suggest that IAV-exposed AMs demonstrate cardinal features of trained immunity.Fig. 3: IAV infection induces trained immunity in AMs.a, Schema of respiratory IAV infection in mice and characterization of AMs on day 30 after infection. b, Volcano plots showing RNA transcripts differentially expressed (adjusted P value (Padj) of <0.05, | log2 (fold change) | > 0) in AMs from IAV-infected mice on day 30 after infection versus those from uninfected (PBS-treated) mice. c, GO enrichment of cluster-specific marker gene transcripts (Padj < 0.05) related to immune functions that are upregulated in IAV versus PBS AMs. d, Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and representative flow cytometry histograms of MHC class II expression on PBS and day 30 IAV AMs. FMO, fluorescence minus one. e, Concentrations of representative proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including TNF, IL-6 and MIP-2, in supernatants of ex vivo cultured AMs either unstimulated (unsti) or stimulated with LPS or live S. pneumoniae (S.p.). f, ATAC-seq heat maps and metagene plots showing the top 1,000 genes with significant gain or loss (FDR < 0.017) of chromatin accessibility in IAV versus PBS AMs. g, GO enrichment of ATAC-seq chromatin regions related to immune functions with significant (Padj < 0.05) gain of chromatin accessibility in IAV versus PBS AMs. h, Survival of PBS- or IAV-infected mice after respiratory infection with S. pneumoniae at 5 × 107 c.f.u. per mouse on day 30 after viral infection. i, Bacterial burden (c.f.u.) in the lungs at 72 h after bacterial infection in PBS- or day 30 IAV-infected mice. Bar graphs are presented as mean ± s.d. Data in b, c, h and i are representative of two independent experiments, data in d and e are representative of three independent experiments, and data in f and g are representative of one experiment, with numbers of mice per group as indicated (n = 3 per group in b, c, f and g; n = 5 PBS-treated mice and n = 4 IAV-infected mice in d; n = 4 culture wells per group in e; n = 8 per group in h; n = 3 PBS-treated mice and n = 5 IAV-infected mice in i). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups. A log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used for comparison of survival curves.Source dataFull size imageWe next sought to assess whether IAV infection induces protection against heterologous bacterial infection in mice, as we have previously shown in an AdV infection model11. To do this, IAV-infected or uninfected mice were challenged i.t. with a lethal dose of S. pneumoniae on day 30 after IAV infection. Compared to IAV-naive mice, IAV-infected mice had improved survival and reduced lung bacterial burdens (Fig. 3h,i). These data indicate that IAV-trained AMs are associated with enhanced antibacterial immunity in the lung, further supporting a trained immunity phenotype in IAV-exposed AMs. To assess whether such an IAV-induced antibacterial trained immunity is contradictory to the well-recognized roles of IAV in bacterial superinfection, we also challenged mice with S. pneumoniae i.t. on day 7 after IAV infection (Extended Data Fig. 5a). At this time point, IAV-infected mice showed increased body weight loss and illness scores and succumbed to bacterial superinfection compared to IAV-naive mice (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). These data suggest that acute-phase IAV infection is associated with bacterial superinfection, while in the immune memory phase after IAV infection, trained AMs exert enhanced antibacterial functions. Our data thus far collectively suggest that IAV infection induces trained immunity in AMs with long-lasting antitumor functions.IAV-trained AMs develop independently of circulating monocytesPrevious studies suggest that trained AMs are generated either from embryonic-derived resident AMs or from circulating monocytic precursors that reconstitute the lung tissues during inflammation11,32,36. To study the cellular ontogeny of IAV-trained AMs, we compared the expression of characteristic cell surface markers, including CD11b, Ly6C, CD64, CD11c and Siglec-F, in IAV AMs to those in circulating monocytes and embryonic-derived AMs from naive (PBS) mice (Fig. 4a). IAV AMs expressed these selected markers at levels similar to those observed in PBS AMs but with drastic differences observed in monocytes (Fig. 4a). We also compared the RNA-seq profiles of embryonic-derived signature genes in PBS versus IAV AMs (Fig. 4b)36. IAV AMs expressed the majority of embryonic-derived signature genes at levels similar to those observed in embryonic-derived PBS AMs (Fig. 4b). These data support the hypothesis that IAV-trained AMs are generated from embryonic-derived resident AMs but not monocytes.Fig. 4: IAV-trained AMs develop independently of circulating monocytes.a, Representative flow cytometry histograms of surface molecules on peripheral blood monocytes and AMs from uninfected (PBS) or IAV-infected mice. b, Relative transcription levels of embryonic-derived signature genes in PBS or IAV AMs (n = 3 mice per group). c, Numbers of AMs in WT or Ccr2-knockout (Ccr2–/–) mice on day 30 after IAV infection (n = 3 or 4 mice per group as indicated). d, MHC class II expression in PBS and day 30 IAV AMs in WT or Ccr2−/− mice (n = 4 mice per group). e, Concentrations of representative cytokines/chemokines in supernatants of ex vivo cultured AMs stimulated with LPS (n = 3 or 4 culture wells per group as indicated). f, Schema of the parabiotic mouse model. g,h, Representative flow cytometry dot plots (g) and chimerism of circulating monocytes in PBS- or IAV-infected parabiotic mice (h; n = 2 PBS-treated mice and n = 6 IAV-infected mice). i,j, Representative flow cytometry dot plots of AMs in BAL samples (i) and chimerism of AMs in BAL samples and lungs of parabiotic mice (j). k,l, Representative flow cytometry dot plots (k) and chimerism of IMs in the lungs of parabiotic mice (l; n = 6 or 4 mice per group as indicated in i–l). m, Chimerism of AMs in BAL samples and lungs of PBS- or day 9 IAV-infected (IAVd9) parabiotic mice (n = 6 mice per group). n, Percentage of BrdU-incorporating AMs in BAL samples of PBS- or IAV-infected mice on days 9 and 11 after infection (n = 3 or 4 mice per group as indicated); CD45– cells by intravenous staining are shown in i–m. Numbers in g, i and k indicate percent against parental gate. Bar graphs are presented as mean ± s.d. Data are representatives of two (b–e and g–n) or three (a) independent experiments. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups. A one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test was performed to compare more than two groups.Source dataFull size imageTo further show the independence of monocytes in IAV-trained AMs, we administered IAV i.n. to Ccr2−/− mice lacking Ly6Chi circulating monocytes, the major contributor of monocyte-derived AMs11. On day 30 after infection, nearly identical numbers of trained AMs with comparable phenotypic and functional changes were observed in Ccr2−/− and WT mice (Fig. 4c–e). We also infected parabiotic mice with IAV and examined the levels of chimerism in AMs after infection (Fig. 4f). As expected, chimerism of circulating monocytes was consistently over 30% in both uninfected and IAV-infected mice (Fig. 4g,h). In sharp contrast, there was minimal chimerism (~1% on average) of AMs in either uninfected or day 30 IAV-infected mice (Fig. 4i,j). By using an i.v. anti-CD45 staining strategy to exclude cells in the lung vasculature, we observed that chimerism of interstitial macrophages (IMs) in the lung interstitium was far higher than that of AMs (Fig. 4k,l), supporting the monocytic ontogeny of IMs. These data indicate that IAV-trained AM generation is independent of monocytes.IAV infection induced acute loss of AMs, with a nearly 90% reduction in AM cell number by around 1 week after infection, and the AM population started to recover between days 9 and 11 after infection (Extended Data Fig. 1c). By using a similar parabiosis approach, we showed minimal chimerism in AMs even on day 9 after infection when niches of AMs were presumably vacant (Fig. 4m). These data point to the possibility that recovery of the AM population after IAV infection was achieved through autonomous proliferation of surviving embryonic-derived AMs. To analyze the proliferation status of AMs at this time point in situ, we performed BrdU incorporation analysis in AMs before infection and on days 9 and 11 after IAV infection. On average, around 10% of AMs incorporated BrdU before infection (Fig. 4n). On day 9 after infection, only 2% of AMs incorporated BrdU (Fig. 4n). Surprisingly, on day 11 after infection, as high as >50% of AMs incorporated BrdU (Fig. 4n). These data suggest that although IAV infection causes substantial loss of AMs, their numbers recover after resolution of acute inflammation via vigorous proliferation of IAV-exposed embryonic-derived resident AMs, through which tissue-specific trained immunity in AMs is generated.Trained AMs have enhanced phagocytic and tumor cytotoxic functionsPrevious studies suggest that tissue-resident macrophages represent a major source of TAMs and play key roles in oncogenesis in their respective tissues of residence, including the lung, liver and pancreas16,17,19. We went on to address whether trained AMs infiltrate tumor lesions in the lung. By using confocal microscopy in immunostained lung sections, we observed abundant Siglec-F+CD11c+ AMs in juxtaposition with B16 melanoma cells in lung tumor lesions (Fig. 5a). Notably, there were higher numbers of tumor cell phagocytosis events by IAV-trained AMs than by IAV-naive (PBS) AMs (Fig. 5a). These data prompted us to hypothesize that trained AMs exert antitumor immunity via enhanced phagocytosis and/or tumoricidal functions. In support of this, RNA-seq in IAV AMs showed enhanced transcription of gene clusters related to phagocytosis, cell killing and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosynthetic process that are closely related to antitumor functions of macrophages (Fig. 5b–d). To further show the antitumor functions of trained AMs, we cocultured B16-luc cells with freshly isolated PBS or IAV AMs and assessed tumor cell survival (Fig. 5e–g). There were significantly reduced numbers of live B16 cells cocultured for 72 h with IAV AMs compared to those cocultured with PBS AMs (Fig. 5e,f and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Analysis at different time points showed that antitumor effects of IAV AMs were only marginal at 24 h but were evident at 48 and 72 h of coculture (Fig. 5g).Fig. 5: Trained AMs have enhanced phagocytic and tumor cytotoxic functions.a, Representative confocal microscopic images on Siglec-F+CD11c+ AMs and melanoma cells (black colored cells in brightfield) in lung tumor lesions in PBS- or IAV-infected mice.

Data are representative of three independent experiments (n = 5 mice per group in a; n = 3 mice per group in b–d; n = 3 or 4 culture wells per group as indicated in f, g and i; n = 3 culture wells per group in h and j; n = 8 culture wells per group in l). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups. A one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test was performed to compare more than two groups, except in h where a two-way ANOVA was used.Source dataFull size imageWe found that antitumor effects of IAV AMs were abrogated when AMs and tumor cells were separated by transwell (Fig. 5h), supporting contact-dependent tumor killing by trained AMs. However, treatment with anti-CD47 had minimal effects on antitumor functions of trained AMs (Fig. 5i), suggesting that enhanced tumor phagocytosis by trained AMs is independent of modulation of ‘don’t eat me’ signals. By using flow cytometry analysis in a similar coculture of AMs and B16-GFP cells, we further showed that phagocytosis of tumor cells was significantly higher in IAV AMs than in PBS AMs (Fig. 5j). Confocal microscopy of AM–B16 coculture also showed increased phagocytic events by IAV AMs (Fig. 5k,l). Three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal microscopy images confirmed that B16 cells were truly engulfed by trained AMs (Fig. 5m). These data thus indicate that trained AMs exert antitumor functions via enhanced phagocytosis and killing of tumor cells.To study whether trained AMs kill phagocytosed tumor cells via macrophage cell death, we measured potential cell death of PBS or IAV AMs cocultured with B16 cells for 48 h. There were no changes in Annexin V+propidium iodide+ (Annexin V+PI+) or Annexin V+PI− AMs before versus after coculture, suggesting that tumoricidal functions in trained AMs are independent of AM cell death (Extended Data Fig. 6b). A recent study showed that enhanced fatty acid oxidation is essential for macrophage antitumor activity24. We therefore asked whether enhanced mitochondrial oxidation in trained AMs (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h) is critical to their enhanced tumoricidal functions. We found that IAV AMs showed enhanced OCRs compared to PBS AMs both before and after coculture with B16 cells for 48 h (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). To further show the significance of enhanced OCR in tumoricidal functions of trained AMs, we used etomoxir (an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation) and UK5099 (an inhibitor of the glucose oxidation pathway) either alone or in combination to suppress mitochondrial oxidation in AMs (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Reduced tumor cell killing was observed in the presence of either etomoxir or UK5099 and was most evident with combined etomoxir and UK5099 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6g). As reduced numbers of live B16 cells were observed after culture with etomoxir and/or UK5099 (Extended Data Fig. 6h), our data indicate that tumoricidal functions of IAV-trained AMs are dependent on enhanced mitochondrial oxidation from fatty acids and glucose.Trained AMs are resistant to tumor-induced immunosuppressionImmunosuppression in TAMs induced by the tumor microenvironment represents a key mechanism in tumor immune escape. To functionally characterize trained AMs in such microenvironments during tumorigenesis in the lung tissues, AMs were purified after establishment of B16 tumors in the lungs of PBS-treated or IAV-infected mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis. ATAC-seq showed that in PBS-treated mice, lung tumors induced the loss of chromatin accessibility in 1,655 genes and the gain of accessibility in 888 genes (PBS-B16 versus PBS; Fig. 6a). Specifically, genes with gain of chromatin accessibility included those related to negative regulation of immune functions, while genes with loss of chromatin accessibility included largely those associated with immune activation pathways (Fig. 6b,c). These changes in infection-free AMs indicate that tumor progress induced an immune-suppressive microenvironment in the lung. Compared to PBS-B16 AMs, IAV-trained AMs in tumor-bearing lungs (IAV-B16) had a gain of chromatin accessibility in 6,516 genes and a loss of chromatin accessibility in 1,268 genes (Fig. 6d). KEGG enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes comparing IAV-B16 to PBS-B16 AMs showed a gain of chromatin accessibility of genes related to immune activation and trained immunity, in particular intracellular signaling pathways (Fig. 6e). Notably, GSEA for ATAC-seq signal changes of genes comparing IAV-B16 to PBS-B16 AMs showed enrichment of pathways closely related to antitumor trained immunity functions in AMs, including phagocytosis, cell killing, glycolysis process and reactive nitric oxide species metabolic process (Extended Data Fig. 7c–f), indicating enhanced antitumor functions in IAV versus PBS AMs in the tumor-bearing lung microenvironment. These data suggest that trained, but not naive, AMs are epigenetically resistant to the immune-suppressive microenvironment induced by lung tumors.Fig. 6: Trained AMs are resistant to tumor-induced immunosuppression.a, ATAC-seq volcano plots showing genes with significant gain or loss (FDR < 0.05) of chromatin accessibility in AMs from uninfected tumor-bearing mice (PBS-B16) on day 9 after tumor inoculation versus naive (PBS) mice. b, GO enrichment of ATAC-seq chromatin regions related to immune suppression with significant (Padj < 0.05) gain of chromatin accessibility in AMs from PBS-B16 versus PBS mice. c, GO enrichment of ATAC-seq chromatin regions related to immune activation with significant (Padj < 0.05) loss of chromatin accessibility in AMs from PBS-B16 versus PBS mice. d, ATAC-seq volcano plots showing genes with significant gain or loss (FDR < 0.05) of chromatin accessibility in AMs from IAV-infected tumor-bearing mice (IAV-B16) versus PBS-B16 mice on day 9 after tumor inoculation. e, KEGG enrichment of ATAC-seq chromatin regions related to immune activation with significant (Padj < 0.05) gain of chromatin accessibility in AMs from IAV-B16 versus PBS-B16 mice. f, RNA-seq heat maps showing z scores of differentially expressed genes (gene transcripts with Padj < 0.05 and | log2 (fold change) | > 0 are presented) in AMs from PBS, PBS-B16, IAV and IAV-B16 mice. AMs were isolated 9 d after tumor inoculation on day 30 after IAV infection. g,h, GO enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes in f (g) and RNA-seq heat maps showing z scores of differentially expressed genes (Padj < 0.05) related to trained immunity and antitumor functions in AMs from the four experimental groups as shown in f (h). Data in a–e are from one experiment (n = 3 per group). Data in f–h are representative of two independent experiments (n = 3 or 4 per group as indicated). A hypergeometric test (one-sided with the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment method) was used for statistical analysis in b, c, e and g.Full size imageHeat map and correlation analyses based on RNA-seq data showed drastic changes in transcriptional profiles of PBS AMs after tumor establishment in the lung (PBS versus PBS-B16; Fig. 6f and Extended Data Fig. 7g). By contrast, fewer changes in transcriptional profiles were observed in trained AMs before than after tumor inoculation (IAV versus IAV-B16; Fig. 6f and Extended Data Fig. 7g). This is further supported by GO enrichment of gene clusters showing that immune activation-related gene transcripts (cluster C3) that were upregulated by IAV remain largely unchanged after tumor establishment in the lung (Fig. 6f,g). Specifically, IAV-upregulated gene transcripts associated with trained immunity and antitumor functions, including antigen processing and presentation, phagocytosis, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and nitric oxide biosynthesis process, remain essentially unchanged after tumor establishment (Fig. 6h). These data suggest that trained AMs are transcriptionally resistant to tumor-induced immune-suppressive microenvironments.Antitumor trained immunity of AMs is dependent on interferon-γ (IFNγ) and natural killer (NK) cellsOur previous study showed that AdV-induced generation of trained immunity in AMs requires T cell help during the acute phase of the primary immune response via IFNγ-dependent mechanisms11. We therefore asked whether IAV-induced antitumor trained immunity in AMs also requires T cell help and/or IFNγ. To induce AMs that were not helped by T cells, we depleted both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo from day 3 after IAV infection to day 30 when B16 melanoma cells were inoculated i.v. (Fig. 7a). On day 17 after tumor inoculation, reduced tumor burden in the lungs was observed in IAV-infected mice regardless of T cell depletion (Fig. 7b–e), suggesting that T cell help is not required for IAV-induced antitumor trained immunity in AMs. To study the potential role of IFNγ, we infected Ifng-knockout mice (IFNγ−/−) and inoculated B16 melanoma cells i.v. on day 30 after infection (Fig. 7f). Tumor burden in the lungs was increased in IAV-infected IFNγ−/− mice compared to in uninfected mice (Fig. 7g–j). These data suggest that IFNγ is required for the enhanced antitumor functions of IAV-trained AMs.Fig. 7: Antitumor trained immunity of AMs is dependent on IFNγ and NK cells.a, Schema of IAV infection in WT mice with continuous T cell depletion, followed by inoculation of B16 cells after infection. b,c, Macroscopic analysis of the lungs (b) and number of macroscopically visible B16 tumor nodules on the surface of lung lobes (c). d,e, Representative lung histopathology images (d) and percentage of lung area occupied by tumor lesions based on lung histopathological analysis in mice shown in b (e). f, Schema of IAV infection in Ifng-knockout (IFNγ−/−) mice followed by inoculation of B16 cells after infection. g,h, Macroscopic analysis of the lungs (g) and number of macroscopically visible B16 tumor nodules on the surface of lung lobes (h). i,j, Representative lung histopathology images (i) and percentage of lung area occupied by tumor lesions based on lung histopathological analysis in mice shown in g (j). k, Survival of B16-luc cells cocultured for 72 h with AMs from PBS- or day 30 IAV-infected WT or Ifngr-knockout (IFNγR−/−) mice. l, Number of IFNγ-producing leukocytes in the lung after IAV infection; ILCs, innate lymphoid cells. m, Schema of IAV infection in WT mice with continuous T cell or NK cell depletion to assess antitumor functions of AMs. n, Survival of B16-luc cells cocultured with AMs as shown in m. Bar graphs are presented as mean ± s.d. Data are representative of two independent experiments (n = 6 mice per group in c and e; n = 5 mice per group in h and j; n = 3 or 4 culture wells per group as indicated in k; n = 4 culture wells per group in n). A one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test was performed to compare more than two groups. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups.Source dataFull size imageCompared to WT mice, IFNγ−/− mice had reduced IAV viral burden in the lungs on day 3 and to a lesser extent on day 5 after infection (Extended Data Fig. 8a). To test whether impaired AM training in IFNγ−/− mice was due to a dose effect of IAV, we infected IFNγ−/− mice with IAV at either a standard dose (120 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) per mouse) or a high dose (360 p.f.u. per mouse). High-dose IAV infection in IFNγ−/− mice failed to rescue the impaired antitumor functions in AMs (Extended Data Fig. 8b), arguing against an IAV dose effect in IFNγ−/− mice. Moreover, impaired AM training was consistently observed in Ifngr-knockout (IFNγR−/−) mice (Fig. 7k and Extended Data Fig. 8c). These findings in AMs from both IFNγ−/− and IFNγR−/− mice strongly support a critical role of IFNγ signaling in IAV-induced antitumor trained AM generation.To show the cellular source of IFNγ in IAV-infected lung tissues, we performed intracellular cytokine staining in lung leukocytes before and on days 3, 5 and 7 after infection. We identified NK cells as the dominant source of IFNγ on days 3 and 5 after infection, and T cells were not the major IFNγ producers until day 7 (Fig. 7l). With intact antitumor immunity in the lungs of T cell-depleted mice, we speculate that IFNγ-producing NK cells are critically required for IAV-induced antitumor trained AM generation. We therefore depleted NK cells or T cells in vivo in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 7m) and found that IAV-exposed AMs from NK-depleted, but not T cell-depleted, mice showed markedly reduced tumoricidal functions after coculture with B16-luc cells (Fig. 7n). Thus, these data collectively suggest that IFNγ and NK cells are required for IAV-induced antitumor trained immunity in AMs.Human trained AMs are associated with antitumor immunityOur data thus far suggest that trained resident AMs play critical antitumor functions in the lungs in mice. We next sought to assess whether trained resident AMs in human lung tumor tissues could also be identified and are associated with antitumor immunity. By using published original data on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues37, we identified multiple subsets of resident AMs based on coexpression of characteristic genes, including PPARG and SERPINA1, and genes encoding macrophage markers, including CD14, CD68 and MRC1 (clusters 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and 20, Fig. 8a and Extended Data Fig. 9a)17,37. Notably, cluster 1 AMs demonstrated transcriptional profiles of prototypical trained immunity, which is highly comparable to IAV-trained mouse resident AMs (Figs. 8b–f and 3c). Specifically, trained AMs in human lung cancer tissues are enriched in gene clusters associated with response to microbes/microbial components and cytokines, proinflammatory cytokine production, immune activation-associated signaling pathways, glycolysis, antigen processing and presentation, chemotaxis and so on (Fig. 8b,c,e). Importantly, the frequency of trained AMs was significantly higher in human lung cancer tissues with high immune activation than in those with low immune activation tumor microenvironments (immune activationhi versus immune activationlow; Fig. 8g–i). Thus, these results suggest that trained resident AMs infiltrating human lung cancer tissues are associated with antitumor immunity.Fig. 8: Human trained AMs are associated with antitumor immunity.a, scRNA-seq t-SNE plots showing a total of 42 cell populations in human NSCLC tumor tissues. b, GO enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes related to immune functions in human trained AMs. c,d, KEGG enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes related to immune activation signaling pathways in human (c) and mouse (d) trained AMs. e,f, GO enrichment of cluster-specific marker genes related to cellular components and molecular functions in human (e) and mouse (f) trained AMs. g, scRNA-seq t-SNE plots showing the distribution of major cell populations in human NSCLC tumors with high or low immune activation; DCs, dendritic cells; HSCs, hematopoietic stem cells; MoMΦ, monocyte-derived macrophages. h,i, Percentage of trained AMs in total TAMs (h) and percentage of trained AMs in total TAMs and monocytes (Mo) in immune activationhi and immune activationlow human NSCLC tumors (i). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups.Source dataFull size imageDiscussionTrained macrophages and monocytes are well recognized for their heterologous anti-infectious functions, as evidenced in both experimental animals and in humans10,13,32. Nevertheless, functional significance of trained immunity during tumorigenesis remains far less appreciated. One relevant study using mouse subcutaneous tumor models reported trained neutrophils with systemic antitumor functions15. A more recent study showed that β-glucan, a widely used inducer of systemic trained immunity, attracts circulating monocyte influx into the pancreas to exert antitumor functions38. Despite these intriguing findings, little is known about whether self-sustaining tissue-resident macrophages can carry antitumor trained immunity and exert long-term antitumor functions at specific tissue sites. Here, we show that lung tissue-resident trained AMs induced by acute respiratory viral infections are poised to exert long-lasting tissue-specific antitumor trained innate immunity. Mechanistically, trained AMs infiltrate tumor lesions and exert T cell-independent tumoricidal functions via enhanced engulfment and killing of tumor cells. Our study reveals a previously unappreciated role of tissue-specific antitumor trained innate immunity mediated by long-lasting and self-sustaining resident macrophages.AMs originally derive from embryonic hematopoietic progenitor cells, and after birth, in particular during lung inflammation, these embryonic-derived AMs might be replaced by circulating monocytes to generate monocyte-derived AMs29,39. We show in this study and in a previous study that acute respiratory infection by influenza virus or AdV, two common respiratory viral pathogens, induces trained immunity in self-sustaining embryonic-derived AMs long after resolution of the primary immune response11. Our data are, however, contradictory with a previous study showing a monocytic ontogeny of antibacterial AMs following acute IAV infection32. A possible explanation is the myeloablative drug busulfan used in this previous study introduced additional cytotoxicity in resident AMs and therefore impaired their autonomous recovery after IAV infection32,40. In support of our data, a previous study suggested that IAV infection does not deplete AMs in B6 mice41. Not unexpectedly, IAV infection in our study induced a drastic reduction in AM cell number by days 5 to 9 after infection, which started to recover by around day 11. We showed that on day 11 after infection, as high as >50% of surviving AMs incorporated BrdU, reflecting their robust proliferating status after resolution of acute IAV infection. Our data support the idea that AMs have potent self-sustaining potential, and thus training in embryonic-derived resident AMs may represent a generalized phenotype induced by acute respiratory viral infections.The tumor-associated microenvironment drives TAMs toward protumor polarization early during tumor development via diversified mechanisms, including modulating signaling pathways and altering the production of effector mediators and epigenetic and/or metabolic programming42. With continuous influence of the microenvironment on TAMs, it is not unexpected that TAM-targeting therapeutic strategies to date rely largely on repeated administration of short-term effective TAM-modulating agents to antagonize the continuous taming by the tumor-associated microenvironment14,21,23,24. Our data suggest that trained resident AMs are resistant to the tumor-associated immune-suppressive microenvironment at transcriptional and epigenetic levels at least until the middle stage of lung tumor development. By contrast, naive AMs are highly susceptible to such an immune-suppressive microenvironment, as demonstrated by loss of chromatin accessibility in genes related to immune activation. One of the limitations in our study is that we used peritumoral rather than intratumoral AMs for transcriptional and epigenetic analysis due to technical challenges in dissecting sporadic small tumor lesions across the lung. However, the drastic transcriptional and epigenetic changes in peritumoral AMs in tumor-bearing lungs indicate profound influences by tumors despite their peritumoral location43,44,45. It is therefore plausible to speculate that the tumor-associated microenvironment educates not only tumor-infiltrating AMs but also peritumoral naive AMs toward an immune-suppressive polarization, which may later infiltrate expanding tumor lesions. Thus, our data indicate that preestablished trained immunity in resident AMs endows an intrinsic resistance to tumor-associated immune-suppressive microenvironments, which is key for trained AMs to reserve antitumor polarization in immune-suppressive microenvironments. Although we show a markedly reduced lung tumor burden in IAV-exposed mice versus in IAV-naive mice, the survival time of the IAV-exposed mice was only 5 d longer than that of the IAV-naive mice. We speculate that this is due to the fast-growing nature of lung B16 tumors, in particular at later stages of tumor development. Moreover, antitumor immunity in IAV-exposed lungs is exerted by trained AMs via enhanced tumor cell phagocytosis without contribution from adaptive T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. These observations highlight the significance of comprehensive antitumor immunity mediated by both the innate and adaptive branches. Nevertheless, our study does not exclude the possibility that trained AMs may facilitate T cell-mediated antitumor immunity23,42,46. Induction of trained immunity in tissue-resident macrophages thus represents an attractive strategy with durable antitumor effects.We show here that trained AMs infiltrating lung tumor tissues are associated with antitumor immunity in humans. However, the causal factors that induce trained immunity in human NSCLC-infiltrating resident AMs remain speculative. A recent clinical study shows that aerosol delivery of AdV-vectored vaccine induces trained immunity in human AMs47. Therefore, trained immunity in human AMs could, similar to that observed in mice, be induced by respiratory viral infections likely including influenza. Moreover, clinical evidence on the association between respiratory viral infections and lung cancers has been scarce. This may reflect sophisticated mechanisms in the modulation of the human respiratory immune environment overtime by a wide variety of stimulants far beyond viral infections, which deserve further investigation.Our study shed light on tissue-resident macrophages as a potential target of trained immunity-based anticancer strategy, that is, prophylactic induction of trained antitumor immunity in resident AMs. Such a strategy is particularly appealing in individuals with extrapulmonary cancers, such as melanoma and breast cancer, which have high risks of lung metastasis. Our study will foster further investigation on the induction of trained immunity in tumor-infiltrating resident macrophages in a therapeutic setting, either as a monotherapy or in combination with T cell-based immunotherapies.MethodsMiceWT female C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice were purchased from Slac Laboratory Animals. CD45.1+ mice (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ), Ifng-knockout mice (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J) and Ccr2-knockout mice (B6.129S4-Ccr2tm1Ifc/J) were originally from the Jackson Laboratory and were kind gifts from Z. Cai (Zhejiang University), X. Wang (Soochow University) and H. Tang (Shandong First Medical University), respectively. Ifngr-knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background were generated by GemPharmatech and were a kind gift from S. Zhu (Zhejiang University). Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility with ad libitum access to food (Xietong Shengwu) and water and were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, with 50–60% humidity and at 20–25 °C at Zhejiang University Laboratory Animal Center. Animals were assigned experimental groups at random. Female mice at 6–8 weeks of age were used for all experiments, and the numbers of mice per experimental group are indicated in the figure legends. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines from the Animal Research and Ethics Boards of Zhejiang University.Respiratory viral and extracellular bacterial infectionsAcute respiratory viral infection was introduced by i.n. administration of influenza virus (A/PR8/34; 120 p.f.u. per mouse) or recombinant human serotype 5 AdV (2 × 107 p.f.u. per mouse)11. In selected experiments, mice were infected with IAV at 360 p.f.u. per mouse. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and infected i.n. with 25 μl of virus preparation in PBS. Respiratory infection with extracellular bacteria was introduced by i.t. administration of S. pneumoniae serotype 3 (ATCC, 6303) resuspended in 40 μl of PBS at 2 × 107 or 5 × 107 colony-forming units (c.f.u.) per mouse as indicated. Growth of S. pneumoniae was assessed as previously described11. Briefly, frozen bacterial stock was plated on blood tryptic soy agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (YC Biotech) and 10 mg ml–1 neomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated overnight. Bacterial colonies were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Todd Hewitt broth (BD Biosciences).Mouse tumor modelsThe GFP-expressing B16F10 cell line (B16-GFP) was generated from luciferase-expressing B16F10 cells (B16-luc; ATCC, CRL-6475-LUC2) by transduction with lentiviral vector encoding GFP under the EF-1α promoter. B16F10 (B16; ATCC, CRL-6475), B16-luc and B16-GFP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Serana) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biosharp). A total of 5 × 105 B16 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and injected i.v. to establish lung melanoma or injected s.c. to the right flank. To establish a spontaneous lung metastasis model, 5 × 105 4T1 (ATCC, CRL-2539) cells resuspended in 100 μl of PBS were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad on the right side of BALB/c mice. The s.c. tumor volume was calculated as volume = (length × width2)/2. A maximal tumor size of 15 mm for the longest axis of the tumor was accepted and was always observed during this study.Luciferin-based in vivo tumor imagingMice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 150 mg kg–1 d-luciferin (Yeason Biotechnology). After injection, mice were placed on the imaging platform of an IVIS Spectrum imaging station (PerkinElmer) with continuous isoflurane inhalation. White light and luciferase activity were recorded for 40 s starting at 8 min after d-luciferin injection. Living Image software (PerkinElmer) was used for luciferase activity quantification.Lung macroscopic analysis and histopathologyLung lobes were collected between days 15 and 18 after tumor inoculation. Visible B16 tumor nodules on the surface of all lung lobes were counted under a JSZ8 dissection microscope (Jiangnan Novel Optics). In selected experiments, lung vascular perfusion was performed to remove erythrocytes for further immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections. Lung lobes were then either processed for frozen fixation or were paraffin embedded. Paraffin-embedded lung sections with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson’s Trichrome staining were scanned on a VS200 research slide scanner (Olympus) by using VS200 ASW software (Olympus) for further analysis.Confocal microscopyFrozen or paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin plus 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C for blocking, followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and on the following day with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Mounting was performed by using DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For staining of Siglec-F, anti-mouse Siglec-F (clone 1RNM44N, Thermo Fisher) was used as primary antibody, followed by staining with goat anti-rat AF488 (Thermo Fisher). Anti-mouse CD11c AF647 (clone N418, Biolegend) was used for CD11c staining. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss), and quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed using ImageJ software and ZEN Black imaging software (Zeiss). Z stack reconstruction was performed using Imaris software version 9.0.1 (Oxford Instruments).Isolation of cells from peripheral blood and lung tissuesCells from peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissues were isolated as previously described11. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and peripheral blood was exhaustively collected from the abdominal vein. Following exhaustive BAL with PBS, lung lobes were collected, cut into small pieces and digested in collagenase type I (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaker incubator. Lung single-cell suspensions were obtained by crushing the digested lung tissues through a 100-μm basket filter (BD Biosciences). Following erythrocyte lysis of peripheral blood and lung cells by incubation with red blood cell lysing buffer (SolarBio), cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in desired medium for further experiments.Flow cytometryImmunostaining and flow cytometry analyses were performed as previously described11. Briefly, single-cell suspensions from BAL, the lungs and peripheral blood were plated in U-bottom 96-well plates at ≤2 × 106 cells per well in PBS. Cells were stained with a Zombie Aqua fixable viability kit (Biolegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then washed and incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences, 1:200) in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min on ice and stained with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies, including anti-CD45 APC-Cy7 (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences, 1:400), anti-CD45.1 APC-Cy7 (clone A20, BD Biosciences, 1:200), anti-CD45.1 FITC (clone A20, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-CD45.2 PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone 104, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-CD11b PE-Cy7 (clone M1/70, BD Biosciences, 1:400), anti-CD11b BV605 (clone M1/70, Biolegend, 1:500), anti-CD11c APC (clone N418, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-CD11c PE-Cy7 (clone N418, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-I-A/I-E Alexa Fluor 700 (clone M5/114.15.2, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-CD3 V450 (clone 17A2, BD Biosciences, 1:200), anti-CD3 PE-CF594 (clone 17A2, Biolegend, 1:400), anti-CD49b PE (clone DX5, BD Bioscience, 1:400), anti-TCRα/TCRβ PE-Cy7 (clone H57-597, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-TCRγ/TCRδ FITC (clone GL3, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-CD45R V450 (clone RA3-6B2, BD Bioscience, 1:200), anti-F4/80 PE-Cy7 (clone BM8, Biolegend, 1:200), anti-Ly6C BV711 (clone HK1.4, Biolegend, 1:500), anti-Ly6G-BV650 (clone 1A8, Biolegend, 1:500), anti-CD24-BV605 (clone M1/69, Biolegend, 1:500), anti-CD64-PE (clone X54-5/7.1, BD Biosciences, 1:200), anti-Siglec-F PE-CF594 (clone E50-2440, BD Biosciences, 1:500), anti-CD4 PE-Cy7 (clone RM4-5, BD Biosciences, 1:200), anti-CD8-APC-Cy7 (clone 53-6.7, BD Bioscience, 1:400), anti-FcεR1a PE-Cy7(clone MAR-1, eBioscience, 1:200), anti-Gata3 PE (clone TWAJ, eBioscience, 1:200), Lin (anti-mouse CD3ε, clone 145-2C11; anti-mouse Ly6G/Ly6C, clone RB6-8C5; anti-mouse CD11b, clone M1/70; anti-mouse CD45R/B220, clone RA3-6B2; anti-mouse TER-119/erythroid cells, clone Ter-119, Biolegend; 1:200) and streptavidin Percp-Cy5.5 (eBioscience, 1:200). In selected experiments, cells were stained with Annexin V and PI (both from MultiSciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to measure cell death.For i.v. staining, 2 μg of anti-CD45 APC-Cy7 (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences) diluted in 100 μl of PBS was injected i.v. via the tail vein of anesthetized mice. Organs were collected 3 min after injection.For intracellular staining of IFNγ, lung cells were cultured ex vivo in the presence of BD GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) for 5 h, followed by cell surface staining as mentioned above. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with fixation/permeabilization buffer (Thermo Fisher) and washed twice with 1× permeabilization buffer (Thermo Fisher), followed by intracellular staining with anti-IFNγ APC (clone XMG1.2, Biolegend, 1:200) diluted in permeabilization buffer for 0.5 h at room temperature.To analyze in situ AM proliferation, i.p. administration of BrdU was performed repeatedly at designated time points after influenza virus infection at 0.5 mg per mouse per injection. Before infection or on days 9 and 11 after infection, BAL and lung cells from mice receiving BrdU were labeled with the above extracellular antibodies, followed by intracellular staining of BrdU by using an APC BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells stained with extracellular antibodies were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and incubated with BD Cytoperm Plus buffer. Cells were refixed with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm before treatment with DNase. Incorporated BrdU was then stained with a monoclonal antibody to BrdU-APC (clone B44, BD Biosciences, 1:50).Stained cells were analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer by using FACS Diva software (version 8.0.1, BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed and illustrated by using FlowJo software (version 10.7.1, BD Biosciences).Parabiotic mouse modelParabiotic surgery was conducted as previously described11. Briefly, the mirroring lateral sides of two age- and weight-matched anesthetized mice (CD45.1+ and CD45.2+, respectively) were shaved, and skin incisions from elbow to knee joints on the respective mirroring sides were made. The adjacent elbow and knee joints and the dorsal and ventral skin were respectively approximated by sutures. Carprofen and buprenorphine were administered i.p. on days 0 to 3 of surgery. Three weeks after surgery, both mice were treated with PBS or IAV i.n. as described above. On days 9 and 30 after viral infection, chimerisms in peripheral blood monocytes and lung macrophages were measured by flow cytometry analysis. Chimerism was respectively calculated as percent CD45.1+/(percent CD45.1+ + percent CD45.2+) in CD45.2+ mice and as percent CD45.2+/(percent CD45.2+ + percent CD45.1+) in CD45.1+ mice.BM transplantationTo generate BM chimeric mice, BM cells were collected from uninfected or day 30 IAV-infected CD45.1+ donor mice. A total of 2 × 106 BM cells were transplanted i.v. into lethally irradiated (8.5 Gy) naive syngeneic host mice (CD45.2+). Five weeks after transplantation, recipient mice were inoculated with B16-luc melanoma cells i.v. as described above.Purification, adoptive transfer and ex vivo stimulation of AMsPurification, adoptive transfer and ex vivo stimulation of AMs were performed as previously described11. To obtain purified AMs, BAL cells from naive or IAV-infected mice were labeled with CD11c microbeads (Miltenyi) followed by positive magnetic selection on a magnetic purification system (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified AMs were used for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, adoptive transfer or ex vivo cell culture experiments. For adoptive transfer experiments, pooled AMs from multiple mice from the same treatment group were resuspended at 1 × 106 AMs per recipient in 40 μl of PBS and were administered i.t. into isoflurane-anesthetized mice. For ex vivo stimulation of AMs, isolated AMs were stimulated with live S. pneumoniae (ATCC) at a multiplicity of infection of 10, as previously described11, or with LPS at 10 ng ml–1 and incubated for 12 h before supernatants were collected.Coculture of AMs and tumor cells for antitumor activity assayAMs were isolated as described above and were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate at 0.5 × 105 to 2 × 105 cells per well. Cells were incubated in a cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) for 2 h. B16-luc or B16-GFP tumor cells were seeded in AM culture wells at 1 × 104 cells per well. At 24, 48 or 72 h of coculture, cells in each well were lysed, and luciferase activity per well was measured by using a luciferase assay system (Yeason Biotechnology), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence measurements were performed on a SynergyMx M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Tumor cell survival was calculated and presented as percentage of normalized luminescence against tumor-only culture wells. In selected experiments, tumor cells were incubated with 10 μg ml–1 rat anti-mouse CD47 (clone Miap301, Biolegend) at 37 °C for 20 min before coculture with AMs. In transwell experiments, AMs and B16-luc cells were cocultured in 24-well tissue culture plates, and in selected wells, AMs were separated from tumor cells by using transwell inserts with a pore size of 0.4 μm (Corning). In selected experiments, AMs and B16-luc cells were cocultured in the presence of 20 μM etomoxir and/or 20 μM UK5099 (both from MedChemExpress).AM phagocytosis assayIsolated AMs were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate at 5 × 104 cells per well. B16-GFP cells were seeded in AM culture wells at 8 × 104 cells per well. At 24 h after coculture, cells were washed and detached using 0.25% trypsin for 10 min. Single-cell suspensions were collected and stained with anti-CD11c-APC (clone N418, Biolegend) to label AMs, followed by flow cytometry analysis.For fluorescence imaging assays, AMs were seeded in 35-mm glass-like polymer coverslip dishes at 4 × 105 cells per dish. After 2 h of culture in a cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2), AMs were labeled with 5 μM 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (Beyotime) according to manufacturer’s instructions. B16-GFP cells were then seeded in the culture dishes at 8 × 104 cells per dish. After a further 24 h of coculture, confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Multiple random fields were collected per replicate, and the number of phagocytic events was scored for each replicate.In vivo cell depletionsTo deplete CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in vivo, mice were injected i.p. with 200 μg of anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioXCell) and 200 μg of anti-CD8 (clone 2.43, BioXCell). To deplete NK cells, mice were injected i.p. with 200 μg of anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136, made in-house). To achieve continuous T cell or NK cell depletion, repeated doses of 100 μg of depleting antibodies were administered at 7-d intervals through the endpoint of the experiment. To deplete AMs in vivo, a single dose of clodronate liposomes or control liposomes (Liposoma Technology) was administered i.t. to mice at 100 μl per mouse in two split doses. To deplete circulating monocytes in vivo, mice receiving i.t. clodronate/control liposomes were injected i.v. with clodronate or control liposomes, respectively, at 100 μl per mouse per d at 5-d intervals starting from 2 d after the initial i.t. dose of liposomes to the endpoint of the experiment.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)ELISAs were performed by using mouse TNF, IFNγ, IL-6 and MIP-2 ABTS ELISA development kits (Peprotech) or a mouse IFNβ ELISA kit (InvivoGene), according to manufacturers’ instructions. ELISA plates were read on a SynergyMx M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Concentrations of cytokines/chemokines were calculated based on serial dilutions of standards by using GraphPad Prism software (version 9, GraphPad software).AM metabolic assaysReal-time cell metabolism of AMs was measured by using the Seahorse XF Cell Mito stress test kit or a Seahorse XF glycolytic stress test kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After culture alone or coculture with B16 melanoma cells for 48 h, AMs were collected and purified by positive selection using CD11c microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified AMs were then seeded into XF 96-well plates (Agilent Technologies) at 50,000 cells per well and cultured overnight in complete RPMI 1640 medium. The next day, AMs were washed and incubated for 1 h in Seahorse assay medium (Agilent Technologies) supplemented with either 2 mM glutamine (glycolytic stress test) or an additional 10 mM glucose and 1 mM pyruvate (mito stress test). The kit compounds were resuspended in assay medium, and the final concentrations of the compounds in culture wells were 1.5 μM oligomycin, 4 μM FCCP and 0.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A in the mito stress test or 10 mM glucose, 1 μM oligomycin and 50 mM 2-DG in the glycolytic stress test. OCRs and ECARs were measured on a Seahorse XFe96 analyzer (Agilent Technologies), and data were analyzed using Wave Desktop software (v2.6).Real-time quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–PCR)Total RNA was extracted from tissues using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher). RT–PCR was performed by using a PrimeScript RT master mix for RT–PCR, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TaKaRa). IAV in infected lungs was quantified by real-time PCR of the influenza NS1 gene in cDNA prepared from whole lung tissues. Quantification of B16 melanoma cells in organs was performed by real-time PCR of genes encoding premelanosome (Pmel), dopachrome tautomerase (Dct)34 and luciferase. The expression of genes was normalized to that of Actb. The following primer sequences were used (Tsingke Biotechnology): Pmel (forward: 5′-GCTTGTAGGTATCTTGCTGGTGTT-3′, reverse: 5′-CCTGCTTCTTAAGTCTATGCCTATG-3′), Dct (forward:5′-GGCTACAATTACGCCGTTG-3′, reverse: 5′-CACTGAGAGAGTTGTGGACCAA-3′), luciferase (forward: 5′-CACCGTCGTATTCGTGAGCA-3′, reverse: 5′-AGTCGTACTCGTTGAAGCCG-3′), NS1 (forward: 5′-GTCAAGCTTTCAGGTAGATTG-3′, reverse: 5′-CTCTTAGGGATTTCTGATCTC-3′) and Actb (forward: 5′-AGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′, reverse: 5′-GCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCGC-3′).RNA-seq and data analysisA total of 400,000 purified AMs per replicate were pelleted and lysed in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher) and cryopreserved at −80 °C, followed by RNA extraction. RNA quantification and qualification were performed using an N50 NanoPhotometer microvolume spectrophotometer (IMPLEN) and an RNA Nano 6000 assay kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing libraries were prepared using an NEBNext Ultra RNA library prep kit (New England Biolabs) following manufacturer’s recommendations, and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot cluster generation system using a TruSeq PE cluster kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq platform (Illumina).Raw RNA-seq fastq format data were processed through in-house Perl scripts, and clean data were obtained by removing reads containing adapter or poly(N) and low-quality reads from raw data. Reads were then mapped to mm10 RefSeq genes downloaded from the University of California Santa Cruz Table Browser using HISATt2 (v2.0.5). FeatureCounts (v1.5.0-p3) was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene. Fragments per kilobase per million base pairs sequenced values of each gene were calculated based on the length and read counts mapped to the gene. A principal-component analysis (PCA) plot was generated, and differential gene expression analysis was performed by using the DESeq2 (v1.34.0) package in R (v4.1.2). The resulting P values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg approach for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). An adjusted P value of <0.05 found by DESeq2 was used as the significance threshold for identification of differentially expressed genes. Volcano and heat map plots were created using the ggplot2 (v3.3.6) and pheatmap (v1.0.12) packages separately in R. GO enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes were performed using the clusterProfiler R package (v4.2.1). GO terms with corrected P values of <0.05 were considered significantly enriched. ClusterProfiler (v4.2.1) was used to test the statistical enrichment of differentially expressed genes in KEGG pathways. The local version of the GSEA analysis tool (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp), GO and the KEGG dataset were used for GSEA independently.ATAC-seq and data analysisA total of 50,000 purified AMs per replicate were washed once in cold PBS and resuspended in 50 µl of cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C, and nuclei were resuspended in 50 µl of transposition reaction mix (25 µl of TD buffer, 2.5 µl of Tn5 transposase and 22.5 µl of nuclease-free water; Illumina) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Transposed DNA fragments were purified by using a Qiagen Reaction MiniElute kit (Qiagen) barcoded with Nextera single indexes (New England Biolabs) and amplified by PCR for 11 cycles using NEBNext high fidelity 2× PCR master mix (New England Biolabs). PCR products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and amplified fragment size was verified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent). ATAC-seq libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina Novaseq6000 system (Novogene).Raw ATAC-seq fastq files from paired-end sequencing were trimmed by using Fastp (v0.19.11) followed by quality control using fastqc (v0.11.5). Clean data were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 reference genome using BWA (v0.7.12-r1039). Samtools (v1.11) was used to remove unmapped, unpaired and mitochondrial reads. PCR duplicates were removed by using Picard (v1.111). Peak calling was performed using MACS2 (v2.1.2, -q 0.05–call-summits–nomodel–shift −100–extsize 200–keep-dup all). For each experiment, peaks of all samples were combined to create a union peak list, and overlapping peaks were merged with BedTools (v2) merge. The number of reads in each peak was analyzed using DiffBind (v3.4). Differentially accessible peaks were identified following DESeq2 normalization using an FDR cutoff of <0.05. Tracks were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (v2.3.77, Broad Institute). Pearson correlations and PCAs between samples were calculated in R (DiffBind v3.4) and plotted. GO term enrichment was performed for each biological condition using clusterProfiler (v4.2.1). Statistical analysis of differential chromatin accessibility tests was done using DESeq2 (v1.34.0), and FDR correction was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg method in R (v4.1.2). Significance of GO term enrichments was calculated with binomial tests and hypergeometric tests. P values and q values of <0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference.Analysis of public human NSCLC scRNA-seq datasetscRNA-seq data of tumors from six individuals with NSCLC (ID numbers 371, 408, 570, 571, 328 and 393) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession code GSE154826. The Seurat package (v4.1.0) was used for count normalization. Samples were filtered for cell barcodes recording >500 unique molecular identifiers, with <25% mitochondrial gene expression. Batch integration was initiated using the Seurat function FindIntegrationAnchors(). Neighbor analysis was performed by invoking FindNeighbors() using the default k parameter of 20 and the first 40 principal components. Clustering was then performed with FindClusters() at a resolution of 2 (resulting in 42 clusters). A PCA was performed based on the scaled data with the top 2,000 highly variable genes, and the top 40 principal components were used for t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) construction. Cell-type marker genes were found using the FindConservedMarkers() function.Annotation of human NSCLC scRNA-seq clustersCell clusters were first annotated with SingleR (v1.8.1) BlueprintEncodeData() and confirmed by identifying differentially expressed marker genes for each cluster and comparing to known cell-type-specific marker genes from CellMarker (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker/). Macrophages (clusters 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 20, 23, 29, 36 and 41) expressed genes encoding CD14, CD68 and MRC1 and lacked PPARG. AMs (clusters 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and 20) expressed genes encoding PPARG, SERPINA1 and MRC1.Differential expression testing of human NSCLC scRNA-seq datasetDifferential expression between two sets of cells was performed using the FindMarkers function in the Seurat package (v4.1.0). GO and KEGG analyses of genes upregulated and downregulated in expression were performed using clusterProfiler (v4.2.1).Statistical analysisStatistical parameters, including the exact value of n, the definition of center, dispersion and precision measures and statistical significance, are reported in the figures and figure legends. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey test was performed to compare more than two groups. A log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used for comparison of survival curves. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 9, GraphPad software). The same samples were not repeatedly measured, and no data points were excluded from the analysis. The confidence interval was set at 95% for statistical analysis. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications7,11. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

View all partners Languages Bahasa Indonesia English Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The current epidemic of avian influenza has killed over 58 million birds in the U.S. as of February 2023. Following on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, large outbreaks of viruses like bird flu raise the specter of another disease jumping from animals into humans. This process is called spillover. I’m a veterinarian and a researcher who studies how diseases spread between animals and people. I was on the Colorado State University veterinary diagnostic team that helped detect some of the earliest cases of H5N1 avian influenza in U.S. birds in 2022. As this year’s outbreak of bird flu grows, people are understandably worried about spillover. Given that the next potential pandemic will likely originate from animals, it’s important to understand how and why spillover occurs – and what can be done to stop it. Viral spillover occurs when a virus spills out from an animal population into people. Treana Mayer/BioRender, CC BY-ND How spillover works Spillover involves any type of disease-causing pathogen, be it a virus, parasite or bacteria, jumping into humans. The pathogen can be something never before seen in people, such as a new Ebola virus carried by bats, or it could be something well known and recurring, like Salmonella from farm animals. The term spillover evokes images of a container of liquid overflowing, and this image is a great metaphor for how the process works. Imagine water being poured into a cup. If the water level keeps increasing, the water will flow over the rim, and anything nearby could get splashed. In viral spillover, the cup is an animal population, the water is a zoonotic disease capable of spreading from an animal to a person, and humans are the ones standing in the splash zone. The probability that a spillover will occur depends on many biological and social factors, including the rate and severity of animal infections, environmental pressure on the disease to evolve and the amount of close contact between infected animals and people. Epidemiologists estimate that three-quarters of all new infectious human diseases originated in animals. Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images Why spillover matters While not all animal viruses or other pathogens are capable of spilling over into people, up to three-quarters of all new human infectious diseases have originated from animals. There’s a good chance the next big pandemic risk will arise from spillover, and the more that’s known about how spillovers occur, the better chance there is at preventing it. Most spillover research today is focused on learning about and preventing viruses – including coronaviruses, like the one that causes COVID-19 and certain viral lineages of avian influenza – from jumping into humans. These viruses mutate very quickly, and random changes in their genetic code could eventually allow them to infect humans. Spillover events can be hard to detect, flying under the radar without leading to bigger outbreaks. Sometimes a virus that transfers from animals to humans poses no risk to people if the virus is not well adapted to human biology. But the more often this jump occurs, the higher the chances a dangerous pathogen will adapt and take off. Spillover is becoming more likely Epidemiologists are projecting that the risk of spillover from wildlife into humans will increase in coming years, in large part because of the destruction of nature and encroachment of humans into previously wild places. Because of habitat loss, climate change and changes in land use, humanity is collectively jostling the table that is holding up that cup of water. With less stability, spillover becomes more likely as animals are stressed, crowded and on the move. As housing and farmland expand into wild places, the risk of spillover increases. Cavan/Getty Images As development expands into new habitats, wild animals come into closer contact with people – and, importantly, the food supply. The mixing of wildlife and farm animals greatly amplifies the risk that a disease will jump species and spread like wildfire among farm animals. Poultry across the U.S. are experiencing this now, thanks to a new form of avian flu that experts think spread to chicken farms mostly through migrating ducks. Current risk from bird flu The new avian influenza virus is a distant descendant of the original H5N1 strain that has caused human epidemics of bird flu in the past. Health officials are detecting cases of this new flu virus jumping from birds to other mammals – like foxes, skunks and bears. On Feb. 23, 2023, news outlets began reporting a few confirmed infections of people in Cambodia, including one infection leading to the death of an 11-year-old girl. While this new strain of bird flu can infect people in rare situations, it isn’t very good at doing so, because it is not able to bind to cells in human respiratory tracts very effectively. For now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinks there is low risk to the general public. Active monitoring of wild animals, farm animals and humans will allow health officials to detect the first sign of spillover and help prevent a small viral splash from turning into a large outbreak. Moving forward, researchers and policymakers can take steps to prevent spillover events by preserving nature, keeping wildlife wild and separate from livestock and improving early detection of novel infections in people and animals.

It also reduced the chance of hospitalization from Influenza A — the virus that causes flu pandemics — in children by nearly three-quarters, and in adults by nearly half, the CDC said in a press release. "These data underscore that flu vaccination can offer substantial benefit against flu and its potentially serious complications," the agency said.One of the referenced studies in the presentation determined that the influenza vaccine was 45% effective among children against the predominant virus. In comparison, during previous seasons, this rate has been about 30%, the CDC wrote. Additionally, vaccinated children were 68% less likely to be hospitalized, and 48% less likely to visit an emergency department due to a flu or flu-related sickness, the CDC found.In a similar trend, adults overall were 44% less likely to visit an emergency department and 39% less likely to be hospitalized for a flu-related illness or complication. In comparison, adults were just 25% less likely to be hospitalized or visit emergency departments and urgent cares during the 2021-2022 season with the last vaccine.Researchers emphasized the effectiveness of the vaccine among people above 65 years of age and the immunocompromised population, two groups that are more likely to get a more severe illness from the flu and less likely to have an immune response to the vaccine. The 2022-2023 flu season peaked in November and early December, when the percent of positive tests hit about 26%. The percent of positive cases is now at approximately 1.7%. Influenza-related hospitalizations have also leveled. While the number of flu patients has gone down, the CDC noted that this season's influenza activity was higher and more damaging than it was in the previous two seasons. In fact, there were 111 influenza-associated deaths among children. Flu Season More When should you get the flu shot? A doctor weighs in on best timing, options.

What is the extent of the current outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in birds? Like much of the rest of the world, the United States continues to experience outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus in wild birds and poultry. HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been circulating among birds and poultry in different parts of the world for many years and continuing to evolve into different groups that are referred to as clades. The current clade of H5N1 virus, called clade 2.3.4.4b, appears well-adapted to spread efficiently among wild birds and poultry in many regions of the world and was first identified in wild birds in the United States in January 2022. Since then, this current clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in wild birds in all 50 states and has caused bird outbreaks in 47 states affecting more than 58 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks. What about H5N1 virus among humans? Seven sporadic human cases associated with poultry exposures during this outbreak of contemporary HPAI A(H5N1) viruses have been reported globally since January 2022, one of which was identified in the United States. In four of these cases, no respiratory symptoms were reported. It is possible that some of these cases did not represent virus infection but rather detection of non-infectious H5N1 virus genetic material in respiratory specimens following prolonged exposure to infected birds. In three cases, severe disease occurred, including one death. No human-to-human spread of H5N1 virus was identified in any of these cases. Sporadic human infections with contemporary H5N1 viruses are not surprising, especially among people who do not take recommended precautions (such as wearing personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection, for example). Since 1997, more than 880 human cases, nearly all from previously circulating H5N1 virus clades, have been reported from 21 countries with high mortality, but very few cases have been identified worldwide since 2016. A small number of sporadic human infections with H5N1 virus does not change the risk to the general public, which CDC currently considers to be low. What about H5N1 virus among mammals? Although H5N1 viruses primarily infect different types of wild birds and domestic poultry, H5N1 viruses also can infect other animals. Sporadic H5N1 virus infections of mammals have been reported for more than 20 years in different countries that have experienced H5N1 outbreaks in poultry or wild birds. H5N1 viruses can infect mammals that are exposed to environments with a high concentration of virus or that eat (presumably infected) sick or dead birds or poultry, including but not limited to wild or feral animals such as foxes; stray or domestic animals such as cats and dogs; and zoo animals such as tigers and leopards. Recently, sporadic H5N1 virus infections in different mammals, including bears, wild foxes, and skunks, have been reported in Canada, the United States, and other countries, including mink in Spain and sea lions in Peru. Reports of sporadic H5N1 virus infections of predatory and scavenger mammals are not unexpected given widespread H5N1 virus infections in wild birds worldwide. Minks Does the detection of H5N1 viruses in farmed mink change the assessment of the risk to human health? No. CDC and other partner agencies have characterized the H5N1 viruses from farmed mink detected in Spain and have not found any indications that would point to increased ability to infect humans. H5N1 viruses do not currently have an ability to easily infect the human upper respiratory tract, which would be needed to increase the risk of transmission to people. Although it is uncommon, H5N1 viruses can bind to receptors in the human lower respiratory tract. Mink have been shown to have two different kinds of cell receptors in their respiratory tracts, one kind of which allows for more efficient infection with H5N1 viruses. As a result, mink are much more susceptible to H5N1 virus infection than people. If there were mink-to-mink spread of H5N1 virus (for example in the outbreak in Spain), would that change the assessment of the risk to human health? No. While there was a genetic marker in the H5N1 viruses detected during the outbreak in mink in Spain that may have resulted in more severe disease in mink and potentially easier mink-to-mink transmission, this marker is unlikely to make it easier for infection to transmit to humans. Besides this marker, the genomic sequence of the H5N1 viruses isolated from mink was very similar to H5N1 viruses found in birds. Humans lack the type of cell receptor in the upper respiratory tract that H5N1 viruses use to cause infection. Mink, on the other hand, have two different kinds of cell receptors in their respiratory tracts, one kind of which allows for easier infection with H5N1 viruses. As a result, mink are more susceptible to infection with H5N1 viruses than people, and limited mink-to-mink spread of H5N1 virus, especially in an environment with close contact among animals, would not be surprising. What is CDC doing to monitor these viruses in people? CDC's existing influenza surveillance systems are well-equipped to rapidly detect cases of avian influenza A virus infection, including H5N1 virus, in people. Influenza virus detection assays, which can detect both seasonal and novel influenza A viruses, are used in 128 public health laboratories in all 50 U.S states and 170 laboratories globally. Additionally, there are diagnostic assays to specifically detect the current H5N1 viruses available at 99 public health laboratories in all 50 U.S. states and 129 international laboratories, representing 116 countries. CDC, along with our state and local public health partners, also continues to actively monitor people who have been exposed to infected birds and poultry for 10 days after exposure. To date, public health departments have monitored more than 6,200 people in 52 jurisdictions who were exposed to birds/poultry infected with H5N1 virus and reported this information to CDC. Of these, 161 people who were being monitored showed symptoms and subsequently were tested for novel influenza A and seasonal influenza viruses along with other respiratory viruses. H5N1 virus genetic material was only detected in a respiratory specimen from one person in Colorado who experienced fatigue from participating in poultry culling activities and was likely not infected with the virus. Other agencies are responsible for monitoring for disease in poultry and wild birds and wildlife. Other Questions Why doesn't this virus appear to spread from human-to-human? H5N1 viruses currently circulating in wild birds and causing poultry outbreaks are well-adapted to spread among birds. However, these H5N1 bird flu viruses do not have the ability to easily bind to receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans, or to transmit among people. Is it possible this virus will cause the next pandemic? We cannot predict when the next influenza pandemic will occur or what virus will cause the next pandemic. The origin of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus may have been an avian influenza A virus. The 1957 H2N2 pandemic influenza virus and the 1968 H3N2 pandemic influenza virus both resulted from a combination of genes from human and low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus resulted from a combination of genes from human, avian, and swine influenza A viruses and is believed to have emerged from pigs to transmit among people. There are many kinds of avian influenza A viruses and swine influenza A viruses that have sporadically infected people worldwide. Therefore, constant vigilance and ongoing surveillance for novel influenza viruses worldwide is needed in people and animals – especially in poultry and pigs. Is there a vaccine to prevent bird flu infection in humans? An H5 candidate vaccine virus (CVV) recently produced by CDC is nearly identical or, in many samples, identical to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of recently detected clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses in birds and mammals (including the mink outbreak) and could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed, and would provide good protections against the circulating H5N1 viruses. This H5 CVV is available and has been shared with vaccine manufacturers. Is there treatment available for people who get sick with bird flu? People with avian influenza A virus infection are recommended to be treated as soon as possible with antiviral drugs that are FDA-approved for treatment of seasonal influenza. Such antiviral drugs include oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir. Antiviral treatment works best when started as soon as symptoms begin. For patients who require hospitalization, antiviral treatment with oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible, and clinical management is focused on supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support in an intensive care unit for patients with severe pneumonia. Should the general public be worried about H5N1? The current public health threat to people from H5N1 virus is low. The current H5N1 outbreak in poultry and birds continues to be mostly an animal health issue. However, people should avoid direct and close contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, and wild animals. People should not consume uncooked or undercooked poultry or poultry products, including raw eggs. Consuming properly cooked poultry, poultry products, and eggs is safe.

Back to Healio Preliminary estimates published in MMWR and presented by the CDC indicate that this season’s influenza vaccine offered significant protection among all ages. According to the CDC, the influenza season started early in the United States, reaching epidemic levels in October for the first time since 2009. Activity also peaked unusually early, during the week ending Dec. 3, 2022. Data derived from McLean HQ, et al, and Olson S, et al. About 75% of infections have been caused by influenza A(H3N2), which is typically associated with more severe illness, including in children. As of Feb. 11, there have been 111 influenza-related deaths in U.S. children this season, the most since the COVID-19 pandemic started, according to the CDC. Most of the deaths occurred in unvaccinated children. The components of season’s vaccine appeared to be a good match for circulating influenza viruses, according to findings published in MMWR by Huong Q. McLean, PhD, MPH, a research scientist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Marshfield, Wisconsin, and colleagues. McClean and colleagues produced estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness from two concurrent studies conducted at the Marshfield Clinic from Oct. 23, 2022, through Feb. 10. According to their report, the vaccine was 54% effective against medically attended outpatient acute respiratory illness caused by influenza among patients aged 6 months to 64 years. In a cohort of children, the vaccine was 71% effective against symptomatic influenza. Adults aged 65 years and older were excluded from the test-negative, case-control study, but other preliminary data from three U.S. networks presented during a meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices this week provided estimates for this age group. Data from 23 U.S. sites showed that, among all adults, the vaccine has been 43% effective this season. Vaccine effectiveness at these sites was found to be higher among adults aged 18 to 64 years (51%) than adults aged 65 years or older (35%), and it was 44% in immunocompromised adults. Similar data were reported from EDs and urgent care centers in the West and Upper Midwest, where the vaccine was found to be 44% effective overall among all adults, including 46% effective in adults aged younger than age 65 years and 39% effective in older adults. Vaccine effectiveness among immunocompromised patients at these sites was 30%. Hospitals in the same network reported that the vaccine was 39% effective among all adults and 29% effective among younger adults, 41% effective among older adults and 31% effective among immunocompromised patients. According to other data submitted by seven U.S. hospitals, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalization and emergency department visits among children was 49% this season, including 68% against hospitalization alone. Vaccination was more effective against influenza A(H1N1) than H3N2, 56% to 45%, data showed. References: CDC. FluView. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm. Updated Feb. 17, 2023.

UnsubscribeConcerns About Human Transmission Of Avian Flu Following Death Of Cambodian Girl - Health Policy Watch Skip to content menu Home About Us Search for: Search for: Antimicrobial Resistance Infectious Diseases Pandemics & Emergencies Non-Communicable Diseases Health, Climate & SDGs Search for: Search for: Concerns about Human Transmission of Avian Flu Following Death of Cambodian Girl Disease Surveillance 24/02/2023 • Stefan Anderson Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window) The death of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has sparked new worries about the potential for human transmission of deadly avian influenza (H5N1). World Health Organization (WHO) officials have sounded alarm bells following the death of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia from the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the first such death in the country in nearly 10 years. At least 12 people in Cambodia have now been tested for infection with H5N1 following the girl’s death, WHO officials said at a press briefing on Friday. WHO officials said the organization was in direct contact with Cambodian public health authorities at the time of the briefing. Cambodia is closely watching the girl’s father, who was also infected, as well as her other contacts, in an effort to determine if person-to person transmission of the deadly virus may have occurred. The H5N1 strain of Avian influenza has only occasionally infected humans, and mostly as a result of animal-to-human contact. But public health officials have long been concerned that a new strain of the virus, harbored by poultry and other birds around the world, could eventualy emerge that is more easily transmissible between people. ‘Worrying’ says WHO official “The situation is worrying,” said Dr Sylvie Briand, WHO’s director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention. The press conference was supposed to provide an update on the composition of seasonal flu vaccines, but was largely taken over by concerns about the more deadly and unpredictable H5N1 pathogen. The virus has had a fatality rate of over 53% among the 868 cases recorded worldwide between 2003 and November 2022. But so far documented cases of human-to-human transmission have been exceedingly rare, and there is no evidence of sustained human transmission of the virus, according to WHO officials. “So far, it is too early to know if it’s human-to-human transmission or exposure to the same environmental conditions,” Briand said. Case in Cambodia follows one in China last year The case in Cambodia follows a similar case of H5N1 in China in September 2022, also in an infected girl who ultimately succumbed to the virus. It was the first case of avian influenza to be recorded in China since 2015. The disease is spreading rapidly among bird populations. Since the start of last year, over 200 million birds worldwide were culled or died as a result of the disease, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Genomic sequence not yet known, but vaccines are on hand The genomic sequence of the exact strain that infected the girl is still unknown. But it is most likely one of two clades, said Dr Richard Webby, Director of WHO’s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals. The two dominant clades of the virus reported by Cambodian authorities in recent years include Clade 2344B, which has ravaged bird flocks across Europe, Africa and the Americas, and Clade 2321C, circulating in Cambodia and the surrounding South Asia region. Many of the tools needed to respond to the H5N1 threat already exist, including multiple vaccines and antivirals, said Dr Wenqing Zhang, Head of WHO’s Global Influenza Programme at the briefing. He said that in addition to five vaccines, nearly 20 products are licensed for pandemic use. WHO has recommended an update the existing reference vaccine, which will begin production in the coming weeks. While it will take some time before the newest vaccine is deployed, Zhang said the vaccines contained in pre-existing international stockpiles built up after an H5N1 outbreak in 2003 stoked fears of a pandemic, have also produced promising clinical trial results against circulating strains. If an outbreak occurs, “there is going to be a period of time when the perfectly matching vaccine won’t be available,” Webby said. “That’s when the stockpiled vaccines could perhaps come into play and probably offer offer protection from more severe disease.” But Webby noted that the trials were not definitive proof of real world efficacy. “We need to separate in vitro reactivity of people’s antibodies from vaccine effectiveness,” he said.

Most studies have focused on the microbiota of single mucosal surfaces; consequently, the relationships between microbiota at different anatomic sites in IAV-infected mice have not been fully studied. Methods: We characterized respiratory and gut microbiota using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing by Nanopore sequencers and compared the nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, lung and gut microbiomes in healthy and IAV-infected mice. Results: The oropharyngeal, lung and gut microbiota of healthy mice were dominated by Lactobacillus spp., while nasopharyngeal microbiota were comprised primarily of Streptococcus spp. However, the oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, lung, and gut microbiota of IAV-infected mice were dominated by Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and Muribaculum spp., respectively. Lactobacillus murinus was identified as a biomarker and was reduced at all sites in IAV-infected mice. The microbiota composition of lung was more similar to that of the nasopharynx than the oropharynx in healthy mice. Discussion: These findings suggest that the main source of lung microbiota in mice differs from that of adults. Moreover, the similarity between the nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota was increased in IAV-infected mice. We found that IAV infection reduced the similarity between the gut and oropharyngeal microbiota. L. murinus was identified as a biomarker of IAV infection and may be an important target for intervention in post-influenza bacterial superinfections. Introduction The risk of a novel influenza A virus (IAV) pandemic looms as a major global public health threat (Iuliano et al., 2018). Secondary bacterial infection following influenza is a prevalent cause of severe pneumonia and death (McCullers, 2014). The normal host microbiome resists colonization by pathogens through niche competition and host immune regulation, and plays an important role in post-influenza bacterial superinfection (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2019). The intestinal microbiome includes 1014 bacteria representing 1,000 species, which are closely related to host metabolism, immunity and mental health (Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). Patients with IAV infection exhibited significantly decreased diversity and abundance of gut microbiota, including a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Actinomycetes and Firmicutes at the phylum level and anaerobic butyrate-producing bacteria (Racinobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae) at the family level (Gu et al., 2020). Intestinal dysbiosis dysregulates host CD4+ and CD8+ T cell generation and antibody response, and aggravates IAV-induced lung pathology (Ichinohe et al., 2011). In addition to the gut microbiome, respiratory microbiota also plays an important role in IAV infection. Due to differences in anatomy and development, the human respiratory tract can be divided into the upper and lower respiratory tracts (URT and LRT, respectively). IAV infection can significantly alter the URT microbiome, including oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal microbiota. For example, IAV-infected children had lower abundance of Moraxella, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Duchenne spp. in the nasopharynx, and Streptococcus, Neisseria and Hemophilus spp. in the oropharynx than healthy children (Wen et al., 2018). In healthy adults, lung microbiota originates primarily from the oropharynx by direct mucosal dispersion and micro-aspiration (Bassis et al., 2015). A murine model demonstrated that IAV infection induced a long-term LRT dysbiosis that featured a clear shift from Alphaproteobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria and a significant increase in the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. (Gu et al., 2019). Although multiple studies have characterized the changes of respiratory tract and gut microbiota after IAV infection, most have focused on specific anatomic sites. Correlations between URT, LRT and gut microbiota during IAV infection have not been studied fully. In addition, due to the read length limitation of second-generation sequencing, few species-level studies of host dysbiosis during IAV infection have been conducted. To further understand the changes and correlation between URT, LRT and gut microbiota during IAV infection, we performed full length 16sRNA gene sequencing of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, lung and gut microbiota using Nanopore sequencing technology in a murine model. We found that IAV infection altered the microbiota structures of the URT, LRT and gut. The lung microbiota was more similar to nasopharyngeal than oropharyngeal microbiota in healthy mice. However, the similarity between nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota deceased during IAV-infection. We also observed that IAV infection reduced the similarity between gut and oropharyngeal microbiota. In addition, we found representative species responses to IAV infection. For example, IAV infection decreased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus murinus in the respiratory tract and gut. Materials and methods Animal model and sample collection Twenty C57BL/6 N female mice (6 weeks of age) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (China) and adapted in specific pathogen-free conditions (5 mice/cage) for 1 week. Mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10): a PBS mock infected (Mock) group and an IAV-infected (IAV) group. To establish a murine model of IAV infection, mice of the IAV group were anesthetized with 0.3% pentobarbital sodium (intraperitoneal injection, 50 mg/kg) and infected intranasally with 25 μl sterile PBS containing strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (60 PFU). Control mice were mock infected with 25 μl sterile PBS. One nasal drip experiment for each mouse. All mice in the IAV group and Mock group were infected in the same day. All mice had access to water and food under a strict 12 h light/dark cycle. All animal procedures for animal raising and handling were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Chinese PLA Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All animals were euthanized with 0.3% pentobarbital sodium (intraperitoneal injection, 150 mg/kg) on post-infection day-4. After weighing the fresh lungs, left lungs were stored at-80°C and right lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The lung index was calculated with the formula: lung index = [(lung weight/g)/(bodyweight/g)] × 100% (Gao et al., 2020). Nasopharyngeal lavage fluid (NLF) was collected as reported previously (Puchta et al., 2014). Oropharyngeal samples were collected using swabs and placed in 1 ml sterile PBS at 4°C. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by washing the bronchoalveolar tree three times using 1 ml sterile PBS. Fecal samples were collected and stored at-80°C for further experiments. Hematoxylin and eosin staining Fresh right lung tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Prepared embedded lung tissues were cut into 3–5 μm-thick sections and stained with H&E. Pathological scores were evaluated as reported previously (Renne et al., 2009). Nucleic acid extraction and qPCR Bacterial genomic DNA of fresh NLF, BALF and oropharyngeal swabs was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Total RNA of fresh NLF, BALF and oropharyngeal swabs was extracted using QIAamp® MinElute® Virus Spin (QIAGEN, Germany). Genomic DNA and total RNA of fecal samples were extracted using AllPrep® PowerFecal® DNA/RNA Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). A control extraction with no sample was performed for each kit. IAV titers of NLF, BALF, oropharyngeal swab and fecal samples were assayed with Luna® Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB, United States). The following primers were used: 5’-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3′ (Forward primer), 5’-GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG-3′ (Reverse primer) and 5’-FAM-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-BHQ1-3′ (Probe). Copies of IAV were calculated using the standard curve method. Full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics pipeline Genomic DNA of NLF, BALF, oropharyngeal swab and fecal samples was used for full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition to the samples, library preparation contained a negative control (Control extraction with no sample) and a positive control (mock community). PCR reactions were conducted using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, United States) and 0.5 μM of Universal-27F (5′- TTTCTGTTGGTGCT GATATTGCAGAGTTTGAT CCTGGCTCAG-3′) and Universal-1492R (5′- ACTTGCC TGTCGCTCTATCTTCTACGACTTAACCCCAATCGC-3′). Cycling conditions were set as 95°C for 3 min; 10 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min; and 72°C for 5 min. The amplification products were purified using 0.8 × AgencourtAMPure XP Beads (Beckman, United States). Cleaned DNA was barcoded and pooled using PCR Barcoding Expansion Pack 1–96 (EXP-PBC096; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom). A library was prepared for sequencing using Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom) and sequenced on the MinION Mk1B (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom) with R10 flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom). Raw reads were base-called and demultiplexed using Guppy (V 5.0.11+) to obtain high-quality reads with min_score = 8. The filtered reads were within a size range of 1.2–1.8 kb. Read numbers and mapping rates for each sample are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Emu software was used to estimates species composition distribution based on the Emu v3.0 + database (Curry et al., 2022). Alpha diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices) and Bray Curtis Distance were calculated by R package vegan (v2.5.7). The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was formed by R package ape (v5.6.2). Functional composition and KEGG pathway abundance of microbiota was predicted using PICRUST2 software (Douglas et al., 2022). LEfse analysis was used to identify biomarkers by comparing abundance between groups (Wilcoxon test p < 0.01 and |log10(LDA)| >3). Statistics Body weight, IAV titer and histologic scoring were analyzed with unpaired t tests. Shannon index, Chao1 index and bacterial taxa abundance among groups were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney test. ***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05. Results IAV induced severe respiratory tract infection and lung injury To validate our murine infection model, we compared body weight, IAV titer and lung pathology between mock and IAV groups. A significant increase in lung index but a significant decrease in body weight were observed in the IAV group compared to the mock group (Figure 1A). We also observed significantly increased IAV titers in the oropharynx, nasopharynx, lung and fecal samples of the IAV group and found the highest IAV titers in the lung (Figure 1B). H&E staining showed that pulmonary injury was induced by IAV infection and featured alveolar wall thickening (Yellow arrow), mononuclear cell infiltration (Black arrows) and bronchial epithelial cell injury (Red arrow). The mean histologic score of the IAV group was significantly higher than that of the mock group (Figure 1C). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Pathological difference between mock-and IAV-infected mice.

IAV infection altered the composition of respiratory tract microbial communities The diversity (Shannon diversity index) and richness (Chao1 index) of the oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota were similar between the two groups (Figure 2A). PCoA analysis showed clearly different oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal microbiota in IAV group compared with the mock group; however, lung microbiota structures were not significantly different (Figure 2B; Supplementary Figures S1A,B,C). FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Respiratory tract dysbiosis during IAV infection. (A) Shannon diversity and Chao1 indices of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota. (B) 2D-PCoA plots of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota. Relative abundance of the top 10 bacteria at the phylum and genus levels (C). Shannon and Chao1 indices were analyzed with Mann–Whitney test. *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. n = 10 per group. We further examined taxonomic profiles at different classification levels. The most prominent phyla of all samples in the mock group were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, while the IAV group had a relatively reduced abundance of Firmicutes but increased abundance of Proteobacteria in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. However, these changes were not observed in the lung. At the genus level, Lactobacillus was most abundant in oropharynx and lung, whereas Streptococcus was predominant in the nasopharynx of the mock group. However, the IAV group exhibited different dominant genera at all locations. Pseudomonas was dominant in the oropharynx, whereas Escherichia was most abundant in nasopharynx and Streptococcus was predominant in the lung (Figure 2C). We also investigated species-level changes of respiratory tract microbiota during IAV infection. For the mock group, L. murinus was predominant in oropharynx and lung, whereas Streptococcus respiraculi was most abundant in nasopharynx. For the IAV group, Pseudomonas fluorescens was predominant in oropharynx, Escherichia coli was predominant in nasopharynx, whereas Streptococcus respiraculi was most abundant in lung (Figure 3A). The metabolic function prediction of microbiota showed that IAV infection decreased D-glutamine, D-glutamate and D-Alanine metabolism in the oropharynx and reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis in the nasopharynx, while increasing pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis in the lung (Figure 3B). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Characterization of species-level bacteria and functional composition of respiratory tract microbiota during IAV infection.

(B) Top 10 significantly altered metabolic pathways of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota between mock and IAV groups. Pathway abundance prediction by PICRUSt2. n = 10 per group. The relative abundance on the x-axis represents the ratio of the corresponding functional abundance to all predicted functional abundances. Comparison of microbiota structures of respiratory tract sites during IAV infection We found that the lung microbiota was more similar to nasopharyngeal than oropharyngeal microbiota in the mock group. Moreover, the similarity between lung and nasopharyngeal microbiota was increased in the IAV group compared to the mock group (Figure 4A). These results suggest that IAV infection increased the influence of nasopharyngeal microbiota on lung microbiota. We screened the species with significant differences between the IAV group and the mock group by the Mann–Whitney test and showed the changes at each location on the heat map. Compared with respective locations in mock group, the oropharynx showed a significant difference of 18 species, the nasopharynx displayed a significant difference of 7 species and the lung exhibited a significant difference of 13 species. We identified some species with synchronous alterations at multiple respiratory tract locations in response to IAV infection. For example, compared with mock group, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus animalis, Lactobacillus johnsonii and L. murinus decreased, while the relative abundance of Enterococcus faecalis increased in the oropharynx, nasopharynx and lungs in IAV group. In addition, we found that some species of the URT and LRT responded differently to IAV infection. For example, the relative abundance of S. danieliae, S. respiraculi and Streptococcus suis decreased in the URT but increased in the LRT in the IAV group (Figure 4B). FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Comparison of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota during IAV infection. (A) Similarity analysis of the microbiota of different locations in the IAV and mock groups. (B) Distribution of significantly different species between mock and IAV groups in different sampling locations. Shannon and Chao1 indices among different sampling locations were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney test. Similarity of microbiota of different locations was analyzed with ANOSIM. Bacterial taxa abundance between mock and IAV group was also analyzed with the Mann–Whitney test. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. n = 10 per group. IAV infection reduced the similarity between oropharyngeal and gut microbiota IAV infection significantly increased the diversity (Shannon diversity index) and richness (Chao1 index) of gut microbiota (Figure 5A). Beta diversity showed that IAV infection strongly influenced the gut microbiota, as results of the mock and IAV groups clustered away from each other (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure S1D). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant gut bacteria in both the IAV and mock groups. However, IAV infection resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes in gut. At the genus level, IAV infection caused a decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and an increase in the relative abundance of Muribaculum and Parasutterella (Figure 5C). LEfSe analysis to identify species-level bacteria associated with IAV infection identified 7 species that were differentially abundant between the mock and IAV groups. Lactobacillus intestinalis, Lactobacillus reuteri, L. animalis, L. johnsonii, Helicobacter japonicus and L. murinus were enriched in the mock group, while Parasutterella excrementihominis was significantly more abundant in IAV group (Figure 5D). The metabolic function prediction of microbiota showed that IAV infection decreased D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism in gut (Figure 5E). Considering the habitual coprophagy of mice, we analyzed the correlation between gut microbiota and oropharyngeal microbiota in mock and IAV groups and found that the diversity and richness of the gut microbiota were significantly higher than those of the oropharynx in both the IAV and mock groups (Figure 6A). In addition, the oropharyngeal microbiota was more similar to the gut microbiota in mock group than in the IAV group (Figure 6B). We observed the same changes in the relative abundance of some species in the gut and oropharynx after IAV infection. For example, the relative abundance of L. murinus, L. reuteri, L. animalis and L. johnsonii were decreased, while the relative abundance of Phocaeicola sartorii increased in both gut and oropharynx in IAV group (Figure 6C).

Discussion IAV infection can alter respiratory tract and gut microbiota (Lv et al., 2021; Rattanaburi et al., 2022). As murine models are the most commonly used in vivo systems in influenza research, many experiments have described long-or short-term dysbiosis in IAV-infected mice (Yildiz et al., 2018; Sencio et al., 2021). However, most studies have focused on a single mucosal surface, and have rarely studied the association of microbiota among multiple locations systematically. Therefore, we compared the respiratory and gut microbiota of normal and IAV-infected mice using full-length 16srRNA gene sequencing and analyzed the correlation of microbiota among different anatomic sites in normal and infected mice. As expected, we successfully established a murine IAV infection model. Previous murine studies have reported that influenza infection decreases body weight and increases lung index (An et al., 2018; Ling et al., 2020). We observed the same results in our experiments. In addition to the respiratory tract, we also detected IAV in the feces of the IAV-infected group. Concordant with our results, virus was also identified in fecal samples from IAV/IBV-infected patients (Hirose et al., 2016). Our histopathologic findings of robust leukocytic infiltration and edema in IAV-infected lung tissue were also observed in a previous study and were associated with protease-activated receptor 4 (Kim et al., 2021). The respiratory tract is complex, and each segment has its own unique microbiota, which respond similarly or differently to IAV infection. In this study, species diversity and richness of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and pulmonary microbiota in IAV-infected mice were similar to those of normal mice. Consonant with our findings, several studies have shown no significant changes in microbial diversity and richness in the URT and LRT of IAV-infected mice (Planet et al., 2016; Yildiz et al., 2018). However, the composition of the microbiota of the different sites responded differently to IAV infection. The reduction of relative abundance of L. murinus at all three respiratory tract sites may have altered host immune response and may have also reduced colonization resistance, as evidenced by the increased relative abundance of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal P. fluorescens. L. murinus belong to Lactobacillus genus which induces Th17 and RORγt+ regulatory T cells and reduces pulmonary inflammation in tuberculosis (Bernard-Raichon et al., 2021). Moreover, L. murinus provides a barrier against pneumococcal colonization in a respiratory dysbiosis model (Yildiz et al., 2020). P. fluorescens belongs to Pseudomonadales, which typically subsist at low levels in the indigenous microbiota of various body sites, but are related to cystic fibrosis, chronic airway diseases, asthma and non-cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis (Scales et al., 2014). The relative abundance of Pseudomonadales also increased in the URT of IAV-infected patients (Kaul et al., 2020). Interestingly, we found that the relative abundance of S. danieliae was increased in the URT and decreased in the LRT. S. danieliae is a major component of the URT microbiome of healthy mice and is involved in the establishment of oral microbiota (Joseph et al., 2021). However, oral administration of Staphylococcus aureus and S. danieliae aggravated experimental psoriasis in a murine model (Okada et al., 2020). There have been few other reports of S. danieliae to date. Our research showed that the lung microbiota was more like that of the nasopharynx than the oropharynx, which suggests that the nasopharynx may serve as the primary reservoir of lung microbiota in mice. In contrast, the oropharynx is the origin of lung microbiota in human adults (Bassis et al., 2015). The nasopharyngeal microbiota is most similar to the lung microbiota in healthy cattle (McMullen et al., 2020). Moreover, IAV infection increased the similarity between nasopharyngeal and lung microbiota in this study. This may have been related to host innate and adaptive immune responses to IAV (Liong et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). IAV infection can decrease the species diversity of gut microbiota in H7N9-infected humans (Qin et al., 2015). However, our results showed that IAV infection increased intestinal species diversity in mice. This could be due to different viral strains, host responses, or sample collection methods. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. (L. intestinalis, L. reuteri, L. animalis, L. johnsonii and L. murinus) was decreased in IAV-infected mice. Considering the absolute abundance can be estimated from the sequencing counts (Yang et al., 2022), we also evaluated the absolute abundance of Lactobacillus in the genus and species levels between the IAV and Mock groups, and found that change of Lactobacillus was consistent in the absolute and relative abundance (Supplementary Table S2). In general, the decreased abundance of Lactobacillus species may be an important phenomenon of IAV infection. Lactobacillus plays an important role in anti-viral immunity. For example, a previous study showed that Lactobacillus johnsonii supplementation attenuates respiratory viral infection via immune cell modulation (Fonseca et al., 2017). Moreover, the relative abundance of L. murinus was not only decreased in the gut, but also in all three segments of the respiratory tract (oropharynx, nasopharynx, lungs). Reduced relative abundance of L. murinus at all anatomic sites may have reduced colonization resistance. L. murinus maintained intestinal immune homeostasis and mediated anti-inflammatory effects in murine models (Tang et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2018). Probiotic administration of L. murinus prevented salt-sensitive hypertension by modulating TH17 cells in mice (Wilck et al., 2017). Parasutterella excrementihominis was significantly more abundant in gut microbiota in IAV infected mice, and was found in a higher relative abundance in older adults (Fart et al., 2020). Increased relative abundance of P. excrementihominis has been associated with fatty liver disease, chronic bowel inflammation and irritable bowel syndrome (Blasco-Baque et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). In addition, IAV infection reduced the similarity of oropharyngeal and gut microbiota. The correlation between murine oropharyngeal and intestinal microbiota may be due to coprophagy (Bogatyrev et al., 2020). Because IAV infection reduces murine alimentation (Bartley et al., 2017), decreased fecal feeding may have lowered the similarity between oropharyngeal and gut microbiota in our infected mice. The murine behavior of coprophagy and subsequent respiratory colonization by enteric microflora brings into question the utility of murine models of post-viral bacterial superinfections. Conclusion We characterized the oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, lung and gut microbiota and compared the microbiota structure of different mucosal surfaces in normal and IAV-infected mice. In addition, we determined that the nasopharynx is the primary reservoir of lung microbiota in healthy mice. IAV infection increased the similarity between lung and nasopharyngeal microbiota. However, IAV infection reduced the similarity between oropharyngeal and gut microbiota. The relative abundance of L. murinus may serve as a biomarker of IAV infection because it was reduced in all locations.

Infectious disease expert Matthew Miller answers questions about vaccines, viruses and ways to stay safe. BY Blake Dillon February 22, 2023 Health & Medicine Infectious Disease SHARE A recent outbreak of H5N1 at a mink farm in Spain caused international concern that the avian influenza virus might be creeping closer to achieving pandemic potential. We asked Matthew Miller, scientific director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research about the merits of those concerns. Miller’s lab, which also supports Canada’s Global Nexus for Pandemics and Biological Threats, has a long history of studying flu viruses. In fact, his team, in collaboration with scientists from across Canada and the U.S., is currently working on a universal flu vaccine that would offer broad protection against all influenza viruses. While the H5N1 virus is highly pathogenic, it is not yet able to cause widespread infection in humans, Miller says. Still, it is a very serious threat, and he advises staying informed as the situation progresses. Here’s what you need to know: What is H5N1? H5N1 is what we call a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. What differentiates it from other types of influenza is that it is very deadly. Waterfowl (i.e., ducks, geese, etc.) are the natural hosts of most influenza A viruses, and highly pathogenic H5N1 can kill birds in really high numbers. In birds, influenza virus causes infection in the gastrointestinal tract and can be spread through birds’ feces. Spillover events can happen when animals or humans come into contact with infected birds or the feces of infected birds. Influenza viruses are often very limited in the tissues that they can infect, but highly pathogenic avian influenzas like H5N1 can cause infection throughout the body, including in places like the brain. This is what makes it particularly deadly for not only birds, but other animals and humans too. How has it evolved recently, and why are such changes concerning? Highly pathogenic H5N1 has been around for a long time, but it used to be significantly more geographically limited. Spillover events were more common in Asia, the Middle East, and northeast Africa, but over the past year, waterfowl that migrate along seasonal migratory paths from Europe had a large outbreak of H5N1. As they migrated, they brought that virus with them throughout Europe and into North and South America. Birds like to congregate in farm fields and in coastal areas, so this poses a particular risk to these areas, where other species of animals often live. In Canada, there was a large outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 influenza virus in turkey and chicken farms in 2015. The good news is that there are really good surveillance programs in place on the agricultural side to detect highly pathogenic avian flus in poultry. Another change we’ve seen recently is increased spread into other animal species, like mink and sea lions. Mink are very susceptible to flu, but what has been observed in the past is that the spread of this virus into mink usually causes a dead-end infection. This means mink aren’t spreading it to other mink — they’re only getting it from infected birds or their droppings. But what seems to have happened recently in Spain is that the virus has recently been transmitted from mink to mink. This has raised some concerns because mink are mammals, so they’re biologically one step closer to humans than birds are. Although there’s been an extraordinarily high death rate in people who get infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza — around 50 per cent — humans, like mink, have historically been a dead-end host. We don’t transmit the virus efficiently to other humans. This is a prerequisite for pandemics, and is a reason why H5N1 has not caused a pandemic to date. Does the virus have pandemic potential for humans? Efficient transmission between humans is a prerequisite for a pandemic, and there is currently no evidence that the virus is capable of doing this, so the pandemic risk is low, at least for now. That said, the risk posed by H5N1 warrants hyper-vigilance when it comes to surveillance and prevention. Almost 10 years ago, there was a series of very famous studies that experimentally tried to determine how the virus would need to change in ferrets to move beyond dead-end infections and become transmissible. The authors discovered a series of mutations that were associated with transmissibility. Though it’s not clear whether these same mutations would enable the virus to transmit in humans, they at least give us something to monitor and help assess risk. In addition, the authors found that initially — when the virus could not transmit — it caused very severe disease in the ferrets. But as the virus became transmissible in ferrets, it no longer caused severe disease. So the evolution toward transmissibility reduced the virus’ pathogenicity. There’s no guarantee that this will always happen, but for respiratory viruses, what often occurs is that when they cause severe disease, they do so in the lower lung. But more efficient transmission tends to occur when the virus moves toward the upper respiratory tract, which in turn often reduces infection severity. Viruses only “care” about transmitting efficiently. Virulence, or the severity of illness a virus causes, is a secondary by-product of infection. Are there any vaccines or therapeutics available to help protect against or treat H5N1? Unlike the situation we were in with COVID-19, where there were no approved vaccines at all on the market for any type of coronavirus, we have a huge global infrastructure for developing and distributing flu vaccines. In fact, new flu shots are literally produced every year. So to make a vaccine for a new flu virus, we can rely on the existing vaccine manufacturing processes that we use for seasonal flus. However, there are some limitations. The process of producing a new vaccine to respond to a pandemic is slow — probably too slow to stop a pandemic from happening. In addition, the efficacy of flu vaccines could always be better. But the good news is that we know how to make them, there are existing manufacturing facilities located all around the world, and many manufacturers already stockpile avian flu vaccines in the event that a new epidemic or pandemic were to emerge. We also have a small number of approved antivirals for influenza. Most H5N1 viruses are susceptible to these drugs. Your lab has been working on developing a universal flu vaccine. Is that something that could help against highly pathogenic flus, like H5N1? A universal vaccine would be a game-changer to mitigate risk of pandemics caused by highly pathogenic flus. In the event of a new flu pandemic, a universal vaccine would reduce the number and severity of infections, buying researchers time to develop an even more specific vaccine to address the specific virus that is circulating. We’re also working on “universal” monoclonal antibodies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the approval of monoclonal antibodies to prevent infection in high-risk people and to treat people who were severely ill. The problem was that as the virus evolved and mutated, those antibodies didn’t work anymore. But we’ve identified antibodies that bind to parts of the flu virus that are shared among all types of flu, and are intolerant to mutations, and so we could deploy those antibodies to provide immediate immunity to people. This is beneficial because, when you get a vaccine, it takes about two weeks for your body to mount an immune response that protects you. But when you get antibodies, you’re protected right away. So having these different layered approaches is really important to pandemic preparedness strategies. What can people do to protect themselves from catching H5N1? The most important thing right now is to be incredibly cautious around birds, because they are the main vehicles for spreading these highly pathogenic avian flus. Hunters, farmers, poultry workers, and even homeowners who has birds on their property should be particularly cautious right now. People should also avoid direct handling of dead animals. Is there any risk to consuming poultry right now? No. Surveillance is excellent in poultry farms, so consumption of poultry really shouldn’t be a risk. Plus, H5N1, much like the virus that causes COVID-19, is a virus that is very environmentally sensitive. So, when you cook poultry, you would definitely kill any possible traces of the virus in the process. What are some common symptoms to watch for, and when should you see a doctor? Flus in humans typically present as a respiratory infection. But the difference with highly pathogenic avian flus is that they can spread beyond the respiratory tract and that’s what makes them so dangerous. It’s highly unlikely that you would contract H5N1 at this point, but, as a general rule, if you experience any signs of illness that you think are unusual (e.g., fever, chills, muscle aches, severe lethargy), that’s always the best time to see a doctor. The average person has an extremely low risk of contracting H5N1 at this point.

Influenza viruses are often very limited in the tissues that they can infect, but highly pathogenic avian influenzas like H5N1 can cause infection throughout the body, including in places like the brain. This is what makes it particularly deadly for not only birds, but other animals and humans too. <span style="color: #7a003c"><strong>How has it evolved recently, and why are such changes concerning?</strong></span> Highly pathogenic H5N1 has been around for a long time, but it used to be significantly more geographically limited. Spillover events were more common in Asia, the Middle East, and northeast Africa, but over the past year, waterfowl that migrate along seasonal migratory paths from Europe had a large outbreak of H5N1. As they migrated, they brought that virus with them throughout Europe and into North and South America. Birds like to congregate in farm fields and in coastal areas, so this poses a particular risk to these areas, where other species of animals often live. In Canada, there was a large outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 influenza virus in turkey and chicken farms in 2015. The good news is that there are really good surveillance programs in place on the agricultural side to detect highly pathogenic avian flus in poultry. Another change we've seen recently is increased spread into other animal species, like mink and sea lions. Mink are very susceptible to flu, but what has been observed in the past is that the spread of this virus into mink usually causes a dead-end infection. This means mink aren't spreading it to other mink — they're only getting it from infected birds or their droppings. But what seems to have happened recently in Spain is that the virus has recently been transmitted from mink to mink. This has raised some concerns because mink are mammals, so they're biologically one step closer to humans than birds are. Although there's been an extraordinarily high death rate in people who get infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza — around 50 per cent — humans, like mink, have historically been a dead-end host. We don't transmit the virus efficiently to other humans. This is a prerequisite for pandemics, and is a reason why H5N1 has not caused a pandemic to date. <span style="color: #7a003c"><strong>Does the virus have pandemic potential for humans?</strong></span> Efficient transmission between humans is a prerequisite for a pandemic, and there is currently no evidence that the virus is capable of doing this, so the pandemic risk is low, at least for now. That said, the risk posed by H5N1 warrants hyper-vigilance when it comes to surveillance and prevention. Almost 10 years ago, there was a series of very famous studies that experimentally tried to determine how the virus would need to change in ferrets to move beyond dead-end infections and become transmissible. The authors discovered a series of mutations that were associated with transmissibility. Though it’s not clear whether these same mutations would enable the virus to transmit in humans, they at least give us something to monitor and help assess risk. In addition, the authors found that initially — when the virus could not transmit — it caused very severe disease in the ferrets. But as the virus became transmissible in ferrets, it no longer caused severe disease. So the evolution toward transmissibility reduced the virus’ pathogenicity. There's no guarantee that this will always happen, but for respiratory viruses, what often occurs is that when they cause severe disease, they do so in the lower lung. But more efficient transmission tends to occur when the virus moves toward the upper respiratory tract, which in turn often reduces infection severity. Viruses only “care” about transmitting efficiently. Virulence, or the severity of illness a virus causes, is a secondary by-product of infection. <span style="color: #7a003c"><strong>Are there any vaccines or therapeutics available to help protect against or treat H5N1?</strong></span> Unlike the situation we were in with COVID-19, where there were no approved vaccines at all on the market for any type of coronavirus, we have a huge global infrastructure for developing and distributing flu vaccines. In fact, new flu shots are literally produced every year. So to make a vaccine for a new flu virus, we can rely on the existing vaccine manufacturing processes that we use for seasonal flus. However, there are some limitations. The process of producing a new vaccine to respond to a pandemic is slow — probably too slow to stop a pandemic from happening. In addition, the efficacy of flu vaccines could always be better. But the good news is that we know how to make them, there are existing manufacturing facilities located all around the world, and many manufacturers already stockpile avian flu vaccines in the event that a new epidemic or pandemic were to emerge. We also have a small number of approved antivirals for influenza. Most H5N1 viruses are susceptible to these drugs. <span style="color: #7a003c"><strong>Your lab has been working on developing a universal flu vaccine. Is that something that could help against highly pathogenic flus, like H5N1?</strong></span> A universal vaccine would be a game-changer to mitigate risk of pandemics caused by highly pathogenic flus. In the event of a new flu pandemic, a universal vaccine would reduce the number and severity of infections, buying researchers time to develop an even more specific vaccine to address the specific virus that is circulating. We're also working on “universal” monoclonal antibodies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the approval of monoclonal antibodies to prevent infection in high-risk people and to treat people who were severely ill. The problem was that as the virus evolved and mutated, those antibodies didn't work anymore. But we've identified antibodies that bind to parts of the flu virus that are shared among all types of flu, and are intolerant to mutations, and so we could deploy those antibodies to provide immediate immunity to people. This is beneficial because, when you get a vaccine, it takes about two weeks for your body to mount an immune response that protects you. But when you get antibodies, you're protected right away. So having these different layered approaches is really important to pandemic preparedness strategies. <span style="color: #7a003c"><strong>What can people do to protect themselves from catching H5N1?</strong></span> The most important thing right now is to be incredibly cautious around birds, because they are the main vehicles for spreading these highly pathogenic avian flus. Hunters, farmers, poultry workers, and even homeowners who has birds on their property should be particularly cautious right now. People should also avoid direct handling of dead animals. <strong><span style="color: #7a003c">Is there any risk to consuming poultry right now?</span> </strong> No. Surveillance is excellent in poultry farms, so consumption of poultry really shouldn't be a risk. Plus, H5N1, much like the virus that causes COVID-19, is a virus that is very environmentally sensitive. So, when you cook poultry, you would definitely kill any possible traces of the virus in the process. <span style="color: #7a003c"><strong>What are some common symptoms to watch for, and when should you see a doctor?</strong></span> Flus in humans typically present as a respiratory infection. But the difference with highly pathogenic avian flus is that they can spread beyond the respiratory tract and that's what makes them so dangerous. It’s highly unlikely that you would contract H5N1 at this point, but, as a general rule, if you experience any signs of illness that you think are unusual (e.g., fever, chills, muscle aches, severe lethargy), that's always the best time to see a doctor. The average person has an extremely low risk of contracting H5N1 at this point.

(AP) — The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers’ pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus.In addition to the cost of the government response that the USDA tallied up and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall. The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn’t proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago. RELATED COVERAGE McDonald’s Quarter Pounder back on the menu after testing rules out beef patties as E. coli source At least 75 people are sickened as the deadly McDonald’s E. coli outbreak expands McDonald’s says onions from California-based produce company linked to deadly E. coli outbreak “The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry’s history,” National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said. In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm — which can number in the millions — must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa — the nation’s biggest egg producer — leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states. That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn’t have any birds on their farms.This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what’s driving prices so high.The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That’s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month. The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating. “We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that’s leading the government’s response.Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.“America’s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,” said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group. Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.“That’s really the key – early detection. It’s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,” National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.Officials say bird flu doesn’t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.

The reported death involves a child from Ingham County who contracted Influenza A/H3. Nationally, there have been at least 111 influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported during the current flu season. “It’s not too late to get the flu vaccine,” said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for MDHHS. “Once children reach six months of age it is recommended they receive two doses of the flu vaccine for their first series. In addition, pregnant women should get the flu vaccine during each pregnancy. Flu vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine.” Each year, influenza claims the lives of children across the United States. MDHHS continues to strongly recommend that everyone six months of age and older get a seasonal flu vaccine. Flu can be serious and lead to severe illness and hospitalizations. Flu vaccine is the best way to prevent getting the flu and can also reduce the severity of flu illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that since October there have been at least 25-51 million flu illnesses, 12-25 million flu medical visits, 280,000-630,000 flu hospitalizations and 18,000-56,000 deaths nationally. Most positive influenza specimens confirmed by the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories this flu season have been Influenza A/H3 virus. This virus can cause severe flu infections in children, as well as in adults. The H3N2 strain is a component of the 2022-2023 seasonal flu vaccine so getting vaccinated provides extra protection. The influenza vaccine is especially important for persons at increased risk for complications from flu, including children, adults aged 65 years and older, persons of any age with underlying medical conditions and pregnant women. Early estimates from Canada suggest vaccination reduces the risk of influenza associated medical visits by 54% this season. Children less than six months of age are too young to be vaccinated and need to be protected by vaccination of their close contacts, including parents, siblings, grandparents, childcare workers and health care personnel. In addition to vaccination, early treatment with an antiviral drug can help prevent flu infections from becoming more severe. Check with your doctor promptly if you are at higher risk of serious flu complications and you get flu symptoms. Currently, for the 2022-2023 flu season, only 33% of Michigan residents have been vaccinated against flu. According to data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry, flu vaccine coverage among children ages six months through 17 years is more than 3% lower for the 2022-2023 flu season (18.8%) compared to the 2021-2022 flu season (22.2%).

But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,” he said.H5N1 –– often called bird flu– – is a highly infectious strain of avian influenza A virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in birds. While it has caused outbreaks before, the current epidemic has led to the devastation of avian populations around the world, including wild birds and commercial poultry.The virus has also been known to jump from birds to other animals as well as humans, with the WHO noting that sporadic human cases are not unexpected as a result of exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.Data from the WHO reveals that from January 2003 to 5 January 2023, there have been 868 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus around the world, 457 of which were fatal. However, only six of these cases, and two deaths, occurred since the start of 2021.Prof James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said that despite the current epidemic in birds, there is no sign of a dramatic rise in cases or deaths in humans.“There has been massive global challenge of wild and domestic birds with the current H5N1 avian influenza virus over the last few months and years, which will have exposed many humans; despite this, what is remarkable is how few people have been infected,” he said.“Tragic though this case in Cambodia is, we expect there to be some cases of clinical disease with such a widespread infection. Clearly the virus needs careful monitoring and surveillance to check that it has not mutated or recombined, but the limited numbers of cases of human disease have not increased markedly and this one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed,” he added.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, added the likelihood of onward human-to-human transmission is very low, but that it is important to monitor circulation of flu in bird and mammal populations and do everything possible to reduce the number of infections seen.“It also highlights why efforts to develop next-generation cross-reactive vaccines are so important,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBird fluCambodiaWorld Health OrganizationAsia PacificInfectious diseasesHealthBirdsnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBird flu outbreak confirmed at East Yorkshire poultry farm6d agoCambodia PM Hun Sen steps down and hands over power to son26 Jul 2023Bird flu in pheasants in England sparks concern over lax rearing rules17 Oct 2024Certain of election victory, Cambodia’s Hun Sen prepares to hand power to son21 Jul 2023Cambodia’s only major opposition party is barred from running in July elections16 May 2023Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is ‘enormous concern’, says WHO 18 Apr 2024Northumberland’s Farne Islands reopen to visitors after bird flu outbreak27 Mar 2024US condemns ‘fabricated’ case as Cambodian opposition leader is jailed for 27 years3 Mar 2023Avian flu outbreak confirmed at vital seabird colonies in Wales20 Jul 2023Human gene identified that prevents most bird flu viruses moving to people 28 Jun 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Lucira COVID-19 and Flu Home Test is a single-use test, which can be purchased without a prescription. A nasal swab is used as with an at-home COVID test; in 30 minutes or less, the test displays the results – positive or negative for influenza A, Influenza B and COVID-19.“Today’s authorization of the first OTC test that can detect Influenza A and B, along with SARS-CoV-2, is a major milestone in bringing greater consumer access to diagnostic tests that can be performed entirely at home,” said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in the announcement Friday.Pay increases since 2010: Airline pilots got sharpest increases, dentists the least.

"This is a major milestone for Lucira Health and at-home diagnostics, and I can’t thank our employees and partners enough for seeing this through, and of course, for the FDA’s recognition," he said.The company currently also sells an Lucira Check It COVID-19 Test ($34.99), which is a molecular test – similar to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) lab tests – and considered more accurate than other at-home rapid antigen tests. In addition to Canada, at-home tests for COVID and flu are already available in Australia and Europe (the test available there also tests for RSV), according to medical site WebMD.

Without the expected revenue from the combo test, the company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and plans to pursue a sale of the business, it announced Feb. 22. “Unfortunately, as restrictions lessened in 2022, we saw lower demand for COVID-19 tests. This, combined with slower than anticipated regulatory approval for the new combined test kit developed for the 2022-2023 flu season led to insufficient revenue and capitalization to offset expenditures," Engelson said in the bankruptcy announcement. "Despite every effort to reduce capital outlays and restructure our business, we took this action to protect and maximize the value of our assets.”In January, the company announced the addition of a free Medi-Call telehealth call with the purchase of its COVID-19 and Flu test in Canada.What's everyone talking about?: Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest newsFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.

On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized what it says is the first at-home test that can tell users if they have the flu and/or Covid-19.

The test can be bought without a prescription. It’s authorized for anyone 14 and older for self-collection, or an adult can give it to a child 2 or older. The test is able to identify a negative result for influenza A with more than 99% accuracy and a positive result with more than 90% accuracy. It’s 100% accurate for negative Covid-19 samples and more than 88% accurate for positive results. There weren’t enough influenza B cases while Lucira was testing the product to measure that performance, so the company says it will have to do a real-world test when there is enough virus in circulation. But in lab studies, it caught nearly 100% of negative cases. All tests carry a risk of false positive or negative results. People who test positive for flu or Covid-19 should take precautions so they don’t spread the illness. Negative results should be confirmed with a lab test, the FDA said, “if necessary for patient management.” Studies show that an at-home test can be less accurate than a lab test because users might not get enough of a sample for a valid result. Health-care providers also may have more sensitive tests. Doctor giving vaccine, flu or influenza shot to patient with injection needle. Close up of arm and medical professional. Nurse or physician with syringe. Immunity, HPV or health care concept. Terovesalainen/Adobe Stock Flu shot provided 'substantial protection' this season, CDC says People who have flu- or Covid-like symptoms but test negative may have a different kind of respiratory infection and should get followup care. Historically, doctors have been reluctant to leave testing to their patients, but the Covid-19 pandemic changed some of that sentiment. Studies have found that people don’t need medical training to test themselves for respiratory illnesses. Although the intensity of the pandemic has slowed and cases are declining, the US still had 236,131 new cases, 2,407 deaths and an average of 3,461 hospitalizations this week, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonal flu activity is low nationally, the CDC says. Tests for Covid-19 and flu are helpful because both illnesses can be treated with different medications, and those drugs work best when taken as soon as possible after symptoms begin.

It is the country's first fatality from the virus in years. What we know about the bird flu death The girl fell ill on February 16 with a fever, cough and sore throat. She was sent to be treated at hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh. She was diagnosed on Wednesday and died shortly afterward, Cambodia's Communicable Disease Control Department said in a statement Wednesday. It did not specify the time of death, but said that test results confirmed that the girl was "positive for H5N1," referring to the bird flu virus. The disease typically spreads from birds to humans through direct contact. Health officials have taken samples from a dead wild bird at a conservation area near the girl's home, the Health Ministry said on Thursday. Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bunheng urged parents to keep their children away from poultry as well as sick or dead birds. Cambodia had 56 human cases of H5N1 from 2003 through 2014 and 37 of them were fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Cambodia villagers in Prey Veng province hold posters to spread awareness of H5N1 virus threatsImage: Cambodia Ministry of Health/AP Photo/picture alliance The spread of bird flu Since late 2021, Europe has been gripped by its worst-ever outbreak of bird flu, with North and South America also experiencing severe outbreaks. This has led to the culling of tens of millions of domestic poultry worldwide, many with the H5N1 strain. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to live poultry markets in Hong Kong. Most human cases worldwide have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but concerns have arisen recently about infections in a variety of mammals and the possibility the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people. Symptoms of H5N1 infection are similar to that of other flus, including cough, aches and fever, and in serious cases, patients can develop life-threatening pneumonia.Bird-flu outbreak hits India hardTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video H5N1 spillover to mammals WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month expressed concern about avian influenza infections in mammals including minks, otters, foxes and sea lions. "H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely,'' he warned, stressing that "for the moment, WHO assesses the risk to humans as low." "But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo," Ghebreyesus said. Globally, there have been more than 450 fatal bird flu cases since 2003, according to the WHO. dht (AP, AFP) Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisementSkip next section Related topicsRelated topicsMpoxImmune systemGerman health systemCambodiaHealthAbout DWWho we arePressDW Global Media ForumDW offersLearn GermanDW AkademieServiceNewslettersReceptionFAQContactTopics from A to ZHeadlinesB2BSales & DistributionTravelAdvertisingGerman News ServiceFollow us on© 2024 Deutsche WellePrivacy PolicyLegal noticeDigital accessibilityData privacy settingsHow concerned should we be about bird flu? | Hub Skip to main content MenuHubOpen Hub About the Hub Announcements For Media Faculty Experts Guide Subscribe to the newsletter Explore by Topic Arts+Culture Athletics Health Politics+Society Science+Technology Student Life University News Voices+Opinion Events At WorkOpen At Work About Hub at Work Gazette Archive Explore by Topic News+Info Benefits+Perks Health+Well-Being Tools+Tech Happenings Johns Hopkins MagazineOpen Johns Hopkins Magazine Current Issue About the Magazine Past Issues Contact Support Johns Hopkins Magazine Subscribe to the Magazine jhu.edu Search Credit: Getty Images Q+A How concerned should we be about bird flu? Johns Hopkins epidemiologist and environmental microbiologist Meghan Frost Davis discusses the current state of the H5N1 outbreak and its global reverberations By Katie Pearce / Published Feb 23, 2023 Now two years in, the global avian flu outbreak has devastated wild and domestic bird populations, leapt into various species of mammals, and cost governments and farmers billions as consumers feel the pain in their grocery bills. Despite containment efforts, the record-breaking outbreak—caused by a highly contagious new variant of H5N1—shows no signs of slowing as migration season looms. While the virus so far has not posed significant threats to humans, many unknowns remain as it continues to evolve, according to Johns Hopkins epidemiologist and environmental microbiologist Meghan Frost Davis. "What we know about flu strains is that they're constantly changing. Our influenzas have the potential to become epidemics or pandemics," she says. "So that's what we keep at the back of our minds." "Right now, there's no reason to believe that these avian influenza strains will rise to the need to be included in our decision-making over human vaccines. We'll see if that changes." In particular, the jump from birds to mammals—including foxes, bears, mink, whales, and seals—is "significant and something to pay attention to," says Davis, an associate professor in environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health. "What people may not remember from high school biology is that there are larger differences between birds and mammals than there are among mammals, so finding the virus in mammals indicates an expanded host range." Davis recently spoke with the Hub about the current state of the outbreak and its global reverberations. What can you tell us about the extent of this outbreak? What we're seeing is an epizootic—the term we use for an epidemic, but with animals—happening in wild birds in many parts of the world, which has caused a record-breaking outbreak of avian flu in domestic poultry, including chickens and turkey raised for meat and eggs, as well as backyard poultry kept for the household or as pets. So the outbreak is of great concern for animal health, starting with the poultry especially. But now we've also seen it detected in a number of other animals, including mammals. And it's shown up in a very small number of people globally. What makes this avian flu outbreak stand out from other similar ones of the past? What we more typically see with outbreaks in animals is that they'll surface and then go away, usually within the space of a season. What's unusual about this one is that it's been going on for some time, starting sometime in 2021, with various sub-strains developing. It's been persistent and widespread, and now has affected an estimated 58 million birds in the United States and more globally. Also seeThe Bird Flu Outbreak Has Taken an Ominous Turn/ WiredAn Even Deadlier Pandemic Could Be Here Soon/ The New York Times What usually happens to prevent these outbreaks from spreading further is going to commercial flocks to depopulate them. So remove the animals, then wait out the viability of the virus in the local environment. They'll do a good cleaning to make sure everything's good, then repopulate the flock. These control measures aren't enough to contain the current outbreak. That's pretty significant because we're not just talking about the loss of animal lives, which is tragic, but we're talking about widespread impacts to our food systems and our ecosystem, not to mention the commercial and psychosocial impacts on people raising the animals. This can all be quite devastating. Why is it significant that the avian influenza has shown up in mammals? From a public health perspective, we're perennially concerned about any infectious agent that has potential to move from one species to another species, and in particular from an animal species into a human. And if that becomes the kind of virus that can transmit human-to-human, that's where we see outbreaks, epidemics, or even pandemics. Of course the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic is one example of this, and we're still struggling with it. "There have been rare cases where avian flu has been found in pet animals such as cats and dogs. The basic advice is to prevent contact with wild birds … I worry more about pet birds, including those that are indoors but might have indirect contact with wild birds through a screened window or door." What level of concern is there that this could spread more widely among humans? Thankfully with the current outbreak we've seen fewer than 10 human cases documented, one of those in the United States. And we've been doing targeted surveillance of people who have been in contact with positive birds, which was the case for the individual in the U.S., who experienced mild symptoms for a few days. Surveillance is key to catching these groups with potential exposure, who could help us identify and track new strains. With the current strains circulating, we haven't seen high risk to humans—so that's reassuring, right? However, what we know about flu strains is that they're constantly changing. This is why our seasonal influenzas have the potential for epidemics or pandemic strains. Those are the worst-case scenarios we imagine. Even though the number of cases in humans from this outbreak is small, the recent death of a girl in Cambodia shows how severe the disease can be. You mentioned depopulation as a control method. What are other methods to limit the spread of bird flu? With the wild bird population, clearly it's not really possible to control it. But as far as what individuals can do, you'll hear advisories for people to disinfect bird feeders, or to not use bird feeders or bird baths at all because you don't want congregations of birds. For people who deal closely with birds, wear N95 masks, and if you suspect an animal might be sick—maybe they're not eating or drinking well, maybe you see discharge around the eyes, or unkempt feathers—it's time to call your veterinarian or potentially also contact appropriate state agencies. With domestic poultry, some of these flocks are hundreds of thousands of birds, so once the virus gets into the flock, it can spread quickly. In these facilities, prevention focuses on biosecurity and biocontainment. Basically, you stop any new elements from coming into a large farm, for example. You disinfect, you limit visitors, you try to enclose the facilities. Even with backyard flocks these principles can be used—you isolate chickens in coops. Different states may have different agencies or groups handling this kind of thing; for example in Maryland we have an extension service through the University of Maryland as well as the state Department of Agriculture monitoring this situation and taking action. It's something that's on the radar and a high priority for the poultry industry as well as for animal health professionals. What about vaccines? What role could they play here? With human vaccinations, we have expert groups come together to decide which strains to include in our seasonal flu vaccines. Right now, there's no reason to believe that these avian influenza strains will rise to the need to be included in our decision-making over human vaccines. We'll see if that changes. With animal vaccination, there are two different considerations: How effective is it in preventing disease, and is it economically feasible? We tried this with COVID-19 vaccines for animals and found that the cost-benefit ratio wasn't really where it should be. With the bird flu, I'm not certain these questions have been fully addressed to the point where an effective vaccine could be brought to market. To my knowledge, there is no widespread deployment right now of vaccines for poultry. Should we be concerned about impacts to our pets, i.e. cats that interact with birds? There have been rare cases where avian flu has been found in pet animals such as cats and dogs. The basic advice is to prevent contact with wild birds. Since outdoor cats can sometimes hunt wild birds, this could lead to exposure, so you'd want to keep them indoors to decrease risks. I worry more about pet birds, including those that are indoors but might have indirect contact with wild birds through a screened window or door. What misunderstandings do you think may exist about the bird flu? The biggest thing I've been hearing is how upset and horrified people are about the price of eggs going up—which, yes, is an economic issue related to this avian influenza outbreak. But I think many general consumers aren't fully comprehending or appreciating just how complex our food systems are and how something like this can impact supplies coming into the market and their price points. To me this really illustrates how vulnerable our food system is and the value of investing in animal health—research and resources that look at the entirety of the food system and try to build as resilient a structure as possible. The challenges we face with animal health diseases aren't limited to avian flu. For example, almost a decade ago, porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED, a coronavirus) caused a major outbreak that impacted pork production. Right now we're seeing African Swine Fever causing disease in pigs around the world, though it hasn't yet been identified in the U.S. There are major efforts underway to try to prevent introduction of this virus and to protect animal health and the food supply. How closely is human health connected to animal health and well-being? I think the bird flu gives us a window into how animal diseases broadly impact human health and all the different pathways for that to occur. After COVID-19 we're all sensitized to the possibility of a virus in animals spilling over into humans. That's not something we want to happen, but it's something that we now understand occurs more frequently than we once thought. But when we think about these animal diseases, we shouldn't limit our concerns just to the possibility of human infection. There can be major global impacts regardless—affecting our food systems, our livelihoods, and causing major disruptions to our ecosystems. Healthy ecosystems can support cleaner air and cleaner water and also can help mitigate impacts from flooding or extreme weather events. If we can't understand and respect the way all of this works together, we'll lose many of these benefits and human populations will certainly feel impacts in one way or another.

The two source flocks had been OK in their pre-movement testing, but one tested positive just after the birds were moved. The flock has been depopulated. The other flock is under investigation and quarantine, Brightbill said.The markets must clean and disinfect at the direction of an Ag Department representative, pass a visual inspection, and complete environmental sampling. Markets are not to restock for at least 120 hours after cleaning and disinfecting.Markets that restock before receiving negative environmental sampling will waive any potential federal indemnity, and they will have to go through the process again if the samples are positive.Pennsylvania’s selldown order, effective Feb. 24, is an attempt to avoid broader repercussions. During the state’s last avian influenza outbreak in 1980s, USDA put a large part of Lancaster County under federal quarantine.“We don’t want to go there. We want to be proactive,” Brightbill said. “We want to ensure we’re mitigating disease while supporting business continuity.”In the U.S., live bird markets are mostly found in major Northeastern cities and provide poultry varieties that are popular with certain ethnic groups but are hard to find in grocery stores.For the past 20 years, New York has required its 87 live bird markets to sell down and clean at least once a quarter. The state’s regulations have greatly reduced disease problems at live markets. A live market in Queens tested positive for avian influenza in November.The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has not advised its live bird markets to sell down, spokesman Mike Wallace said.Brightbill said outreach over the past week has increased understanding between Pennsylvania officials and live bird market producers, many of whom are religiously conservative. The state is looking to train employees from these farms to conduct avian influenza testing.Pennsylvania has been the hardest hit state with avian influenza over the past month, with more than 150,000 birds lost across five backyard and two commercial flocks that have been publicly confirmed by USDA. Most of the sites are in Lancaster County.For a one-page summary of ways to protect birds, symptoms of avian influenza, and numbers to call, go here.This story has been updated with comment from the Virginia ag department.

(WJAC)TOPICS:Health Medical PharmaZOETISZOETIS INC.Josh HunterHuman InterestAnimal VirologyCanine InfluenzaFujian FluAs dog flu cases are going up dog-owners are trying to get their pets vaccinated.The only current manufacturer of canine influenza vaccines, Zoetis, is experiencing some supply disruptions which is worrying local vets about having enough supplies for the season.The CDC states that Canine influenza, or dog flu, is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by specific Type A influenza viruses. Currently, there are two different influenza A dog flu viruses: one is an H3N8 virus and the other is an H3N2 virus. The vaccines work for both strains.“It’s not what we would call a core vaccine where you walk into your clinic and it’s going to be routinely given to your animal," said Dr. Josh Hunter, veterinarian at Glades Pike Veterinary Hospital. "We screen people to see, do you board a lot? Do you spend a lot of time in doggy day care? Those dogs that are higher risk we definitely recommend the vaccine.”But veterinarians report a shortage in the vaccine.“There’s a huge shortage right now and that is the big problem," said Dr. Hunter. "We can’t vaccinate anybody at all right now. We have very little vaccine left.”We contacted the manufacturer of the vaccine, Zoetis for comment and they said that;The current shortage of canine influenza vaccines is the result of another company pulling out of the market several months ago, and this has impacted Zoetis and our ability to meet the increased demand. We are the only manufacturer currently supplying these vaccines to the market, and this type of biologics product (vaccine) requires a good deal of lead time for planning, production, and quality testing. While short-term disruptions are still happening, we expect the supply situation to stabilize this spring...Dr. Hunter said that not many dogs are receiving the vaccine at the moment but that’s likely to change with rising outbreaks.“Less than 50 a year," said Dr. Hunter. "We should be vaccinating more dogs than we are and that may be why we’re seeing more of these outbreaks.”He also said the cost of the vaccine is an issue.“That’s probably what’s stopping most people," he said. "It is one of the more expensive vaccines.

While the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, a new threat looms on the horizon: the avian influenza (more commonly known as bird flu) outbreak that is sweeping across the globe. In particular, the H5N1 strain of this virus is raising fears among scientists monitoring its spread. We must be proactive about the bird flu before this outbreak grows into a pandemic. Back in October 2022, veterinarians noticed that minks at a farm in Galicia, Spain were dying unexpectedly. While SARS-CoV-2 was suspected to be the culprit, lab tests revealed that H5N1 was to blame. Workers were immediately quarantined, and more than 50,000 minks were killed. While none of the farm workers became infected, it was an unprecedented finding. Though H5N1 is making headlines now, the bird flu strain is more than 25 years old. It was initially detected at a goose farm in China in 1996. The first documented human deaths resulted from a poultry outbreak occurring in Hong Kong in 1997. In addition to devastating global bird populations and posing the risk of a pandemic, bird flu has dealt massive blows to the animal agriculture industry. Any time that the virus is detected, the entire flock must be killed to prevent the spread of the virus. The current outbreak has cost the government $661 million and resulted in 58 million birds slaughtered, 43 million of which were egg-laying chickens. Consumers are already bearing this cost as egg prices rose to $4.82 per dozen in January compared to $1.93 just a year earlier. The bird flu binds to specific receptors in the upper airways of birds. These receptors are less common in mammalian upper airways. This is why H5N1 has not caused much trouble to mammals in the past; however, this new wave has infected many mammalian species — such as foxes, cats, ferrets, seals, dolphins, bears and humans. This news is incredibly concerning. While the H5N1 strain has not infected humans often, it has a troubling 53% case fatality rate when it does. As infection numbers rise, the probability of a deadly mutation occurring only increases. Compared to the virus found in birds, the version detected in minks showed several changes, including a mutation allowing it to better replicate in mammalian tissue (T271A). Isabella Monne, a veterinary researcher at the European Union’s Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in Italy, expressed concern. “This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start,” Monne said. Farms pose a huge threat for viral epidemics. When we force thousands of mammals to live together in close contact with each other and humans, we create ideal conditions for pathogens to spread and adapt. What’s more, the mink’s upper respiratory tract is well suited to spread the bird flu to humans. In 2020, Danish mink farms generated new variants of SARS-CoV-2 that infected humans. Monne advocates for increased biosafety measures at farms such as wearing masks and enforcing better sanitary conditions. Thomas Peacock, virologist and research associate at Imperial College London, adds that it may be time to think about ending mink farming in general. “It’s a bit of an existential threat,” Peacock stated. Many questions have been raised about the ethicality of this industry. Minks are raised for their fur, a luxury item that is “not essential to human health or well-being,” according to University of Oxford ethicist Andrew Linzey. In the face of the H5N1 outbreak, it is essential to take proactive steps to prevent the spread of bird flu and suppress early outbreaks. Surveillance and monitoring are key. The U.S. and the World Health Organization already have influenza surveillance networks. Effective monitoring would need to prioritize those at higher risk of contracting bird flu such as poultry workers and healthcare workers. Additionally, testing should be made widely available and easy to obtain. Those in contact with patients, poultry and wild birds should be able to test after any potential exposure. In terms of prevention, there are several H5N1 vaccines already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, while the U.S. government has an H5N1 vaccine stockpile, it is meager compared to the amount necessary to prevent a serious outbreak. As a result, if an outbreak occurs, the country will have to scramble to mass-produce vaccines. Instead, we should be adequately prepared before cases rise. More must be done to prepare for outbreaks. There is an opportunity to prevent a pandemic and protect the health of people and animals around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic did not allow us to prepare in advance, but, this time, we have an opportunity to prevent disaster.

Eighty-two birds in the lake area were culled, and disinfection procedures were implemented.The other species of birds in the lake area to be depopulated included common guineafowl, mallards, Indian peafowl, greater flamingos and an ostrich. The WOAH report also listed 25 birds in the lake area simply as “birds,” but only 14 of those were depopulated.In addition to the two Andean condors that died, one other condor was susceptible, as well as six Eurasian sparrowhawks. The remaining Andean Condor, which is classified as a species vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), was not listed among the birds depopulated in the WOAH report.The other birds in the clinic and aviary areas of the zoo are considered susceptible, and those areas are being monitored and biosecurity measures are being taken, according to the WOAH report.Read our ongoing coverage of the global avian influenza outbreak.RecommendedLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesLatest NewsHormel Foods honoredRelated StoriesEgg ProductionMPS acquires Country Charm Eggs, gains 1.8 million hensEgg Production2 lawmakers from cage-free states make selves look sillyEggSeventh Ecuador layer flock hit by avian influenzaEgg ProductionGlowing biomarker could simplify in ovo chick sexingMore in EggIndustry OrganizationsVirginia Egg Council’s Cecelia Glembocki to retireBrand InsightsVaccination success depends on crew trainingZoetisContinuous evaluation and training are critical to improving pullet vaccination accuracy.Animal WelfareNoble Foods, actor Kelvin Fletcher partner on hen welfareStructures for climbing and tires filled with dust are just a couple of the enrichment materials the egg producer provides its birds.Business and MarketsVital Farms reports over 30% net revenue boost in 2024New offerings, retail distribution gains are given as some of the reasons sales grew in the most recent quarter.Egg ProcessingWhy the egg sector should look more to pet careThere are numerous reasons why egg producers ought to more fully embrace pet nutrition and care.EggUK egg producer Farmlay invests in new grading capacityState-of-the-art egg grader, to be installed in January 2025, responds to growing consumer demand for eggs and more favorable investment climate.EggMichael Foods boosts efficiency at new Minnesota feed millLeading egg producer replaced two aging feed mills with a single, fully automated one, ushering in a new era for Gaylord feed operation.Hen Housing SystemsHow Burnbrae Farms aims to overcome activist challengesBurnbrae Farms CEO Margaret Hudson explains how the company is dealing with an active campaign from an animal activist group.Latest NewsKathy Brodhagen is new CEO at Echo Lake FoodsShe brings to the company years of experience in the egg products industry.EggHappy Egg completes merger with Egg InnovationsThe merger brings together two of the largest U.S. based free-range and pasture-raised egg companies.EuropeMoldovan farm authorized to export eggs to EUGeorge Standard has invested in improvements to production methods and raised product standards to meet the EU standards.EggBurcon launches Puratein for egg replacement applicationsEgg ProductionCooper Farms increases liquid egg productionNew silos will increase storage capacity by 50%.Page 1 of 484Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Experts say bird flu threat small despite Cambodian fatality | CBC News ContentSkip to Main ContentAccessibility HelphamburgerMenuWhen search suggestions are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.SearchSearchSign InQuick LinksNewsSportsRadioMusicListen LiveTVWatchnewsTop StoriesLocalClimateWorldCanadaPoliticsIndigenousBusinessThe NationalHealthEntertainmentScienceCBC News InvestigatesGo PublicAbout CBC NewsBeing Black in CanadaMore Experts say bird flu threat small despite Cambodian fatality | CBC News LoadedHealthExperts say bird flu threat small despite Cambodian fatalityA top World Health Organization official, reacting to the death of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia infected by bird flu, said on Friday that the recent global spread of the virus and human infections are "worrying."Influenza leaders, vaccine manufacturers discuss threat posed to human healthThe Associated Press · Posted: Feb 24, 2023 2:24 PM EST | Last Updated: February 25, 2023Government workers wear protective gear to collect poultry for slaughter during an outbreak of avian influenza on the Ivory Coast. Dozens of countries are reporting cases of the deadly H5N1 strain during a months-long global outbreak that has spilled over from birds into other mammals and humans. (Legnan Koula/EPA-EFE)Social SharingA top World Health Organization official, reacting to the death of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia infected by bird flu, said on Friday that the recent global spread of the virus and human infections are "worrying."Dr. Sylvie Briand, WHO's director for epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, said the United Nations agency is "in close communication with the Cambodian authorities to understand more about the outbreak."Speaking ahead of a meeting in Geneva on influenza vaccines, Briand called the global situation concerning the virus "worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world, and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including humans."WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries," she said.Independent experts also have expressed concern over a wave of bird flu, or avian flu, that has spread through much of the world since late 2021, posing a potential public health risk.The Cambodian girl, from a village in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, died Wednesday at a hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh, shortly after tests confirmed she had Type A H5N1 bird flu, according to Cambodia's Health Ministry. She had fallen ill on Feb. 16, and when her condition declined she was sent to the hospital with a fever as high as 39 C, with coughing and throat pain.WATCH | 'Explosive' avian flu surge hits global bird populations: 'Explosive' avian flu surge hits global bird populations2 years agoDuration 2:02Global bird populations are being ravaged by a deadly strain of avian flu, wiping out flocks of domestic poultry and killing wild birds. Some researchers warn the virus could eventually evolve to better infect humans and potentially start a future pandemic.The girl's father tested positive for the virus but has not displayed any major symptoms, health authorities said Friday.Health Ministry spokesperson Ly Sovann told The Associated Press that the Cambodian father's case is under investigation, and it was not yet known how he became infected. He has been put in isolation at a local district hospital for monitoring and treatment.A ministry team collected samples from 12 people from the dead girl's village known to have had direct contact with her, and laboratory tests confirmed Friday that only her father was infected.Briand was speaking ahead of a meeting with scientists, regulators and vaccine manufacturers who meet twice a year to decide which strain of seasonal flu to include in the vaccine for the coming winter season — in this case for the northern hemisphere.At this week's meeting, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was a key topic, WHO and global flu experts said. Experts have been tracking H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b since it emerged in 2020, and recent reports of mass deaths in infected mammals from seals to bears.Experts discussed vaccines, virus strainsExperts also discussed potential vaccine development.WHO-affiliated labs already hold two flu virus strains that are closely related to the circulating H5N1 virus, which could be used by vaccine manufacturers to create a human vaccine if needed. One of them was added after the previous WHO flu meeting in September 2022, and the experts decided at this week's meeting to add another subtype that more closely matches the virus spreading among animals.Bird flu keeps spreading beyond birds. Scientists worry it signals a growing threat to humans, tooIn Ontario, worries of an even deadlier pandemic start with chickensA number of companies that produce seasonal flu vaccines can also make pandemic flu vaccines. For example, GSK and CSL Seqirus are already working with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to test shots based on one of the closely related strains.Having these strains ready could save about two months in the development of a vaccine, said WHO's Briand.But getting enough vaccine developed quickly would still remain a challenge in a pandemic situation, the experts said.B.C. warns doctors to watch for avian flu spreading to humans after spike in cases in birdsSecond OpinionHow deadly bird flu sparked explosive outbreaks in 2022 — and why it matters for global healthBird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads between sick poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The recent detection of infections in a variety of mammals, including at a large mink farm in Spain, has raised concern among experts that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people — and potentially trigger a pandemic.Threat to humans remains low, officials sayHealth professionals have expressed concern about a wave of bird flu that has spread worldwide in the past year and a half, but they consider the current risk to humans to be low."There has been a massive global challenge of wild and domestic birds with the current H5N1 avian influenza virus over the last few months and years, which will have exposed many humans; despite this, what is remarkable is how few people have been infected," Prof. James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at England's University of Cambridge, said in an emailed statement."Tragic though this case in Cambodia is, we expect there to be some cases of clinical disease with such a widespread infection. Clearly the virus needs careful monitoring and surveillance to check that it has not mutated or recombined, but the limited numbers of cases of human disease have not increased markedly, and this one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed."According to the World Health Organization, there were 56 bird flu cases in humans in Cambodia from 2003 until 2014, and 37 of them were fatal. Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to WHO in 21 countries, for an overall case fatality rate of 53 per cent.Avian flu suspected in deaths of 3 swans in Stratford, Ont.Hundreds of dead gulls found as 'unprecedented' avian flu outbreak continues in Nova ScotiaBut the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds."Between 2005 and 2020, 246 million poultry died or were culled because of avian influenza," said the World Organization for Animal Health."Since October 2021, an unprecedented number of outbreaks has been reported in several regions of the world, reaching new geographical areas and causing devastating impacts on animal health and welfare," the Paris-based agency says on its website.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees that the current H5N1 outbreak is mostly an animal health issue."However, people should avoid direct and close contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry and wild animals," it warns on its website. "People should not consume uncooked or undercooked poultry or poultry products, including raw eggs. Consuming properly cooked poultry, poultry products, and eggs is safe."With files from ReutersCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.A vital dose of the week's news in health and medicine, from CBC Health.

Over the past two years, the lethal pathogen has devastated bird populations in unprecedented numbers and has more recently jumped into mammals including mink, foxes and sealions.There are also signs it may be mutating, which could eventually enable H5N1 to spread efficiently in humans.The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday it was “concerned” the current outbreak may be spreading between people and ordered a new vaccine for humans to be made in response to the rapid spread of the virus.Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency confirmed it is drawing up hypothetical Covid-style modelling to see what might happen if the virus started to people.Earlier in the week Sir Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist designate of the WHO, called for governments to urgently organise influenza vaccines and other countermeasures.The young girl who died of the virus in Cambodia lived in a village in Prey Veng province, a region 60 miles southeast of the capital Phnom Penh, and close to the border with Vietnam. According to the Ministry of Health, the child developed flu-like symptoms on February 16, including a cough and sore throat. As these became more severe she was sent to the National Pediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh, where she later died. On Friday, authorities announced that her 49-year-old father – one of 12 close contacts tested – had also been infected.An emergency response team has been sent to Roleang village, where the family lived, and 11 other people who had contact with the girl have been tested are waiting results. Previous media reports suggested four of these individuals had flu-like symptoms, but there is not yet any evidence of human-to-human transmission, say experts.“The value of tracking those [11 cases] is to make sure there’s no further human-to-human transmission – that's where the worry is,” said Prof Ruklanthi de Alwis, deputy director of the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “That’s why there’s so much focus on this cluster – [human-to-human transmission is] something we need to prevent at the get go, to prevent this turning into a larger outbreak.”Officials believe it is likely that the young girl caught the virus from dead birds or animals near her home, as an “irregular number of dead wild animals” were found nearby – including 22 chickens and 3 ducks. Samples have been taken to a laboratory for testing. Human cases of H5N1 are not uncommon. Since 2003, 868 confirmed infections in people and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organisation, from 21 countries. This includes 57 infections and 37 fatalities in Cambodia – before this week, the most recent detection in the southeast Asian country was in 2014. A market worker checks his phone as he lies on a cage of live chickens at the Khlong Toei wet market in Bangkok Credit: JACK TAYLOR Most of these cases have involved close contact with birds – for instance at a farm or wet market. Last month, health officials traced an infection in a nine-year-old in rural Ecuador to backyard poultry – the child was hospitalised and survived. Limited human-to-human transmission has been recorded before; in 1997, officials in Hong Kong confirmed 18 cases of H5N1, which, in some instances, spread between people. Then, the virus died out without sparking a broader epidemic. “There have been small outbreaks in the past, but they haven’t spread in the broader community,” said Prof David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “What we need to be watching for… is any unexplained cases, which can’t be traced back to an infected human, bird or mammal.”He added that the Hong Kong outbreak is thought to have started when infected but asymptomatic geese made their way to a wet market, where they infected chickens in neighbouring cages and the people nearby. Why scientists fear H5N1 in mammals The unconfirmed cluster in Cambodia comes amid heightened concern at the trajectory of the current H5N1 outbreak, as the virus is increasingly infecting and spreading between mammals.“There are two ways H5N1 can change – the mutations it accumulates itself over a period of time, or the mutations it develops as it links with other species,” says Prof Heymann.“Influenza can recombine with other viruses… if human influenza and H5N1 get into the same cell in a mammal and recombines in a certain way – with the transmission of a human virus and virulence of an avian virus – it would be very dangerous.”Prof Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, added: “The spread among birds already was unprecedented. But particularly the stories about transmission into a mink farm in Spain, where it really looks like there was spread between animals, that is kind of a warning sign – because that is what these viruses normally do not do.“We do see that as an indication of the potential that this could also happen in people,” she told the Economist last week. Bird flu spread The outbreak in mink took place in October, when H5N1 leapt from wild birds in north-west Spain to thousands of farmed animals. Within weeks, more than four per cent had died from haemorrhagic pneumonia caused by the virus. Workers were given antiviral drugs and placed in quarantine – none were infected – and 50,000 minks were promptly culled. In a Eurosurveillance report published last month, scientists said that genetic sequencing had revealed that the mink carried the “PB2” gene – one similar to that found when avian flu jumped to pigs over a decade ago.“Globally, we are concerned about the continued reports of mammalian cases and potential mammal-to-mammal spread,” Dr Michelle Wille, an expert in avian viruses at the University of Sydney, told the Telegraph. “In most of the mammalian cases where the virus has been sequenced, we have seen a specific mutation in the PB2 gene, which allows the virus to replicate at a different body condition… The mutation is cropping up more because there are more mammalian cases, which is likely [because of] the staggering number of avian cases.” She added that in experiments in ferrets from a decade ago, scientists identified a handful of mutations that would be needed to allow for efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission. Unlike PB2, these have not yet been spotted in nature – but the more transmission that occurs, the greater the risk that this could occur. Credit: SERNANP / AFP/Scientists at the Paracas National Reserve inspecting a dead sea lion in Peru, where more than 700 have died from bird flu And the deaths of at least 716 sea lions in protected areas across Peru, where more than 60,000 birds have died since November, has raised further alarms that the virus may be getting “fitter” in new species. Sequencing of the H5N1 virus detected in these sea lions – which could shed light on how so many have been infected – has not yet taken place. But scientists investigating the outbreak have warned “the possible transmission pathways remain unknown” and “we cannot rule out that the virus has adapted to mammals and that sea lion-sea lion transmission has begun in Peru”. “If transmission between mammals have started, the virus has changed and this could increase the risk for human health,” Dr Pablo Plaza, an expert in veterinary public health and epidemiology at the National University of Comahue in Argentina, and co-author of the first pre-print describing the sea lion outbreak, told the Telegraph.“Until now, this risk seems to be low – however, we must be alert since [the] virus is changing all the time. Several changes in the virus are needed to adapt to human-human transmission, so hopefully they will not occur,” he added. “However, we need strong surveillance and further research to evaluate and be prepared if this happens.”But experts warned that while it is possible to prepare for this outcome and mitigate the risks – for instance through rigorous contact tracing, tiger biosecurity on farms, and better surveillance in risk areas such as wet markets – it is impossible to predict how H5N1 will unfold.“No one can say the risk is low, high or intermediate,” said Prof Heymann. “A mutation or spillover is a chance event… where all the risk factors line up in such a way that a new virus can be created… but it is unpredictable.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Poppy Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024Bird Flu in Humans: Girl Dies of H5N1 Flu in Cambodia, Father Positive - Business Insider Menu icon A vertical stack of three evenly spaced horizontal lines.

Advertisement An 11-year-old girl has died in Cambodia from bird flu, health authorities in the country said.The girl initially fell ill with a high fever and cough on February 16 and later died in the National Children's Hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital city, on Wednesday, the authorities said, per Reuters.The case comes amid an outbreak of bird flu that has lead to the deaths of more than 200 million birds worldwide since early 2022, either from disease or mass culls, the World Organisation for Animal Health told Reuters. Advertisement The bird flu strain "H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A" or "H5N1" has infected 868 people since it was first detected in humans in 1997, and 457 of those confirmed cases died, according to the World Health Organization. Officials in Cambodia said that the girl was the first human case in a Southeast Asian country since 2014, per Reuters.Officials believe that the young girl caught the virus from dead wild birds or animals near her home in the Prey Veng province in south Cambodia, close to the border with Vietnam — 22 chickens and three ducks were found dead nearby, per The Telegraph.Officials have taken samples from those birds as well as at least 12 people who came into contact with the girl, according to Reuters. As of Friday, the girl's father had tested positive for the virus, but we don't know how he caught it. Advertisement Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, UK, told the Science Media Centre on Friday that human infections are rare, and the likelihood of onward human to human transmission was "very low.""There is always a risk of human infection, particularly in people in close contact with poultry or wild birds, and this risk increases during times where circulation of avian influenza is particularly high, as it is now," he said. Related stories Humans don't usually catch bird flu, but it can be deadlyH5N1 causes fever, cough, and then can rapidly progress to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome — a life-threatening condition when fluid builds up in the tiny air sacs in the lungs — and multi-organ failure, according to the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. It states that 50% of people who catch it die, but that figure can vary between countries. Advertisement James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, UK, told the SMC that many people will have been exposed to H5N1 in recent years, but only a few had caught it."This one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed," he said. Ball said that the risk to humans is still "very low." Advertisement Experts, including Ball and Wood, told the SMC that H5N1 needs to be closely monitored, in part due to recent reports of it infecting mammals like sea lions in Peru."There are two ways H5N1 can change – the mutations it accumulates itself over a period of time, or the mutations it develops as it links with other species," David Heymann, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,UK, told The Telegraph.But he cautioned that "no one can say the risk is low, high or intermediate," because a mutation or "spillover" from another species was an unpredictable, "chance event." Advertisement "By far the most likely scenario for H5N1 is that nothing happens right now," Francois Balloux, the director of the UCL Genetics Institute, UK, tweeted on Friday.

Offenders will be fined HK$5,000 (US$637) on the spot.The decision came hot on the heels of Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po’s renewed pledge to revive a Covid-hit economy in his latest budget blueprint unveiled earlier on Wednesday.Government pandemic adviser Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai on Thursday voiced support for the extension, saying influenza viruses could be better contained under warmer temperatures.“When we lift the mask mandate, there is likely to be a resurgence of flu cases,” he warned. “But if we scrap the mask mandate in warmer weather, the virus will be less active and the risk of developing complications will be lower.”He added the city’s population had a weaker immunity against influenza and other upper respiratory tract infections due to limited exposure in the past few years.AdvertisementHung suggested removing the outdoor mask mandate in early March, after the current extension expires, and to further drop the indoor requirement in April if there was no significant surge in influenza or related infections.AdvertisementAn avian flu outbreak is spreading to mammals – what is the risk to humans?

The current threat to humans is low, but we should remain alert to the changing nature of the virus. Published on the 21 Feb 2023 by Ben Knight The latest outbreak is not a cause for alarm in humans at this stage. Photo: Shutterstock. Media contact Ben KnightUNSW Media & Content(02) 9065 4915b.knight@unsw.edu.au Avian influenza – or bird flu, as it’s commonly known – continues to run through bird populations, killing millions of animals worldwide. Now, a particularly infectious and lethal strain of the virus called H5N1 appears to be spreading to mammals, with cases reported in wild otters, foxes, seals and in farmed minks. While transmission from an infected bird to another animal is not uncommon, it is unusual for the virus to spread between mammals, as is suspected with the H5N1 outbreak in minks. The virus not only appears to have passed from mink to mink, but in doing so, may have developed genetic mutations which could help it better infect other mammals. Professor Bill Rawlinson, a virologist from the School of Biomedical Sciences, UNSW Medicine & Health, says the situation remains an issue with animal health but is not a cause for alarm in humans at this stage. “The worry is a deadly H5N1 strain could mutate in a mammal like a mink and become more adaptable to people, but it doesn’t appear we’re on the cusp of that at the moment,” Prof. Rawlinson says. While we’re still likely several steps away from a human-adapted version of the virus, there may be more chances that people will encounter it. “The overall risk of contracting it is quite low, but the risk may be slightly higher for those who have close unprotected contact with infected birds and their saliva, mucous, and faeces in industries like poultry,” Prof. Rawlinson says. A low, but anticipated threat Since its emergence in the mid-1990s, scientists and health authorities have worried about the potential of H5N1 to evolve into a pandemic. Still, the threat remains low, and no human-to-human transmission has ever been recorded. “Avian flu tends not to infect people because it simply can’t bind as well in humans, so you’re almost certainly not going to be infected by it walking around today in Australia,” Prof. Rawlinson says. The transmission of H5N1 between minks has raised some concerns about the potential of the virus to spread. Photo: Shutterstock. However, in the rare instances H5N1 has jumped the species barrier and infected humans, it has been deadly. According to the World Health Organization, over half of the 868 cases of human infection with H5N1 since 2003 have been fatal. Prof. Rawlinson says the current situation would be more worrying if there were signs the virus was spreading between mammals more genetically similar to humans, such as other primates. “Pigs would be the other concern as they can be more easily infected with both human and avian flu strains, so may have potential to pass a super strain on to humans,” Prof. Rawlinson says. “Thankfully, that doesn’t always seem to be the primary way avian infections cause human infections and hasn’t been as much of an issue as we’ve feared to this point.” Monitoring the risks of animal viruses Prof. Rawlinson says we should continue with routine preparedness measures in case the virus changes and becomes a more significant threat to human health. This includes strengthening a One Health System, with all health professionals, from doctors and vets to virologists and epidemiologists, working closely together to assess changing risks. “We should continue sampling and testing wild birds and poultry, which is essential to be on top of any early signals if the situation is changing,” Prof. Rawlinson says. “If you do have regular contact with birds, and you observe sudden unexplained changes, it’s essential to talk to a local vet or contact The Ministry of Health, so they can investigate. “We also need to be on the lookout for people with unexpected, undiagnosed pneumonia-like infections.” Prof. Rawlinson also says it’s also essential people get vaccinated for the flu every year, which may reduce the capacity for a person to host, and mix, avian and human strains. “It’s not so much about cross-protection with avian flu, although there may be a small amount. But by vaccinating against human flu, we’re less likely to see a mixing of avian and human flu strains. “People have been very switched on to vaccination with COVID-19, and that needs to extend to the human flu, especially as we’re likely to have another moderate to severe outbreak this year.” Ultimately, Prof. Rawlinson says the virus should warn us about the need to be wary of the increasing presence of zoonotic – animal-derived – diseases in our world. “There are a range of zoonotic viruses, not just avian flu, that seem to be becoming part of a more regular cycle between animals and humans,” Prof. Rawlinson says. “That doesn’t mean they will always be a pandemic risk, but we should be continuing to monitor these events and be prepared to respond to any pandemic risk.” Top UNSW.edu.au Engage with us Contact us Find an expert Careers at UNSW Education at UNSW Alumni Study UNSW International Degree Finder Student Portal Academic Calendar News, Media & Events Newsroom UNSW events Research news About us Our rankings & reputation Faculties and schools Campus locations Centres and institutes UNSW Library UNSW Sydney NSW 2052 Australia Telephone: +61 2 93851000 UNSW CRICOS Provider Code: 00098G TEQSA Provider ID: PRV12055 ABN: 57 195 873 179 Acknowledgement of Country UNSW is located on the unceded territory of the Bidjigal (Kensington campus), Gadigal (City and Paddington Campuses) and Ngunnawal peoples (UNSW Canberra) who are the Traditional Owners of the lands where each campus of UNSW is situated.

And unfortunately, dog flu cases are on the rise right now.We spoke to veterinarian Ivana Crnec, DVM at Veterinarians.org via email, about dog flu symptoms, the vaccine, and preventative measures you can take to protect your fur babies. Article continues below advertisementHer words of wisdom are reassuring and incredibly helpful for pet parents concerned about this doggy epidemic.Source: Getty ImagesArticle continues below advertisementWhat are the symptoms of dog flu?Canine influenza — aka the dog flu — is different from the influenza viruses that spread through humans. It’s caused by H3N8 and H3N2, according to the New York Post, which are both Type A viruses. Humans can't contract it, and fortunately, it generally isn't fatal.However, it's important to be aware of symptoms, should your pup get infected."In terms of symptoms [the dog flu] manifests with runny nose and eyes, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and fever," Crnec tells us, saying it can take a few weeks for them to recover.To prevent it from worsening, dogs showing symptoms are recommended to get immediate medical attention, as any dog breed of any size can catch it from another infected dog.Article continues below advertisementSource: Getty ImagesThere's a dog flu vaccine, but it's in short supply.Because dog flu cases are on the rise, Zoetis — which is the sole manufacturer of the vaccine — is facing a major supply shortage at this time, per WJACTV. "The current shortage of canine influenza vaccines is the result of another company pulling out of the market several months ago, and this has impacted Zoetis and our ability to meet the increased demand," reads a statement from the company. Article continues below advertisement"We are the only manufacturer currently supplying these vaccines to the market, and this type of biologics product (vaccine) requires a good deal of lead time for planning, production, and quality testing. While short-term disruptions are still happening, we expect the supply situation to stabilize this spring."Similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, the dog flu won't give your dog guaranteed immunity. However, it ensures that if they do become infected, the symptoms won't be quite as bad."The vaccine does not prevent infections 100 percent, but it reduces both the severity and duration of the disease," Crnec explains.Article continues below advertisementSource: Getty ImagesPreventative measures to take against the dog flu:Even though dodging the dog flu seems difficult right now, especially for pups that frequent the dog park, securing the vaccine as soon as possible is crucial in protecting your pup. Crnec says it's not considered mandatory by vets, but it's highly recommended for dogs that frequent parks, day care, or other crowded areas."The best way of preventing the flu is vaccinating your dog and then keeping it up to date on the vaccine," she says. "The flu vaccine is labeled as a 'lifestyle' meaning it is not essential to all dogs. However, it is highly recommended for dogs going to kennels, boarding facilities, dog parks, dog shows, and other dog-crowded places."So until the vaccine comes out, pet parents should consider one-on-one playdates for the foreseeable future.AdvertisementMore from Green MattersNetflix's New Docuseries, 'Cat People,' Features a Cat Rapper, a Cat Surfer, and MoreAmazing Rehabilitation Program Has Incarcerated People Training Rescue Dogs (Exclusive)Pet Insurance: Is It Worth It?Latest Pets News and UpdatesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementABOUT Green MattersAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCASitemapCONNECT with Green MattersLink to FacebookLink to XLink to InstagramContact us by EmailOpt-out of personalized ads© Copyright 2024 Engrost, Inc.

LivemintUpdated23 Feb 2023, 04:20 PM ISTAvian influenza detected in samples from govt poultry farm in Bokaro. (File Photo: AFP)New Delhi: The ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal, has detected Avian influenza (H5N1) in samples received from a government poultry farm at Bokaro, Jharkhand. “Avian influenza (H5N1) was detected by the ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal from the samples received from Government Poultry Farm at Bokaro, Jharkhand on 17 February 2023 and the Department has issued notification on 20th February 2023,” the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying said in a statement.The last occurrence of bird flu was reported in Godda district of Jharkhand in January 2019. The state has been advised to carry out control and containment operations as per the Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (2021).A two-member central team has been deputed to assist the state in control and containment operations. Also, the Union health ministry has deputed a central team for surveillance in human sector. “Secretary, AHD, Government of India, had telephonic discussion with Secretary, Animal Husbandry, Government of Jharkhand regarding appropriate preventive measures and assured all support from Government of India,” it said. The ministry added that the commissioner of central animal husbandry department had a discussion with state departments of Jharkhand and West Bengal and has advised on measures to contain the spread of the disease.Further, a virtual meeting with the concerned officials of the State Animal Husbandry Department of Jharkhand was also held for sensitising all before initiation of control and containment measure.Compensation is paid to farmers whose poultry birds, eggs and poultry feed are culled/disposed off by the state as per the action plan. The Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) provides funds to the states and union territories on a 50:50 sharing basis under ASCAD component of its LH & DCP Scheme.According to the ministry, the state has been advised to maintain sufficient stock of PPE kits and other accessories required for culling operations. “The state is requested to coordinate with the departments of Health and Forest and sensitise them about Avian Influenza. State is also requested to submit daily report to this Department on the control measures taken by them,” it said, adding that the situation will constantly monitored.Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

The NHS website does warn of certain strains: “Although H5N1, H7N9 and H5N6 don’t infect people easily and aren’t usually spread from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number ofRelated articlesUK NEWSBird flu found in otters and foxesFebruary 02 2023, 12.05pmRhys Blakely, Science CorrespondentJIM DIXON | NATURE NOTEBOOKGathering geese say boo to flu in the FirthDecember 16 2022, 9.00pmJim DixonGene-edited chickens to beat bird fluDecember 05 2022, 12.01amKieran AndrewsPROMOTED CONTENTBack to topGet in touchAbout usContact usHelpThe Times Editorial ComplaintsThe Sunday Times Editorial ComplaintsPlace an announcementClassified advertisingDisplay advertisingThe Times correctionsThe Sunday Times correctionsCareersMore from The Times and The Sunday TimesThe Times e-paperThe Sunday Times e-paperThe Sunday Times Wine ClubTimes Print GalleryThe Times ArchiveTimes Crossword ClubSunday Times DrivingTimes+The Sunday Times Rich ListTravelGood University GuideSchools GuideNewslettersBest Places to LiveBest Places to StayTimes AppointmentsPodcastsTimes Money MentorTimes LuxurySportswomen of the Year AwardsBest Places to WorkPuzzlesMore from News CorpThe AustralianBarron'sDow JonesFinancial News LondonInvestor's Business DailyMansion GlobalMarketWatchRealtor.comThe SunTimes Literary SupplementThe Wall Street Journal© Times Media Limited 2024.Registered in England No. 894646.

Representative photo: iStock.ShagunPublished on: 23 Feb 2023, 5:43 amCopiedThe ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal, has detected avian influenza (H5N1) from the samples received from a government poultry farm at Bokaro, Jharkhand. This comes a day after reports of deaths of over 500 chickens in the state in the past week. ICAR-NIHSAD received the samples on February 17, 2023. The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has advised the state government to carry out the control and containment operations in accordance with the Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (2021), including culling to stop the spread. IN PHOTOS: Bird flu spreads to mammalian speciesThe Jharkhand government had put all poultry farms and such facilities on high alert after bird flu cases were reported in the government-run poultry farm. Two species of chickens — Kadaknath and RIR — are kept on this farm and deaths were reported in both. Avian influenza, also called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds. Wild birds can carry the virus without showing symptoms of it and transmit it to poultry through their feathers or faeces. The H5N1 strain is known to be more infectious and fatal to poultry and more persistent in wild bird populations.The first instance of Avian influenza was reported in the Godda district of Jharkhand in January 2019. The Department of Animal Husbandry (AHD) has deputed a two-member central team to assist the state in the control and containment operations. Also, the Ministry of Health has deputed its central team to overview the surveillance in the human sector. Also read: H5 pandemic in the making? Minks may become the bird flu vector for humans“Secretary, AHD, Government of India had telephonic discussion with Secretary, Animal Husbandry, Government of Jharkhand regarding appropriate preventive measures and assured all support from Government of India,” a statement by the ministry of animal husbandry said.Animal Husbandry Commissioner had a discussion with the state animal husbandry departments of Jharkhand and West Bengal and advised for effective control measures so that the disease doesn’t spread to other parts, it added. “Further, animal husbandry commissioner took a virtual meeting with the concerned officials of the state animal husbandry department of Jharkhand for sensitising all before initiation of control and containment measures as per the Action Plan,” the statement read.The statement also said compensation will be paid to the farmers whose poultry birds, eggs and poultry feed are culled/disposed of by the state as per the action plan. Also read: Bird flu: UK is seeing its largest ever outbreak – which may prove particularly deadly for wild birdsThe state was also advised to maintain sufficient stock of PPE kits and other accessories required for culling operations and submit a daily report to the department on the control measures taken by them.The spread of H5N1 has been reported in other countries too recently. In fact, the virus, which is not known to spread among mammals easily, led to the culling of 50,000 minks in Spain last October, indicating that the virus is evolving and may be gaining pandemic potential. The findings published January 19, 2023, indicated at least one mutation in the virus’ genome, which may make mammal-to-mammal infection easier. Typically, mammals catch avian influenza directly from infected birds.Read more: Bird flu scare in Kerala: What’s pushing sudden rise in cases again?

The WHO warns that even if the world is more prepared than for COVID, "we are not yet prepared enough". Josephine Franks News reporter @jos_franks Friday 24 February 2023 13:54, UK Image: Pic: AP Why you can trust Sky News A COVID-style plan for dealing with bird flu is being drawn up by health officials, modelling what would happen if the virus starts spreading between humans.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says there is "no evidence so far that the virus is getting better at infecting humans or other mammals" but warned the high level of transmission in birds presents a "constant risk". To make sure the country is prepared for a possible bird flu outbreak in humans, health officials are modelling scenarios of human transmission.It comes after an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died from bird flu. The girl's father also tested positive for the virus but it is unclear whether he caught the virus from his daughter or through contact with an infected bird.At least 11 other people in the country have also been tested. Analysis:Bird flu infections in humans 'still rare' despite Cambodian girl's deathIf this is an example of human-to-human transmission, it would be one of the first instances of that happening.There has been some evidence of people catching the virus from family members or in healthcare setting, the UKHSA said, but no or little evidence of "sustained" transmission between humans.The UKHSA is modelling what happens if that changes, looking at two scenarios: a mild scenario where the infection-fatality rate is similar to COVID, at about 0.25%, and a more severe scenario similar to the 1918 flu pandemic, where about 2.5% of people who caught the virus died. Advertisement That would mean under the mild scenario, one in 400 people with the virus would die, and under the severe scenario one in 40 infected people would die.

The virus has already jumped from birds to otters, foxes and cats, while an outbreak at a mink farm prompted fears the virus was spreading between animals."We are more prepared (than for COVID), but even if we are more prepared, we are not yet prepared enough," Sylvie Briand, WHO director of global infectious hazard preparedness, said ahead of the meeting."We need to really continue the efforts for a flu pandemic."

Avian Influenza in India: The latest major avian flu outbreak in 2020-2021 swept through many States causing mass mortality of wild birds. Challenges for India:India is a major wintering ground for many waterfowl that rely on the central Asian Flyway.Fastest growing egg producer in the world.Unlike in Europe, poultry birds here are not vaccinated against the flu.Farms with a diversity of animals or in the vicinity of wetlands increase the potential for the viruses to generate more virulent strains – H5N1/H7N9 – which could infect humans. There is no active surveillance in the poultry sector.There is no efficient mechanism for how wetland and waterfowl habitats at the interface of poultry need to be monitored.Environmental surveillance – Meaning and need: Meaning: It can improve knowledge of the presence and diversity of avian influenza viruses in domestic flocks that are allowed to roam/in confinement where waste products like faeces, etc. are released into the environment. Need:Birds infected with the virus shed large quantities of virus in their faeces, saliva, and nasal secretions for about a week.Zoonotic potential: Transmission from dead birds to scavenging animals such as sea lions, and foxes, has posed serious risks.Recently, the intra-mammal transmission of H5N1 (in mink farms) was recorded.Lakes and wetlands can act as environmental reservoirs for several months. Way ahead: An active and passive year-round surveillance network under One Health which connects monitoring of humans and animals in a shared environment. Conclusion: Currently, virus surveillance relies on sampling dead birds. Therefore, environmental surveillance would be a great non-invasive tool that can be done without disturbing the birds and can be used to obtain both host and viral genetic material.

The Jharkhand government is on alert after bird flu cases were reported in a government-run poultry farm in Bokaro district, officials said on Tuesday. More than 400 chickens died in the last five days in the government poultry farm located in Lohanchal, Sector 12 of Bokaro district in Jharkhand after being affected by Bird Flu, a Kolkata lab has confirmed. Avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds (especially wild water fowl such as ducks and geese). Wild birds can carry the virus without showing symptoms of it and transmit it to poultry through their feathers or faeces. The main risk factor for humans is possible via direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. Experts claim that slaughtering, de-feathering, preparing poultry for consumption, and handling carcasses of infected poultry, especially in household settings can aggravate risk factors. Notably, the avian influenza A virus in humans has an incubation period averaging from two to five days and can go up to 17 days. Symptoms of avian influenza? According to US CDC, the reported signs of avian influenza A virus infections in humans have ranged from mild to severe influenza-like illness. The common symptoms of Bird flu are -- Fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Severe respiratory illnesses such as shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Neurologic changes such as altered mental status, and seizures. How to prevent avian influenza? Good hygiene can prove effective in keeping avian influenza at bay. Some of the tips are – Wash cutting boards, utensils and all surfaces that come in direct contact with raw poultry using hot, soapy water. Chicken dishes should be cooked for minimum 30 minutes. The chicken must reach a minimum internal temperature of 165 F (74C) Avoid eating raw or undercooked eggs as eggshells can be contaminated with bird droppings.
