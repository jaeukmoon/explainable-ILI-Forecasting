- Researchers have developed a pentavalent broadly protective nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against influenza B viruses.
- The vaccine is based on the lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA platform.
- The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their ability to protect against both ancestral and recent influenza B viruses from different antigenic lineages.
- The pentavalent vaccine showed promising results, protecting mice from morbidity at a low dose after a single vaccination.
- These findings support the further development of nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines expressing multiple conserved antigens as universal influenza virus vaccine candidates.
