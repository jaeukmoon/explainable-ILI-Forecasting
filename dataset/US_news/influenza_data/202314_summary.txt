- Seasonal influenza outbreaks continue to be a public health concern, causing hospitalizations and deaths among high-risk groups.
- Understanding the transmission dynamics of influenza is crucial for designing effective control measures and reducing the burden of outbreaks.
- A study analyzed surveillance data from Kamigoto Island, Japan, a semi-isolated island population, to identify drivers of influenza transmission during outbreaks.
- Pre-school and school-aged children were found to be at the highest risk of getting infected with influenza.
- The number of imported cases was consistently higher in the most populated and busy districts on the island.
- Lower local vaccination coverage and higher number of inhabitants in districts were associated with more secondary transmissions.
- Being younger than 18 years old and infection with influenza type A were also associated with higher numbers of onwards transmissions.
- Individual vaccination status did not show an association with onwards transmissibility.
