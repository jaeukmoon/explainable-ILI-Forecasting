But its antiviral function as well as the underlying regulatory mechanism has not been examined in vivo. In the present work, we show that PLSCR1 expression is decreased in H1N1 SIV-infected mice, and Plscr1−/− mice are more susceptible to H1N1 SIV infection. By performing yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor 1 (ILDR1) as a novel PLSCR1-binding partner. ILDR1 is highly expressed in the lungs, and its expression level is increased after virus infection. Interestingly, ILDR1 could not directly interact with virus NP protein, but could combine with PLSCR1 competitively. Our data indicates that there is a previously unidentified PLSCR1-ILDR1-NP regulatory pathway playing a vital role in limiting IAV infection, which provides novel insights into IAV-host interactions.

The swine-derived H1N1 influenza that broke out in 2009 caused severe flu-like symptoms with a variety of complications in humans, and was a substantial global health concern2. Swine have receptors for both human influenza (SAα-2,6-Gal) and avian influenza (SAα-2,3-Gal), hence are referred to as "mixers" of influenza viruses3. They play an important role in the recombination of influenza viruses. It is therefore important to understand the pathogenic mechanisms and how these may be used to prevent and control of swine influenza virus (SIV) infection.The negative-sense, single-stranded genome of IAV comprises eight segments of viral RNA, which are separately encapsidated into ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs). The virial RNA (vRNA) is bound to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RdRp) and encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (NP), forming the so-called vRNP complex4. The vRNP is the key to IAV life cycle and important for viral pathogenicity and host range determinants5. NP is essential for the translocation of vRNP into the nucleus of host cells and could be used as a target to block the replication of influenza virus specifically6,7. A series of host proteins have been reported to regulate nuclear entry through interacting with NP, such as α-actinin-48, CRM19, UAP5610, Hsp4011 and MOV1012, hence played important roles in promoting or inhibiting virus replication. So, identification of new NP-binding host proteins will help to provide new targets for prevention and/or control of influenza viruses.Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) was first identified as a calcium-binding type II membrane protein that could be induced by interferons and growth factors13. It is involved in multiple biological processes, such as gene transcription regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis14,15,16,17. Recently, the antiviral activity of PLSCR1 received extensive attentions. It has been reported that PLSCR1 could inhibit HBV infection and replication through mediating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HBx protein18, and mediates resistance of HCV infection through interacting with CORE by yeast two-hybrid screens[19]and interfering with the viral entry into host cells20. Also, it was reported that PLSCR1 forms a trimeric complex with NP and importin α, which inhibits the incorporation of importin β and suppress nuclear importation of NP, thereby inhibiting IAV replication21. However, the function of PLSCR1 in vivo has not been clarified. Besides, whether there are other interacting proteins affecting the binding of PLSCR1 and NP will also provide a new mechanism to play an inhibitory role in influenza virus.The interacting protein of PLSCR1 plays an important role in its antiviral effect. For example, PLSCR1 could interact with the CD4 receptor on the T lymphocyte membrane to inhibit HIV infection and interacts with the angiogenin (ANG )in the nucleus to regulate rRNA transcription22. Moreover, PLSCR1 also inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus through promoting the secretion of IFN23. We used yeast two-hybrid technology to screen whether there are other interacting factors in the complex of PLSCR1 binding to NP, and found immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (ILDR1) could interact with PLSCR1. ILDR1 is an evolutionally conserved type I transmembrane protein that contains immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. ILDR1 and its two paralogs, immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor 2(ILDR2) and lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor(LSR), have been identified as components of tricellular tight junctions (tTJs), specialized structures where the corners of three epithelial cells meet to form a barrier of the cellular sheet24. Our previous data showed that ILDR1 interacts with a series of splicing factors and regulates alternative splicing, and it was highly expressed in the lung, the target organ of influenza virus25. In this study, we used a combination of knockout mouse models and a series of experiments in vitro demonstrate that the role of PLSCR1 interacting with ILDR1 in regulating IAV infection by promoting the nuclear import of NP.ResultsPLSCR1 expression is decreased in mouse lungs after H1N1 SIV infectionPLSCR1 is a calcium ion-binding type II membrane protein, and is highly conserved among different species including human and pigs (Fig. 1A). QD-2018 strain is a type H1N1 SIV strain isolated from pigs in Shandong province of China26. This strain has very high homology with human influenza virus isolated in 2009, with the identity of the NP higher than 98.6% (Fig. 1B). This conservation allows us to use SIV in our following investigation of the IAV-associated disease.Figure 1PLSCR1 Expression after H1N1 SIV Infection. (A) The similarity of PLSCR1 between different species. (B) The identity percentage of nucleoprotein of influenza virus between the isolated strain from the diseased pigs and human. (C) Western blots showed that PLSCR1 expression in various tissues of C57BL/6 mice on day 42. (D) PLSCR1 and ILDR1protein levels in lung are modulated after swine influenza A virus (SIV) infection. The lungs were dissected from C57BL6/J mice that were either mock- or SIV-infected at multiple days p.i. as indicated. (E and F) The area of the PLSCR1 and ILDR1 peak, in relation to the standard curve, was determined using ImageJ software (n = 3). Bars represent mean ± s.d. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageWe first examined the expression level of PLSCR1 in the tissues of C57BL/6 mice by performing western blot. The results show that PLSCR1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues of mice (expect the heart and cerebrum) examined and has relatively high expression level in lung, the target organ of influenza virus (Fig. 1C). We then used 103 pfu H1N1 SIV to infect C57BL/6 J mice intranasally and examined PLSCR1 levels at different time points post infection. The results show that PLSCR1 expression is markedly decreased when examined at 1 day post infection (dpi) (Fig. 1D). PLSCR1 expression continues to decrease to less than 5% at 5 dpi, then gradually returns to the normal level by 14 dpi (Fig. 1D and E). This dynamic change of PLSCR1 expression suggests that PLSCR1 might play an essential role in SIV infection in vivo.H1N1 SIV replication is increased in Plscr1 knockout miceIn order to investigate the functions of PLSCR1 during Influenza A virus infection in vivo, we developed Plscr1 knockout mice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique. The mouse Plscr1 gene contains eight exons encoding 378 amino acids, and two sgRNAs were designed to target exon 4 (Fig. 2A). DNA sequencing revealed that a deletion of 122 bp was introduced into exon 4 in Plscr1 knockout mice, which causes a premature translational stop and gives rise to a potentially truncated protein of 43 amino acids (Fig. 2B). RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry results confirm that PLSCR1 expression is indeed disrupted in the homogenous knockout mice (Fig. 2C–E). Interbreeding of Plscr1+/− mice gave rise to offspring in the expected Mendelian ratio (23.8% wild-type, 47.6% Plscr1+/−, and 28.6% Plscr1−/−; n = 42) with normal viability, suggesting that PLSCR1 is dispensable for general development in mice.Figure 2Construction of Plscr1 knockout mice. (A) The schematic drawing of the strategy for Plscr1 gene disruption. The target sites of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in the Plscr1 gene are indicated in red, and the deleted region in the Plscr1 gene of knockout mice is indicated by dashes. The positions of RT-PCR primers are indicated by arrows. (B) The schematic drawing of the domain structure of PLSCR1 in wildtype and knockout mice. (C) The expression of Plscr1 mRNA in the tail of P42 mice was determined by RT-PCR. β-actin was included as the internal control. The corresponding size were respectively 636 bp, 514 bp corresponding to wild types and Plscr1-/- mice. (D) Western blot showed the expression in the liver and lung of P42 mice. (E) PLSCR1 was detected by immunohistology using rabbit anti-mPLSCR1, visualized with 3,3,-diaminobenzidine, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Scale bar: 20 μm. +/+ :wild type mice; +/− : heterozygous mice; −/−:Plscr1 knockout mice.Full size imageWe then examined whether Plscr1 knockout affects H1N1 SIV infection. Control and Plscr1−/− mice were infected intranasally with 103 pfu H1N1 SIV, and the survival rate, body weight and lung virus load were determined over a 28-day period. The results show that the survival rate of Plscr1−/− mice is much lower than that of control mice after SIV infection (Fig. 3A). Plscr1−/− mice start to die at 3 dpi, and the survival rate drops to 50% at 28 dpi. Meanwhile, similar body weight was observed between survived Plscr1−/− mice and control mice (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the decreased survival rate, higher lung viral load was observed in Plscr1−/− mice (Fig. 3C). Titers of SIV increase in the lungs of both genotypes and peak at 5 dpi, then start to decrease and not detectable at 14 and 28 dpi. Virus titers are significantly higher in Plscr1−/− mice at all time points examined (Fig. 3C). Consistently, western blotting shows that the level of NP in Plscr1−/− mice was significantly higher than that in wild mice at 3 dpi (Fig. 3D and E). Taken together, our present data suggest that H1N1 SIV replication is increased in Plscr1 knockout mice that leads to lower survival rate.Figure 3PLSCR1 influences the infection of mice by Swine influenza virus (SIV). (A) C57BL/6 J and Plscr1−/− mice were infected intranasally with 103 pfu SIV. Suviral was determined daily and calculated as a percentage of the initial total numbers. (B) Mice were weighed daily and the weights represented as a percentage of the starting weight (n = 7 per group). (C) Lung tissues were taken at multiple days p.i. as indicated and virus titer determined by plaque assay (n > 6 per group). Data represent the mean value ± SD. Asterisks indicate statistical difference (Unpaired t test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (D) Western blots showed that ILDR1 and NP protein expression in lung of C57BL/6 and Plscr1−/− mice on day 42 after infected with 103 pfu SIV for 3 days. (E) Statistical analysis of ILDR1 and NP levels in Plscr1−/− mice. The value for ILDR1 and NP were standardized to the GAPDH level and normalized to the level of ILDR1 and NP in lung of wild type mice. Data are shown as the means SD from three independent experiments (Unpaired t test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imageILDR1 is a novel PLSCR1-binding proteinIn our previous study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a chicken cDNA library using the C-terminal intracellular domain of ILDR1 (228–553 aa) as bait 24. Among the positive clones identified, five clones encode PLSCR1. We then performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to confirm the interaction between ILDR1 and PLSCR1. The results show that EGFP-tagged mouse ILDR1 cytoplasmic domain could be co-immunoprecipitated together with Myc-tagged PLSCR1 (Fig. 4A). Likewise, EGFP-tagged PLSCR1 could be co-immunoprecipitated together with Myc-tagged ILDR1 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 4B). ILDR1-EGFP mainly localizes in the cytoplasm in COS-7 cells as reported previously (Fig. 4C) 25. In contrast, PLSCR1-mCherry localizes in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 4D). When cotransfected, ILDR1-EGFP translocates from cytoplasm to nuclei with PLSCR1-Mcherry (Fig. 4E). Our co-IP and co-localization results suggest that ILDR1 is a novel PLSCR1-binding partner.Figure 4PLSCR1 binds ILDR1. (A) Western blots showing that EGFP-tagged cytoplasmic fragment of ILDR1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged PLSCR1. (B) Western blots showing that EGFP-taggedPLSCR1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged cytoplasmic fragment of ILDR1.

(D) PLSCR1-mCherry localize both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of COS7. (E) However, when PLSCR1-mCherry is present, ILDR1-GFP translocates into the nuclei. Expression vectors were transfected into COS-7 cells to express epitope-tagged proteins. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bar: 10 μm.Full size imageILDR1 promotes H1N1 SIV infection in cultured cellsIn order to explore the role of ILDR1 in influenza virus infection, we first determined the level of ILDR1 in C57BL/6 J mice after H1N1 SIV infection. Western blot results show that ILDR1 level is significantly increased by more than 15-fold on the first day after infection and then decreases as the viral load decreases (Fig. 1D and F). ILDR1 expression was also examined by performing immunohistology. ILDR1 is weakly expressed in the lungs of mice before infection, while a substantial increase of ILDR1-positive cells was observed at 3 dpi (Fig. 5A and B). The quantitative analysis shows a 3–sixfold (P < 0.05) increase in the percentage area stained in the lungs at 3 dpi. ILDR1 levels was restored to a normal level on 14 dpi (Fig. 5A and B). In addition, ILDR1 levels in Plscr1−/− mice were examined after SIV infection at 3 dpi. The results show that ILDR1 expression is up-regulated after viral infection in Plscr1−/− mice, suggesting that ILDR1 might play a role in Influenza virus infection (Fig. 3D).Figure 5ILDR1 Expression after swine influenza virus infection. (A) C57BL/6 J mice were infected intranasally with 103 pfu. SIV. The lungs of mice were taken after infection 0, 3 and14 days for immunohistochemical detection. ILDR1 was detected by immunohistology using rabbit anti-ILDR1, visualized with 3,3,-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Scale bar: 20 μm. The expression levels of the ILDR1 after infection relative to that of normal expression were analyzed by areal density (B). (C) HEK 293 T cells were infected with different doses(MOI = 0,0.01,0.1,1,10) for 48 h, and RNA were extracted, then the expression of ILDR1 was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Data represent the mean value ± SD. Asterisks indicate statistical difference (n = 3, Unpaired t test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (D) Expression of ILDR1 in virus-infected cells at an MOI of 0.1. RNA were extracted at different time points (0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h) and subjected to RT-qPCR. Data represent the mean value ± SD. Asterisks indicate statistical difference (n = 3, Unpaired t test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (E) Virus replication in ILDR1-overexpressing HEK293T cells. Cells were transfected with ILDR1-GFP or pEGFPN2 for 24 h, and then infected with SIV at an MOI of 0.1. RNA were extracted at the indicated time points, and virus titers or NP expression were determined by TCID50, CCK-8 (F) and RT-qPCR (G).Full size imageWe next analyzed the effect of ILDR1 on SIV infection in HEK 293 T cells. qRT-PCR results reveal that the expression of ILDR1 mRNA is significantly increased after SIV infection in a dosage- and time-dependent way (Fig. 5C and D). To examine the effect of ILDR1 overexpression, HEK293T cells were transfected with ILDR1-expressing vector or empty vector, followed by infection with SIV at an MOI of 0.1. The results show that SIV TCID50 and viral RNA are significantly increased in ILDR1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5E and G). Meanwhile, the viability of virus-infected cells is significantly decreased in ILDR1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5F). Taken together, our present data suggest that ILDR1 promotes H1N1 SIV infection.ILDR1 competes with NP in binding PLSCR1We transfected either ILDR1-Cter or PLSCR1 together with NP protein in HEK 293 T cells and examined their potential interaction by performing co-IP experiments. The results show that Myc-tagged PLSCR1 but not ILDR1-Cter is co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-tagged NP protein (Fig. 6A). Likewise, EGFP-tagged PLSCR1 but not ILDR1-Cter is co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged NP (Fig. 6B). We then moved on to examine whether ILDR1 and NP could interact with PLSCR1 simultaneously or compete with each other. We examined the interaction between NP and PLSCR1 in the presence of ILDR1 of increasing amounts. The results show that when the amount of ILDR1 is increased, the level of NP bound to PLSCR1 is decreased (Fig. 6C and D). Similar results were obtained when increasing amounts of NP was used (Fig. 6E and F).Figure 6The viral PLSCR1-NP interaction is inhibited by ILDR1. (A, B) No interaction of ILDR1 with viral NP as determined by the co-IP assays. The interaction between the ILDR1 Cter domain and the NP of SIV was validated using the co-IP assays.HEK293T cells were transfected with ILDR1and NP protein. The Myc-tagged PLSCR1 plasmids were used as positive controls. All cell lysates were prepared at 24 h post transfection and proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc mouse MAb, or anti-EGFP rabbit MAb. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. (C) HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-NP (0.5 μg), PLSCR1-pmCherry (0.5 μg) and different concentrations of EGFP-ILDR1 cytoplasmic fragment (0 μg,0.5 μg,1 μg,1.5 μg,2 μg). The cell lysates were prepared, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-PLSCR1 rabbit PAb. The expression levels of the ILDR1 and NP protein after immunoprecipitation relative to that of GAPDH were analyzed by densitometry, n = 3 (D). (E) HEK293T cells were transfected with EGFP-ILDR1 cytoplasmic fragment (0.5 μg), PLSCR1-pmCherry (0.5 μg) and different concentrations of Myc-NP (0 μg,0.5 μg,1 μg,1.5 μg,2 μg). The cell lysates were prepared, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-PLSCR1 rabbit PAb. The expression levels of the ILDR1 and NP protein after immunoprecipitation relative to that of GAPDH were analyzed by densitometry, n = 3 (F). (G) Cells were transfected with ILDR1-GFP, PLSCR1-Myc or empty retrovirus-transfected control for 24 h, and then infected with SIV at an MOI of 0.1. At 6 h p.i., the cells were separated into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic fractions (C). Each fraction was subjected to western blotting with corresponding antibody for protein detection. (H) Model of PLSCR1-NP interaction is competitively by ILDR1. ILDR1 located in the cytoplasm, when in the presence of PLSCR1, ILDR1 and PLSCR1 co-translocate into the nuclei. PLSCR1 could prevent the nuclear import of NP protein and ILDR1 could bind to PLSCR1 competitively with NP. So in the nuclei, the viral PLSCR1-NP interaction is inhibited by ILDR1.Full size imageIn order to further verify that ILDR1 and PLSCR1 will affect the nuclear importation of NP, a cell fractionation experiment was conducted. Cells were transfected with ILDR1-GFP, PLSCR1-Myc or empty plasmid—transfected control for 24 h, and then infected with SIV at a MOI of 0.1. At 6 h p.i., the cells were separated into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic fractions (C), then subjected to western blotting. The results show that, GAPDH and LaminB1 were only detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Also we found that NP was primarily detected in the cytoplasm and was only weakly detected in the nucleus while PLSCR1 was overexpressed as reported previously 21. In contrast, when we overexpressed ILDR1, it will promote the expression of NP protein into the nucleus. When ILDR1 and PLSCR1 were co-transfected, a considerable amount of NP was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 6G). Taken together, our present data suggest that ILDR1 and NP compete with each other in binding PLSCR1(Fig. 6H).DiscussionInfluenza A virus has caused several outbreaks of influenza in human history, including the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemics. As a single-strand negative-strand, segmented RNA virus, its high mutation rate and gene rearrangement properties can continuously produce new virus subtypes, imposing a long-term threat to human and animal health. Swine plays an important role in the recombination of influenza virus because of the characteristics of the receptors3. In 2009, the H1N1pdm09 IV pandemic broke out in the world, and researchers found that many of its gene fragments are derived from SIV1. Between 2011 and 2018, a predominant emergent Eurasian avian-like (EA) reassortant genotype 4 (G4) virus in pigs had pdm/09 and TR-derived internal genes and showed increasing human infectivity2. In addition, the H1N1 subtype SIV has always maintained a high prevalence rate in the pig herd 27, and has been involved in the recombination of a variety of new viruses during its evolution 28. Therefore, our work is of great significance for exploring the pathogenic mechanism of SIV. The experimental strain used in the present work was collected from a sick pig farm. It showed homology of more than 90% with the 2009 human epidemic strain and mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 stain. Also, the virus could infect mice and the half infection amount of the virus was10–4.48 by the Reed-Muench method. It thus models IAV-associated disease in humans and also allows for analysis over an extended time course.Influenza A virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex is the structural basis of viral RNA transcription and replication, and plays an important role in the process of virus infection29. During the early stage of viral infection, the vRNP complex is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell via endocytosis and demembrane, and then enters the nucleus with the help of nuclear localization signals and transport proteins30. To date, several host proteins have been reported to be potential binding partners of the vRNP complex, and regulate viral infection through various mechanisms5. In our experiment, we established Plscr1 knockout mice and found that it is indeed more susceptible to SIV. By examining the survival rate, body weight and lung virus load of the mice, we presented in vivo evidence for the first time that PLSCR1 is important for inhibiting influenza virus replication, which was consistent with the report of PLSCR1 negatively regulates virus replication by interacting with NP in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear import in vitro20. We also found that PLSCR1 is widely distributed in various tissues of mice (except heart and brain). Among these, PLSCR1 is highly expressed in the lung, the target organ of influenza virus. At the same time, we observed the higher bands of PLSCR1 in the cerebrum and cerebellum (approximately 55 kD) were initially detected, then we tested the expression of PLSCR1 in wild mice and Plscr1−/− mice by western blot, and found that this band still exists, so it is speculated that it may be a non-specific band. This results have also been verified by Sahu SK in human tissue31.The interaction protein of PLSCR1 plays an important role in its antiviral effect, so whether there are other proteins affecting the interaction between PLSCR1 and NP during influenza virus infection. We identified ILDR1 as a novel PLSCR1-binding partner by yeast two-hybrid. ILDR1 is a putative type I transmembrane protein containing an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain32. ILDR1 has been shown to mediate fat-stimulated cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion33 and play an important role in regulating the integration of tTJs23. Ildr1 knockout mice show profound hearing loss accompanied with tTJs destruction in the inner ear34,35 and polyuria due to renal concentrating defects in kidneys36. In our previous study, we detected high expression of ILDR1 in lungs of mice25. However, its function in the lungs and whether it participates in disease infection has not been reported so far. Therefore, we observed the role of ILDR1 in influenza virus infection. We first determined the level of ILDR1 after H1N1 SIV infection by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that ILDR1 levels significantly increased by more than 15-fold on the first day after infection and it decreased as the viral load decreased. The same results were obtained using Plscr1 knockout mice. Moreover, we examined the effect of ILDR1 overexpression on virus infection, and confirmed that virus replication was significantly promoted and the viability of virus-infected cells is decreased, suggesting that ILDR1 might play a role in influenza virus replication. Also, its homologous protein ILDR2 have been extensively studied on immunomodulatory effect in recent years. ILDR2, a new B7 family protein, has been confirmed expressed in immune cells and inflammatory tissues to suppress the activity of T cells37. ILDR2-Fc regulates the function of immunity in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by regulating the stability of the immune internal environment and rebuilding the balance of immune tolerance38. However, the expression of this family member in virus infection and its pathophysiological significance have not been reported so far. Further studies were needed to determine exactly how the ILDR1 protein family play in influenza virus, which may be a new target of influenza virus or a new direction provided for influenza virus research.Given that PLSCR1 can inhibit influenza virus replication by binding to the NP protein21, and ILDR1 could interact with PLSCR1, so the role of ILDR1 on the PLSCR1-NP complex in influenza virus deserves further study. The fact that ILDR1 could not directly interact with NP while PLSCR1 could interact with NP protein as previously reported. However, when the amount of ILDR1/PLSCR1 is increased, the level of NP bound to PLSCR1/ ILDR1 is decreased, which indicating that ILDR1 and have a certain competitive effect on the binding with NP. Additionally, ILDR1 will promote the expression of NP protein into the nucleus when overexpressed by cell fractionation experiment. The redundant PLSCR1 binds to the NP protein, which may facilitate the entry of the NP protein into the nucleus, thereby promoting the replication of the virus. However, the precise regions of the PLSCR1 binding to ILDR1 and NP should be investigated in the future to understand this competitive interaction affecting the functions of the viral RNP complex.In conclusion, this study identified the ILDR1 promotes SIV replication through interacting with PLSCR1. PLSCR1 was shown to inhibit influenza virus replication in vivo and could interact with ILDR1. The expression level of ILDR1 is increased after virus infection and as an antiviral suppressor to inhibit viral replication. Also, ILDR1 could not directly interact with virus NP protein, but could combine with PLSCR1 competitively. This study suggests the existence of a previously unknown pathway in regulating SIV infection, which sheds light on SIV prevention and/or treatment.Materials and methodsAnimalsGeneration of Plscr1 Knockout mice were generated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing technique as previously described39. Briefly, C57BL/6 female mice (7–8 weeks old) were superovulated by intraperitoneally injecting pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and then mated to C57BL/6 male mice. The fertilized embryos (zygotes) were collected from the oviducts, and mixed Cas9 mRNA (50 ng/µl) and small guide RNA (sgRNA; 25 ng/µl) were injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes with visible pronuclei in Chatot-Ziomek-Bavister (CZB) medium. The injected zygotes were then cultured in Quinn’s Advantage cleavage medium (in vitro Fertilization, Inc.) for 24 h, at which time 18–20 2-cell–stage embryos were transferred into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant ICR female mouse at 0.5 day post coitus (dpc). The accession numbers of the Plscr1 cDNAs used to design sgRNA is NM_011636.2. To determine the nucleotide sequence of mutated alleles, genomic DNA of F0 mice was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-GGTGATCTCGATTCAGGGGT-3′, reverse, 5′-GGGGTTACTCGACCCTAAAA-3′. DNA sequencing was then performed after TA cloning into plasmid pMD19T. In order to obtain F1 knockout mice, F0 mice were crossed with C57BL/6 mice and newborns were examined by Sanger sequencing. All animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. At the time of sacrifice, animals were euthanized with an overdose of isoflurane to minimize suffering followed by decapitation.VirusSIV (QD-2018 strain) was a H1N1 strain that isolated and obtained from the diseased pigs in Shandong province of China, which can be used as one of representative strains for the analysis of variant strains. The virus was continuously passaged on MDCK cells and virus titer was as high as 10–4.48 TCID50/mL.Cell culture, transfectionHEK 293 T(Human embryonic kidney cells, CC-Y1010), COS7(Monkey Kidney Cell, provided by Pro. Zhigang Xu) and A549 cells (Human lung cancer cells, ATCC CCL-185) were maintained with 10% FBS DMEM medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2, and transfected with expression vectors or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Plasmid constructionThe cDNAs encoding the mouse Ildr1 (NM_001285788.1) and Plscr1 (NM_011636.2) were cloned into pmCherry-N1, pEGFP-C2, and pMyc-C2 (modified pEGFP-C2 with EGFP-coding sequence replaced by Myc-coding sequence) as we have reported. All the constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing.Yeast two-hybrid screeningYeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously 40. Briefly, yeast strain AH109 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was sequentially transformed with the baitplasmid and a chicken cochlear cDNA library in HybriZAP pAD-GAL4 vector50. HIS3 was used as the reportergene for the screening in presence of 2.5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Positive colonies were further tested for activation of two other reporter genes, ADE2 and lacZ. Then the pAD-GAL4 prey vectors in triple-positive colonies were recovered, and cDNA inserts were determined by Sanger sequencing.Western blotCultured cells were transfected with expression vectors as described above or siRNAs synthesized by the Sigma-Aldrich company, then protein was resuspended with RIPA cell lysis containing 1 mM PMSF (Beyotime; Shanghai, China). After centrifuging at 4℃ for 20 min, the supernatant was analyzed by western blot. Protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, then transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% BSA buffer for 1 h, the membrane was cut prior to hybridisation with antibodies. They were incubated with Rabbit Polyclonal-PLSCR1 Polyclonal Antibody (Proteintech, Cat#11582–1-AP,1:1000 diluted), Rabbit Polyclonal-Anti-ILDR1 antibody (Abcam, Cat#ab89847,1:1000 diluted), Rabbit Polyclonal-Anti-H1N1 Influenza A virus Nucleocapsid protein antibody(Abcam, Cat#ab104870,1:1500 diluted), rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody(Abcam, Cat#ab181602, 1:5000 diluted), rabbit anti-LaminB1 antibody(Abways, Cat#AB0054, 1:3000 diluted) at 4℃ over night, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody or goat anti-rabbit secondary (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at room tempreture for two hours. The 26,616-PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder was provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The signals were detected with the ECL system (ImageQuant LAS 500, GE, USA) or exposed in dark room. The area of the related proteins peak, in relation to the standard curve, was determined using ImageJ software.RNA extraction, RT-PCR and Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated from virus-infected cells or mouse tissues which frozen-thawed for three times and cDNA was carried out by reverse transcription (RT) following the kit instructions (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, China). The expression of gene or virus was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM system, Takara). The primers used were as follows: Ildr1 forward primer, CCGGCGGCTGATGAAGAAAGACTC, reverse primer, AGGGCAGCAACAGCGGGTAGGA; Plscr1 forward primer, GTGGGGCGTC TAGACCTTTC, reverse primer, CCAGGCATCACAGGTGAGTT; H1N1 forward primer, ACAGAAGTTATAAGAATGA, reverse primer, TGTCTCCGAAGAAAT AAGA;β-actin forward primer, ACGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG, reverse primer, AGGGGCCGGACTCATCGTA. PCR reaction system and procedures were refered to Premix Taq kit instructions (Takara). PCR reaction sets were adjusted between 24 and 36 cycles, and annealing temperatures were adjusted between 55 and 60 °C. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gel.Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM system (Perfect Real Time, Takara). The primers and templates were the same as that used in RT-PCR. Amplifiation and detection were run in a Roche 480 Sequence Detection System with an initial cycle of 95 °C for 10 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 62 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 5 s. All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. Fold change in gene expression level was calculated using the 2-ΔΔct method and all PCR reactions were performed in triplicate.Immunofluorescence assayInfected cells or transfected cells with GFP- or mCherry-tagged proteins growing on Gelatin-coated glass cover slips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min and blocked with PBT1 buffer (0.1%Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 5% heat-inactivated goat serum in PBS, pH 7.3) for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with corresponding antibody diluted in PBT1 then washed twice with PBS for 10 min. And cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBT2 (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times for 10 min. For nuclei staining, cells were incubated with DAPI (Solarbio Life Sciences) for 15 min, followed by three 10 min PBS washes, then mounted in 50% glycerol/PBS. The cells were imaged with an inverted fluorescence microscope (TE200, Nikon).ImmunohistochemistryThe tissues were fixed in 10% formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 4 μm thicknesses and dewaxed the paraffin sections to water. Then the sections were placed in a retrieval box filled with EDTA antigen retrieval buffer (PH 8.0) in a microwave oven for antigen retrieval. After that, the sections were blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. The section were incubated with anti-PLSCR1antibody (1:50) overnight at 4 °C. After a brief wash, the secondary antibody were used for detection at room temperature for 50 min and DAPI dye solution was added for 10 min in the dark. The images were taken using a light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse C1). For the controls, no antibody was added to the samples.Cell fractionationThe PLSCR1-overexpressing or empty retrovirus-transfected control A549 cells grown in 6-well plates were infected with WSN virus at an MOI of 5. At 6 h p.i., the cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by using Minute Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (SC-003, Invent) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The amount of NP, ILDR1 and PLSCR1 in each fraction were determined by western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb, a rabbit anti-ILDR1 pAb and a rabbit anti-PLSCR1 pAb, respectively. LaminB1 and GAPDH, nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction markers, respectively, were detected by western blotting with a rabbit anti-GAPDH pAb and a rabbit anti-LaminB1 pAb, respectively.Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)HEK293T cells were transfected with expression vectors as described above, then washed twice with PBS 24 h after transfection and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 × cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After centrifuging at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant was collected and incubated with immobilized anti-Myc or anti-EGFP antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with 300 mM lysis buffer and then analyzed by western blot.Statistical analysesAll data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD), and an independent-sample t-test was used to evaluate data using Graph Prism software. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.ARRIVE guidelines statementThe ARRIVE Guidelines have been adopted.

Sifford is the Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States and Deputy Administrator of the Veterinary Services program, part of USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Dr. Rosemary Sifford started with USDA in 1997 and has worked on a variety of high-profile animal disease and animal welfare issues. What is avian influenza?Avian influenza--the bird flu--is a virus that infects wild birds (such as ducks, gulls and shorebirds) and domestic poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese). The strains are divided into two groups based upon virus’ ability to affect poultry: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Native North American strains of avian influenza naturally occur in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor clinical signs in birds; these are LPAI or “low path” viruses. LPAI H5 and H7 strains have the potential to mutate into HPAI and are therefore closely monitored. HPAI, or “high path” avian influenza, spreads very rapidly and has a high death rate in domestic birds.In 2022, Eurasian lineage H5 HPAI was confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks in 34 states and in wild birds in 35 states. The latest information about detected cases is available on the APHIS website.Is HPAI a food safety or human health issue?Avian influenza is not transmissible by eating properly prepared poultry. Proper handling and cooking protect against all avian influenza viruses. The chance of infected poultry or eggs entering the food chain is extremely low because of the rapid onset of symptoms in poultry and USDA safeguards, which include testing and inspection.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk from this avian influenza detection remains low, but there have been rare cases of human infections, mostly due to direct contact with infected birds. To date, there have only been two humans confirmed with this virus strain worldwide, and both had contact with sick birds. Avian influenza viruses do not spread easily among people. Visit the CDC website for more information.What can bird owners to do prevent HPAI in their flocks?Poultry producers or owners, from the small backyard owner to the large commercial operator, should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Also, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS’ toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. When possible, APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors to further prevent exposures.APHIS resources are available for both commercial poultry producers and backyard bird owners through our Defend the Flock campaign. APHIS offers more information about this campaign and links to toolkits containing biosecurity checklists, videos, and more.What will happen if HPAI is detected in my birds or in a flock close to mine?If HPAI is detected on your property or close to it, APHIS and your state veterinarian’s office assist you and others in the local area to immediately contain the outbreak and protect animal health. If your birds appear sick or if HPAI has been reported in your area, USDA or state officials will sample your flock to check for HPAI.If you have HPAI in your flock, we will help you stop the disease from spreading. This includes quarantining your operation, depopulating the affected flock, testing wild and domestic birds in the quarantine area, disinfecting the affected location, and confirming the area is virus free. Following quarantine requirements, using proper biosecurity, and cooperating with federal and state officials are the best things you can do to keep HPAI from spreading. APHIS also offers advice on what to expect.Will producers be compensated for the birds?The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to indemnify producers for birds and eggs destroyed during a disease response. APHIS also compensates for depopulation and disposal and virus elimination.APHIS compensates for birds destroyed using species-specific calculators that determine the birds’ fair market value. We also pay for eggs that must be destroyed.In 2018, an APHIS final rule outlined conditions that USDA will indemnify farms affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). This final rule:Allows indemnification split between poultry and egg owners and their contracted growers and provides a formula for the split;Adopts biosecurity principles established by the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP); andRequires auditable biosecurity plans for larger-sized operations to receive indemnification.More information:Defend the Flock ProgramHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)Lyndsay Cole is the assistant director of public affairs with APHIS.

The one above survived, but is permanently blind and cannot be released into the wild.By Marcus Schneck | mschneck@pennlive.comThe bird flu, which has been found in domestic poultry flocks in 34 states and more than a thousand wild bird across the country, has been found in wild red foxes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources confirmed that several fox kits were infected with the currently circulating H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which also is known as avian influenza or bird flu.It was also detected in foxes in Ontario, Canada, earlier this month.The virus was identified at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, a diagnostic testing lab in the USDA’s Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service.“Kits appear to develop severe clinical disease and die rapidly after infection, similar to what we are seeing in spillover events of this virus in other non-host species, such as domestic poultry and raptors (birds of prey, including hawks and eagles),” explained Betsy Elsmo, diagnostic pathologist at the WVDL and associate clinical diagnostic professor at the UW School of Veterinary Medicine.After noticing an uptick in ill fox kits brought into the Dane County Humane Society (DCHS) Wildlife Center, staff submitted several deceased animals to the WVDL for additional testing.The staff at WVDL ruled out the common causes of mortality in foxes and broadened their search for answers.Previously, cases of HPAI in wild foxes had been detected in the Netherlands.According to the USDA, 292 domestic flocks in 34 states, totaling 37 million birds, have been infected since the start of the current outbreak in the U.S. That includes nine commercial flocks in Pennsylvania, where 3.9 million chickens and ducks have been destroyed.The disease has been found in more than a thousand wild birds of 55 species across the country, according to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.In Pennsylvania it has been detected in two bald eagles (one found March 24 in Chester County and one found April 5 in Crawford County) five mergansers found March 28 in Venango County, a redhead duck found April 5 in Crawford County and a Canada goose found April 19 in Franklin County, and some of more than a hundred black vultures found dead in late April and early May near Conowingo Dam on the Susquehanna River.Avian flu found in some of 100+ black vultures found dead along Susquehanna RiverRECOMMENDED•pennlive.comCDC calls for expanded bird flu testing after blood tests reveal more human infectionsNov. 7, 2024, 3:00 p.m.Man who killed eagles on a Native American reservation gets nearly 4 years in prisonNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Although the avian flu has infected humans in the past, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no human cases have been found in current outbreak in the U.S. and there is a low risk to people.It’s likely the foxes in the upper Midwest and Canada contracted the virus after eating or coming into contact with infected birds in their natural environments.Contact Marcus Schneck at mschneck@pennlive.com.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

From there, the virus made its way into a large commercial turkey operation in southern Indiana.Since arriving stateside, HPAI case numbers have continued to balloon, and now, the U.S. is in the midst of its biggest outbreak of avian influenza to date.The last big outbreak spanned the winter of 2014 and persisted until June of 2015, when temperatures in more northerly parts of the country finally warmed enough to stop the cold-adapted virus. Like the outbreak of 2014 to 2015, the current bird flu strain came to North America from China via migratory bird movement.While the latest strain of HPAI is killing domestic birds by the tens of millions, it’s the toll that the outbreak is taking on wild birds, and wild turkeys in particular, that’s turning heads in the hunting and conservation communities.Western Turkeys Bear the Brunt Last month, avian influenza turned up in dead Merriam's turkeys in Montana and then in Wyoming a short time later.In Montana, three tom turkeys from an urban flock in Billings tested positive for HPAI after they were reported to Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) by a resident who found two of the birds dead in his yard. The HPAI-positive toms were just three of seven dead turkeys that FWP game wardens found in the Billings neighborhood.“Our game warden described these birds as urban turkeys, and people have speculated that they hang out around the university in places where they’re probably being fed to some extent,” Dr. Jennifer Ramsey, a wildlife veterinarian with Montana FWP, told MeatEater. “They’re wild turkeys, but they’re not your typical wild birds that are out in the wild living a completely wild life.”There is some debate around if these turkeys are truly wild—one Montana FWP communications manager said the flock likely bred with domestic turkeys at some point.While the habituated Billings birds were the first wild turkeys to ever test positive for avian influenza in North America, they aren’t the only wild birds in the Big Sky State that have been contracting the disease this year.“We’re definitely seeing more wild bird mortalities this time around than we did back in 2015,” Ramsey said. “Twenty fifteen was a bad year, but we didn’t have nearly this many calls and reports and animals testing positive.”Ramsey said that the hardest-hit species in Montana, as of now, are snow geese, Canada geese, and various types of raptors.“Snow geese and Canada geese are both getting hit pretty hard,” she said. “And we’re getting reports of a lot of raptors contracting this. We’re getting turkey vultures, various hawks, and we’re getting quite a few great horned owls that have died and are testing positive.”While the USDA reports that just 18 birds in Montana have tested positive for HPAI in its official statistics, Ramsey says that that number is far lower than what she’s actually seeing in her day-to-day work with reported avian influenza cases.“We keep getting calls, and it’s fairly disheartening,” she said. “We have a scheme of prioritizing which ones we need to get tested and which ones we don’t because we can’t test them all. There’s way too many.”Wild birds in nearby Wyoming are fairing even worse. According to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), at least 38 wild birds have tested positive for H5N1in the Cowboy State. Eleven of those were wild turkeys that turned up dead near a captive pheasant farm that is administered by the Wyoming Game & Fish Department (WGFD).Pheasant Farming Fears Because HPAI is known to decimate captive bird populations, the presence of the virus in close proximity to a pheasant breeding facility immediately raised red flags within the WGFD.Out of what it called “an abundance of caution for the thousands of birds soon to hatch,” the agency depopulated the 1,200-member broodstock of pen-raised pheasants at its Sheridan bird farm. With its two breeding facilities, WGFD incubates and hatches nearly 40,000 pheasants annually, birds that the agency then stocks on public lands in eastern and central Wyoming throughout the upland game bird hunting season.Dr. Samantha Allen is a wildlife veterinarian with WGFD. She says that pen-reared pheasants in other states have contracted H5N1 during the 2021 to 2022 outbreak.“I think that the risk is definitely there because other states have had pheasant farms get this strain, and they’ve all died very quickly,” Allen told MeatEater. “I know that in places like Texas and New York, they had to depopulate whole pheasant farms because they had avian influenza.”She says that none of the broodstock pheasants from the Sheridan game farm were tested for avian influenza either before or after euthanization. But it’s highly likely that if any of the captive pheasants had contracted the virus, the whole facility would have been depopulated, not just the broodstock.“The unfortunate thing when it comes to getting AI (avian influenza) is, one, your pheasants get really sick and they die, but you’re also going to have to get rid of everything on the premises,” she said. “You can’t just say, ‘Oh, I have this breeding group and then I have these chicks, and I’m just going to get rid of the breeding group at this point.’ If you have AI on your farm, every bird has to be depopulated.”The discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza near a captive pheasant facility has raised the hackles of conservationists who fear that pen-rearing game birds and then releasing them into wild populations could exacerbate the spread of this deadly pathogen.In Montana, a new pheasant farming program, mandated by legislative action in the spring of 2021, is in the early stages of implementation. When it’s up and running, the new program aims to release as many as 50,000 pheasants every year onto “suitable and eligible state-owned lands.”The pheasant rearing program is being set up at the Montana State Prison, where it will be staffed by inmates. One million dollars in license-supported FWP funds have already been allocated for the project.Writing on behalf of the Montana Chapter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers in a recent op-ed published in the Billings Gazette, Missoula lawyer Graham Coppes said that Montana FWP’s plan to initiate a stocking program for pen-raised ring-neck pheasants amid an avian influenza outbreak could have disastrous implications.“While the legislature appropriated money specifically for this project, that was long before avian flu arrived,” Coppes wrote. “The Fish and Wildlife Commission could still say no. Given this new and emerging bird virus, this seems like the perfect time for the Commission to put the chicks back in the egg, so to speak, and prevent a biological disaster.”In a recent press release, Montana Fish Wildlife & Parks attempted to alleviate such concerns, saying that the pheasants at its new facility were recently tested for HPAI, “and all results came back negative.”“We’re taking the threat from HPAI very seriously and monitoring the stock closely in partnership with staff at the prison,” FWP Director Hank Worsech said in the press release. “The safety measures folks are taking to ensure the health of the flock are impressive—on par with any medical facility. They’ve gone above and beyond from a biosecurity standpoint.”Though the current strain of H5N1 that’s circulating in wild and domestic birds in North America has low zoonotic potential, meaning that transmission from birds to humans is unlikely, there has been one reported case of the virus jumping the species barrier and ending up in a human being. That case involved an inmate at a Colorado prison who contracted HPAI while culling infected birds at a private poultry farm as part of an early release work program. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the man was asymptomatic and has since recovered.A New Future for Wild Turkeys? When it comes to wild turkeys, few game managers in the United States predicted that avian influenza would emerge as a potential threat to the country’s already beleaguered turkey flocks.“I’ll be honest, it hasn’t been something that we’ve really paid a lot of attention to because it typically affects other species like waterfowl and domestic chickens,” wild turkey expert Mike Chamberlain told MeatEater.Chamberlain is the Terrel Professor of Wildlife Ecology and Management at the University of Georgia. He’s been immersed in wild turkey research throughout his career, and he’s been an avid turkey hunter for most of his life.He says that the anecdotal reports he is getting on wild turkey flocks in HPAI-affected areas are concerning.“I have had several people contact me about this,” Chamberlain said. “One was an outfitter in the Sheridan, Wyoming area. I was supposed to hunt on his land, and he called me last week as I was about to drive from South Dakota to visit him and he said, ‘My birds are gone.’”The area Chamberlain had planned to hunt was near Buffalo, Wyoming, the same area where WDFG had to euthanize its broodstock of pen-reared pheasants after necropsies on 11 dead turkeys confirmed the presence of HPAI.“He texted me two days later and said that the population had continued to decline,” Chamberlain said. “He said birds were just disappearing. Birds that he had been watching were no longer there.”Chamberlain went on to say that many birds that contract diseases like HPAI will go completely unnoticed by state agencies and USDA officials.“The problem with these diseases is that birds get infected, and then they get sick, and then they hide,” he said. “They go hunker down somewhere and die, and therefore we don’t know about it.”Chamberlain fears that Western turkey flocks, which have largely escaped the type of declines that are plaguing turkey populations in other parts of the country, could see their numbers dip too if HPAI gets out of hand.“Populations in the West, in many ways, haven’t been subjected to some of the declines that we’ve seen in the South and the East,” he said. “But these anecdotal reports that I’m getting are pretty concerning. I’ll be curious to see if they come to fruition, in other words, if agencies realize that we really took a hit in some of these areas.”While hunting turkeys in South Dakota this year, Chamberlain encountered a dead horned owl in the middle of a freshly cut hay pasture.“We were hustling along through this pasture to try to cut off a bird before it got away, and I just glanced over my shoulder and happened to notice a dead horned owl laying there,” he said. “I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, and then the next day that outfitter called me, and I thought to myself, ‘Damn, I wonder if that bird had avian influenza and died from it.’ I reported it, but I wasn’t in a position where I could go back. By the time I realized that, I was four hours away.”According to APHIS, South Dakota has seen at least 50 wild birds test positive for HPAI, while neighboring North Dakota leads the country with 197 known cases.Back in Montana, Jennifer Ramsey and her team of technicians rely on encounters like Chamberlain’s to track the spread of avian influenza on the landscape.“Most of our calls come from the public,” she said. “Like people having owls in their yard, or just weird birds in weird places where they’ve never seen them before. They’re having these encounters with dead birds that are out of the norm and calling in to report those.”If you see a bird that might have died from highly pathogenic avian influenza, you should report it to your nearest game warden immediately. And though the likelihood of humans contracting this particular strain of the bird flu is low, Dr. Samantha Allen of WDFG recommends caution when dealing with dead birds, harvested or otherwise.“There is a low risk of zoonotic potential with this disease,” she said. “Wear rubber gloves when you’re cutting stuff open to be cautious.”Feature image via John Hafner.

(ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)abc.net.auews/qld-influenza-flu-season-surge-in-cases-sparks-vaccine-warning/101077240Link copiedShareShare articleExperts have sounded a warning about this year's flu season, with concerns young children will be particularly vulnerable to life-threatening complications. Key points:More than 400 people have been hospitalised with influenza in Queensland this flu seasonDoctors say children under two are particularly susceptibleOne expert says flu vaccines should be "essential" in vulnerable settings Queensland flu notifications for the year have skyrocketed in the past week, increasing from 1,848 to 4,282 — a jump of more than 130 per cent in seven days.Since the start of April, 457 people have been admitted to Queensland public hospitals with flu, including 30 who have required intensive care.Queensland Health data shows 180 people have been diagnosed with the double whammy of having COVID-19 and flu at the same time in 2022.Almost half of Queenslanders with so-called "flurona" have been aged between 10 and 29.Influenza cases jumped 130 per cent in one week, leading to some predicting a big flu season. (Supplied: Queensland Health)Queensland Children's Hospital infectious disease physician Angela Berkhout said children aged two and under had low levels of natural immunity to flu as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.COVID-19 public health directions kept flu numbers down in 2020 and 2021, but they have already rebounded this year with the relaxation of restrictions and reopening of borders.'Life-threatening' risk of catching both COVID and the fluPhoto shows Yvette D'Ath in a white singlet smiling as she gets a needle.Health Minister Yvette D'Ath says she is concerned about the "life-threatening" risk of Queenslanders being struck down with both viruses at once this winter."We can't be complacent," Dr Berkhout said."It is really important that this year … children are having their influenza vaccine."Dr Berkhout said flu could be serious in children, with the virus capable of causing myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, and encephalitis — swelling of the brain."I don't want to be fear-mongering amongst parents, but very rarely there are some children who die from influenza," she said."People think: I've got a well child, they've got no underlying medical problems so my child will be fine. Unfortunately, it's unpredictable."We know that there are children who've been previously fit and healthy who unfortunately catch influenza and have severe disease and complications related to influenza."Dr Angela Berkhout says influenza can lead to other serious medical conditions in children. (Supplied: Queensland Health)A fast rise but no guarantee of a fast declineUniversity of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay said flu was not a "trivial virus"."A proportion of infections are quite severe and quite serious and every year it kills people," he said.Dr Mackay said diagnosed flu cases across Queensland, as well as nationally, suggested the season could peak earlier than the usual August pinnacle."We've certainly got a much earlier rise and looking at the last five years, I would say it's a faster rate of rise than we've seen in any of the previous five years," he said."It doesn't mean it'll peak fast and drop fast. It might stay around for a while."Chief Health Officer Dr John Gerrard, an infectious disease specialist, is yet to make flu shots mandatory for people visiting or working in residential aged care, as he has for COVID-19 vaccination.The influenza vaccine is free for children and other vulnerable population groups. (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said yesterday she would be guided by Dr Gerrard on the issue but Dr Mackay said, "flu vaccination should be essential for people going into vulnerable settings like that".Flu shots are free for children aged from six months to less than five years, Australians aged 65 and older, pregnant women, First Nations people and those with certain medical risk factors, such as heart disease, severe asthma, chronic lung conditions and impaired immunity.But Ms D'Ath is so concerned about this year's flu season she plans to write to the Commonwealth asking for free flu jabs to be broadened."We are probably going to be experiencing our worst flu season that we have seen in almost a decade and it's coming at us quickly," she said.[Qld local edition teaser]Queensland Health's Acting Chief Operating Officer David Rosengren, an emergency medicine specialist, said the state was already seeing a surge in the number of flu cases requiring hospital admission, including intensive care."The dominant strain of influenza this season is influenza A," Dr Rosengren said."Influenza A is a serious illness. It has serious impacts on our young and on our older and more frail people, particularly those with chronic disease."I saw a 19-year-old gent in the emergency department last Thursday night with influenza A who described never having felt so bad in his entire life."If you don't want to feel so bad in your entire life, then my challenge is to go out and get your flu vaccine. We know it works."Posted Wed 18 May 2022 at 7:33pmWednesday 18 May 2022 at 7:33pmWed 18 May 2022 at 7:33pm, updated Wed 18 May 2022 at 9:53pmWednesday 18 May 2022 at 9:53pmWed 18 May 2022 at 9:53pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

(File/Getty) News Multiple wild geese test positive for avian influenza in Oregon by: Matt Rawlings Posted: May 18, 2022 / 01:59 PM PDT Updated: May 18, 2022 / 02:17 PM PDT (File/Getty) by: Matt Rawlings Posted: May 18, 2022 / 01:59 PM PDT Updated: May 18, 2022 / 02:17 PM PDT SHARE SALEM, Ore. (KOIN) — The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) announced Tuesday that multiple Canada goose goslings collected from Alton Baker Park in Eugene have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). ODFW also says that a red-tailed hawk and an osprey tested positive for the avian flu on May 10. The department expects a larger outbreak to take place, saying that more sick and dead ducks and geese have been observed at the park. Clackamas County officials stay overnight to log votes, ensure accuracy The cases are reportedly the first know detections of the new avian flu strain in wild birds in the state. According to ODFW, the first Oregon case in a backyard poultry was confirmed earlier this month in Linn County, while one additional case was confirmed in Lane County. The CDC says the risk of HPAI to human health is low, and that the only known human case involving infection and illness was in a person involved in the culling of presumptively infected poultry at a commercial farm in Colorado. OR revenue forecast: $2.3 billion increase, bigger rebate However, ODFW recommends for people to avoid close contact with ducks and geese over the spring and summer. The department encourages people to not collect or handle sick or dead birds, but to report the incident directly to ODFW at 866-968-2600 or Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov. ODFW will continue to monitor the presence of the disease. Currently, Oregon wildlife rehabilitators are not accepting sick ducks and geese to protect the other avian patients and education birds in their care. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Here’s how to take precautions. Bird flu killed an owl in Utah and may be spreading. Here’s how to take precautions.The virus was confirmed in a wild owl that was found dead in Cache County last month.By Jordan Miller | May 18, 2022, 12:00 p.m.The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources confirmed a case of avian flu in a wild bird last week, and officials are urging Utahns who have birds or interact with them to take precautions.The virus was found in a dead great horned owl in April, and the case was recently confirmed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, located in Ames, Iowa. Five additional owls were later found dead in both Cache and Weber counties, and the wildlife division is awaiting their test results.Avian flu can be passed to humans in some cases, and one person in Colorado tested positive for the virus in late April after direct exposure to poultry. But risk to the public with this particular strain is low, officials said.According to the Centers for Disease Control, the patient in Colorado reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and has since recovered.“Certain strains can be fatal and like all flus, they can mutate, and they get into other species,” said Virginia Stout, wildlife veterinarian for Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “But as the disease spreads and changes, there’s definitely a possibility it could change and become more virulent.”These viruses are “very contagious” among birds though, and can cause rapid and high mortality in domestic birds particularly — such as chickens, turkeys and domestic ducks. They can also kill waterfowl, raptors and scavengers.Tracy Aviary taking precautionsThe Tracy Aviary is taking precautions against the contagious virus among its Salt Lake City flocks, officials said.That includes temporarily closing three exhibits that house birds that are most at risk of contracting the virus — the Kennecott Wetlands, Backyard Birds, and Treasures of the Rainforest. And some of its close-encounter experiences, like the Lorikeet Adventure, have been suspended.The aviary has also installed new netting to prevent wild birds from congregating with sensitive species, and shoe disinfection may be required at some indoor exhibits to limit birds’ exposure to outside materials.“Some of those places have endangered species, so we’ve advised them to put the really special birds indoors so there’s no chance of contact between flying birds overhead and the species in the zoo,” Stout said.(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) White Pelicans on their island in Pelican Pond at Tracy Aviary on Friday, Jan. 22, 2016. The Tracy Aviary is taking precautions against the contagious bird flu recently detected in Utah.“We’ve had to remove a couple geese from the premises,” Stout continued, “just to make sure that they don’t have [avian influenza] and spread it without us knowing.”The flu can be spread among birds through nasal and oral discharge, as well as fecal droppings. Songbirds are usually not affected by the virus, so individuals should not need to remove bird feeders unless they have backyard chickens or ducks, since they are more at susceptible.“Another thing that you want to avoid is going into places where waterfowl and shorebirds are, and then using those same boots around your chickens at home,” Stout said.How you can help stop the spreadThe length of the restrictions depends on the virus’ prevalence in the environment, Stout said, so they may be lifted when the state has gone a month or two without any new cases.The wildlife division is testing birds for avian influenza as they find them, so individuals should report any groups of dead waterfowl or scavengers they encounter — and be sure not to touch them.“Just report it to us, and we will come collect them for testing,” Stout said in a news release. “It typically doesn’t have much of an impact on the overall populations of waterfowl, but it’s likely that we will have some die now that it’s been confirmed in wild birds in the state.”Utah’s last confirmed cases of avian flu were in 2014-15, during a nationwide outbreak of highly pathogenic strains. At that time, the virus was found in two healthy ducks in the Beehive State.“A lot of it has to do with migration, so the reason that it started happening is those birds were flying in ... and through that migration, they’re bringing new viruses in to the environment,” Stout said. “So we’re hoping that by mid-summer, it should be calming down, because it doesn’t last very long in the warmer temperatures.”(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) A great blue heron takes takes flight at Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, a 74,000-acre nature reserve in the northern Great Salt Lake on Wednesday, June 23, 2021.

All outbreaks are now closed and the epidemiological situation is favourable, but we must not let our guard down. The risk of the virus jumping to humans is considered low. Irene Iglesias Martín, Ana de la Torre Reoyo 17/05/2022 - 11:12 CEST Versión en castellano An employee of the XinRong pigeon hatchery moves pigeons in Shanghai (China) / EFE Avian influenza is one of the most important viral diseases in poultry farming. It is caused by avian influenza virus type A (family Orthomyxoviridae) and is classified into two categories: high and low pathogenicity (HPAI and LPAI respectively). HPAI is a constant threat to the global poultry industry and to vulnerable wildlife species, causing a disease with high mortality in infected birds. It is included in the list of notifiable diseases of the OIE (International Organisation of Epizootics). Its natural hosts are wild birds, especially waterfowl, which historically hahistorically have not been affected by the disease. However, in 2002, a new strain causing mass mortality in wild birds was described for the first time. Since then there have been several epidemic waves spread by migratory birds to several continents. Contact between wild and domestic birds has introduced the disease into the poultry sector. As a result, more than 50 million domestic birds have died or been culled in the last two years alone. Spain is highly vulnerable as more than 1,500,000 wintering migratory waterfowl arrive each year from infected countries. The susceptible population of wild and domestic birds in Spain is very high, and the potential economic impact is high given that the Spanish poultry sector is the second largest livestock producer. However, the current epidemiological situation of avian influenza in our country seems favourable and its impact less than in the other affected countries. No human cases in Spain Avian influenza can be transmitted under certain conditions to humans, although the risk of this occurring has so far been considered low. Between 2003 and 2022, 864 human infections have been reported worldwide, mostly under conditions of high exposure to the virus, such as those of personnel on affected poultry farms. But the increased incidence in recent epidemics makes these viruses a threat to public health. This, and the fact that they are viruses with a high mutation rate, makes it necessary to maintain constant vigilance in both birds and humans. Avian influenza has never been detected in humans in Spain and the risk of this occurring is considered low. Surveillance is carried out within the framework of the National Avian Influenza Surveillance Programme of the Ministry of Agriculture in coordination with the Ministry of Health. From the first global wave to an unprecedented epidemic HPAI subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong, China, in domestic geese. Different types of this precursor, coupled with other influenza viruses from geese and duck reservoirs, generated multiple, much more pathogenic strains. These subtypes spread throughout Asia, Europe and Africa between 2002 and 2006, killing thousands of domestic and wild birds, as well as sporadic human cases. It is considered the first wave of avian influenza on a global scale. In Spain, the first H5N1 case was detected in 2006, in a wild bird at the Salburua reservoir, Álava. After a few years of "moderate" notifications, the H5N8 subtype spread from Asia in 2014, reaching Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, with a high number of notifications between 2015-2017. In early 2017, one outbreak was reported in Spain in wild birds and another, with secondary outbreaks, in domestic birds. The current global HPAI epidemic is unprecedented. This wave originated in 2020 with an increase in HPAI H5 notifications in domestic and wild birds. Initially dominated by the H5N8 subtype, it has been overtaken again by the H5N1 subtype in 2021. In Europe, 39 countries are affected, with more than 5,200 notifications in wild birds and more than 4,000 in domestic birds. In France, 16 million birds have been culled. North America, whose last cases were in 2015, has also been affected in the current wave, with more than 28 million domestic birds killed or culled. The impact of Spain's epidemics Despite being an area with a high concentration of migratory birds and its proximity to highly affected countries, such as France, there have been few cases in Spain in the last two decades, and always at the end of each epidemic wave. A key factor may be the higher temperatures in Spain, which reduce the survival of the virus. Thus, although bird flu has been ravaging Europe for two years, Spain has only been affected in 2022, and less than other European countries. Even so, the situation in the first months of this year in our country has been absolutely unusual, with an unprecedented number of outbreaks in wild and domestic birds. So far, 31 outbreaks have been reported in Spain in poultry, with more than 900,000 birds affected. In wild birds, 37 outbreaks have been reported, with more than 200 birds affected.

(Source: Ministerio de Agricultura Pesca y Alimentación)The official veterinary services have taken the relevant measures, which include the immobilisation and culling of the affected holdings; the carrying out of an epidemiological survey; the cleaning, disinfection and destruction of carcasses; and the establishment of a restriction zone around the outbreaks. Following these actions, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food considers all outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in Spain to be closed. The current epidemiological situation of avian influenza in our country seems favourable, both in poultry and wild birds. The second most important livestock sector The economic impact of avian influenza is very important. It affects farmers, agricultural insurers and poultry markets in general. The distortion caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the war in Ukraine make it difficult to predict the impact on poultry markets of the current global avian influenza epidemic, although the FAO has already identified a rise in poultry meat prices. The poultry sector, with 18 % of the Spanish final livestock production, is the second most important livestock sector in Spain, behind only the pig sector. In the EU, Spain is the second largest producer of poultry meat, the first being Poland and ahead of France and Germany. Hence the importance of animal health in Spain. In conclusion, it is necessary to continue with the surveillance carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture to protect the livestock sector from diseases that pose a risk to its stability and profitability, thus avoiding possible economic restrictions and market disturbances.

The kit allows individuals to self-collect nasal swab samples at home to send to LabCorp, which will test for the presence of influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-2. As the pathogens cause similar symptoms, a firm diagnosis can only be made by testing for the viruses. The FDA shared details of the emergency use authorization on the same day that LabCorp disclosed the launch of an at-home sample collection device for diabetes-risk testing. The products advance a multiyear push into direct-to-consumer testing that began in 2015. Dive Insight: Going into the first winter of the pandemic, multiple companies introduced products that tested for both influenza and COVID-19 in the expectation that the winter flu season may cause a surge in people presenting with symptoms that could be caused by either pathogen. They pitched the products as a way to ensure the timely diagnosis and treatment of the right virus. However, unusually low flu activity in the 2020-21 season meant the misdiagnosis risk was smaller than feared. Still, companies have continued to innovate, with Roche getting a CE mark for a rapid antigen test for influenza and COVID-19 in January. LabCorp added a new product to the U.S. testing arsenal this week by securing an EUA for a home sample collection kit that can be bought online or in a store without a prescription. The kit allows consumers to collect nasal samples for sending to LabCorp for testing. The company will test the sample for influenza A and B, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 and provide results through an online portal. Other businesses also have received EUAs for panels that test for a range of respiratory pathogens, including those covered by LabCorp’s kit. Luminex secured an EUA for its product more than a year ago and at least four other companies have received emergency authorizations for respiratory panels since then. LabCorp’s kit is differentiated as it enables at-home sample collection without a prescription. However, Jeff Shuren, director of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, already is looking forward to the next advance. “The rapid advances being made in consumer access to diagnostic tests, including the ability to collect your sample at home for flu and RSV without a prescription, brings us one step closer to tests for these viruses that could be performed entirely at home,” Shuren said in a statement. LabCorp’s new test will slot into its dwindling COVID-19 business. In the first quarter, LabCorp averaged about 70,000 PCR tests a day, well below its 300,000 daily capacity, and COVID-19 testing sales fell 43% compared to last year. The company expects volumes to fall for the rest of the year, while it maintains the ability to process 300,000 samples a day “pending supplies and labor” in case a new wave happens.

Prior to the development of specific vaccines, there was a lot of interest in using existing vaccines against COVID. New research released this month suggests those receiving influenza vaccinations may stand a greater chance of avoiding sickness – in particular severe illness – caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Qatar-based pre-print study, which has been picked up by Nature, looked at the health records of 30,774 healthcare workers in the country during the 2020 vaccination season before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. All of those who took a PCR test during the study period were eligible for inclusion, with effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe or fatal illness the key criteria measured. The findings, which have now been published on medRxiv, indicate that those who were vaccinated had around a 30% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 infection compared to those who were not, as well as an almost 95% reduction in severe illness. The authors say their research findings were limited by the youth of the cohort, which had an average age of around 36, with the infrequency of severe illness also causing a wide confidence interval for the efficacy estimates. Acknowledging studies that support a link between flu vaccination and COVID-19 prevention and others that do not, they state their work adds to evidence that the flu vaccine may boost protection more widely than for just that specific illness. ‘The findings support benefits for influenza vaccination that extend beyond protection against influenza infection and severe disease,’ they wrote. The authors also said that by focusing on the response in healthcare workers, they would be mitigating the influence of a so-called ‘healthy user effect’ as they would be less likely to have wide variations in health-related behaviour compared to the broader population. ‘These results for a healthcare worker population where the influence of the healthy user effect is perhaps minimised, support the conclusion that recent influenza vaccination has a genuine biological effect in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity,’ the study reads. For Professor Dale Godfrey, Immunology Theme Leader at the Doherty Institute, the premise of a vaccine designed for one disease offering protection against another is familiar. ‘The idea is not a new one,’ he told newsGP. ‘There was a lot of interest in other vaccines possibly providing some protection against COVID.’ He points to a study led by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute which tested the impact of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 in the first few months of the pandemic. ‘There’s evidence even back from the 70s that immunisation with live attenuated vaccines provided a level of protection against influenza,’ he said. ‘There was evidence long before COVID that this phenomenon happens and it fits with what we understand.’ Professor Godfrey says that even though specific vaccines target the adaptive immune system and will not provide protection against a different virus that does not share the same molecule, the vaccine’s broader impact on the innate immune system may play a role. ‘If your immune system has recently been stimulated, then you’ll have a lot of innate cells and innate molecules that will be activated and that takes them a while to settle down again,’ he said. ‘And that’s probably what’s happening. ‘It’s like putting the immune system on guard, that’s a really key part of any immune response. You’re just revving up your defences a bit against any pathogen.’ As for whether people should expect a flu vaccine to protect them against COVID-19, Professor Godfrey is unambiguous that a targeted vaccine is preferable. ‘If they want to get a flu vaccine they should certainly do that because it will provide the best protection against flu,’ he said. ‘If they’re doing it to get protection against COVID, then a COVID vaccine makes the most sense. ‘A flu vaccine might add a little bit to that, who knows, especially if it’s been a few months since their last COVID [vaccine] boost.’ The lifespan of any protective boost that might be offered is also not yet clear, Professor Godfrey says. ‘It’s not really well understood about the durability of such protection and whether one vaccine is better than another,’ he said. ‘Most of the evidence that I’ve heard has been more related to live attenuated vaccines, and the flu vaccine is not a live attenuated vaccine, it’s a subunit vaccine. ‘There are lots of questions that still remain.’ In the Nature article, infectious diseases expert Professor Mihai Netea from the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands suggests that using an existing vaccine as protection against emerging disease could be helpful in the early stages of any future pandemic. Professor Godfrey believes the huge shift in the dynamics of vaccine development due to COVID-19 is likely to limit the useful window of using an unrelated vaccine to shield people. ‘With mRNA vaccines and simple protein vaccines, we have seen some incredibly fast progress from having the sequence of a virus to getting a vaccine approved,’ he said. ‘Next time there’s a pandemic, I would hope that would happen in an even more smooth, streamlined manner because of our experience with COVID.’ However, he does not rule out the possibility altogether. ‘There would still be a period of few months, where potentially [the development of a vaccine] might not have happened yet. ‘Any other way to increase our immunity would be an advantage.’ Log in below to join the conversation.

People can purchase the test online or at a retail store, and the turnaround time for results is typically one to two days once the sample has arrived at the lab, Labcorp told NBC News in a statement. Tests that can detect multiple respiratory viruses already exist, but they usually require people to go to a health care provider, who collects the nasal swab sample from the patient and then sends it off to a lab to be analyzed.Labcorp's newly authorized test removes some of the red tape, allowing Americans to collect a sample from the convenience of their own home.A test that looks for Covid, flu and RSV is “sort of the Holy Grail,” said Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer for eMed, a company that provides telehealth and at-home testing services. All are dangerous respiratory viruses that, in total, cause tens of thousands of deaths each year. The test will likely remove barriers and increase access to testing, particularly in underserved populations where people may not be able to go into a clinic to get a test or in situations where people don't feel comfortable getting tested, said Jennifer Smith, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. Labcorp's test is a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction test. This type of test works by detecting tiny snippets of genetic material from the viruses in question. A test kit costs $169, according to a Labcorp spokesperson Chris Allman.Smith said the price tag wasn't surprising, noting that people are getting three tests in one.She hopes the new test will lead to even greater advancements, including tests that can be taken at home and don't need to be shipped to a lab to be analyzed.“Technology is advancing very quickly, and in due time, home-based point of care testing using PCR will likely be an option in the near future,” she said.Matthew Binnicker, a clinical virologist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, agreed, saying he wouldn't be surprised if "a true 'at-home' molecular test targeting Covid-19, influenza and RSV is available within the next 12 months."The FDA said in a release that people ages 18 and older can collect their own samples while people ages 14 to 17 can collect their samples with adult supervision. Adults need to assist children under age 14, according to the agency. Test results are delivered through an online portal, the agency said, with follow-up from a health care provider for positive or invalid test results.While exciting, Smith, of the University of North Carolina, said there needs to be a focus by state and federal officials to implement systems that allow people who test positive to seek the appropriate care that they need.

Why That Has One U of G Researcher Concerned Avian Flu Has Been Found in Foxes. Why That Has One U of G Researcher Concerned The discovery of the first case of avian influenza in two young foxes is a worrying development, says a University of Guelph pathobiologist. Dr. Scott Weese is the chief of infection control at the Ontario Veterinary College and the director of U of G’s Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses. His research focuses on emerging infectious diseases among animals. Dr. Scott Weese Weese said while it is well known that a new strain of highly pathogenic H5N1 is spreading rapidly among poultry farms as well as among wild birds, including crows, eagles and geese, the discovery of the virus in two young foxes marks the first time the virus has been found in a mammal in Canada. Weese suspects the fox kits likely caught the virus after eating an infected bird or through interactions with their parents or litter mates, as described in a post on his blog Worms & Germs. It’s hard to say whether other mammals in Ontario have been infected with H5N1, but it’s likely that there have been other sporadic infections, Weese added. “The main big-picture concern with spillover infections is the potential for the emergence of a new flu variant, through adaptation of that strain to the new species, or, more critically, recombination of influenza viruses within the new host,” he explained. “Most of the time, spillover events are sporadic and a dead end for the virus… so it dies out. However, that’s not guaranteed in every case. ‘We simply don’t want more flu viruses in circulation’ “What we’re most worried about is situations where an individual human or animal gets infected with this flu virus and one of the other circulating flu viruses. When that happens, there is the potential that those viruses exchange genes to become a new flu virus, possibly one that is more able to infect people.” While the risk is likely low, infection of wild mammals shows potential concerns with domestic animals, Weese said. To reduce the risk of a spillover event, it’s important to control flu viruses in wild species as much as possible, as well as to control flu in domestic animals. “We simply don’t want more flu viruses in circulation,” he said. “The more circulating flu viruses in different species, the greater chance of a problem.” There’s a theoretical risk that dogs (which, like foxes, are also canids) could become a host for a new strain because they are susceptible to some flu strains. Cats could also be infected with some avian flu strains by eating birds. The likelihood of dogs or cats becoming infected with avian flu is relatively low, said Weese. Nevertheless, he recommended dog owners use common sense to reduce the risk of their pets being exposed to infected birds or other species. That means avoiding sick and dead birds, as well as keeping dogs and cats away from sick and dead birds and their poop, and from wandering off in areas where avian flu has been reported. Weese is available for interviews.

In 2015, a virulent avian flu outbreak nearly wiped out his flock.Barns once filled with chattering birds were suddenly silent. Employees were anguished by having to kill sickened animals. The family business, started in 1924, was at serious risk.His business recovered, but now the virus is back, again imperiling the nation's poultry farms. And this time, there's another pernicious force at work: a potent wave of misinformation that claims the bird flu isn't real.“You just want to beat your head against the wall,” Moline said of the Facebook groups in which people insist the flu is fake or, maybe, a bioweapon. “I understand the frustration with how COVID was handled. I understand the lack of trust in the media today. I get it. But this is real."While it poses little risk to humans, the global outbreak has led farmers to cull millions of birds and threatens to add to already rising food prices.It's also spawning fantastical claims similar to the ones that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring how conspiracy theories often emerge at times of uncertainty, and how the internet and a deepening distrust of science and institutions fuel their spread.The claims can be found on obscure online message boards and major platforms like Twitter. Some versions claim the flu is fake, a hoax being used to justify reducing the supply of birds in an effort to drive up food prices, either to wreck the global economy or force people into vegetarianism.“There is no ‘bird flu’ outbreak," wrote one man on Reddit. “It’s just Covid for chickens."Other posters insist the flu is real, but that it was genetically engineered as a weapon, possibly intended to touch off a new round of COVID-style lockdowns. A version of the story popular in India posits that 5G cell towers are somehow to blame for the virus.As evidence, many of those claiming that the flu is fake note that animal health authorities monitoring the outbreak are using some of the same technology used to test for COVID-19.“They’re testing the animals for bird flu with PCR tests. That should give you a clue as to what’s going on,” wrote one Twitter user, in a post that’s been liked and retweeted thousands of times.In truth, PCR tests have been used routinely in medicine, biology and even law enforcement for decades; their creator won a Nobel Prize in 1993.The reality of the outbreak is far more mundane, if no less devastating to birds and people who depend on them for their livelihood.Farmers in states like Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota have already culled millions of fowl to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Zoos around the U.S. have moved exotic bird exhibits indoors to protect their animals, and wildlife authorities are discouraging backyard bird feeding in some states to prevent the spread by wild birds. The disease has also claimed bald eagles around the country.The first known human case of the H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. was confirmed last month in Colorado in a prison inmate who had been assisting with culling and disposing of poultry at a local farm.Most human cases involve direct contact with infected birds, meaning the risk to a broad population is low, but experts around the country are monitoring the virus closely just to be sure, according to Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, an agency that tracks animal disease in part to protect the state's agricultural industries.“I can guarantee you, this is the real deal,” Poulsen told The Associated Press. “We certainly aren’t making this up.”Poultry farms drive the local economy in some parts of Wisconsin, Poulsen said, adding that a devastating outbreak of avian flu could create real hardships for farmers as well as consumers.While the details may vary, the conspiracy theories about avian flu all speak to a distrust of authority and institutions, and a suspicion that millions of doctors, scientists, veterinarians, journalists and elected officials around the world can no longer be trusted.“Americans clearly understand that the federal government and major media have lied to them repeatedly, and are completely corrupted by the pharmaceutical companies,” said Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopath whose discredited claims about vaccines, masks and the coronavirus made him a prominent source of COVID-19 misinformation.Mercola's interest in the bird flu dates back years A 2009 book for sale on his website, which Mercola uses to sell unproven natural health remedies, is titled “The Great Bird Flu Hoax.”Polls show trust in many American institutions — including the news media — has fallen in recent years. Trust in science and scientific experts is also down, and along partisan lines.Moline, the Iowa turkey farmer, said he sympathizes with people who question what they read about viruses, given the last two years and bitter debates about masks, vaccines and lockdowns. But he said anyone who doubts the existence or seriousness of the avian flu doesn't understand the threat.The 2015 outbreak was later determined to be the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. Moline's farm had to cull tens of thousands of turkeys after the flu got into one of his barns. Workers at the farm now abide by a hygiene policy meant to limit the spread of viruses, including using different pairs of boots and clothes for different barns.Conspiracy theories are bound to flourish during times of social unrest or unease, according to John Jackson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.Before the internet, there were likely just as many people who privately doubted explanations for big events, Jackson said. But they enjoyed limited opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, few chances to win new converts, and no way to broadcast their views to strangers.Now, the conspiracy theories that gain wide popularity — such as the QAnon movement or discredited claims about COVID-19 — work because they give believers a sense of control in a rapidly changing, interconnected world, Jackson said. While they can emerge after disasters, assassinations or plane crashes, they can also appear during times of social upheaval or rapid change.“There isn't a phenomena on the planet, whether it’s the avian flu or 5G, that isn’t already primed for conspiracists,” Jackson said. “Now we have coronavirus, which has traumatized us so profoundly ... we look at this same idea of bird flu with completely new eyes, and we bring different kinds of conspiracy to it.”Claims that the avian flu is a hoax used to drive up food prices also highlight real-world concerns about inflation and food shortages. Worries that the flu is somehow linked to 5G towers underscore anxieties about technological change. Suggestions that it will be used to mandate vegetarianism, on the other hand, reflect uncertainties about sustainable agriculture, climate change and animal welfare.By creating explanations, conspiracy theories can offer the believer a sense of power or control, Jackson said. But he said they also defy common sense in their cinematic fantasies about vast, sprawling conspiracies of millions working with clockwork efficiency to undermine human affairs.“Conspiracy theories rest on the idea that humans have the capacity for keeping secrets,” Jackson said. “But they underestimate the reality that we aren’t very good at keeping them.”Most Read 2 men die in Wood County house fire, still under investigation Authorities believe ‘missing’ father of 3 faked his disappearance, fled the countryElementary school employees accused of feeding hot sauce, spicy Takis to special needs student with digestive disability, other abuse WATCH: Three area football teams advances to Level 4, Owen-Withee moves on 8-player championship 10-year-old girl makes over $2,000 selling chickens, but the bank kept the money, family says 1 arrested, 1 injured in Forest County shooting 2 children die in crash after speeding driver runs red light, slams into their car, police sayBobby Allison, NASCAR Hall of Famer and 3-time Daytona 500 winner, dies at 86Latest NewsJudge rejects GOP call to give Wisconsin youth prison counselors more freedom to punish inmatesTurnout in Wisconsin election tops 26%, highest in 60 years for fall primary in presidential yearRepublicans are gathering in Milwaukee to nominate Donald Trump again.

The prestigious Fellowship honours Professor Stephen Locarnini by providing support to a talented early to mid-career researcher who is specialising in the field of virology, and was made possible thanks to a generous donation from the Morningside Foundation. Dr Koutsakos, a Research Fellow in the laboratory of Professor Stephen Kent at the Doherty Institute, said he was honoured to be named the Locarnini-Morningside Fellow. “It is an incredible opportunity that will enable me to undertake cutting-edge virology research,” Dr Koutsakos said. “I am grateful to the Morningside Foundation for their support, and the Doherty Institute for awarding me the Fellowship.” Dr Koutsakos will use the Fellowship to further his research into understanding how the immune system recognises influenza B viruses and how the virus changes to escape antibody responses. “I hope to gain novel insights that may facilitate the development of an influenza B vaccine that does not require annual reformation,” Dr Koutsakos said. The Morningside Foundation has a long history of supporting science and enabling education through philanthropic donations, beginning in 1996 with the establishment of the Morningside Centre for Mathematics. Their philanthropic efforts now benefit a global audience and include providing 500 scholarships annually to allow underprivileged students to attend top universities and gifting $350 million to Harvard University to support its School of Public Health. Dr Gerald Chan, Chairman and CEO of the Morningside Foundation said that the Foundation honors Professor Locarnini. “He has done so much in advancing virology,” Dr Chan said. “It is most fitting that his legacy would include the training of virologists for the future.” University of Melbourne Professor Sharon Lewin, Director of the Doherty Institute, congratulated Dr Koutsakos on the appointment. “Dr Koutsakos is a truly worthy recipient of the Fellowship, having already carved out a remarkable career,” Professor Lewin said. “This Fellowship will enable him to build on his significant portfolio of research by developing and leading his own research program at the Doherty Institute. “It is important to be able to support the next generation of virology researchers such as Marios and we are incredibly thankful for the Morningside Foundation’s significant support that has enabled us to create this opportunity for him.” Professor Locarnini, whom the Fellowship is named after, retired as Head of Research and Molecular Development at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at the Doherty Institute in 2019. His decades of research and public health contributions in understanding viral infectious diseases and hepatitis have advanced the field of molecular virology and drug resistance, leading to improved diagnosis, treatment and control of viral hepatitis.

Nearly 38 million birds have been culled in 35 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Yet despite the horrific effects the disease has had on the state’s flocks, the wallets of poultry farmers and, potentially, on already rising food prices, conspiracy theories have popped up online that it’s a hoax or a biological weapon. “You just want to beat your head against the wall,” Iowa turkey farmer Brad Moline told the Associated Press. “I understand the frustration with how COVID was handled.

Since then, more than 13.3 million birds have been culled from 15 affected flocks. The outbreak has led to the quarantine of bird populations. Poultry shows and exhibitions were been canceled, ahead of summer fair season. In Iowa, the virus has been waning, with the last confirmed outbreak on May 2 in a backyard flock in Bremer County.

(KOMO) – Officials across the U.S. are stepping up efforts to combat bird flu as it continues to wipe out thousands of animals.Experts with Washington state’s Department of Agriculture have asked for live market poultry sales to be stopped for the next 30 days as officials work to curb the spread of bird flu in the region..The move comes asseven counties in the stateare now reporting cases of avian influenza.“Temporarily suspending poultry and waterfowl sales is recommended until detections across Washington slow down. This may extend until the end of June,” veterinarian Dr. Amber Itle said in a news release. “Stopping these sales protects not only these backyard flocks but small and large commercial flocks as well,” she added. “It is all about reducing risk. Bringing birds from different flocks together definitely increases opportunities for this virus to spread and impact more birds.”Itle also asked people to watch out for animals that could transmit the virus."We know that avian influenza is very unlikely to infect a cat, or a dog," Itle said. "We do know they can act as fomites, just like we can on our feet. They can carry that virus around on their paws."Micha Ide owns Bright Ide Acres with her husband, and their farm in Orting sells chicken and turkey meat.Their farm is located in Pierce County, which has recorded cases of the the virus. Ide said they cannot risk bird flu coming to their farm."If we did get it on our farm and it was confirmed and they would have to come out and euthanize all of our birds and then we couldn't have any more poultry on our farm for the rest of the season," Ide said. "It would really decimate a big chunk of our business."The farm has been forced to take safety precautions."We have a boot wash station that anyone visiting the farm will use," Ide said. "If folks do have wild water fowl, I will probably not let them on to the farm, or ask that they wear boots that have never been worn at their farm if possible."I think all of the confirmed cases have been backyard flocks. So actually, the people who should be paying the most attention to this are those folks that are just raising birds in their back yard for their own eggs and for fun," Ide said. "Those people often have less bio security in place."While bird flu poses little risk to humans, outbreaks have led farmers to cull millions of birds and threaten to add to already rising food prices. Other states that have recently seen cases include Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wyoming and Maine.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Us© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsFCCFCCEEOPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Queensland health system faces 'dire' strain on hospitals amid staffing shortages and a surge in flu cases - ABC NewsSkip to main contentABC NewsJust InFor YouPoliticsUS ElectionWorldBusinessAnalysisSportLifestyleEntertainmentMoreSearch the news, stories & peopleLog inNews HomeJust InFor YouAnalysisRuralWatch LiveHealthIndigenousPoliticsUS ElectionScienceElectionsWorldEnvironmentInvestigationsBusinessFact CheckLocal newsSportAFLNRLFootballTennisCricketNetballLifestyleWellbeingRelationships & FamilyFood & RecipesPersonal FinanceHome & GardenEntertainmentTV & MoviesBooksMusicPop CultureArtsYour ABC AccountPersonalise the news andstay in the knowLog in to personaliseFacebookYouTubeInstagramTwitterEmergencyBackstoryNewsletters中文新闻BERITA BAHASA INDONESIATOK PISINABCABC iViewABC ListenTriple JABC KidsABC NewsABC News News HomeLatest updatesAsk a questionShare Queensland health system faces 'dire' strain on hospitals amid staffing shortages and a surge in flu casesBy Tobias Jurss-Lewis and Lexy Hamilton-SmithTopic:Health AdministrationWed 18 May 2022Wednesday 18 May 2022Wed 18 May 2022 at 4:08amDisplay captionHealth Minister Yvette D'Ath says the major strain on Queensland's hospitals has been driven by "factors we cannot control".

It is just awful. It is not safe and it is not fair, it is not safe on our staff and it is certainly not fair on the community," Dr Raghwan said.Dr Shantha Raghwan says Queensland's access block is dangerous. (ABC News: Lexy Hamilton-Smith)"Really it is a mismatch between resources and we have the services that are required by the community at the moment."Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said the problem was driven "by other factors that we cannot control", including the COVID-19 pandemic and failings in the aged care sector."When you can't afford private health insurance, when you can't get into private specialists, when you cannot access GPs, when you cannot get an NDIS package, when you cannot get the support you need in aged care you turn to the public health system," she said."We have 520 long-stay patients who do not require medical care in our hospitals today who need an NDIS or aged care package.Health experts say ambulance ramping has been bad in Queensland in recent weeks. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)"We have another 462 patients in our public hospital beds with COVID and an additional 49 patients in private."Ms D'Ath said more than 1,600 health staff were also isolating due to COVID.'We are worried': Surge in flu casesQueensland Health's acting chief operating officer Dr David Rosengren said he expected the flu season could further increase demand on hospitals.He said the state had seen a surge in influenza cases over the "last couple of weeks", including an increase in people admitted to intensive care with the illness."We are worried … we haven't had a flu season in Queensland for a couple of years," he said."Don't contribute to the burden of demand on our emergency departments by finding yourself in the back of an ambulance being transported to a hospital because you haven't found the time or effort to get a flu vaccine."Opposition Leader David Crisafulli says Queensland's health system has been in decline for more than half a decade. (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)Opposition Leader David Crisafulli said the state's health system was in crisis "long before" COVID and that immediate action was required."COVID was that added pressure on the health system but it's been over half a decade in decline and we have now reached the situation where experts are telling patients and staff to come forward and tell their stories."We absolutely need more resources … more beds, more doctors, more nurses."He called on the Queensland government to release "real-time" hospital data.AMAQ president Chris Perry said the hospital overcrowding was a product of chronic underfunding rather than the pandemic."There's 9 per cent of gross domestic product being spent on health and it's been like that for 40 years," he said."We're very disappointed with the health policies of both major parties."Both sides of the house in both levels of parliament of Australia have been shooting the messenger: it is all doctors' fault, somebody else's fault, it is never them."We need somewhere between $20 billion and $30 billion in the forward estimates to get our hospitals in Australia back to the level that we need."We need to increase the [Medicare] rebates so that GPs can stay afloat."We have inadequate beds … it's got nothing to do with low-grade COVID cases crowding accident and emergency wards."'Shared responsibility'Ms D'Ath said the state had delivered "consecutive record health budgets" but needed more funding from the federal government to improve hospital performance.[Qld local edition teaser]"This is not about shifting responsibility it's about sharing responsibility, and it's not about politics," she said."We need investment and Commonwealth health funding in aged care, in NDIS, in private health insurance and we need more support for GPs."Mr Crisafulli agreed Queensland needed "more from the Commonwealth" but said the state government needed to act."That involves working with Canberra for more money, but it also involves fixing the things you are accountable for," he said."Start by sharing data in real time … start by putting doctors and nurses back in charge, look at the way you triage in the ED."Posted Wed 18 May 2022 at 4:08amWednesday 18 May 2022 at 4:08amWed 18 May 2022 at 4:08am, updated Wed 18 May 2022 at 7:14amWednesday 18 May 2022 at 7:14amWed 18 May 2022 at 7:14amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

What to know, and how symptoms differ from COVID-19 Detections of seasonal respiratory viruses have increased since February 2022, with influenza accounting for most of the increase in recent weeks, Health Canada says. Photo: Kelly Sikkema. By Lucas Casaletto Posted May 17, 2022 11:46 am. Last Updated May 17, 2022 1:14 pm. Influenza, the common cold, seasonal allergies and COVID-19. The month of May is as synonymous with sunshine and warmth as runny noses and a scratchy throat with flowers blooming and bees pollinating. What makes people uneasy is how symptoms directly compare to COVID-19 and how best to differentiate signs of allergies from that of the coronavirus. But what about the common cold and influenza (the flu)? According to Health Canada’s most recent weekly influenza report — which examined flu cases from April 17 to May 7 — since the beginning of April, detections of influenza have sharply increased and have met seasonable thresholds. Health Canada says just under 5,000 laboratory cases of influenza were detected in the country in the weeks mentioned. Among the cases with precise age data, the majority were individuals under the age of 45 years. Health Canada notes that increases in flu-like illness and hospitalizations are currently taking place, adding that elevated flu activity — 249 influenza-associated hospitalizations — has occurred over the past few weeks. Additional statistics show that the percentage of Canadians reporting “influenza-like illness (ILI)” to doctors was 2.1 per cent. “The percentage visits for ILI has now exceeded the pre-pandemic levels typical of this time of year,” Health Canada says, adding that the IMPACT network has seen a “sharp increase” in influenza-associated hospitalizations among the pediatric population.

That data seems to align with what Chicago has reported in recent days. According to city data, there were about 300 known flu cases a week throughout April and during the first part of May. The city uses data on test results reported by several Chicago hospital labs. By comparison, there were just tens of cases a week throughout most of January and February. RELATED: Allergy season to arrive earlier and be far more intense, study shows Officials with Health Canada say that detections of seasonal respiratory viruses have also increased since February 2022, with influenza accounting for most of the growth in recent weeks. Health Canada says that the activity of most respiratory viruses is within or below expected levels for this time of year. “Influenza is the most common seasonal respiratory virus detected in Canada as we conclude the third week of the influenza season,” writes the Public Health Agency of Canada. “[The] activity of other respiratory viruses is low; however, the activity of seasonal human coronavirus (178 detections; 4.8 per cent positive) remains slightly above expected levels.” Meanwhile, Health Canada data shows Rhinovirus test positivity — the main culprit behind the common cold — is up slightly compared to past weeks, including higher detection in Ontario compared to other provinces. Ontario is reporting 11 new deaths linked to COVID-19 today. The province says that figure includes deaths from previous days recorded during a data clean-up. There are 1,345 people hospitalized with the virus today, up from 1,122. Health Canada says Canadians with influenza-like illnesses are on the rise. Photo: Unsplash. Comparing flu, cold symptoms with COVID-19: What to know COVID-19, the common cold, seasonal allergies and the flu have many similar signs and symptoms, notes Mayo Clinic. Health officials continue to stress that the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and tiredness. Symptom COVID-19 Cold Cough Usually (dry) Usually Muscle aches Usually Sometimes Tiredness Usually Sometimes Sneezing Rarely Sometimes Sore throat Usually Usually Runny or stuffy nose Usually Usually Fever Usually Sometimes Diarrhea Sometimes Never Nausea or vomiting Sometimes Never New loss of taste or smell Usually (early — often without a runny or stuffy nose) Sometimes (especially with a stuffy nose) COVID-19 symptoms typically appear two to 14 days after exposure, while signs of a common cold generally start to show one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Most healthy individuals recover from a common cold in three to 10 days, although some colds may linger for two or three weeks. The flu works differently. Compared to COVID-19, it’s less transmissible, and COVID-19 can also take longer before people show symptoms. People can remain contagious for longer periods of time. The Centre Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 just by looking at the symptoms because they show some of the same signs. Typically, a person may experience flu-like symptoms anywhere from 1 to 4 days after infection. Most people with influenza are contagious for about one day before they show symptoms, while older children and adults appear to be most contagious during the first three-to-four days of their illness. Most people who get flu will recover on their own in a few days to two weeks. Symptom COVID-19 Flu Cough Usually (dry) Usually Muscle aches Usually Usually Tiredness Usually Usually Sore throat Usually Usually Runny or stuffy nose Usually Usually Fever Usually Usually — not always Nausea or vomiting Sometimes Sometimes (more common in children) Diarrhea Sometimes Sometimes (more common in children) Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Usually Usually New loss of taste or smell Usually (early — often without a runny or stuffy nose) Rarely Submit a Correction Accessibility Feedback Top Stories Remembrance Day ceremonies and what's open and closed on Monday Remembrance Day is Monday and events are being held in Toronto and the GTA to honour those who served Canada during times of war.

Box 2. Post-acute COVID-19 symptoms2,3,12,15 Common symptoms include: fatigue dyspnoea joint pain chest pain cough change in sense of smell or taste cognitive disturbances hoarse voice Less common symptoms include: insomnia low-grade fevers headaches neurocognitive difficulties myalgia and weakness gastrointestinal symptoms rash depression Management of these presentations will usually be pragmatic and symptomatic. Support your patient to maximise their personal wellbeing through diet, exercise and sleep. Consider and exclude serious complications and possible alternative causes of ongoing symptoms, such as anaemia. Investigate new or worsening symptoms that could indicate delayed sequelae, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), cardiac complications or pneumonia. Where possible, optimise the management of the patient’s other chronic conditions. Identify other social factors that could intersect with their personal health and wellbeing, including smoking, alcohol intake, drug use, risk of mental health issues, risk of family and intimate partner violence, and risk of social isolation. Consider current recommendations for management of specific symptoms (refer to Box 3). Management should be guided by the patient’s specific clinical circumstances and be evidence based. Specialist referral should be undertaken, as required. Box 3. Management of common symptoms Breathlessness:2,3 Optimise management of pre-existing respiratory conditions Recommend respiratory muscle conditioning (pulmonary rehabilitation) Consider chest X-ray at 12 weeks for patients who have had significant respiratory illness Corticosteroids could be considered for inflammatory lung disease on the advice of a respiratory physician Recommend gradual commencement or return to symptom-limited exercise guided by tertiary-trained exercise professionals Referral to a speech pathologist for management of chronic cough, hoarse voice or dysphagia Consider home pulse oximetry measurement Referral to an Accredited Practising Dietitian if symptoms interfere with nutrition, and speech pathology if dysphagia is present Fatigue:2,9,16 Maximise self-care, sleep, relaxation and nutrition Recommend that patients pace and be selective when prioritising daily activities Recommend caution with return to exercise (reduce if there is any increase in symptoms) A monitored return to exercise can be supported by an exercise physiology, physiotherapy or rehabilitation referral If fatigue is causing difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs), recommend energy conservation techniques and home visits by an occupational therapist or rehabilitation service Chest pain:2,9,17 Exclude acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, pulmonary effusion or pulmonary embolism, and arrhythmia Provide education regarding symptoms of concern Patients who have had myocarditis or pericarditis as a component of their acute illness should abstain from vigorous exercise for 3–6 months, and athletes should have cardiology supervision for return to training Refer for graded increase in low-to-moderate activity to increase mobility, exercise capacity and quality of life; this should be facilitated by a physiotherapist or exercise physiologist, or cardiac rehabilitation program Headaches, low-grade fevers and myalgia:2 Exclude COVID-19 reinfection or recrudescence Prescribe simple supportive measures and analgesia or antipyretics, as needed Check for secondary infections and prescribe antibiotics, as appropriate Neurocognitive difficulty:2,9 Provide supportive management If severe enough to cause difficulty with ADLs, consider cognitive testing, occupational therapy support and speech pathology support for cognitive communication impairment Depression/anxiety:2,18 Provide information about post–COVID-19 recovery Use existing standardised screening tools Address multifactorial contributors that might require assistance with pain management, independence with ADLs, financial and other social supports, and loneliness Facilitate access to mental health services or online support if patient is unwilling to access face-to-face counselling Encourage individualised moderate-intensity exercise initiated and supervised by a tertiary-trained exercise professional Refer to an Accredited Practising Dietitian for nutrition support and access to food services Thrombosis risk and contraceptive choice:19 COVID-19 causes a hypercoagulable state in some people, which might worsen the VTE risk associated with combined hormonal contraception. The incidence of VTE in biological females of reproductive age with COVID-19 infection is currently not known Patients should be advised of this risk to allow informed choice of contraceptive option For biological females who have had mild or moderate COVID-19 and stopped oral menopausal hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy, if recommencing, consider using a transdermal preparation For biological females who have had COVID-19 and who are taking oestrogen-containing contraception, manage these medications as per usual care For biological females who have stopped or suspended contraception when they have contracted COVID-19, contraception can be restarted when acute symptoms have resolved Patient collaboration Collaborate with the patient to develop an individualised management plan to support their recovery. This might also present an opportunity for the development of multidisciplinary models of care guided by the general practice team, using chronic disease management plans, team care plans and case conference items. It is important to ensure that if you use specific Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items for this (eg Item 721: GP management plan) that you are familiar with and follow the specific item requirements (including descriptors and notes). Allied health and other specialist collaboration Your initial assessment will help inform your management plan. Your patient could benefit from allied health input. Consider collaborating with community and hospital-based allied health, rehabilitation medicine and geriatric medicine services to support individual management planning where appropriate. This might include: physiotherapists exercise physiologists occupational therapists dietitians speech pathologists psychologists occupational and environmental physicians rehabilitation medicine physicians geriatric medicine physicians rehabilitation medicine services including outpatients, day rehabilitation and inpatient rehabilitation geriatric medicine services including outpatients, and geriatric evaluation and management units. Multidisciplinary clinics for the management of post–COVID-19 conditions have been established in some jurisdictions. It may be appropriate to refer eligible patients with post–COVID-19 sequalae to these clinics. Eligibility criteria and referral processes will be defined by each jurisdiction. Check your local Health Pathways or contact your PHN for information on clinics in your area. Alternately your local Health Pathways might have referral pathways for other allied health and specialist clinics. Barriers in accessing allied health services might exist for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients with low English proficiency due to lack of interpreter funding. When referring your patients, ensure the service is able to provide the appropriate care. References World Health Organization.

And how to you tell it apart from COVID-19 or the flu? Dr Nirvana Luckraj dispels some common misconceptions.By Alex ChapmanA leading doctor is urging Australians to be vigilant for so-called “flurona” infections - as she dispels some common misconceptions.Flurona made headlines earlier this month when a Victorian woman died after being diagnosed with both COVID and the flu.Watch more on this story in the video aboveKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Experts say there’s a heightened possibility people could be infected simultaneously as we enter the winter months.Dr Nirvana Luckraj, the Chief Medical Officer at national public health information service Healthdirect, told 7NEWS.com.au flurona was commonly misconceived as a new virus.Experts are tipping a bad flu season due to lack of exposure during the height of the pandemic. File image. Credit: AAPIn reality, she said, it’s a “non-medical term” that means someone has flu and COVID at the same time.“With COVID continuing to circulate in the community and cases still high in some states, combined with the predicted flu season we are expecting now that restrictions have eased, it’s quite possible that a person could have flu and COVID at the same time,” she said.“It’s something we want to prevent as these are both potentially severe illnesses and combined would be particularly serious.”Vaccination is the key to avoiding serious illness, she said.But don’t expect your COVID jabs to have any impact on the flu.“The flu vaccine is specifically designed for flu virus and COVID vaccines for COVID – they don’t protect against each other so it’s important to get both vaccines for best prevention this winter.“Vaccines are one of the most important and simple measures we can take to keep ourselves, our families and communities healthy.”Dr Nirvana Luckraj. Credit: HealthdirectCases of the flu have been jumping across Australia, with COVID cases also remaining stubbornly high.In New South Wales alone, there were 2000 cases of the flu reported in the week ending May 7, almost doubling from the week earlier.School settings, in particular, are vulnerable to flu outbreaks, Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said.“As with COVID-19, boarding schools are a high-risk setting for flu transmission. We’re strongly encouraging all students and staff in boarding schools to get their flu vaccine,” Chant said.“Boarders with flu should be isolated from others until their symptoms resolve. If a school has three or more boarders with flu, they are urged to contact the local Public Health Unit for advice.”Health authorities say flu shots protect the wider community with cases rising ahead of winter. Credit: AAPBut how do you know if you have the flu, COVID, or both?Luckraj said there were many similarities, given they’re both contagious respiratory diseases.However, COVID appears to be more contagious.“You really can’t tell or self-diagnose by just symptoms alone, so it’s important to get tested for COVID to know for sure,” she said.“If you are otherwise fit and healthy, there is usually no need to see a doctor if you have flu-like symptoms.“However, if you have more severe symptoms such as breathing difficulties, an intense headache, are unable to keep down fluids or if you’re just concerned you should speak to your doctor or call Healthdirect to speak to a registered nurse who can help advise next steps.”Contracting both the flu and COVID is possible through the winter months. Credit: Guido Mieth/Getty ImagesA recent study in the UK found flurona doubled the risk of death from either virus.Dr Paul Griffin, Infectious Diseases Expert at the University of Queensland, said flurona was “quite significant”.“We need people to be concerned enough about this to go and get vaccinated,” he said.“Flurona is quite significant, and we know it greatly increases the chance of all the serious outcomes from either infection.“So you’re much more likely to end up in hospital, and much more likely to have those serious consequences.”Taking vitamins to help recover from COVID?

(30832929)But poultry keepers are still advised to maintain good levels of biosecurity and to keep their details registered with the States’ veterinary officers.The measures, which including registering birds, were brought in earlier this year due to avian flu outbreaks in the UK and Europe.Avian influenza is a viral infection of domestic poultry and wild birds.The order was due to lapse on 1 January 2023, but has been revoked early.States veterinary officer David Chamberlain said it was good news to be able to revoke the compulsory measures early and in time for summer events.‘However, it is highly likely that bird flu will reoccur yearly and therefore we want to stress the need to still maintain good biosecurity measures,’ he said. ‘For example, only keeping as many birds as you can house safely in an outbreak.‘We are also still recommending poultry keepers to register their details with us voluntarily so that we can notify them of important developments and distribute the latest guidance directly.‘Knowing the numbers and locations of poultry on-island will also help us in the event of a future outbreak.’Poultry keepers’ data will be removed from the States veterinary officers’ database by the end of May, unless poultry keepers email svo@gov.gg or call 01481 221161 by then. A voluntary register will remain in place.n All poultry keepers are advised to read the information on avian influenza at https://gov.gg/animalhealth.Similar storiesBig projects at risk as P&R starts mini-BudgetNews|Just nowLes Beaucamps class sizes are fastest-growing of 11-16 schoolsNews|Just nowPublic get to see plans for Victor Huge CentreNews|1 hour agoSixth Form Centre at La Mare remodelling to start in summerNews|1 hour ago‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|1 hour agoMost popular1Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|19 hours ago2GST heading your way for 2027News|Nov 83‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|1 hour ago4Queens Road Medical Practice opens at new site on MondayNews|Nov 95St James grateful but future is still uncertainNews|Nov 9Follow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.

In an interview, Prof Mulenga said COVID-19 barely affected the lower parts of the lungs. “Yes, it’s possible [to contract COVID-19 and influenza at the same time]. When you look at Covid, Covid affects the airways and those airways once they are affected, there are certain cells which it multiplies inside in the lungs and it establishes itself in those same cells. Now the influenza, remember it’s a virus, there are two types of influenza, type A and type B. And what we are dealing with is type A and again there are a lot of what you can call variants as well,” he said. “Covid affects Alveolar cells whereas as this one affects the lining of the respiratory system. The lining of the airways, which are affected by the influenza and that causes an inflammation or establishment of the infection in the airways. So the mechanism through which they affect the lungs are different. And also one thing you need to note is that influenza barely affects the lower parts of the lungs whereas Covid can affect the lower parts of the lungs and causes pneumonia. You can have an individual getting both influenza and also Covid.” Prof Mulenga said Influenza had not been a major public health problem, which was why the ministry had not invested in vaccinations against the same. “Let’s say someone has TB and they have influenza, someone has chronic lung condition and they have influenza, then it speeds up the acceleration of the other infection. Otherwise, it’s not as lethal as Covid. It’s a virus, just like Covid is caused by a virus, even influenza, it’s a virus which causes the influenza. Influenza doesn’t have chronic life long effects although there have been some cases of people after recovering from influenza, a chronic fatigue just like Covid and it may be similar to what is called post-viral syndrome,” said Prof Mulenga. “Yes there is a vaccine for influenza and usually you may have heard of it called a season flu vaccine. Because almost every season you have a new variant of influenza, so even the vaccines have to be changed as well to suit the new variant or the new strain. It’s one of the vaccine-preventable diseases. We are not vaccinating against influenza. Remember it hasn’t been a major public health problem in our area so there are a lot of diseases which can be vaccinated against, but because we don’t have high frequency of that influenza that is the reason we cannot invest in the vaccination.” [TheChamp-Sharing count="1" total_shares="ON"] Opinion Poll Which of the following do you support?

Even though MoH has not yet recorded an excessive amount of influenza cases, some people have been attributing this influenza activity to COVID-19 infection.People with mild flu, who would normally stay at home and not get tested for flu, are visiting the doctor and getting tested because they think they might have Covid.Two weeks ago when the uptick in flu cases started, the ministry released a statement indicating that the current flu cases surge has nothing to do with COVID-19 but rather a change of season.Health ministry spokesperson, Christopher Nyanga stated then that the increased number of influenza-like illnesses recorded in most parts of the country could not be classified as a pandemic or an outbreak because it was generally common for such cases to increase during the winter season.“Viruses that cause these influenza-like illnesses generally thrive in dry and cold conditions,” he highlighted.Giving a COVID-19 update on Thursday, public health physician from MoH, Thebeyame Macheke said they have recorded an increasing number of flu like illnesses as more people continue to visit health facilities.“We see these numbers going up as we head into the winter season. People are complaining about flu. We believe that we should test everyone who has flu but at the moment as we test them for Covid not all of them test positive. It shows that they have the normal influenza,” he said.Macheke said that people should apply the same COVID-19 precautions for this particular flu and take care of themselves. During this current winter season, MoH has also advised that people should keep warm at all times and should seek medical attention every time they experience any flu-like symptoms.Macheke further said that as the flu cases continue to go up, the COVID-19 infection rate on the other hand is not a cause for concern even though they had recorded a slight change. He said in the week from May 1 to 7 they recorded 105 cases of COVID-19 compared to the 94 cases recorded in the previous week.Macheke also pointed out that currently they have 162 active cases and most of them are isolated at home while only one person had been admitted to Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital.He disclosed that in the same week they have recorded two deaths despite not having had such mortalities in quite some time.Looking at the fact that flu had been circulating at nearly non-existent levels between 2020 and 2021, medical experts said this current flu surge could be tied to people’s behaviour such as taking masks off and mass gatherings.Also the downturn in Covid cases has been linked to pleasing vaccination rates in the country.Currently, Macheke said they have vaccinated 1.5 million people so far out of the recent 2.4 million figures of the population released by the Statistics Botswana in the preliminary results of the 2022 Population and Housing Census.He said that means they have vaccinated 64% of the population and it shows they are almost there in terms of reaching the World Health Organisation’s target of vaccinating 70% of the population by mid-year.
