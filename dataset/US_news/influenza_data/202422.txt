Seasonal flu vaccines cover influenza B and the more common influenza A but do not stimulate the broadest possible range of immune responses against both viruses. In addition, people whose immune systems have been weakened by age or illness may not respond effectively to the flu shot. Small-molecule drugs that block neuraminidase, a major surface glycoprotein of the influenza virus, can help treat early infection, but they provide limited benefit when the infection is more severe, and they are generally less effective in treating influenza B infections. Thus, another way to combat this virus is needed. James Crowe, Jr., MD, and Rachael Wolters, DVM, PhD. (photo by Anthony Czelusniak) Reporting May 31 in the journal Immunity, the VUMC researchers describe how, from the bone marrow of an individual previously vaccinated against influenza, they isolated two groups of monoclonal antibodies that bound to distinct parts of the neuraminidase glycoprotein on the surface of influenza B. One of the antibodies, FluB-400, broadly inhibited virus replication in laboratory cultures of human respiratory epithelial cells. It also protected against influenza B in animal models when given by injection or through the nostrils. Intranasal antibody administration may be more effective and have fewer systemic side effects than more typical routes — intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection — in part because intranasal antibodies may “trap” the virus in the nasal mucus, thereby preventing infection of the underlying epithelial surface, the researchers suggested. These findings support the development of FluB-400 for the prevention and treatment of influenza B and will help guide efforts to develop a universal influenza vaccine, they said. “Antibodies increasingly have become an interesting medical tool to prevent or treat viral infections,” said the paper’s corresponding author, James Crowe Jr., MD. “We set out to find antibodies for the type B influenza virus, which continues to be a medical problem, and we were happy to find such especially powerful molecules in our search.” Crowe, who holds the Ann Scott Carell Chair, is University Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics and director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, which has isolated monoclonal antibodies against a host of viral infections, including COVID-19.

Influenza A(H5) virus infection was detected in two U.S. farm workers during a multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) viruses in dairy cows; these are the first known instances of presumed cow-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses. What is added by this report? Approximately 350 exposed farm workers are being monitored; one of the two cases was identified via daily, active monitoring. Surveillance has identified no unusual influenza activity trends in the United States. A(H5) candidate vaccine viruses are available, and laboratory analyses indicate that A(H5N1) viruses circulating in cows and other animals are susceptible to FDA-approved antivirals. What are the implications for public health practice? Current risk to the U.S. public from A(H5N1) viruses is low; however, persons exposed to infected animals or contaminated materials, including raw cow’s milk, are at higher risk and should take precautions and self-monitor for illness. A One Health (human, animal, and environmental) approach is critical to preparing for circumstances that could increase risk to human health. Article Metrics Altmetric: Box Related MaterialsArticle PDFFull PDF Abstract On April 1, 2024, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported that a dairy farm worker had tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus after exposure to presumably infected dairy cattle; CDC confirmed these laboratory findings. A(H5N1) viruses were found in high concentrations in unpasteurized (raw) milk from infected cows. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and state and local public health and animal health officials using a coordinated One Health approach to identify and prepare for developments that could increase the risk to human health. Activities include monitoring of exposed persons, conducting syndromic and laboratory surveillance, planning epidemiologic investigations, and evaluating medical countermeasures. As of May 22, 2024, approximately 350 farm workers with exposure to dairy cattle or infected raw cow’s milk had been monitored. These monitoring efforts identified a second human A(H5) case with conjunctivitis in Michigan, which was reported on May 22, 2024. CDC considers the current risk to the U.S. public from A(H5N1) viruses to be low; however, persons with exposure to infected animals or contaminated materials, including raw cow’s milk, are at higher risk for A(H5N1) virus infection and should take recommended precautions, including using recommended personal protective equipment, self-monitoring for illness symptoms, and, if they are symptomatic, seeking prompt medical evaluation for influenza testing and antiviral treatment if indicated. Pasteurization inactivates A(H5N1) viruses, and the commercial milk supply is safe for consumption; however, all persons should avoid consuming raw milk or products produced from raw milk. Importantly, the risk to the public might change based on whether A(H5N1) viruses acquire genetic changes that increase their transmissibility to and among humans, which could increase the risk of an influenza pandemic. Top Investigation and Findings Identification of Two Human Cases of Influenza A(H5) Virus Infection On April 1, 2024, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported, after confirmation by CDC, that a commercial dairy farm worker tested positive by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus infection after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with A(H5N1) viruses*,†; CDC confirmed laboratory findings through RT-PCR and sequencing (1). The patient only experienced conjunctivitis without other signs or symptoms, was instructed to isolate, was treated with oseltamivir, and recovered. No illness was identified among the patient’s household members, all of whom received oseltamivir postexposure prophylaxis. One week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had reported a multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) viruses in dairy cows.§ A(H5N1) viruses were also detected in barn cats, birds, and other animals (e.g., one raccoon and two opossums) that lived in and around human habitations and that died on affected farms.¶ Genetic sequencing of the A(H5N1) virus from infected cattle and the farm worker** identified clade 2.3.4.4b; this clade has been detected in U.S. wild birds, commercial poultry, backyard flocks, and other animals since January 2022 (2). On May 22, 2024, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported an A(H5) case in a dairy farm worker on a farm confirmed to have A(H5N1) virus in cattle; this person was enrolled in an active text-based monitoring program and reported only eye symptoms.†† The investigation into this second case is ongoing. These two cases are the first known instances of presumed cow-to-human spread of an avian influenza A virus. Influenza A(H5N1) Viruses in U.S. Dairy Cattle Although first reported in March 2024, A(H5N1) virus infection of U.S. dairy cows might have been occurring since December 2023, according to preliminary data (3). As of May 22, 2024, infected dairy cows had been identified in 52 dairy cattle herds in nine states§§ (Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas). Signs in cattle were nonspecific and included decreased milk production, reduced rumination, and thickened (colostrum-like) milk consistency; some cows also had clear nasal discharge. High A(H5N1) virus levels have also been found in unpasteurized (raw) milk from infected cows(4). Human Cases of Influenza A(H5N1) Worldwide From 1997 through late April 2024, a total of 909 sporadic human A(H5N1) cases were reported worldwide from 23 countries; 52% of human cases have been fatal (2); of the 909 cases, 26 human A(H5N1) cases have been reported from eight countries, including seven deaths, since 2022. Since these numbers were last updated, two additional human A(H5) cases have been detected including the case from Michigan and one case in Australia. Nearly all reported human A(H5N1) cases had reported recent exposure to poultry. In the United States, three human A(H5) cases have been identified to date; all patients had mild illness, were not hospitalized, and fully recovered. The first occurred in April 2022 in a person from Colorado with direct exposure to infected poultry, who only reported fatigue,¶¶ and the second and third occurred in dairy farm workers with conjunctivitis referenced in this report. U.S. Outbreak Response Activities Activities implemented using a One Health*** approach to respond to this outbreak††† include monitoring for infections in exposed persons, conducting syndromic and laboratory surveillance, planning for epidemiologic investigations, and assessing performance of existing medical countermeasures including diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics. To assess A(H5N1) virus pathogenesis, severity, and transmissibility in an animal model of infection, CDC is also conducting laboratory experiments in ferrets. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§ Ferret studies were approved by the CDC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Monitoring of Persons Exposed to Influenza A(H5) Viruses In 2014, CDC began monitoring persons exposed to infected poultry when HPAI A(H5) viruses were first detected in poultry and wild birds in North America (5). Recommendations are to monitor persons exposed to infected birds, poultry, or other animals for 10 days after their last exposure and to test symptomatic persons for influenza A viruses by RT-PCR assay using H5-specific primers and probes, in coordination with state or local health departments (6). During February 2022–May 2024, approximately 9,400 persons in 52 jurisdictions have been monitored. As of May 22, 2024, approximately 350 farm workers had been or were currently being monitored for illness after exposure to infected cows or infected raw cow’s milk; the number of persons monitored continues to increase; data are updated weekly.¶¶¶ Monitoring is performed either through direct daily contact by state or local health departments or by providing persons with information on how to self-monitor and where to seek testing and possible treatment should they experience symptoms. The most recent human A(H5) case was identified through active, daily monitoring of exposed farm workers using a text-based illness monitoring program in Michigan (7). National Surveillance Activities CDC’s influenza surveillance systems**** collect information to track trends in influenza activity and detect changes in circulating influenza viruses, including detection of novel influenza A viruses year-round. Human cases of novel influenza A virus infection have been nationally notifiable since 2007; every identified case is investigated and reported to CDC. Through approximately 300 clinical laboratories, CDC monitors changes in the percentage of influenza tests with positive results in clinical settings. The National Syndromic Surveillance Program collects data from emergency departments and other health care settings, facilitating the detection of unusual trends in influenza diagnoses, including in jurisdictions where A(H5N1) viruses have been identified in animals. CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System†††† complements other existing human influenza surveillance systems in monitoring influenza trends. These monitoring methods detect influenza A viruses but do not distinguish subtypes of influenza A, meaning that current wastewater testing can detect A(H5N1) viruses but cannot distinguish them from other influenza A viruses or determine the source of the influenza A viruses (e.g., humans versus animals or animal products). Together, these systems provide visibility into U.S. influenza activity. As of May 18, 2024, no indicators of unusual human influenza activity, including A(H5N1 virus), had been detected in humans through these systems. CDC’s molecular diagnostic assays are used at more than 100 public health laboratories in all 50 states and other U.S. jurisdictions to detect seasonal and novel influenza A viruses; nine centers also perform genetic sequencing for virus characterization. Statistical methods are used to determine the number of specimens needed to have 95% confidence that at least one novel influenza A virus among all influenza positive specimens per week would be detected given varying influenza prevalence; the number varies by timing during the season. Each state’s contribution is proportional to its population and has been set as a national weekly goal for public health laboratory testing.§§§§ Spring and Summer Activities Multiple efforts are underway to enhance influenza surveillance activities through the spring and summer as part of this response. CDC is working with commercial laboratories to increase submission of influenza-positive test specimens to public health laboratories to increase the number of specimens available for virus subtyping. Approximately 140,000 of these H5-specific tests are already prepositioned at the state and local level, and another 750,000 tests are available for distribution if needed. CDC also continues to collaborate with manufacturers of commercial diagnostic tests with the goal of having an A(H5N1) test that is widely available if needed. Surveillance for laboratory-confirmed, influenza-associated hospitalizations will also continue during the spring and summer through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which typically conducts surveillance during October 1–April 30 of each influenza season. As well, CDC is working with state and local public health partners, with outreach to providers and clinics, to increase awareness about A(H5N1) so that influenza is considered in patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness after exposures, including agricultural fair attendance, that might increase the risk of novel influenza A virus infection. Medical Countermeasures As a World Health Organization Collaborating Center, and in partnership with the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), CDC regularly develops novel influenza A candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for pandemic preparedness. Antigenic characterization of the A(H5N1) virus isolated from the Texas farm worker (A/Texas/37/2024) with ferret antisera produced against existing CVVs confirmed two clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5) CVVs have good cross-reactivity to this virus. Under the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program, ASPR has shared these CVVs with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturers and has completed initial production of bulk antigen. ASPR is also supporting clinical evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of vaccines using antigen manufactured from one of these CVVs, influenza A/Astrakhan/3212/2020–like virus vaccine, in combination with different adjuvants that are stockpiled under the NPIVS. The clinical study (NCT05874713)¶¶¶¶ testing cell-based antigen combined with MF59 adjuvant, according to the AUDENZ-licensed manufacturing process, has completed enrollment. The egg-based antigen, produced according to the Q-PAN-licensed process, combined with AS03 adjuvant clinical study (NCT05975840)***** is also fully enrolled. ASPR is planning additional clinical studies for combining egg-based antigen with both AS03 and MF59 adjuvants with enrollment expected to start in late summer 2024. If needed, and dependent upon FDA review and regulatory action allowing use, these vaccines could be the first allotment of vaccines used while additional manufacturing, starting with the stockpiled antigens and adjuvants, ramps up for full-scale production. Four FDA-approved antiviral drugs (baloxavir marboxil, oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir) are recommended for influenza treatment in the United States.††††† CDC has conducted phenotypic testing of antiviral susceptibility and found that the A(H5N1) virus isolated from the Texas farm worker is susceptible to baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza, Genentech) and to neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (generic or Tamiflu, Genentech). Oral oseltamivir treatment is recommended for persons with confirmed or suspected A(H5N1) virus infection.§§§§§ Oral oseltamivir is also recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (using twice daily treatment dosing) of close contacts (e.g., household members) of a confirmed A(H5N1) case. Observational studies of patients infected with older and different clades of A(H5N1) viruses, (i.e., not the current clade 2.3.4.4b viruses identified in the United States) have found that starting oseltamivir treatment within 2 days of symptom onset was significantly associated with survival benefit compared with no treatment or later initiation of oseltamivir treatment after symptom onset (8,9). All four antivirals are available in the Strategic National Stockpile and in many state-managed stockpiles, both of which can be deployed to assist with supply chain constraints should they arise. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) continues to investigate the efficacy of novel direct-acting antiviral medications and host-targeted molecules as well as broadly neutralizing antibodies and more targeted monoclonal antibodies aimed at A(H5N1) viral-specific surface antigens that could protect from death or severe respiratory disease. Epidemiologic Investigations To better ascertain and define the risk to humans, CDC is working with states to plan epidemiologic investigations in collaboration with affected farms and health and agricultural partners at local, state, and federal levels. Important public health questions might be addressed through in-depth studies with specimen collection and surveys (Box). CDC conducted a similar study in response to poultry outbreaks of A(H5N1) in 2022 (10). Top Discussion CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, FDA, ASPR, the Health Resources and Services Administration, NIAID, and state and local public health and animal health officials using a coordinated One Health approach to identify and prepare for developments that could increase the risk to human health. Substantial challenges to identifying and interviewing persons exposed to cattle infected with A(H5N1) viruses for illness monitoring or epidemiologic studies exist. Workers exposed to A(H5N1) viruses might represent socioeconomically vulnerable, or otherwise hard-to-reach populations, including those who live in rural or remote areas; or they might be migrant, transient, or undocumented workers. Further, persons might not be aware of the risks or potential signs and symptoms associated with exposure; dairy farmers and the dairy industry have not previously been major partners in outreach about avian influenza. Recommendations for worker protection have been recently updated¶¶¶¶¶ and disseminated. Once exposed persons are identified, defining exposure periods is also difficult. A(H5N1) disease is widespread in poultry, and mortality is high. Rapid depopulation of affected flocks facilitates monitoring of exposed workers because it creates a finite 10-day monitoring window after exposure. In contrast, illness in cows can last for 2–4 weeks, and the duration of infectious virus shedding in cows is unknown. In addition, A(H5N1) virus infection has been identified in some cows without signs of illness; thus, some workers might be unaware of their exposure. Recent testing did not detect live, infectious A(H5N1) viruses in retail dairy samples; however, identification of A(H5N1) viral fragments in approximately one in five retail milk samples from across the country (4) suggests that A(H5N1) virus infections of cattle might be widespread. Therefore, monitoring of exposed or potentially exposed persons and animals might be protracted and resource-intensive. Interpretation of surveillance data can be challenging given that A(H5N1) virus infections might manifest signs and symptoms similar to those associated with infections caused by other pathogens. During periods of low U.S. influenza virus circulation (e.g., spring and summer), syndromic and wastewater surveillance might more readily identify unusual signals in influenza-related symptoms or activity. However, using these systems to detect novel influenza A virus infection trends in the fall and winter, once seasonal influenza A virus circulation increases, will likely be complicated. Interpretation of wastewater data are further limited by the inability to distinguish between human and animal source material. Currently circulating A(H5N1) viruses do not have the ability to easily bind to receptors that are most prevalent in the human upper respiratory tract and therefore are not easily transmissible to and between humans (2). However, because of the widespread global prevalence of A(H5N1) viruses in birds and other animals, continued sporadic human infections are anticipated. Further, if a novel influenza A virus acquires the ability to infect and be transmitted easily between persons in a sustained manner, an influenza pandemic could occur. Thus, investigation of every novel influenza A virus case in humans and comprehensive worldwide surveillance is critical to public health preparedness efforts. Implications for Public Health Practice CDC considers the current health risk to the U.S. public from A(H5N1) viruses to be low. However, persons who have job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds, poultry, dairy cattle, or other infected animals or contaminated materials, including raw cow’s milk, are at increased risk for infection; these persons should take appropriate precautions, including using recommended personal protective equipment, self-monitoring for illness symptoms (6), and seeking prompt medical evaluation if they are symptomatic, including influenza testing and antiviral treatment if indicated. FDA has confirmed that pasteurization inactivates A(H5N1) viruses, and that the commercial milk supply is safe for consumption (4); however, all persons should avoid consuming raw milk or products produced from raw milk. A coordinated and comprehensive One Health response to this ongoing outbreak of A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows, poultry, and other animals is needed to identify and prepare for any developments that indicate an increase in the risk to public health.

However, antibodies against neuraminidase (NA) can also confer protection against influenza, making NA an attractive target for the development of novel vaccines. In this study, we aimed to enhance the immunogenicity of recombinant NA antigens by presenting them multivalently on a nanoparticle carrier. Soluble tetrameric NA antigens of the N1 and N2 subtypes, confirmed to be correctly folded by cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis, were conjugated to Mi3 self-assembling protein nanoparticles using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. Immunization of mice with NA-Mi3 nanoparticles induced higher titers of NA-binding and -inhibiting antibodies and improved protection against a lethal challenge compared to unconjugated NA. Additionally, we explored the co-presentation of N1 and N2 antigens on the same Mi3 particles to create a mosaic vaccine candidate. These mosaic nanoparticles elicited antibody titers that were similar or superior to the homotypic nanoparticles and effectively protected against H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses. The NA-Mi3 nanoparticles represent a promising vaccine candidate that could complement HA-directed approaches for enhanced potency and broadened protection against influenza A virus.

Influenza vaccines are of critical importance in protecting high-risk groups from severe disease and mortality. Currently, available vaccines primarily induce antibodies targeting antigenically variable epitopes on hemagglutinin (HA)2. As a result, the protective efficacy of these vaccines is limited in large part by the antigenic match of the vaccine with the circulating IAV strains. One of the main challenges currently in the influenza field is, therefore, to develop vaccines that can offer broader protection and overcome the constraints imposed by antigenic variation.IAV contains two glycoproteins with different functional roles; HA binds to sialoglycan receptors and mediates membrane fusion, whereas neuraminidase (NA) is the receptor-destroying enzyme that removes the terminal sialic acids. The sialidase activity of NA is essential for virion release from (decoy) receptors on host cells and for virion mobility through sialic acid-dense surroundings to reach functional entry receptors3. Antibodies that bind the HA head domain and thereby inhibit receptor binding are traditionally recognized as the main correlate of protection4,5. However, antibodies targeting NA also independently correlate with protection against disease and transmission of IAV6,7,8,9. The tetrameric NA protein consists of a globular head domain, containing the catalytic site, a narrow stalk, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. NA-inhibiting (NAI) antibodies interfere with sialidase activity by binding directly to the catalytic site or by limiting the access of the sialic acids to the catalytic site through steric hindrance. Non-NAI antibodies may provide indirect protection through Fc-mediated effector functions10,11,12,13.One strategy to induce NA-directed protective immunity is by vaccination with purified recombinant NA proteins14,15,16,17. The immunogenicity of such viral glycoprotein-based subunit vaccines can be improved considerably by the presentation of the antigen on a nanoparticle carrier. This has been demonstrated for various viral targets, including glycoproteins of coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Lassa virus18,19,20,21,22. Antigens conjugated to nanoparticle carriers more effectively activate the immune system because of increased size and antigen repetitiveness23,24. Nanoparticle vaccine platforms are also highly adaptable and allow for the conjugation of antigens of diverse symmetries25. Moreover, the presentation of multiple related, but antigenically different antigens, has been demonstrated to induce broadly cross-protective immune responses for IAV HA and coronavirus receptor binding domain26,27,28,29,30.Here, we describe immunogenicity profiling and virus challenge studies in mice to evaluate NA nanoparticle vaccine candidates. We produced soluble recombinant tetrameric NA proteins stabilized with a tetrabrachion tetramerization domain, validated their quaternary structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis, and conjugated these to Mi3 self-assembling protein nanoparticles using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system31,32. Vaccination of mice with the resulting N1-Mi3 or N2-Mi3 nanoparticles induced high titers of NA-binding and inhibiting antibodies, and protected against an otherwise lethal challenge with H1N1 or H3N2 IAV, respectively. In addition, we co-presented the N1 and N2 antigens on Mi3 to create mosaic nanoparticles. These induced high antibody titers and provided potent protection against H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses. The humoral response and protection offered by the mosaic nanoparticles were as good or even superior to a mix of homotypic N1-Mi3 and N2-Mi3 nanoparticles.ResultsRecombinant tetrameric NA antigensWe produced recombinant N1 NC13 (derived from A/North Carolina/07/2013 H1N1) and N2 HK68 (derived from A/Hong Kong/1968 (H3N2)) antigens in a soluble tetrameric form using a previously described construct design in which the transmembrane region is replaced with a tetrabrachion tetramerization domain33. In addition, the constructs contained a Strep-tag for affinity purification and a SpyTag for later conjugation to Mi3 nanoparticles (Fig. 1a). The antigens were produced in a mammalian (HEK293F) expression system, affinity purified, and evaluated for purity and size on SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The recombinant N1 and N2 proteins were highly enzymatically active in an assay based on the cleavage of the small molecule substrate MUNANA (Supplementary Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: Recombinant NA antigens and coupling to Mi3 nanoparticles.a Schematic representation of the recombinant soluble NA protein constructs.

Scale bars in main micrographs = 100 nm, scale bars in inset panels = 25 nm.Full size imageThe structural integrity of recombinant NA antigens is of critical importance for inducing an optimal immune response34,35,36. It was recently shown that recombinant soluble tetrameric NAs, particularly of the N1 subtype, may suffer from structural instability in the head domain, resulting in an “open” conformation not generally observed on virions37,38. Therefore, we performed cryo-EM to evaluate the quaternary structure of our constructs. 2D classification of the tetrabrachion-stabilized recombinant N1 NC13 produced class averages corresponding to different views of the NA tetramers, all of which were consistent with the closed conformation (Fig. 1b). The 3D reconstruction further confirmed this view (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). Moreover, the atomic model built into the cryo-EM map shows high similarity to the previously published model based on X-ray crystallography (PDB: 3NSS, RMSD: 0.436 Å). N2 HK68 also displayed a closed conformation in negative stain EM (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Collectively, these observations indicate that our NA antigens adopt a closed conformation similar to the presumed conformation of NA on viral particles37,38.NA-Mi3 nanoparticle couplingTo construct the immunogens, we covalently attached NA proteins to Mi3 nanoparticles using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. The 60-meric Mi3 self-assembling protein nanoparticles with an N-terminal SpyCatcher domain were expressed in E. coli, affinity purified using the C-tag, and analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Combining SpyCatcher-Mi3 nanoparticles with SpyTag-NA causes the spontaneous formation of an isopeptide bond that conjugates the NA to the nanoparticle (Fig. 1d). We evaluated the coupling efficiency at varying molar ratios and selected a ratio of 1:2 (NA:Mi3) for production of the immunogens as it resulted in the highest proportion of conjugated NA (Supplementary Fig. 3a). A portion of the NA remained unconjugated, presumably in part due to the symmetry mismatch between the Mi3 particles (3-fold symmetry) and NA (4-fold symmetry). Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) analysis of undecorated nanoparticles (Fig. 1e) and nanoparticles decorated with N1 (Fig. 1f), demonstrate the conjugation of NA to the nanoparticles, confirming observations in negative stain projections (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). The coupling of NA to Mi3 nanoparticles had no effect on its enzymatic activity as determined in the MUNANA assay (Supplementary Fig. 3d), suggesting that it did not impact the structural integrity of the NA proteins.NA-Mi3 nanoparticles induce higher serum antibody titers using less antigenVaccination of mice with the NA proteins formulated as unconjugated or nanoparticle-conjugated antigens was performed to test the hypothesis that nanoparticle presentation enhances the immunogenicity of NA. Mice were vaccinated with a low (0.1 µg NA) or high (1 µg NA) dose of the antigen and boosted three weeks later (Fig. 2a). All immunizations were performed by subcutaneous injections using Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS) as adjuvant. Mock-immunized mice received injections with PBS and SAS. Serology analysis was performed on sera collected three weeks after primary immunization (day 21 of the experiment, before administering the booster dose) and three weeks after the booster immunization (day 42) (Fig. 2a). NA-binding antibody titers were determined in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant soluble NA proteins carrying a GCN4 tetramerization domain and a FLAG tag for purification, as to detect only NA-specific antibodies. NAI titers were determined in enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLAs), measuring cleavage of the terminal sialic acids from the glycoprotein fetuin, using H1N1 Bel/09 or H3N2 X31 virus preparations.Fig. 2: Immunization with N1-Mi3 nanoparticles induces high antibody titers.a Immunization scheme. BALB/c mice (n = 6) were immunized with N1 NC13 unconjugated and conjugated to Mi3 nanoparticles (N1-Mi3) in a prime-boost regimen at 0.1 or 1 µg per dose based on the total NA content. Serum samples were collected for serology analysis at day 21 (prime) and day 42 (boost) after primary immunization. b–d N1-binding antibodies in serum samples were quantified in ELISA and endpoint titers were determined as described in materials and methods. Endpoint titers against homologous N1 WI13 after prime (b) and boost (c) immunizations. d Endpoint titers against heterologous N1 HU02 (H5N1) after boost immunizations. e NA inhibiting antibodies in post boost sera were quantified in an ELLA assay with H1N1 Bel/09. IC50 values represent the reciprocal dilutions resulting in 50% inhibition of NA enzymatic activity. Bars represent the geometric means for each group (n = 6–9). The dotted lines represent the lowest serum dilution tested. Groups were compared with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).Full size imageThree weeks after the primary immunization, mice of all groups immunized with the N1 antigens developed a detectable antibody response against homologous N1 derived from A/Wisconsin/09/2013 (WI13). This N1 differs from the vaccine antigen N1 NC13 only at amino acid position 38639. Serum IgG titers were significantly higher in the mice that received the high dose of N1-Mi3 compared to all other groups (Fig. 2b). The booster immunization induced a significant increase in the NA-specific humoral responses (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a). High titers were observed for mice that received a high dose of N1 and either dose of N1-Mi3. Low dose N1-Mi3 immunized mice had comparable antibody titers to mice from the group that received a 10-fold higher dose of NA as an unconjugated antigen (Fig. 2c).Mice in all N1-vaccinated groups also developed antibodies that cross-reacted with N1 derived from A/Hunan/795/2002, an avian H5N1 strain (HU02; 87.5% shared sequence identity with N1 NC13) (Fig. 2d). Reactivity against this heterologous N1 was lower overall, but followed similar trends to those observed for homologous N1. The highest cross-reactive titers were detected in mice immunized with a high dose of N1-Mi3. The induction of antibodies capable of inhibiting sialidase activity was tested in an ELLA assay against a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (Bel/09). The NA protein of this virus shares 98% sequence identity with the N1 NC13 protein that was used for the immunizations. Consistent with the total NA-binding antibody titers, NAI titers were highest in sera from mice immunized with high dose N1-Mi3 (Fig. 2e). Detectable NAI antibodies were only found in 3 out of 18 mice from the other groups.A similar prime-boost immunization experiment was performed using N2 antigens. Most of the mice immunized with the N2 antigens developed measurable antibody titers after primary immunization. The N2-Mi3 vaccinated mice had significantly higher antibody titers against the homologous N2 antigen (N2 HK68) than the mice that received unconjugated N2 antigens at an equivalent dosage (Fig. 3a). The highest serum IgG titers were again observed for the mice that received the high dose of the Mi3-coupled NAs. Antibody titers were further increased after the booster vaccination (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Mice immunized with low or high doses of N2-Mi3 had significantly higher levels of antibodies than the low dose unconjugated N2 immunized group (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3: Immunization with N2-Mi3 nanoparticles induces high antibody titers.BALB/c mice were immunized with N2 HK68 unconjugated and coupled to Mi3 (N2-Mi3) in a prime-boost regimen at 0.1 or 1 µg per dose based on the total NA content. Serum samples were collected for serology analysis at day 21 (prime) and day 42 (boost) after primary immunization. N2-binding antibodies in serum samples were quantified in ELISA and endpoint titers were determined as described in materials and methods. (a and b) Endpoint titers against homologous N2 HK68 after prime (a) and boost (b) immunizations. Endpoint titers against heterologous N2 SI57 (c) and N2 GE18 (d) after boost immunizations. e NA-inhibiting antibodies in post-boost sera were quantified in an ELLA assay with H3N2 HK68. IC50 values represent the reciprocal dilutions resulting in 50% inhibition of NA enzymatic activity. Bars represent the geometric means for each group (n = 6–9). The dotted lines represent the lowest serum dilution tested. Groups were compared with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001).Full size imageWe next evaluated cross-reactivity of the immune sera to heterologous N2 NAs. High titers of cross-reactive antibodies against NA of a 1957 H2N2 strain (N2 SI57; 95% shared sequence identity with N2 HK68) were detected in all test groups, similar to the reactivity measured against the homologous NA (Fig. 3b, c). Reactivity against the antigenically drifted NA of 2018 H3N2 virus (N2 GE18; 84.1% shared sequence identity with N2 HK68) was lower in all groups. Interestingly, titers against this antigen appeared lower in the N2-Mi3 vaccinated mice than in the unconjugated N2 vaccinated mice. Only 1 out of 6 mice that received the low dose N2-Mi3 developed measurable antibodies against GE18 (Fig. 3d). These data suggest that the presentation of N2 on nanoparticles resulted in targeting of different, more antigenically variable epitopes, compared to unconjugated N2.We analyzed the induction of NAI antibodies in mice immunized with the N2 antigens in an ELLA assay using the H3N2 X31 virus, which carries an NA homologous to the N2 HK68 that was used for the immunizations. High titers of NAI antibodies were elicited by the high dose unconjugated N2 immunization and both dosages of N2-Mi3 (Fig. 3e). These results correlate with the ELISA antibody titers against N2 HK68 (Fig. 3b), although two N2-Mi3 vaccinated animals responded with much lower or undetectable NAI titers (Fig. 3e). Notably, the NAI titers against H3N2 HK68 in these N2-vaccinated mice were higher than the titers against H1N1 Bel/09 in the N1-vaccinated mice. This difference may be explained in part by the lower NA activity of the H1N1 virus preparations compared to H3N2 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Because of the lower NA activity, more virus was used in the ELLA-based NAI assay for Bel/09, likely resulting in a higher virion-to-antibody ratio.Taken together, we found that NA presented on Mi3 nanoparticles induced higher titers of total NA-binding serum antibodies against homologous NAs, compared to unconjugated NA, particularly after the prime immunization. A tenfold lower dose of NA-Mi3-induced antibody titers equal to or exceeding the titers induced with unconjugated NA. N1-Mi3 vaccination additionally induced higher NAI titers than unconjugated N1, whereas differences were not significant for N2.NA-Mi3 nanoparticles induce improved protection against homologous influenza A virus challengeNext, we tested the protective efficacy of N1 and N2 formulated as unconjugated or nanoparticle-based vaccines against lethal homologous IAV challenge in a mouse model (Fig. 4). Three weeks after the second vaccine dose, mice (n = 6/group) were challenged with four times the lethal dose 50 (LD50) of H1N1 Bel/09 or H3N2 X31 (Fig. 4a). Changes in body weight were monitored for the next two weeks post-infection. N1-Mi3 vaccination protected mice against H1N1 Bel/09 challenge. Mice vaccinated with the nanoparticles were better protected against weight loss in the initial four days post-challenge (p = 0.006) and recovered faster (p = 0.007) compared to mice vaccinated with unconjugated N1 (Fig. 4b and Table 1). No significant differences in weight loss rates were detected between mice vaccinated with low or high doses of the vaccine preparations. All mice that received the N1-Mi3 vaccine, both at high and low doses, survived the challenge, as well as all mice that received the high dose of unconjugated N1. Only 3 out of 6 mice immunized with a low dose of unconjugated N1 and 2 out of 6 mock-immunized mice survived the challenge (Fig. 4c).Fig. 4: NA nanoparticle vaccination protects mice from homologous virus challenge.a Immunization and challenge schedule. BALB/c mice (n = 6 per group) were immunized with unconjugated NA or NA coupled to Mi3 in a prime-boost regimen at 0.1 or 1 µg per dose based on the total NA content. On day 42, N1- and N2-vaccinated mice were challenged with 4LD50 H1N1 Bel/09 or H3N2 X31, respectively. Mice were monitored for weight loss and survival for two weeks post-challenge. Mean body weights of mice immunized with N1 and N1-Mi3 after challenge with H1N1 (b) and of mice immunized with N2 or N2-Mi3 after challenge with H3N2 (d). Survival of mice immunized with N1 or N1-Mi3 after challenge with H1N1 (c) and of mice immunized with N2 or N2-Mi3 after challenge with H3N2 (e).Full size imageTable 1 Statistical analysis of body weight changes in mice immunized with unconjugated and nanoparticle-conjugated N1 NC13 after challenge with H1N1 Bel/09Full size tableSimilarly, N2-Mi3 vaccination provided better protection against H3N2 challenge than unconjugated N2, resulting in reduced weight loss in the initial phase of infection (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4d and Table 2). Mice immunized with the high dose of the nanoparticle vaccine demonstrated no significant change in body weight. Low-dose N2-Mi3 immunized mice experienced greater weight loss (p < 0.001), at a rate similar to the mice immunized with the high-dose unconjugated N2. All mice in these groups survived the challenge (Fig. 4e). Low-dose unconjugated N2 was less protective, as these mice experienced even greater weight loss (p < 0.001) and only 3 out of 6 mice of this group survived the challenge. For comparison, none of the mock-immunized mice survived the challenge.Table 2 Statistical analysis of body weight changes in mice immunized with unconjugated and nanoparticle-conjugated N2 HK68 after challenge with H3N2 X31Full size tableIn conclusion, vaccination with NA presented on Mi3 nanoparticles induced more potent protection against an otherwise lethal viral challenge than unconjugated NA. In agreement with the serology data, the protection provided by the low dose NA-Mi3 was similar (N2) or superior (N1) compared to a tenfold higher dose of unconjugated NA.Mosaic N1-N2-Mi3 nanoparticles induce high antibody titers against both NAsAfter having established that the NA nanoparticle-based vaccines induce superior antibody titers and protection against IAV challenge, we next aimed to design a vaccine that could offer protection against H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs. N1 and N2 were combined in one vaccine formulation in two ways: (1) mixing the homotypic N1-Mi3 and N2-Mi3 particles (N1/N2-Mi3 mix vaccine) and (2) coupling N1 and N2 onto the same Mi3 particles (N1-N2-Mi3 mosaic vaccine). The effects of combining NAs of different subtypes on the antibody response and protection from IAV challenge were determined and compared to vaccination with homotypic N1-Mi3 or N2-Mi3 particles. The total NA content of the vaccines was kept constant at 0.2 µg per dose. Mice (n = 6 per group) were immunized following the same prime-boost regimen as described earlier (Fig. 2a). This experiment was performed twice and the combined results of the two experiments are shown.All N1-containing vaccine preparations induced high antibody titers against the homologous N1 WI13, while no reactivity against N1 was observed after vaccination with the N2-Mi3 homotypic nanoparticles (Fig. 5a–c). An inversed pattern was observed for the N2-containing vaccines (Fig. 5d–f). Closer inspection of the serology data against N1 shows that the mixed particles induced NA-binding antibodies to similar titers as homotypic N1-Mi3, while the mosaic particles induced higher titers than the mixed particles after the boost immunizations (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the mosaic particles induced higher levels of NAI antibodies against NA of H1N1 than the mixed particles. No significant difference in NAI titers was observed between N1-N2-Mi3 mosaic particles and homotypic N1-Mi3 (Fig. 5c), consistent with the total NA binding antibody titers. Although the mosaic nanoparticles elicited a superior antibody response against N1 compared to the mixed nanoparticles, a similar effect was not observed for the overall reactivity against N2. The anti-N2 titers did not significantly differ between the groups immunized with the N2-Mi3, mixed, or mosaic nanoparticles at either time point in the experiment (Fig. 5d, e). However, the mosaic nanoparticles appeared to induce slightly higher NAI titers against H3N2 than the mixed nanoparticles (Fig. 5f).Fig. 5: Nanoparticle vaccines combining N1 and N2 induce high antibody titers against both NAs.BALB/c mice (n = 12 in two independent experiments of 6 mice per group) were immunized with NA-Mi3 nanoparticles at 0.2 µg of NA per dose. Serum samples were collected for serology analysis on day 21 (prime) and day 42 (boost) after primary immunization. (a, b, d, and e) NA-binding antibodies in serum samples were quantified in ELISA. Endpoint titers against N1 WI13 after prime (a) and boost (b) immunizations. c NAI titers of H1N1 Bel/09 in post-boost sera were quantified in ELLA assay. IC50 values represent the reciprocal dilutions resulting in 50% inhibition of NA enzymatic activity.

Horizontal bars represent the geometric means for each group. The dotted lines represent the lowest serum dilution tested. Groups were compared with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001).Full size imageTo determine whether combining N1 and N2 antigens in one vaccine formulation can alter the breadth of the immune response, serum reactivity was tested against heterologous N1 and N2 NAs in ELISA. Results obtained with pooled serum samples from mice immunized with the different nanoparticle preparations were similar against homologous NAs (Supplementary Fig. 6a, c) as those obtained with the individual serum samples (Fig. 5b, e). No differences in cross-reactive responses were detected between the different preparations against any of the heterologous recombinant NAs that were tested (Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, pooled serum samples from mice immunized with the different nanoparticle preparations were all unable to inhibit cleavage of MUNANA by NA (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating the absence of antibodies targeting the conserved catalytic site.Collectively, the serology data suggest superior performance of the N1-N2-Mi3 mosaic nanoparticles compared to the N1/N2-Mi3 mix, but not the homotypic NA-Mi3 vaccines. However, combining different NA subtypes in one vaccine did not measurably improve the breadth of the antibody response against heterologous N1 and N2 NAs.In addition to characterizing the NA-targeting antibody response, we also evaluated the induction of antibodies directed against the Mi3 scaffold. High titers of anti-Mi3 antibodies were detected in all mice immunized with the NA-Mi3 nanoparticles. (Supplementary Fig. 8). These titers were comparable to the NA-specific titers, suggesting that both components of the NA-Mi3 nanoparticles are equally immunogenic when covalently linked. Interestingly, a substantially lower anti-scaffold response was detected in mice immunized with unconjugated Mi3 nanoparticles. Thus, the conjugation of NA results in an increased antibody response against the Mi3 scaffold.Mosaic nanoparticles protect against lethal H1N1 and H3N2 challengeFinally, we assessed if vaccination with the nanoparticle-based vaccines that combine N1 and N2 antigens in the mixed or the mosaic formulation can protect against H1N1 and H3N2 virus challenge. Mice were challenged with H1N1 or H3N2 three weeks after the booster immunization and evaluated for weight loss and survival. Single homotypic N1-Mi3 and N2-Mi3 nanoparticles, and unconjugated Mi3 nanoparticles were included as controls.Immunization with single homotypic NA-Mi3 vaccine preparations protected mice against weight loss and lethality when challenged with the homologous, but not the heterosubtypic virus (Fig. 6), in accordance with the serology analyses (Fig. 5). Mice immunized with the mosaic particles experienced only minimal weight loss after H1N1 challenge, which resolved within a week. N1-Mi3 vaccinated mice lost weight more rapidly in the first four days post-challenge with H1N1 than mosaic vaccinated mice (p = 0.001), but also made a full recovery. In the N1/N2-Mi3 mix-immunized group, most animals suffered from transient weight loss (Fig. 6a), but 2 out of 12 mice continued to deteriorate and did not survive the challenge (Fig. 6b). The rate at which the N1/N2-Mi3 mix-immunized mice lost weight in the initial phase did not differ significantly from the mice immunized with N1-Mi3 (p = 0.145) or with the mosaic nanoparticles (p = 0.353) (Table 3). The N2-Mi3 group and a control group immunized with unconjugated Mi3 particles both experienced rapidly progressing weight loss and reached ethical endpoint criteria by day 6–8.Fig. 6: NA nanoparticle vaccination protects mice from H1N1 and H3N2 challenge.BALB/c mice (n = 12 in two independent experiments of 6 mice per group) were immunized with NA-Mi3 nanoparticles. Three weeks post-boost, N1- and N2-vaccinated mice were challenged with 4LD50 H1N1 Bel/09 or H3N2 X31, respectively. Mice were monitored for weight loss and survival for two weeks post-challenge. Mean body weights of mice immunized with NA-Mi3 after challenge with H1N1 (a) or H3N2 (b).

All mice that received vaccines including N2 antigens experienced transient weight loss (Fig. 6c) and made a full recovery (Fig. 6d). In contrast, mice immunized with N1-Mi3 or empty Mi3 particles all died or reached ethical endpoint criteria by day 7 (Fig. 6d). The N2-Mi3 homotypic nanoparticles appeared to protect best against weight loss following H3N2 challenge. Weight loss rate in the four days post-challenge was lower in the mice immunized with N2-Mi3 compared to the mix immunized group (p = 0.002). No significant difference was observed between N2-Mi3 and the mosaic particles (p = 0.992) or mix and mosaic particles (p = 0.472) (Table 3).We conclude that the N1-N2-Mi3 mosaic nanoparticles fully protect mice against both H1N1 and H3N2 challenge. A protective immune response was also induced by a mix of homotypic nanoparticles (N1/N2-Mi3 mix). However, in agreement with the serological analysis (Fig. 5), the protective efficacy of the mosaic nanoparticles in the H1N1 challenge appeared more robust compared to that of the mixed nanoparticle vaccine.DiscussionNA-targeting antibodies can protect against IAV infection, disease, and transmission6,14,17,40,41, but are poorly induced by currently licensed influenza vaccines2. Since the antigenic drift of NA is discordant with that of HA42, enhancing the antibody response against NA could potentially improve protection against drifted strains. Here, we show that multivalent presentation of tetrameric NA antigens on a self-assembling protein nanoparticle enhances their immunogenicity and results in improved protection from lethal IAV challenge. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining N1 and N2 NA antigens on mosaic nanoparticles is an effective strategy to induce protective immunity against both human H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes.The structural integrity of NA antigens is crucial for the induction of a qualitative immune response. It was recently shown that in some recombinant soluble NAs, in particular those of the N1 subtype, the head domain exhibits a more open or disordered conformation. Extensive mutational stabilization was required to change these into tightly packed, symmetric tetramers that resemble the native NA as it is presumably present on viral particles37,38. In contrast, our NA antigens adopt the closed conformation without the need for stabilizing mutations. This difference may be attributed to the different tetramerization domains that were used. The recombinant NAs that displayed a more open head assembly were fused to a tetramerization domain derived from human vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which has a coiled-coil structure with right-handed rotation37. The tetrabrachion coiled-coil that was used in our study has a more parallel structure and is suggested to provide higher stability to recombinant NAs36,43 and to result in NAs with higher enzymatic activity33. These findings suggest that using a better-suited tetramerization domain may obviate the need for mutagenesis to produce recombinant NAs that adopt the closed conformation. Nevertheless, the stabilizing mutations reported by Ellis and colleagues may further enhance the protein stability.Our recombinant NA antigens are immunogenic and can induce a protective immune response against IAV challenge in mice. Consistent with previous studies on NA as well as other viral glycoproteins18,19,20,21,22,25, we found that the immunogenicity of NA can be enhanced by presenting it on nanoparticles. Nanoparticle-based immunogens elicit a stronger humoral immune response, characterized by higher antibody titers and possibly with higher affinity22. Antigen conjugation to a nanoparticle carrier results in immunogens that mimic the size and repetitiveness of the antigens on the virus particle. These characteristics promote the induction of a robust immune response on various levels, including increased innate immune activation, improved drainage to the lymph nodes, and cross-linking of B cell receptors leading to stronger B cell activation23,24. Although we cannot exclude that the Mi3 nanoparticles themselves have adjuvanting properties, this was observed not to be the case for similar Lumazine synthase nanoparticles in combination with SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology22. Our NA-Mi3 nanoparticles achieved a tenfold dose-sparing effect compared to unconjugated NA. Thus, nanoparticle presentation of NA could be an effective strategy for antigen sparing in addition to the use of adjuvants. This could be particularly valuable in a pandemic context.In addition to the on-target NA-directed antibody response, NA-Mi3 immunization induced high levels of antibodies targeting the Mi3 nanoparticles. Notably, anti-Mi3 antibody titers were five- to tenfold higher in mice immunized with NA-Mi3 compared to those immunized with unconjugated Mi3 nanoparticles. This heightened anti-carrier response is not consistently observed for other nanoparticle-based immunogens. For instance, the conjugation of RSV F glycoproteins to different types of nanoparticles reduced the anti-scaffold response, indicating antigenic competition favoring the glycoproteins20,44. The balance between antigen- and scaffold-specific immunity against nanoparticle-based immunogens arises from intricate interactions within the immune system, providing multiple possible explanations for our observations. NA can engage CD4+ T cell help45,46, potentially amplifying the B cell response against both components of the immunogens. Additionally, NA’s sialidase activity may influence the reactivity against the Mi3 scaffold. By removing sialic acids from the cell surface, NA can contribute to the activation of various immune cell subsets, including B and T cells47,48. Thus, the presence of exogenous NA in germinal centers might foster an environment conductive to immune activation against the nanoparticle scaffold. It would therefore be insightful to compare the immunogenicity of enzymatically active and non-active NA preparations. The high reactivity observed against the Mi3 particles may raise concerns that anti-scaffold antibody responses could undermine the antigen-specific response, a phenomenon observed with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein44,49. Yet, such negative effects were not observed for other, more immunogenic viral glycoproteins20,44,50. CD4+ T cells targeting the scaffold might even positively contribute to the antigen-specific antibody response, as proposed for HA-ferritin nanoparticles51. Moreover, pre-existing antibodies directed against the tetrabrachion domain have been documented to enhance the immune response against tetrabrachion-stabilized NA, possibly by promoting antigen processing via immune complex formation43. Further research is needed to investigate if and how (pre-existing) anti-Mi3 responses influence the induction of NA-targeting antibodies.Nanoparticle presentation not only amplifies the magnitude of the antibody response, but also modifies epitope targeting. Antigens displayed on a nanoparticle maintain a rigid outward orientation, mirroring their natural positioning on the viral particle. The orientation of an antigen on a nanoparticle is thought to affect its immunogenicity profile by making outward-directed epitopes more accessible for binding by B cell receptors52. This effect was demonstrated and taken advantage of with HA coupled to nanoparticles in an inverted orientation. Having the HA stalk directed outward resulted in the induction of five- to tenfold higher antibody titers against this more conserved domain52. In the current study, we observed that antibodies cross-reactive with N2 GE18 were induced to lower levels by N2-Mi3 nanoparticles compared to unconjugated N2 (Fig. 3d). It seems that epitopes conserved between the N2 of HK68 and GE18 were less efficiently targeted on the nanoparticle-conjugated N2, possibly as a result of reduced accessibility. In line with this hypothesis, cross-reactive antibodies targeting the underside of NA head domain have recently been described53,54. Given the outward-facing orientation of NA on the nanoparticles, the antibody response against NA-Mi3 is presumably directed mainly towards epitopes located at the top of the globular head, which might be more antigenically variable. Of note, despite observing diminished reactivity against N2 GE18, cross-reactivity with N2 from 1957 H2N2 was evident after immunization with N2-Mi3. Similarly, N1-Mi3 induced a cross-reactive response with N1 of an avian H5N1 virus. The increased reactivity against these heterologous NA proteins upon immunization with the NA-Mi3 preparations compared to the unconjugated NAs appeared proportional to the increases observed in total antibody titers against the homologous NAs, indicating that it reflects differences in the quantity rather than the breadth of the induced antibodies. These results imply that the immune response to NA-Mi3 may possess the breadth needed to protect against ‘recently’-drifted strains, although further work is needed to establish the breadth of the antibody response induced by homotypic NA-Mi3.Furthermore, we demonstrate that mosaic nanoparticles induce a more balanced antibody response against both N1 and N2 immunogens than the mix of homotypic nanoparticles, in which the N1-specific response was somewhat lower. This disparity might stem from antigenic competition between the two NA proteins, which appears to affect these preparations differently. However, in prior immunizations with unconjugated N1 and N2, no competition between the antigens was reported55. Combining the antigens on one particle might also locally enhance the recruitment of CD4+ T cell help, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to the mixed vaccine formulation. While the exact mechanism underlying the superiority of the mosaic NA nanoparticles remains unclear at present, these encouraging results could motivate further refinement, following the example of recently reported broadly reactive mosaic vaccines against influenza HA or coronavirus receptor binding domain26,27,28,29,30. These nanoparticles incorporate antigens of as many as eight different variants which ensures minimal clustering of identical antigens adjacent to each other. This characteristic is believed to provide an avidity advantage for B cells interacting with conserved epitopes, thereby boosting the induction of cross-reactive antibodies26,28. Further improvements of the mosaic NA nanoparticles, such as the inclusion of multiple NA subtypes, may enhance cross-reactivity by promoting the generation of antibodies targeting conserved epitopes, such as the catalytic site. Notably, certain antibodies targeting the catalytic site have demonstrated exceptional breadth56,57. The induction of such antibodies by vaccination would be expected to result in heterosubtypic immunity, a phenomenon rarely observed with experimental NA-based vaccines13. The current display of only two NA subtypes on the mosaic nanoparticles does not appear sufficient, however, to focus the immune response to the catalytic site and to result in the induction of broader-reactive antibodies compared to a mix of homotypic nanoparticles.In conclusion, our study confirms the potency and adaptability of Mi3-SpyCatcher nanoparticles as a vaccine platform. We have demonstrated their capability to elicit a robust humoral immune response against NA and harnessed their versatility to induce a broadly reactive immune response against two highly divergent subtypes. Further refinement of the design holds the potential to enhance the breadth of the anti-NA response. Nonetheless, for achieving a robust and long-lasting immune response against multiple influenza virus subtypes and drifted strains, we anticipate that a multicomponent vaccine will be required. NA nanoparticles could complement HA-directed strategies, including inactivated virus vaccines or the more novel HA stem-based immunogens, to enhance and broaden their protective efficacy.MethodsNA gene construct designHuman codon-optimized cDNA encoding the NA ectodomain (Genscript, USA) including the head and stalk of A/North Carolina/07/2013 (H1N1) (GenBank accession no. AGV29185.1; referred to as N1 NC13), A/Wisconsin/09/2013 (H1N1) (GenBank accession no. AGV29183.1; referred to as N1 WI13), A/Hunan/795/2002 (H5N1) (GenBank accession no. BAM85820.1; referred to as N1 HU02), A/Hong Kong/1968 (H3N2) (GenBank accession no. ABQ97206.1; referred to as N2 HK68), A/Germany/7830/2018 (H3N2) (GenBank accession no. QBH71200.1; referred to as N2 GE18), A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) (GenBank accession no. AY209895.1; referred to as N2 SI57) were cloned into pFRT expression plasmids (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described33,39. The NA ectodomain sequences of N1 NC13 and N2 HK68 were preceded by sequences encoding the signal sequence derived from Gaussia luciferase, the SpyTag, a Twin-Strep-tag for affinity purification (IBA GmbH), and the Tetrabrachion tetramerization domain (similarly as described previously33,39). To generate the NA proteins for use in ELISAs the non-NA encoding sequences downstream of the signal peptide sequence were replaced, to ensure that any detected signal resulted from reactivity against the NA ectodomain. In these plasmids encoding N1 WI13, N1 HU02, N2 HK68, N2 GE18, and N2 SI57 the NA ectodomain sequences were preceded by the Gaussia luciferase signal sequence, a Flag tag for affinity purification, and the GCN4 tetramerization domain.NA protein expression and purificationNA proteins were expressed in Freestyle 293-F cells (Gibco) that were maintained in Freestyle 293 Expression Medium (Gibco) at 37 °C with 8% CO2 with shaking at 130 rpm. Plasmids encoding the NA proteins were transfected into the cells using polyethyleneimine (PEI) in a 1:3 ratio (µg DNA:µg PEI). After 24 hours Peptone Primatone RL (Sigma-Aldrich) and valproic acid (Sigma) were added to final concentrations of 0.5% and 2,25 mM, respectively. Cells were then incubated for a further 3–4 days until viability fell below 80%. Cell supernatant was cleared by centrifugation (30 x g for 15 min) and for the expressions containing the Strep-tag the supernatant was incubated with Biolock (IBA) for 20 minutes. Then, StrepTactin Sepharose resin (IBA) was added to the expressions containing the Strep-tag, or Pierce Anti-DYKDDDDK affinity resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the expressions containing the Flag tag. After overnight incubation at 4 °C the proteins were purified on Poly-Prep chromatography columns (BioRad) according to instructions of the manufacturers of the affinity resins. Strep-tagged proteins were eluted using D(+)-Biotin (Roth) and Flag-tagged proteins using Pierce 3xDYKDDDDK peptide (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were analyzed for correct size and purity by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 12% gel and under reducing conditions, stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo Scientific).Cryo-electron microscopy of recombinant NA proteinsPurified NA N1 was diluted 10x in PBS to a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. 3 µL of the sample was loaded onto a Quantifoil 300 mesh 1.2/1.3 grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools) that was glow discharged (PELCO easiGlow, Ted Pella). The drop was blotted, and the sample was vitrified by plunging into a liquid ethane/propane mixture (37% ethane) using a Vitrobot Mark IV plunger (Thermo Fisher Scientific) set to 4 °C, 95% humidity, blot force 0, and blotting time 3 s.Data was collected on a Talos Arctica (Thermo Fisher Scientific) transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV, equipped with a postcolumn energy filter (Gatan) operated in zero-loss imaging mode with a 20-eV energy selecting slit. Micrographs were collected using a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) in counting mode, at a magnification of 130,000x (1.041 Å/pix). Exposure time for each micrograph was 8 s with 0.2 s per subframe, with a total dose of 48.1 e-/Å and a dose per subframe of 1.2 e−/Å. 1466 micrographs were recorded with a defocus range of −1 to −3 micrometers.Motion and CTF correction were done in cryoSPARC58. A subset of particles was picked by the blob picker and was used to create templates for automated particle picking. Three rounds of template matching and reference-free 2D classification were performed, resulting in 199,724 particles. For the 3D refinement, a homogeneous refinement was applied. The map was segmented in ChimeraX59, and only the ‘head’ was imported into cryoSPARC to create a mask by extending the map by 3 pixels and adding a 15-pixel soft cosine edge. Applying a C4 symmetry with this mask, and subsequent CTF refinement and sharpening with a B-factor of −100 resulted in a 2.99 Å map, based on the “gold standard” FSC = 0.143 criterion (Figure S2c).The initial model was built using ModelAngelo60 with the cryo-EM map and part of the sequence (residues 152–530). Additional residues were built (144–151) in the map and real-space refined using COOT61. Three iterations of real-space refinement manually in COOT and globally in PHENIX62 were performed.Mi3 nanoparticle expression, purification, and NA-Mi3 assemblyFor the expression of the SpyCatcher-Mi3 nanoparticles32 the pET28a-SpyCatcher-Mi3 (Addgene plasmid #112255) plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells (Novagen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium until they reached log phase (OD600 ~ 0.8) and then expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; GIBCO BRL) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Cultures were incubated for 16 hours at 22 °C, then pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/mL Lysozyme, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche)). Samples were then sonicated on ice in four rounds of 30 seconds. Debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (76,000 x g for 45 min at 5 °C) and supernatant was incubated overnight with CaptureSelect C-Tag affinity matrix (Thermo Scientific). Nanoparticles were purified according to manufacturer’s instructions and eluted with 2 M MgCl2. Proteins were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE gel with GelCode Blue (Thermo Scientific). NA-Mi3 nanoparticles were assembled by co-incubation of SpyTag-NA and SpyCatcher-Mi3 in 50 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4 For 16 hours at room temperature. Conjugation of NA to the nanoparticles was confirmed with SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel under reducing conditions, stained with GelCode Blue (Thermo Scientific). Gels shown per figure were derived from the same experiment and were processed in parallel.Negative stain electron microscopy of NA-Mi3 nanoparticlesMi3 nanoparticles or Mi3-N1 nanoparticles were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4, on ice. Subsequently, 3 μl of the sample was applied to carbon-coated copper grids that had been glow discharged for 30 seconds using a Cressington 208 instrument. The sample was allowed to absorb for 30 seconds prior to 2X wash with MQ and staining with 2% uranyl acetate solution. Grids were allowed to dry in air for ∼5 min and then imaged on a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission EM operated at 200 keV, equipped with a CCD camera.Cryo-electron tomography of NA-Mi3 nanoparticlesBoth uncoupled and coupled nanoparticles were used at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. 4 µL of sample was loaded onto a Quantifoil 2/1 grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools) that was glow discharged (PELCO easiGlow, Ted Pella). 1 µL of a BSA-conjugated gold beads (Aurion) suspension was added and the drop was blotted from the back (other side of sample deposition) for 4–6 seconds. Sample was vitrified by plunge freezing in liquid ethane-propane mix (37% ethane) using a manual plunge-freezer (MPI-Martinsried).Data was collected on a Talos Arctica (Thermo Fisher Scientific) transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV, equipped with a postcolumn energy filter (Gatan) operated in zero-loss imaging mode with a 20-eV energy selecting slit. Tomograms were collected using a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) in counting mode with dose fractionation, at a magnification of 100,000x (1.359 Å/pix). SerialEM63 was used to record tilt series with a grouped dose-symmetric scheme, with a range from -45° to 45° in 3° increments. Target defocus was set at −4 micrometers and total dose approximately 110 e-/Å.For tomogram reconstruction, the frames were aligned on-the-fly using Warp64 and reconstructed using IMOD65, using weighted back-projection and a SIRT-like filter66.MUNANA NA activity assayTo measure the activity of the purified NA proteins and determine whether conjugation to the nanoparticles impacted NA activity we performed a MUNANA assay on the unconjugated NA and NA -Mi3. This assay works on the principle that NA hydrolyzes the substrate 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma-Aldrich) to the fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU)67. The protein preparations were serially diluted in (50 mM Tris-HCl, 4 mM CaCl2, pH 6.0) in a flat-bottom 96-well black plate (Greiner Bio-One). An equal volume of reaction buffer containing 200 µM MUNANA was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for one hour. The reaction was terminated by adding the stop solution (0.1 M glycine, 25% ethanol, pH 10.7). Fluorescence was measured immediately after stopping the reaction using Promega GloMax Explorer with excitation filter 365 nm and emission filter 415–445 nm.Mouse immunization experimentsAll animal experiments were conducted according to the Belgian legislation (Belgian Law 14/08/1986 and Belgium Royal Decree 06/04/2010) and European legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (EU directives 2010/63/EU and 86/609/EEC). Experimental protocols were all approved by the Ethics Committee of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB), Ghent University, Faculty of Science (permit numbers EC2021–032 and EC2022–104). Six- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River) were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions with food and water ad libitum. Animals were immunized subcutaneously in the left and right flank with 100 µl containing 1 µg or 0.1 µg of recombinant protein (N1 or N2) or nanoparticle (N1-Mi3, N2-Mi3, or a combined formulation). All immunizations were adjuvanted with a 1:1 volume of Sigma Adjuvant System or SAS (S6322–1VL, Sigma). Mice received two immunizations in total (prime on D0 and boost on D21). Blood was collected on D21 & D42 by puncturing the lateral tail vein with a 23 G needle. In immunization experiments that were conducted for serology analysis and were not followed by viral challenge, mice were humanely sacrificed on D42 with an overdose of pentobarbital (Kela, Nembutal) and blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding. The obtained blood samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C to allow clotting, which was followed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (the serum) was recovered and submitted to a second centrifugation at the same speed. Cleared sera were stored at −20 °C before use in serological assays. On D42, mice were challenged with a 4LD50 dose of mouse-adapted A/Belgium/1/2009 [H1N1] (referred to as Bel/09) or X31 virus (A/Aichi/2/68 [H3N2] X PR8)68,69. Influenza virus infections were performed under sedation with a mixture of ketamine (Eurovet, Netamik, 10 mg/kg) and xylazine (Bayer, Rompun, 60 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally, and a total of 50 μl of the virus inoculum was instilled equally across the nostrils of the mouse. After infection, the body weight of the mice was determined daily for two weeks. Animals that had lost ≥25% of their original body weight were humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayAntibody titers in mouse serum samples were determined using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). NUNC MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with recombinant NA proteins containing the GCN4 tetramerization domain and Flag affinity tag diluted in Dulbecco’s PBS with Ca and Mg (Capricorn) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The tetramerization domain and affinity tag were intentionally changed from the antigens used for immunizations to ensure that any signal detected in ELISA reflected antibody binding to the NA ectodomain specifically. The plates were washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 and blocked for one hour with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0,1% Tween-20 in PBS. Serum samples were added to the plates in three-fold serial dilutions in a blocking buffer and incubated for two hours at room temperature. Starting dilutions were 1:100, 1:150, or 1:300, depending on the volume of the serum sample that was available. After incubation, the plates were washed four times and then incubated with Polyclonal Rabbit anti-Mouse Immunoglobulins-HRP (Dako P0260; 1:1000) in blocking buffer for one hour. Plates were then washed three times and incubated with TMB (BioFX) for 3–5 minutes before stopping the reaction with H2SO4. Read-out was performed using BioSPX 800 TS Microplate reader (BioTek) at 450 nm. Endpoint titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with a signal above the background value. The background was determined as mean + 3*SD of the signal at the lowest dilution of control sera (either from mice immunized with PBS or unconjugated Mi3 nanoparticles).VirusesMouse-adapted A/Belgium/1/2009 (H1N1; referred to as Bel/09), A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2 in the genetic background of PR8; referred to as X31) or A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2 in the genetic background of PR869; referred to as HK68) virus strains were amplified on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate in the presence of 2 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (T1426–50MG, Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Ninety six hours after virus inoculation, the culture medium was collected, cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2500 x g at 4 °C, and the virus was pelleted from the supernatants by overnight centrifugation at 30,000 x g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold sterile 20% glycerol in PBS, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until used.Enzyme-linked Lectin assayNeuraminidase inhibition titers were determined with an Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA). This assay measures the ability of the serum samples to inhibit sialic acid cleavage from the glycoprotein fetuin by H1N1 or H3N2 IAV. Fifty µl of a 25 µg/ml fetuin solution (Sigma cat. # F3385; dissolved in PBS) was coated in wells of Nunc MaxiSorp™ plates (ThermoFisher cat. # 44–2404–21), which were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T). Serum samples were heat inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 1 h and a 2-fold serial dilution series was made in sample buffer (1X MES VWR cat. # AAJ61979-AP: 20 mM CaCl2, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween-20). Sixty µl of the diluted sera was pre-mixed with 60 µl of a 1/1250 dilution of a 3.3x108 PFU/ml stock of A/Belgium/1/2009 (Bel/09) or a 1/103658,5 dilution of a 1.7 x 107 PFU/ml stock of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (HK68) virus. These virus dilutions correspond to the 70% maximum activity of NA from the respective viruses as determined in the ELLA assay. Fifty µl of the serum:virus mixture was added to the fetuin plates in duplicate and the plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h. The plates were then washed six times with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with a solution of PNA-HRP (cat. # L6135–1MG, Sigma) at 5 μg/ml in conjugate diluent (MES pH 6.5, 20 mM CaCl2, 1% BSA). After three washes with PBS-T, TMB substrate (cat # 555214, BD Pharmingen) was added, and the plates were incubated for 5 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M H2SO4. The optical density was measured at 450 nm and as a reference 655 nm in a Tecan microplate reader M200. Half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software).Statistical analysis ELISA and ELLAData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1. Horizontal bars represent mean values and data plotted with error bars represent means with s.d. Statistical differences between groups were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test on log-transformed titers. The differences between prime and boost titers (Supplementary Fig. 4) were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test.Statistical analysis of virus challengeMouse body weights were recorded daily during the 14-day course of the challenge experiments with Bel/09 and X31 (experiments shown in Fig. 4). The data were analyzed in R statistical software70 using tidyverse71. We used a piecewise linear mixed model with knots at days 4 and 6 for both settings (Bel/09 and X31). Knots were chosen after careful exploratory data analysis at time points that capture inflection in the weight curves best over the different challenge experiments. The models were saturated in the fixed effects (treatment and all time segments) thus allowing for all possible interactions (up to 2-way). We also used a random intercept per mouse to model within-mouse correlation over time. Fitting was done using the lme4 package72 with the nlminb algorithm from the optimx package73. We then used robust covariance estimators from the clubSandwich package74 (vcovCR, type ‘CR0’) in conjunction with the multcomp package75 to calculate adjusted p-values and/or adjusted confidence intervals for contrasts pertaining to the research questions (Supplementary Tables 1–4).For the challenge experiments comparing the homotypic, mixed, and mosaic nanoparticle vaccines the results of two independent experiments were analyzed together. Mouse body weights were recorded daily during the 14-day course of the challenge experiments with Bel/09 and X31 (experiments shown in Fig. 6). The data were analyzed in R statistical software70, using tidyverse71. Before modeling the data in Fig. 6, we selected only the groups of interest (hybrid, mixed, and N1 particles in the Bel09 setting and hybrid, mixed, and N2 particles in the X31 setting). We used the same type of model for all settings: a piecewise linear mixed model with knots at days 4 and 6. The models were saturated in the fixed effects (treatment, experiment, and all time segments) thus allowing for all possible interactions (up to 3-way). We used a random intercept and slope (for time) per mouse to model within-mouse correlation over time. Fitting was done using the lme4 package72 with the nlminb algorithm from the optimx package73. We then used robust covariance estimators from the clubSandwich package74 (vcovCR, type ‘CR0’) in conjunction with the multcomp package75 to calculate adjusted p-values and/or adjusted confidence intervals for contrasts pertaining to the research questions (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Source: iStock.com H5N1, often referred to as the “bird flu” or “avian influenza,” is an infection caused by a virus that is commonly found in birds. Currently, it is also prevalent in dairy cows in several states, including Michigan. In rare cases, it can be transmitted to humans or other animals, often leading to respiratory distress. While anyone who is around birds or dairy cattle can get the virus, people working closely with animals, such as those working with poultry, waterfowl and livestock are at an increased risk. While H5N1 is common among birds, particularly wild birds, it is still rare that humans contract the disease. Since it was first discovered in 1997, there have been less than 1,000 cases in humans worldwide and, as of May 2024, only four of those were in the United States. Of the four cases, two occurred in Michigan. It is most commonly spread through direct contact with an animal with the virus, its body fluid or feces, or a contaminated surface. Humans cannot get H5N1 from commercial milk or properly cooked poultry and eggs. However, symptoms to look for in humans are similar to other influenzas and include fever, cough, muscle aches, general fatigue, sore throat, nausea or vomiting and shortness of breath. In severe cases, avian flu has been linked to serious illnesses including pneumonia, sepsis, brain swelling and respiratory failure. If you have been around birds or dairy cattle recently and feel like you are getting the flu, it is important to be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Though most people who contracted H5N1 in the United States had mild symptoms and recovered quickly, the worldwide mortality rate is about 50%. Beginning antiviral treatment as soon as possible after symptoms start is an important step in reducing that risk, as well as reducing the risk of passing it on to other species. In some cases, antiviral treatments can be given as a precaution to prevent getting the illness if a person feels like they were potentially exposed.

Since the publication of the WHO guidance “Non-pharmaceutical public health measures for mitigating the risk and impact of epidemic and pandemic influenza” in 2019, several PHSM have been widely used to reduce and slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with also an impact on the circulation of seasonal influenza viruses.In light of the resulting huge increase in experience and evidence regarding the use of PHSM and given the ever-present threat of the next influenza pandemic, a WHO technical consultation was held in June 2023 to gather relevant experts and stakeholders to review the most up-to-date scientific evidence identified through systematic reviews and discuss factors like feasibility, costs, and ethical considerations relevant to the update of the 2019 WHO guidance. This meeting report summarizes the main outcomes of discussions that took place during the consultation.

That's according to the authors of a new review which delves into existing research into bird flu vaccines for humans. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics, the results of the paper are particularly timely following news last week (Wednesday 22nd May) that the bird flu strain H5N1 had once again, for a second time, jumped from cattle in America to a human – prompting fears of subsequent human-to-human infection, with possible critical consequences. Instances of the avian influenza were first recognized in US cattle in March. Since then, this strain has mainly spread from cow-to-cow and scientists have discovered very high levels of virus in raw milk (pasteurized milk is safe, having shown viral RNA but not infectious virus). To-date two people, however, are known to have contracted the bird flu virus. Both patients – US farmers – only reported eye symptoms and with treatment they made a full recovery. Following tests on the first human instance, it was seen that the strain had mutated to be better adapted to mammalian cells, but as long as that human didn't pass it onto another person it likely stopped the spread at that point. With the second case, the CDC has released a statement to say it has been monitoring influenza surveillance systems intently, especially in impacted states. "There has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in syndromic surveillance," they report. The concern now, though, is that if H5N1 continues to be given the environment in which to mutate (such as in close quarter cattle farms) – and this continues long enough – it has the potential to find a combination that will easily spread to humans. The results of this new research, carried out by a team at the University of Georgia, USA, suggests vaccines still remain our "primary defense" against potential spread of avian influenzas such as the H5N1 and others assessed. "The H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes of avian influenza virus pose a dual threat, not only causing significant economic losses to the global poultry industry but also presenting a pressing public health concern due to documented spillover events and human cases," explains lead author Flavio Cargnin Faccin, who alongside his mentor Dr. Daniel Perez of the University of Georgia, USA, analyzed the current landscape of research into human vaccines for these bird flus.

The team examined studies of vaccines tested in mice, ferrets, non-human primates, and clinical trials of bird flu vaccines in humans, and assessed both established platforms and promising new directions. The review carried out suggests inactivated vaccines are a safe and affordable option that primarily activate humoral immunity – the part of our immune system that produces antibodies. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) are known to induce a wider immune response than inactivated vaccines, activating not only antibody production but also mucosal and cellular defenses. In this review, the authors suggest this broader response may offer greater protection, though, the authors suggest further research is needed to fully understand and harness its potential benefits for both human and agricultural applications. The review also examined alternatives, such as virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, that have emerged more recently. Although VLP vaccines for bird flu have limited clinical trial data in humans, results from studies in mice and ferrets showed promise, the authors found. mRNA vaccines against H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu subtypes also generated a rapid and strong immune response in mice and ferrets, and, while data in humans is scarce, results from a phase 1 study of an H7N9 mRNA vaccine in healthy humans were "encouraging". Overall, the team suggests "exploring and employing a diverse range of vaccine platforms", will be "crucial for enhancing pandemic preparedness and mitigating the threat of avian influenza viruses".

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY 2nd Michigan farmworker has contracted avian influenza from cow, health officials sayKristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption Bird flu affecting dozens of dairy herdsThe latest bird flu outbreak has affected more than 60 dairy herds since late March, according to the CDC.Fox - 5 AtlantaA second Michigan farmworker has contracted the H5 avian influenza virus, likely from infected dairy cattle, the state health department announced Thursday. The person was treated with antiviral medication for respiratory symptoms and is recovering.As with the first human bird flu case in Michigan, which was announced May 22, the state health department would not disclose on which farm the person worked, in which county the infection occurred or even which region of the state is involved."It's just to protect farm and worker privacy. These are small towns," said Chelsea Wuth, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.Wuth did say, however, that Michigan's two infected farmworkers are employed at separate farms in a county (or counties) with a known dairy cattle H5N1 outbreak. There does not appear to be human-to-human spread of the virus at this time.As of Thursday, there were 23 outbreaks in dairy cattle herds in 10 Michigan counties: Allegan, Barry, Calhoun, Clinton, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Montcalm and Ottawa, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.What's distinct about the latest case is that the worker reported upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.The other two known human cases of cow-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza — in Michigan and Texas farmworkers — reported conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pinkeye, as their only symptom."Most influenza presents as a respiratory virus," said Joe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, "so that's not necessarily terribly surprising. But this is the first case that has had these types of symptoms in the country. And, generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas."It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure."The CDC reported that the person was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored for symptoms and also have been offered antiviral medication."No other workers at the same farm have reported symptoms, and all staff are being monitored," the CDC reported Thursday.Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, said the newest case of avian influenza in a Michigander was identified through a swift public health response that encourages farm owners and workers to report even mild symptoms and provides access to testing.“With the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye," she said in a statement. "With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow. Neither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE)."This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.”More: Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to humanMore: Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be nextThe risk is higher for people who have prolonged or close contact with infected birds, cattle or other animals and for people who spend time in environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, the CDC said.That includes not only poultry and cattle farmers and workers, but also those who work in slaughterhouses, people who have backyard flocks, veterinarians and veterinary staff, and others who work in animal and public health."Given the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, additional human cases in people with higher risk exposures would not be surprising," the CDC said in a statement released Thursday. "A CDC priority right now is to prevent additional cases of A(H5N1) infections in dairy herd workers, who are at higher risk of exposure."The agency urges people to avoid consuming raw milk and to stay away from sick animals along with potentially contaminated surfaces and water (such as ponds, bogs and troughs) on farms with potentially infected animals. It also suggests avoiding contact with the udders of lactating dairy cattle; the feces, bedding or litter of potentially infected animals, and the carcasses of animals — especially birds and livestock — that have died from an unknown cause.Those who must work around infected animals are urged to wear such PPE as a waterproof apron, respirator mask, safety goggles or a face shield, gloves, a head covering and boots or boot covers.The first Michigan case of the H5N1 influenza virus in a human was identified through the text messaging surveillance program MDHHS developed that allows farmworkers to report daily whether they have any symptoms that could be tied to bird flu, Coyle said.But with the second case, detection came about through collaboration between state agriculture workers and public health.When MDARD identifies infected cattle herds, state agricultural workers reach out to the farm owners, Coyle said."We asked MDARD, 'When you do that first outreach to the farm, can you please let the farm owner or the producer know that local public health will be following up?' " he said. "One of the critical questions that they're going to ask is: 'Do you have any sick people?' And so when MDARD started to make that initial outreach to the farm, and local public health followed up, the producer said, 'Oh, yes, there has been someone who has been sick.'"It was through the public health follow-up with the farm that we were able to identify that person as being ill and then rapidly worked to get them tested."Specimens were collected from the farmworker and tested by the state Bureau of Labs. The CDC said it confirmed the H5 infection Wednesday night, and genetic sequencing is underway to determine whether there are any concerning changes to the virus.Sequencing of the virus that infected the first Michigan dairy farmworker showed a mutation that allows mammals to be infected with this strain of bird flu more easily, the CDC reported last week, but did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

A gene found in a strain of avian influenza – H5N1 – was detected in industrial discharge from the Forsyth County/ Winston-Salem wastewater treatment plant last month, scientists found, coinciding with an outbreak in a herd of dairy cattle in west-central North Carolina. Scientists at Stanford and Emory universities published their findings May 20 in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters. “It is the first study to suggest H5N1 is detectable in wastewater and provides evidence for potential sources,” the scientists wrote. “This work can aid in the response to the current avian influenza outbreak.” The gene was also present in wastewater from two other treatment plants in Amarillo, Texas, and Dallas County, Texas, where dairy cattle were also sickened. Forsyth County Public Health Director Joshua Swift told Newsline that the detection “does not mean there is infectious H5N1 virus in the wastewater.” Swift said the county health department is working with the local utility, the state Division of Public Health and other agencies to continue testing and monitoring for the gene associated with the virus. The scientists’ findings have prompted nine North Carolina environmental and animal welfare groups to advocate for more transparency from state officials, as well as “bold action” by the CDC “to determine the true extent of this outbreak before its threat to people, wildlife and farmed animals becomes impossible to contain,” according to a letter recently sent to U.S. centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Mandy Cohen. Cohen was previously the North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services. The CDC could not be immediately reached for comment. H5N1 influenza emerged in wild birds in the late 1990s; and spread to backyard and commercial chicken and turkey flocks, including in North Carolina. A new H5N1 strain has caused widespread outbreaks, and last year tens of millions of chickens were killed in the U.S. to control the transmission of the disease. This year the outbreak spread to dairy cattle and other animals. Since 2022, there have been three cases of H5N1 in humans, none in North Carolina, federal data show. Three cases have been documented in farmworkers, one in Texas, and two in Michigan, earlier this spring. There have been no reports of farmworkers in North Carolina contracting H5N1, state health officials told Newsline. But testing is not required. The CDC recommends testing only for people showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness and who have been exposed to the virus. In their letter, the environmental and animal welfare advocates asked Cohen to “significantly increase” the number of dairy workers tested for H5N1, “proactively test people in non-dairy animal agriculture operations to improve early detection and response for further potential outbreaks of this virus.” The scientists’ recent discovery underscores the importance of wastewater monitoring for pathogens. This includes viruses thought to be primarily found in animals, but with potential to jump to humans, known as “zoonotic transmission.” “There is increasing evidence” of zoonotic transmission of H5N1 to humans, “representing a potentially significant threat to public health,” the scientists wrote, adding the study’s findings also “highlight the need to consider industrial and agricultural discharges into wastewater.” The wastewater detections provide key information, especially in North Carolina, where there is a lack of transparency about agricultural operations. The locations of any type of farm with a disease outbreak is confidential and known only to state agricultural and health officials. But in general, while cattle operations must have a state permit – and their addresses are public – state law exempts most poultry farms from permitting. Their addresses are not known, even to the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality. The N.C. Department of Agriculture houses the confidential poultry farm records, a practice that environmental advocates have long opposed. The environmental and animal welfare advocates are asking for more detailed geographic data to become public, “while protecting privacy rights of workers.” Milk, animal by-products, likely source of H5N1 gene in Forsyth County wastewater The Stanford and Emory scientists monitored wastewater for a different Influenza A gene – which does not cause avian flu – from July 2023 until late April 2024. They collected samples from 190 treatment plants in 41 states and noted that at a third of those facilities, Influenza A concentrations were still high, even though the season had passed. The scientists then turned their attention to retroactively testing those saved samples for the H5N1 gene. They chose the Forsyth County/Winston-Salem wastewater treatment plant, along with the four in Texas, because they had “remarkable increases” in concentrations of Influenza A and the respective public health departments approved the testing for H5N1. A plant in Honolulu, Hawai’i, served as a control group because it didn’t have spikes of Influenza A or documented cases of H5N1 in animals. Dairy cattle shed the virus in milk. While pasteurization kills the virus, it can persist in milk in a non-infectious form. And since milk containing the virus has to be diverted from the food supply, it would likely be discharged into wastewater treatment plants. The NC Department of Health and Human Services advises people not to consume or prepare food with raw or unpasteurized milk. The Texas and Forsyth County/Winston-Salem wastewater treatment plants receive industrial discharges containing animal byproducts, including dairies and beef processing plants, the scientists wrote. In Forsyth County, the uptick in H5N1 genetic material in wastewater occurred from April 5 through April 17; that coincided with the first report of the virus in a North Carolina cattle herd on April 9. The herd was directly linked to the Texas outbreak, which occurred on March 24. Dr. Mike Martin, the North Carolina state veterinarian, issued a “stop-movement” order to keep dairy cattle from affected herds from coming into the state, Heather Overton, spokesperson for the state Department of Agriculture, told Newsline. The department also required that the herd be isolated. Despite the positive test, the North Carolina herd didn’t show symptoms of being ill, Overton said, but since then, the department has “worked with industry and our state and federal partners to inform consumers and protect the industry. We also currently follow all USDA guidelines and recommendations when it comes to movement of dairy cattle.” The state agriculture department then lifted the isolation order on May 6, after several tests showed the virus was no longer present. There are no current H5N1 cases in North Carolina poultry or dairy, Overton said. While scientists have linked the recent findings to dairy cattle, “this doesn’t eliminate the possibility of contributions from other animals, including humans,” the scientists wrote. “Future work should further explore the possible contributions of animal shedding to municipal wastewater systems.” The virus is still circulating in the wild bird population, with 29 cases in North Carolina since January, federal data show. Of those, 24 were reported in the eastern part of the state. The remaining five were detected in Buncombe County, with four, and Mecklenburg County. Wild birds can infect backyard and commercial flocks. Of the 19 cases reported since 2022, 11 have been in commercial flocks with the remaining in backyard chickens. From January through March, two commercial flocks accounting for 53,000 birds in Duplin and Lenoir counties were infected with the virus, state data show. H5N1 has also been detected in 20 mammal species, including barn cats who became ill on farms around the same time as the virus broke out in dairy herds. “A slow response” to the H5N1 virus “is inexcusable due to the painful lessons learned from COVID-19,” the environmental and animal welfare advocates wrote. “The CDC must respond to this outbreak with strong, proactive measures.” XAvian influenza gene found in Forsyth County wastewater discharge; dairy cattle suspected source by Lisa Sorg, NC Newsline May 29, 2024 Avian influenza gene found in Forsyth County wastewater discharge; dairy cattle suspected source by Lisa Sorg, NC Newsline May 29, 2024 This story has been updated to reflect a third farmworker contracted H5N1, in Michigan, on May 30, according to the CDC.

There have been no reports of farmworkers in North Carolina contracting H5N1, state health officials told Newsline. But testing is not required. The CDC recommends testing only for people showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness and who have been exposed to the virus. In their letter, the environmental and animal welfare advocates asked Cohen to “significantly increase” the number of dairy workers tested for H5N1, “proactively test people in non-dairy animal agriculture operations to improve early detection and response for further potential outbreaks of this virus.” The scientists’ recent discovery underscores the importance of wastewater monitoring for pathogens. This includes viruses thought to be primarily found in animals, but with potential to jump to humans, known as “zoonotic transmission.” “There is increasing evidence” of zoonotic transmission of H5N1 to humans, “representing a potentially significant threat to public health,” the scientists wrote, adding the study’s findings also “highlight the need to consider industrial and agricultural discharges into wastewater.” The wastewater detections provide key information, especially in North Carolina, where there is a lack of transparency about agricultural operations. The locations of any type of farm with a disease outbreak is confidential and known only to state agricultural and health officials. But in general, while cattle operations must have a state permit – and their addresses are public – state law exempts most poultry farms from permitting. Their addresses are not known, even to the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality. The N.C. Department of Agriculture houses the confidential poultry farm records, a practice that environmental advocates have long opposed. The environmental and animal welfare advocates are asking for more detailed geographic data to become public, “while protecting privacy rights of workers.” Milk, animal by-products, likely source of H5N1 gene in Forsyth County wastewater The Stanford and Emory scientists monitored wastewater for a different Influenza A gene – which does not cause avian flu – from July 2023 until late April 2024. They collected samples from 190 treatment plants in 41 states and noted that at a third of those facilities, Influenza A concentrations were still high, even though the season had passed. The scientists then turned their attention to retroactively testing those saved samples for the H5N1 gene. They chose the Forsyth County/Winston-Salem wastewater treatment plant, along with the four in Texas, because they had “remarkable increases” in concentrations of Influenza A and the respective public health departments approved the testing for H5N1. A plant in Honolulu, Hawai’i, served as a control group because it didn’t have spikes of Influenza A or documented cases of H5N1 in animals. Dairy cattle shed the virus in milk. While pasteurization kills the virus, it can persist in milk in a non-infectious form. And since milk containing the virus has to be diverted from the food supply, it would likely be discharged into wastewater treatment plants. The NC Department of Health and Human Services advises people not to consume or prepare food with raw or unpasteurized milk. The Texas and Forsyth County/Winston-Salem wastewater treatment plants receive industrial discharges containing animal byproducts, including dairies and beef processing plants, the scientists wrote. In Forsyth County, the uptick in H5N1 genetic material in wastewater occurred from April 5 through April 17; that coincided with the first report of the virus in a North Carolina cattle herd on April 9. The herd was directly linked to the Texas outbreak, which occurred on March 24. Dr. Mike Martin, the North Carolina state veterinarian, issued a “stop-movement” order to keep dairy cattle from affected herds from coming into the state, Heather Overton, spokesperson for the state Department of Agriculture, told Newsline. The department also required that the herd be isolated. Despite the positive test, the North Carolina herd didn’t show symptoms of being ill, Overton said, but since then, the department has “worked with industry and our state and federal partners to inform consumers and protect the industry. We also currently follow all USDA guidelines and recommendations when it comes to movement of dairy cattle.” The state agriculture department then lifted the isolation order on May 6, after several tests showed the virus was no longer present. There are no current H5N1 cases in North Carolina poultry or dairy, Overton said. While scientists have linked the recent findings to dairy cattle, “this doesn’t eliminate the possibility of contributions from other animals, including humans,” the scientists wrote. “Future work should further explore the possible contributions of animal shedding to municipal wastewater systems.” The virus is still circulating in the wild bird population, with 29 cases in North Carolina since January, federal data show. Of those, 24 were reported in the eastern part of the state. The remaining five were detected in Buncombe County, with four, and Mecklenburg County. Wild birds can infect backyard and commercial flocks. Of the 19 cases reported since 2022, 11 have been in commercial flocks with the remaining in backyard chickens. From January through March, two commercial flocks accounting for 53,000 birds in Duplin and Lenoir counties were infected with the virus, state data show. H5N1 has also been detected in 20 mammal species, including barn cats who became ill on farms around the same time as the virus broke out in dairy herds. “A slow response” to the H5N1 virus “is inexcusable due to the painful lessons learned from COVID-19,” the environmental and animal welfare advocates wrote. “The CDC must respond to this outbreak with strong, proactive measures.” NC Newsline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2) is a host transmembrane protease expressed throughout the porcine airway epithelium and is purported to play a major role in the HA cleavage process, thereby influencing viral pathogenicity and tissue tropism. Pigs are natural hosts of IAV and IAV disease causes substantial economic impact on the pork industry worldwide. Previous studies in mice demonstrated that knocking out expression of TMPRSS2 gene was safe and inhibited the spread of IAV after experimental challenge. Therefore, we hypothesized that knockout of TMPRSS2 will prevent IAV infectivity in the swine model. We investigated this hypothesis by comparing pathogenesis of an H1N1pdm09 virus challenge in wildtype (WT) control and in TMPRSS2 knockout (TMPRSS2−/−) pigs. We demonstrated that TMPRSS2 was expressed in the respiratory tract in WT pigs with and without IAV infection. No differences in nasal viral shedding and lung lavage viral titers were observed between WT and TMPRSS2−/− pigs. However, the TMPRSS2−/− pig group had significantly less lung lesions and significant reductions in antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines in the lung. The virus titer results in our direct challenge model contradict prior studies in the murine animal model, but the reduced lung lesions and cytokine profile suggest a possible role for TMPRSS2 in the proinflammatory antiviral response. Further research is warranted to investigate the role of TMPRSS2 in swine IAV infection and disease.IntroductionInfluenza A virus (IAV) is responsible for one of the most important viral respiratory diseases in pigs and humans (Anderson et al., 2021). Pigs are natural hosts of IAVs and while the clinical signs of uncomplicated infection may be mild, swine influenza is responsible for substantial economic impact on the pork industry worldwide due to multi-etiology porcine respiratory disease complex and predisposition of pigs to secondary respiratory infections (Gorres et al., 2011). Pigs possess cell-surface receptors preferred by both avian and human IAV and are susceptible to infection by certain human and avian IAV strains (Matrosovich et al., 2009). Therefore, they are considered “mixing vessels” for the potential to host co-infection with endemic swine adapted strains and human seasonal or avian strains, which may lead to reassortment and generation of potentially novel IAV strains. The 2009 influenza pandemic was a reminder of this possibility, when a novel swine-origin H1N1 (pdm09) IAV that contained ancestral gene segments from human, avian and swine IAV emerged and rapidly spread within the human population worldwide, reaching pandemic status (Henningson et al., 2015). The pdm09 became a seasonal strain in humans and continues to transmit from humans to pigs, greatly increasing the reassortment and evolution potential of swine IAV (Markin et al., 2023). Therefore, control of IAV in swine will have a downstream impact on human public health.Infection of the host by IAV is initiated by binding of hemagglutinin (HA), a glycoprotein exposed on the IAV lipid envelope to the cognate cell surface receptor and fusing with cellular endosomal membrane. However, the HA is synthesized as a precursor protein HA0 necessary for trimerization and binding to host receptors but requires proteolytic cleavage by host cellular proteases into HA1 (peripheral N-terminal) and HA2 (C-terminal transmembrane) fragments to acquire competence for fusion following cell entry. The proteolytic cleavage of HA results in a cascade of events, first rendering the HA fragment metastable, inducing major conformational changes in low endosomal pH, exposing the fusion peptide, and ultimately fusing with the endosomal membrane to release IAV ribonucleoproteins (RNP) into the cytoplasm (Peitsch et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022). The cleavage of the HA by host cell proteases is the rate limiting step for viral infectivity and determining pathogenicity and tissue tropism (Bottcher et al., 2006; Hatesuer et al., 2013). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that type II transmembrane proteases are responsible for cleavage at the monobasic site of HA and IAV infection in human, mice, and swine airway epithelium (Peitsch et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022). TMPRSS2 is a type II transmembrane serine protease and is indicated to be one of the serine proteases responsible for HA0 proteolytic cleavage of several IAV HA subtypes that contain an arginine in the linker peptide between HA1 and HA2 domains, as shown for H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) and H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/13) (Sakai et al., 2014; Tarnow et al., 2014). In mice, knockout of TMPRSS2 resulted in the protection against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34), mouse adapted H1N1 (A/California/04/09) and H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/13) IAV infections (Sakai et al., 2014; Tarnow et al., 2014), and did not result in overt morbidity or mortality (Kim et al., 2006). Likewise, in humans, genetic linkage studies have identified genetic variants in patients that have high TMPRSS2 expression exhibited a higher risk for severe H1N1 (pdm09) and Asian H7N9 IAV infection (Cheng et al., 2015). These results highlight the growing evidence supporting the role of TMPRSS2 in IAV infectivity.Pigs express TMPRSS2 and other HA cleaving proteases in different parts of the respiratory tract, including the epiglottis, trachea, and lung (Peitsch et al., 2014). Since IAVs are a threat to animal and public health, measures to control on-going circulation and viral evolution in the swine population are essential. Disease resistant animal models, including pigs, have been successfully generated over recent years through genetic modifications (Whitworth et al., 2022). Our working hypothesis was that TMPRSS2 plays an important role in IAV infection, and knockout of the TMPRSS2 gene regulates IAV infectivity in the swine model. We investigated this hypothesis by generating TMPRSS2 knockout (TMPRSS2−/−) gene edited pigs and comparing the pathogenesis of an H1N1pdm09 strain in wildtype (WT) control and TMPRSS2−/− pigs.Materials and methodsExpression of TMPRSS2 in wildtype swine respiratory tractTo demonstrate the cellular distribution of TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in normal swine respiratory tissues, lung and trachea tissue sections from 4 non-infected and 4 IAV infected WT pigs euthanized on 5 days post inoculation (dpi) were cut, fixed in fresh 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 48 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin at room temperature, and mounted on Superfrost® Plus slides (Avantor, Radnor, PA). RNAscope® assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the automated Ventana Discovery™ Ultra system (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA). Antigen retrieval was carried out for 24 min at 97°C followed by Protease Plus pre-treatment for 16 min at 37°C, and incubation with the amp reagent for 24 min. The target probe was RNAscope™ 2.5 VS Sus scrofa transmembrane protease serine 2 mRNA (Ss-TMPRSS2-C2). The positive control probe was RNAscope™ 2.5 VS Sus scrofa peptidylprolyl isomerase B cyclophilin B (Ss-PPIB) partial mRNA and the negative control probe was RNAscope™ 2.5 VS Bacillus subtilis strain SMY methylglyoxal synthase (mgsA) gene, partial coding sequence. Slides were then counterstained, cover slipped, and stored in the dark until image evaluation.Generation of TMPRSS2−/− fibroblastsSomatic cells null for TMPRSS2 were derived from genome edited pigs reported in Whitworth et al. (Whitworth et al., 2017). Briefly, a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro transcribed RNA and two single guide RNAs (CRISPR guides #3 and #6) flanking an essential exon (exon #2) that contains the “ATG” start codon and coding sequence, were co-injected into cytoplasm of presumptive zygotes 14 h post fertilization. Following embryo transfer and birth of edited offspring, the founder boar was bred with WT animal, and the line was propagated by breeding. Following subsequent cross of heterozygous animals, fibroblasts null for TMPRSS2 were obtained from ear and tail skin biopsies of TMPRSS2−/− piglets. The tissue samples were cut into small pieces (of ∼1 mm3) in 100 mm cell culture dish and digested in 20 mL of the digestion medium (DMEM HG 15% fetal bovine serum [FBS] + Collagenase [200 μg/mL type IV, sigma C5138] + Dnase I [25 Kunitz/mL, sigma D-4263] + antibiotics [1 μg/mL gentamicin, 10 mg/mL stock]) for 7–8 h in a tissue culture incubator at 38.5°C in 5% CO2 and air. The fibroblast cultures were then cryopreserved in 10% DMSO in DMEM and stored in liquid nitrogen until pigs were recreated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). One male and 1 female line (94–2 and 94–3, respectively) were used for SCNT. The edit for the 94–2 line included a 211 bp deletion and a 11 bp insertion in exon 2 removing the start codon on one allele and an 875 bp deletion removing the entire exon 2 on the other allele. The edit for the 94–3 line included a 210 bp deletion and a 17 bp insertion in exon 2, removing the start codon on one allele and an 875 bp deletion removing the entire exon 2 on the other allele.Generation of TMPRSS2−/− pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)TMPRSS2−/− pigs were generated by SCNT as described in our previous studies (Park et al., 2021). Briefly, cumulus-oocyte-complexes were purchased from a commercial supplier (De Soto Biosciences, Seymour, TN, United States). After in vitro maturation, the cumulus cells were removed from oocytes by gentle pipetting in a 0.1% (w/v) hyaluronidase solution. The oocytes were enucleated by aspirating the polar body and the MII metaphase plates by a micropipette (Humagen, Charlottesville, VA, United States) in 0.1% DPBS supplemented with 5 μg/mL of cytochalasin B. After enucleation, a donor cell was placed into the perivitelline space of an enucleated oocyte. The cell–oocyte couplets were fused by applying two direct current (DC) pulses (1-s interval) of 2.0 kV/cm for 30 μs using an ECM 2001 Electroporation System (BTX, Holliston, MA). After fusion, the reconstructed oocytes were activated by a DC pulse of 1.0 kV/cm for 60 µs, followed by post-activation in 2 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine for 3 h. After overnight culture in porcine zygote medium with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (PZM3) with a histone deacetylase inhibitor Scriptaid (0.5 μM), the cloned embryos were cultured and maintained in PZM3 medium in a low oxygen environment (5% O2, 5% CO2 and 90% N2) (Redel et al., 2019). Embryos that progressed to blastocysts were surgically transferred into synchronized recipients on the days 3–5 following standing estrus. Seven embryo transfers resulted in 2 pregnancies and 7 live piglets from 2 litters. Two piglets were male and derived from the 94–2 line and 5 piglets were female and derived from 94–3 line. Piglets were genotyped to confirm TMPRRS2−/− status by PCR as described previously (Whitworth et al., 2017).VirusThe IAV strain used in the animal study was A/swine/Iowa/A02524480/2020 (IA/20), a representative of the 1A.3.3.2 H1N1pdm09 lineage of IAV. This H1N1 phylogenetic clade pairing represented approximately 5% of the IAV detected in swine in the U.S. in 2020–2023, and the remaining 6 gene segments represent one of the most common whole genome constellation patterns in US swine in the last 3 years (TTTPPT) (Arendsee et al., 2021). The HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes originated from a human seasonal H1N1 of the pdm09 lineage circulating in the 2018–2019 influenza season that spilled into pigs and sustained transmission in the animal population. The IA/20 isolate originated from a clinical case of respiratory disease in pigs and was obtained from the IAV repository at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) IAV swine surveillance system in conjunction with the USDA-National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN). Prior to challenge, the virus was propagated and titrated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells.In vivo animal studyControl WT pigs were obtained from a commercial source free of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and IAV, and used as positive and negative controls for IAV infection. The TMPRSS2−/− pigs were obtained from the National Swine Resource and Research Center (RRID: NSRRC:0060), from two separate litters with N = 2 and N = 5. Pigs were implanted with a Life Chip from Bio-Thermo Technology (Destron Fearing, DFW Airport, Texas), separated into three groups in separate containment rooms, one group of negative WT control pigs (non-challenged) (N = 5), a group of positive control WT pigs (N = 10), and the TMPRSS2−/− group (N = 7). After arrival, all the pigs were housed in bio-safety level 2 containment and cared for in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Animal Disease Center. The pigs were treated with ceftiofur crystalline free acid and tulathromycin (Zoetis Animal Health, Florham Park, NJ) to reduce secondary bacterial infections. All were screened by a commercial ELISA kit to ensure absence of IAV antibody (Swine Influenza Virus Antibody Test, IDEXX, Westbrook, ME). Temperature collection commenced 2 days before challenge and continued until 5 days post inoculation (dpi). At 4–5 weeks of age, pigs were inoculated intratracheally and intranasally with 2 mL and 1 mL, respectively, of 1 ×105 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL of the IA/20 virus. Inoculation was done under sedation using an intramuscular injection of ketamine (8 mg/kg; Phoenix, St. Joseph, MO), xylazine (4 mg/kg; Lloyd Inc., Shenandoah, IA), and Telazol (6 mg/kg; Zoetis Animal Health, Florham Park, NJ) cocktail. Nasal swabs (NS) were collected daily from 0 to 5 dpi, in infection media containing 2 mL minimum-essential-medium (MEM) supplemented with 1:1000 TPCK Trypsin, to evaluate nasal viral shedding.On 5 dpi the pigs were bled and humanely euthanized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital (Fatal Plus; Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI). Lungs were aseptically removed, evaluated for macroscopic lesions and lavaged with 50 mL of MEM containing 1% BSA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). Right cardiac or affected lung lobe and distal trachea tissues were collected from all pigs.Confirmation of TMPRSS2−/− knockoutLung tissues collected during necropsy were maintained in RNAlater® (R0901, Sigma-Aldrich). Isolation of genomic DNA (gDNA) from tissues was done with Monarch® Genomic DNA purification kit (New England Biolabs, Cat. No. T3010L) for DNA isolation as per manufacturer’s recommended protocol. All Prep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No./ID: 80004) for mRNA isolation as per the recommended protocol. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using an Applied BiosystemsTM High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNATM kit (ThermoFisher, Cat. No. 4387406) for cDNA synthesis as per the manufacturers’ recommended protocol. Genotyping PCR was performed using TaqPolymerase mix (Bioline) by using the following conditions: denaturation and polymerase activation step of 95°C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s (denaturation), 52°C for 30 s (annealing), 72°C for 1 min (extension), and the final extension step of 72°C for 5 min. RT-PCR was performed by using KOD Hot start mastermix (Novagen) by using the following conditions. For ACTG1: denaturation and polymerase activation step of 95°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 20 s (denaturation), 60°C for 15 s (annealing), 72°C for 2 min (extension), and the final extension step of 72°C for 2 min. The primer sequence and information are provided in Supplementary Table S1.Virologic assays and PCR antigen detectionAll nasal swab samples were filtered with a 0.2-micron syringe filter and plated onto 48-well plates containing confluent MDCK cells that were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured at 37°C for 48–72 h, depending on the amount of cytopathic effect present. Plates were fixed and stained for immunocytochemistry (ICC) as previously described (Gauger and Vincent, 2014). BALF samples were streaked (100 µL) on Casmin (NAD-enriched) and blood agar plates for 48 h at 37°C to verify lack of significant aerobic bacterial growth. Virus isolation-positive nasal swabs and BALF samples were analyzed for viral titers by being plated onto 96-well plates of MDCK cells in 10-fold serial triplicate dilutions in 100 µL with infection media containing antibiotics. At 48 h, plates were fixed and stained (Gauger and Vincent, 2014). Titers were calculated for each sample as TCID50 per mL and transformed to log10 for comparison purposes. Nasal swab samples were subjected to RNA isolation using MagMAX-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit and qPCR with VetMAXTM-Gold SIV Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to compare cycle threshold (Ct) values.Pathologic changes and immunohistochemical staining for IAVAt necropsy, the percentages of lung surface with lesions typical of IAV infection were recorded. A visual estimation was made for each lung lobe, and a total percentage for the entire lung was calculated based on weighted proportions of each lobe to the total lung volume (Halbur et al., 1995). All tissues collected and fixed in 10% formalin were transferred to 70% ethanol buffer approximately 48 h following collection. Lung and tracheal tissues were processed by routine histologic procedures and the slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microscopic lesions were scored by a veterinary pathologist with parameters previously described (Morgan et al., 2016). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was carried out manually on 5-µm thick lung and tracheal sections, using a primary antibody that targets the IAV nucleoprotein (NP). Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed in an EZ-retriever® IR System (BioGenex, Fremont, CA) using a citrate buffer (pH 6; Abcam, Boston, MA) heated to 95°C for 2 cycles of 10 min. Slides were allowed to cool for 20 min followed by a rinse with deionized water and Dako Wash Buffer (2 × 5 min: Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Slides were then incubated with hydrogen peroxide (3% in PBS; 2 × 8 min) to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, washed, and blocked for 60 min with 10% goat serum diluted in Dako Wash Buffer. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 60 min with primary antibody (1:4000; GTX125989, GeneTex, Irvine, CA) diluted in antibody dilution buffer (S080983-2, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), washed, and incubated with a secondary antibody (EnVision + anti-rabbit Poly HRP-IgG, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) for 30 min. Diaminobenzidine chromogen detection was completed using Dako DAB Plus (5 min, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and Dako DAB Enhancer (3 min, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Slides were then rinsed with deionized water, cleared through gradient alcohol and xylene, counterstained using hematoxylin and cover slipped. Sections were scored by a veterinary pathologist blinded to the study using a 0–4 scoring factor (Gauger et al., 2012) with modifications based upon the quantity of antigen-positive cells present in the tracheal epithelium and either in the conducting airways of the lung, alveolar lumen and/or septa (0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe or abundant).Cytokine and chemokine analysisBALF samples were centrifuged to remove cellular debris and tested with the Invitrogen ProcartaPlex™ Porcine Cytokine and Chemokine 1 9-Plex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) per manufacturer’s instructions. The media used to collect the lavages was used to prepare the standard mix. All samples were assessed on a Luminex MAGPIX Instrument System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for the expression of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. The average of duplicate wells for each sample was used for statistical analysis.Statistical analysisMacroscopic pneumonia scores, microscopic tracheal and lung lesion scores, ICC staining scores, log10 transformed BALF, nasal swab virus titers and cytokine data were analyzed using ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test and IHC scores were analyzed by t-test (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Comparisons were made between groups at the same time-point using a 5% level of significance (p-value <0.05) to assess statistical differences. Clinical data associated with this study are available for download from the USDA Ag Data Commons at https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1529793.ResultsConfirmation of TMPRSS2 knockoutThe TMPRSS2−/− piglets generated by SCNT were genotyped to confirm the expected loss of exon 2 and loss of expression by RT-PCR, respectively using gene specific primers (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Figure S1). As shown in Supplementary Figure S2, loss of exon 2 results in the loss of the canonical start codon and truncated polypeptide sequence to render the TMPRRS2 protein non-functional.TMPRSS2 expression in swine respiratory tissueIn clinically healthy WT pigs, abundant TMPRSS2 transcripts were detected in the pseudostratified ciliated epithelium of the turbinate (Figure 1A) and trachea (Figure 1B). Similarly, abundant transcripts were circumferentially detected within the respiratory epithelium lining the mainstem bronchi (Figure 1C), bronchioles (Figure 1D), and terminal bronchioles. Transcripts were also commonly detected in cells comprising or within the alveolar septa (Figure 1E) and rarely detected in endothelial cells (Figure 1F). The epithelium of submucosal glands in the turbinate, trachea, and lung also contained transcripts. Multiple transcripts per cell were commonly present with minimal to mild variation between cells in all tissues evaluated.Figure 1 Figure 1. RNAscope detection of TMPRSS2 transcripts in the respiratory tract of clinically healthy wildtype pigs without IAV infection. There was abundant detection in pseudostratified ciliated epithelium of the turbinate (A) and trachea (B) and circumferential detection within the respiratory epithelium lining the mainstem bronchi (C) and bronchioles (D). Transcripts were detected in cells comprising the alveolar septa (E) but rarely detected in endothelial cells (F). Original magnifications: ×600 (A,B,F); 40× (C); 400× (D,E).Differential transcript distribution was visually observed in IAV infected WT pigs compared to non-challenged pigs. Diminished expression signal was visually detected in areas of erosion in the turbinate (Figure 2A) and trachea (Figure 2B). Bronchi and bronchioles affected by necrotizing bronchitis (Figures 2C,D) and bronchiolitis (Figures 2E,F) had diminished TMPRSS2 transcripts with fewer cells containing TMPRSS2 transcripts. Increased transcription was observed in cells surrounding affected bronchioles (Figure 2F). Differential endothelial transcription was not observed. It is not clear if this differential distribution was a result of downregulation in the expression of TMPRSS2 or a direct consequence of epithelial cell death due to viral infection. Tissue samples from the TMPRSS2−/− were not analyzed by RNAscope assay as the RNA expression is not disrupted, and the RNAscope probes did not target the deleted region.Figure 2 Figure 2. RNAscope detection of TMPRSS2 transcripts in the respiratory tract of IAV infected wildtype pigs at 5 days post inoculation (dpi). Diminished transcripts were observed in areas of erosion in the turbinate (A) and trachea (B). Differential visual observation of TMPRSS2 transcripts was noted in bronchi (C,D) and bronchioles (E,F) affected by necrotizing bronchiolitis and bronchitis after IAV infection compared to non-challenged pigs. Increased transcription was observed in cells surrounding affected bronchioles (E,F) when compared to healthy tissue. Original magnifications: ×200 (D–F); 100× (C); 400× (A,B).Absence of TMPRSS2 had minimal impact on nasal viral sheddingNo IAV was detected in nasal secretions from any inoculated pigs at 0 dpi, and all negative control pigs remained negative throughout the study. Both challenged groups had onset of nasal shedding at 1 dpi with 10 of 10 positive in the WT control group, and 2 of 7 in the TMPRSS2−/− group positive for virus on 1 dpi (Figure 3). All 7 pigs in the TMPRSS2−/− group were shedding on 2 dpi. Viral shedding detected in nasal swabs continued in both groups throughout the duration of the study. The magnitude of virus titers were significantly different between groups on 3 dpi, when the TMPRSS2−/− pig group had higher mean titers in nasal swabs compared to the WT positive control group (p < 0.005). Viral RNA levels were also higher for the TMPRSS2−/− pigs on dpi 2, reflected in significantly lower Ct values (p < 0.05).Figure 3 Figure 3.

Virus titers showed as log10 transformed group mean TCID50/ml ± standard error of the mean from nasal swabs of 1–5 days post infection in negative controls (grey, N = 5), wildtype (green, N = 10), or TMPRSS2−/− pigs (black, N = 7).

BALF were collected and titrated to evaluate viral replication in the trachea and lungs. All challenged pigs had IAV detected in their BALF samples and mean viral titers were not significantly different between groups (Figure 4A). The IA/20 H1N1 isolate induced mild to moderate percentages of macroscopic pneumonia in all challenged pigs with varying degrees of multifocal to coalescing areas of consolidation, consistent with experimental infection of IAV. Macroscopic lung lesions demonstrated higher average percentages in the WT group compared to the TMPRSS2−/− group (Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure S3). Overall, microscopic lung lesions scores followed the same pattern, with the mean histologic lesion scores being significantly lower in the TMPRSS2−/− group (Figure 4C). However, tracheal lesions were not significantly different between groups (Figure 4D). IHC staining of tissue sections revealed antigen-positive cells in the lung, trachea, and nasal turbinate tissue of all TMPRSS2−/− pigs. When compared, no significant difference in the IHC score was found in the trachea (Figure 5A) or conducting airway epithelium of the lung (Figure 5B) between the TMPRSS2−/− and WT pigs. A significant difference between the non-airway IAV antigen-positive cell scoring of the TMPRSS2−/− and WT lungs was observed (Figure 5C). The TMPRSS2−/− group had higher levels of signal in pneumocytes, macrophages and alveolar luminal exudate than the WT group of pigs. These results indicate that the absence of TMPRSS2 expression does not impede IAV infection of the upper and lower respiratory tract.Figure 4 Figure 4.

The TMPRSS2−/− pigs had elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-α compared to the non-challenged negative control group. However, the WT positive challenged control group had significantly higher levels of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10, and IL-4 when compared to the TMPRSS2−/− group (Figure 6). IL-8 quantity was also higher in the WT group, but not statistically significant due to the variability between TMPRSS2−/− animals. TNF-α levels were not significantly different between challenged groups.Figure 6 Figure 6.

Among these, the swine population plays a crucial role in the ecology of IAV, because pigs can be infected by both avian and human IAV. Pigs also act as mixing vessels, allowing for the reassortment and consequently emergence of new viruses. These reassorted novel viruses can carry gene segments from different viral lineages that were previously found in separate animal species. As a result, if returned to their original host, they have the potential to evade existing population immunity and cause disease. Reducing the burden of IAV infection in swine improves the overall welfare of animals by decreasing clinical respiratory disease. This, in turn, protects the economic stability of the swine industry since IAV outbreaks have a significant economic impact due to reduced growth rates, decreased productivity, and increased mortality among infected animals. Reducing the circulation of IAV in pigs also decreases the likelihood of viral reassortment and evolution in swine and consequently the risk of human exposure. The typical approach to reduce IAV burden in the swine population is to implement control measures such as biosecurity and vaccination practices (Vincent et al., 2014). However, due to the complex ecology of swine IAV and the continued evolution and co-circulation of distinct lineages evading control measures, alternative approaches to control influenza circulation require consideration.Disease-resistant or tolerant animal models exhibit a natural or engineered decrease in susceptibility to specific diseases. They are valuable models to study disease mechanisms, therapeutic interventions, and vaccines (Whitworth et al., 2022). Recently, viral disease resistant pig models have been successfully generated through gene editing technology (Whitworth et al., 2016) and they provide an unprecedented opportunity for deciphering infection dynamics and host-pathogen interactions. Gene edited pigs provide opportunities to mitigate economic losses and maintain a healthier and more productive swine herd and thereby more sustainable farming practices. If pigs are less susceptible to influenza, the risk of transmission to humans will decrease, potentially preventing future outbreaks and pandemics. The swine model is also valuable to study multifaceted host-pathogen interactions that occur during IAV infection because swine are a natural host and share respiratory and physiological similarities with humans (Rajao and Vincent, 2015). Our TMPRSS2−/− pig model was created to address the role of TMPRSS2 in swine influenza pathogenesis but may also improve our knowledge of therapeutic approaches to human influenza disease.The extent of the physiological roles of TMPRSS2 is currently unknown (Antalis et al., 2011); however, it is noteworthy that the lack of TMPRSS2 was not associated with severe unwanted side effects and TMPRSS2−/− pigs, similar to the knockout mice, did not exhibit any overt health abnormalities and did not show any developmental alterations such as splayed legs, macroglossia, or low birth weight (Supplementary Figure S4) (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014). In this study, we showed subtle effects of loss of TMPRSS2 compared to similar studies performed previously in the mouse model (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014). In our swine model, the host-protease TMPRSS2 was not solely responsible for susceptibility to IAV infection. The H1N1 IAV strain tested here was capable of infecting and causing disease in pigs despite the gene editing to prevent TMPRSS2 expression. The similarity in viral titers from the WT and TMPRSS2−/− nasal swabs and BALF samples indicate that there was no difference in viral shedding and possible transmission capability between the groups, although the latter was not assessed. This may be explained because IAV can employ multiple enzymes for HA cleavage and fusion activation in the host (Hatesuer et al., 2013) and in the absence of TMPRSS2, other proteases might compensate. IHC staining revealed that the IA/20 H1N1 strain infected cells throughout the respiratory tract.The lesions induced by IAV in the respiratory tract reflect not only the damage done by the virus during infection, but also the host’s innate inflammatory response during an acute respiratory tract infection. The inflammatory response is signaled by cytokines and chemokines to initiate development of specific immunity. While the response leads to resolution of the infection, the innate antiviral reaction also mediates inflammation and contributes to clinical signs (i.e., labored breathing, fever, and anorexia) (Hayden et al., 1998; Van Reeth et al., 2002). Many of the cytokines tested were present in significantly higher levels in the lung lavage of WT pigs compared to the TMPRSS2−/− pigs. Interferons are upregulated early in antiviral responses in swine. While IFN-α is produced by dendritic cells and IFN-γ by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells upon antigen stimulation, both play many immunoregulatory roles during early stages of influenza infection (Suradhat et al., 2001; Van Reeth et al., 2002; Barbe et al., 2010). Interleukins are another family of cytokines with potent immunomodulatory properties. IL-1β is produced mainly from antigen presenting monocytes and macrophages and strengthens the response by activating T and B cells and increasing additional cytokine production (Tuo et al., 1996). IL-6 has a significant influence on the development of adaptive immunity and impacts influenza disease severity in animals and humans (Lauder et al., 2013). IL-12 drives the development of cell-mediated immunity (Carter and Curiel, 2005). IL-4 also regulates antibody production, inflammation, and activation of T cells (Brown and Hural, 2017). Conversely, IL-10, a repressor of the proinflammatory response, was also present in higher levels in the lung of WT pigs. This cytokine increases through feedback mechanisms in response to inflammation and is essential for tissue-healing (Ouyang et al., 2011). Therefore, the reduced lung lesions in the TMPRSS2−/− pigs were likely associated with a dampened pro-inflammatory response. This was consistent with cytokine levels reported in a TMPRSS2 knockout mouse model (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019). A small-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that elevated TMPRSS2 expression in humans resulted in more severe outcomes of pdm09 influenza disease (Cheng et al., 2015). The lack of TMPRSS2 expression may result in pigs that experience less inflammation and subsequently reduced clinical signs when infected with IAV. As a result, the overall consequences of disease and subsequent production losses may be decreased.We acknowledge that our study was limited by the low number of TMPRSS2−/− pigs available for IAV challenge; however, we demonstrated the need to investigate disease dynamics in the natural host as our results in the swine model differed from the mouse model. This is particularly critical in the case of IAV, as swine are a natural host. Previous studies regarding host genetic determinants of IAV susceptibility and resistance via alterations in genes that control innate immunity were reported in mice and humans. For instance, Mx genes and their corresponding products are a group of interferon-inducible antiviral proteins that have been extensively investigated as suppressors of IAV infection (Palm et al., 2010; Haller and Kochs, 2020). In vitro, fibroblast cells taken from genetically modified pigs with increased Mx1 expression exhibited reduced IAV proliferation (Yan et al., 2014). Other studies indicated that this inhibition of viral replication was dependent on the Mx1 protein function and not on interferon induction (Nakajima et al., 2007). There are also host genetic determinants that influence IAV host range. One of the major barriers to avian IAV replication in mammalian cells is the incompatibility of the viral polymerase with acidic nuclear phosphoproteins (ANP). ANPs are host cellular proteins utilized by the viral polymerase for replication of the viral genome and propagation of infectious virus in host cells. This was demonstrated by knockdown of ANP in human cells, reducing IAV replication and transcription (Staller et al., 2019). Porcine ANP32A showed greater avian IAV polymerase activity than ANP32B, and host-specific sequences involved in the interaction were identified that can be targeted for gene editing ANP32A in swine (Zhang et al., 2020). Overall, our findings highlight the use of pigs as natural hosts for investigating mechanisms of IAV susceptibility and generating disease-resistant pig models for mitigating influenza risk. Future studies will be aimed at investigating other host cell proteases that may have compensated for the loss of TMPRSS2 expression in this single knockout model or may result in an additive effect on IAV resistance in pigs. In addition, pathogenesis, and transmission studies of distinct IAV subtypes and strains in TMPRSS2−/− model pigs are warranted as we were limited to only one H1N1 strain due to availability of the knockout pigs.Data availability statementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material or at the USDA Ag Data Commons at 10.15482/USDA.ADC/1529793, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.Ethics statementThe animal study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Animal Disease Center (NADC).

The projects are receiving a total of $20 million. Fifty-four applications were received in response to a global request for proposals on novel antivirals for pandemic influenza. The 11 funded projects cover a broad range of discovery research and early development activities. These include research into new viral targets; development of more potent dual-acting compounds; and exploring ways to target human proteins and pathways that are essential to influenza virus replication to reduce the likelihood of resistance developing. The projects have been developed by researchers from academia, non-profit research organizations, and biotech, some in cross-sector collaboration, and are hosted at institutions and organizations around the world. “Pandemic influenza is a constant threat,” says Peter Lawætz Andersen, Senior Vice President and Head of Infectious Diseases at the Novo Nordisk Foundation. “Even now, there is a highly pathogenic strain of avian flu circulating among birds and spreading to mammals, including some cases in humans. It is vital to support discovery, early development and de-risking of new and better medical countermeasures, so that if a pandemic influenza strain starts circulating among humans, we’re as ready as we can be. “This is a goal of the PAD initiative, and also partly why the Foundation recently announced the Novo Nordisk Foundation Initiative for Vaccines and Immunity, which will be focused on the development of more robust, broad and long-lasting vaccines against respiratory infections including influenza.” Inevitable but hard to predict Pandemic influenza occurs when a new influenza strain jumps from animals to humans and starts spreading between people globally. These influenza strains have different molecular properties to the seasonal flu viruses that circulate every year, so people have very little, if any, pre-existing immunity. In addition, the existing influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs are not necessarily effective against these new strains. Influenza pandemics have occurred throughout history, with the most severe – the Spanish flu in 1918-19 – causing 50-100 million deaths, and the most recent being the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Many experts agree that another influenza pandemic is inevitable, but it is hard to predict when it will happen. With this funding, the PAD initiative aims to help the world prepare for these future threats by supporting researchers to identify and develop novel antiviral drug candidates. These should be differentiated from currently marketed drugs for seasonal influenza, demonstrate activity against pandemic influenza strains and drug-resistant influenza strains, and suitable to deploy globally during an emerging pandemic, potentially in combination treatments to reduce the likelihood of drug resistance emerging. Second year of PAD grants This is the second year that grants have been awarded within the PAD initiative, a global philanthropic collaboration between the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Open Philanthropy, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The initiative was established during the Covid-19 pandemic to catalyse early discovery and development of antiviral drugs in preparation for future pandemics. The first grants awarded within PAD focused on discovery and early development of antivirals for henipaviruses, a pandemic threat with no current vaccines or antivirals approved. These funded projects are ongoing. Many of the supported researchers attended a PAD-hosted workshop in April to discuss progress and share knowledge. At present, no requests for proposals are planned for 2024. About the PAD initiative Pandemic Antiviral Discovery (PAD) is a global philanthropic initiative launched by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Philanthropy, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation. PAD’s mission is to help researchers worldwide identify and develop phase 2-ready antiviral drug candidates targeting pandemic threat viruses, including coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and orthomyxoviruses. With equitable access as a core principle of the initiative, the founding partners are committed to ensuring that discoveries and innovations supported by PAD are accessible to people in low- and middle-income countries.

This Time, It’s DifferentA Third Person in the U.S. Has Bird Flu. This Time, It’s Different3 minute readBy Alice ParkUpdated: May 30, 2024 4:42 PM EDT | Originally published: May 30, 2024 2:41 PM EDTA third dairy worker in the U.S. has tested positive for the bird flu infection that is causing outbreaks in cattle in at least nine states.The farmworker, from Michigan, was exposed to infected cows and is the first of the three recently confirmed cases to have respiratory symptoms, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The previous two people—another in Michigan and one in Texas—did not show any respiratory symptoms but experienced discharge from the eyes. The dairy worker in the latest case worked on a different farm in Michigan than the previous case reported in the state.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the dairy worker in the latest case also experienced “watery discharge” from the eyes, but also reported coughing (with no fever). Tests on samples from the patient performed by Michigan's health department were positive for influenza A(H5), the avian influenza strain. Further tests conducted by CDC scientists confirmed the results.It's not clear whether the respiratory symptoms indicate that the virus is changing; CDC scientists are conducting additional sequencing studies to determine if that's the case. The CDC says there are no spikes in influenza cases among people in areas where the virus has been reported in cows, nor are there any unusual increases in emergency room visits or positive lab tests for influenza. So far, there have also been no reports that the virus was spread from one person to another in the infected workers’ households. In all three cases, the infected workers, as well as their families, were monitored and offered antiviral medications. The state of Michigan is continuing to work with farms to monitor for sick animals and symptoms in farmworkers and has tested 45 people so far, says Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.For now, the CDC says the outbreak in cows does not pose a significant health threat to people who don’t routinely work with the animals. Those who do, however, should wear protective equipment and practice caution when handling sick or dead animals, including birds and cows, as well as monitor and report any flu-like symptoms to their local health department. In the first Michigan case, the farmworker was directed exposed to contaminated milk that splashed in his eye, and he was not wearing any protective equipment. In the latest case, the worker was not wearing a mask and worked directly with a sick animal, says Bagdasarian. "Two points to take home are that so far, people who are at risk are those who have direct, sustained exposure to sick animals, and second, that neither was wearing full personal protective equipment," she says. "So right now the risk to the general public is very low. There are no secondary cases of infections from these individuals, no sustained human-to-human transmission, and no cases outside of dairy workers."Still, there are things that everyone else can do to protect themselves. Avoid raw milk, which has not been pasteurized, the CDC advises. The temperatures required for pasteurization generally inactivate the virus, so pasteurized milk remains safe to drink, according to the agency.More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

As of May 31, cows in 68 dairy farms across 9 states have been confirmed positive for HPAI, and three human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection have been detected in persons with close contact to infected cows. Testing Guidance In an effort to enhance surveillance of influenza infections during this outbreak, CDC in coordination with STLT public health agencies, requests that commercial laboratories prospectively increase submissions to their jurisdictional PHL during the spring and summer months when influenza transmission is normally low. This guidance has been developed to ensure the efficient transfer of clinical specimens for additional subtyping testing. Commercial laboratories are encouraged to communicate with the PHL of the patient’s state of residence prior to submitting specimens to obtain the appropriate specimen submission form and any additional submission instructions. Specimens will be tested for surveillance purposes and patient specific reports may not be returned to the submitter. CDC requests commercial laboratories continue to send the following specimens to PHLs as soon as possible for further testing and characterization. Influenza A positive specimens that are subtype negative on tests designed to provide an influenza subtyping result (ex. Biofire) and confirmed upon retest. Influenza A positive specimens that are subtype influenza A(H1) and not influenza A(H1)pdm09 on tests designed to provide an influenza subtyping result and confirmed upon retest. For Awareness Performance characteristics for the CDC in vitro diagnostic reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) subtyping assays have been determined with the following human upper respiratory specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture: nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS] nasal swabs [NS] throat swabs [TS] nasal aspirates [NA] nasal washes [NW] dual nasopharyngealhroat swabs [NPS/TS] Performance characteristics for the CDC in vitro diagnostic reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) subtyping assays have been determined with the following human lower respiratory tract specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection: bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] bronchial wash [BW] tracheal aspirate [TA] sputum and lung tissue Enhanced Surveillance Submissions of additional influenza A and B positive specimens that have not undergone influenza subtyping testing are greatly appreciated to ensure rapid detection of any human infections of A(H5N1). While submission of as many samples as possible is preferred for the summer months ahead, CDC (in collaboration with APHL) can help to determine an appropriate and feasible number of samples each month in order to prioritize available laboratory resources. Please consider submission of samples that meet the established assay cutoff of your testing method to identify positive samples. CDC will continue to work with commercial laboratories and APHL to determine a process by which samples will be submitted to state and local public health laboratories or national reference laboratories for additional subtype testing.

The antigenic drift/shift of IAV continually gives rise to new strains and subtypes, aiding IAV in circumventing previously established immunity. As a result, there has been substantial interest in developing a broadly protective IAV vaccine that induces, durable immunity against multiple IAVs. Previously, a polyanhydride nanoparticle-based vaccine or nanovaccine (IAV-nanovax) encapsulating H1N1 IAV antigens was reported, which induced pulmonary B and T cell immunity and resulted in cross-strain protection against IAV. A key feature of IAV-nanovax is its ability to easily incorporate diverse proteins/payloads, potentially increasing its ability to provide broad protection against IAV and/or other pathogens. Due to human susceptibility to both H1N1 and H3N2 IAV, several H3N2 nanovaccines were formulated herein with multiple IAV antigens to examine the “plug-and-play” nature of the polyanhydride nanovaccine platform and determine their ability to induce humoral and cellular immunity and broad-based protection similar to IAV-nanovax. The H3N2-based IAV nanovaccine formulations induced systemic and mucosal B cell responses which were associated with antigen-specific antibodies. Additionally, systemic and lung-tissue resident CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were enhanced post-vaccination. These immune responses corresponded with protection against both homologous and heterosubtypic IAV infection. Overall, these results demonstrate the plug-and-play nature of the polyanhydride nanovaccine platform and its ability to generate immunity and protection against IAV utilizing diverse antigenic payloads.

To date, vaccines have been the most effective measure to prevent and reduce the severity of IAV infection, and have substantially lowered the economic burden of IAV3. While these vaccination efforts have led to reduced IAV-associated morbidity and mortality overall, immunity and protection provided by current IAV vaccines is largely derived from systemic immunity in the form of anti-hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibody responses that are predominantly strain matched4,5. Moreover, current IAV vaccines generate little to no de novo T cell responses within the lower-lung mucosa6,7. This local, lung-tissue resident immunity is poised for rapid responses to infection and is known to be critical for heterosubtypic protection8,9,10. Thus, while effective, the current vaccines do not generate multi-faceted immunity and broad protection against IAV, resulting in suboptimal protection against heterosubtypic, cross-group IAV infection11,12.To combat the diverse repertoire of potential IAVs, a comprehensive IAV vaccine that drives both humoral and cellular immunity, and thus has the ability to overcome the genetic drift/shift of IAV, and could afford long-lasting, supra-seasonal protection against multiple IAV strains would be preferred13,14. Further, the current IAV vaccine production pipeline has an extended time lapse (6–9 months) in between when the vaccine strain for a given season is chosen and when the vaccine is available15. Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic have reinforced the issues that may arise during an IAV pandemic which include vaccine production time and storage, vaccine protection against variant strains, and the importance of vaccine-induced mucosal immunity. Efforts to develop broadly protective IAV vaccines have utilized various platforms that include but are not limited to recombinant protein-based16, virus-like particle17, mRNA18,19, and polymeric nanovaccines19,20,21. Our own laboratory has previously reported on a novel, intranasally administered polyanhydride [copolymers of 1,8-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxoctane (CPTEG) and 1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane (CPH)] nanovaccine platform, known as IAV-nanovax, that generates systemic and mucosal T and B cell immunity and cross-strain protection against IAVs22,23,24. Moreover, this nanovaccine platform can be quickly produced and stored at ambient temperatures for prolonged periods of time, mitigating logistical problems that arise with current IAV vaccines22,25.Our previous report demonstrated the efficacy of 20:80 CPTEG:CPH particles encapsulating IAV antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) from an H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) and adjuvanted with CpG24. However, the immunity generated by nanovaccines encapsulating other IAV proteins and proteins from other IAV strains (e.g., H3N2) has not yet been determined. Interestingly, studies have suggested that targeting IAV proteins in addition to HA such as neuraminidase (NA), NP, and matrix protein (M1) may improve upon current vaccines26,27,28,29. Therefore, to evaluate the breadth and applicability of our polyanhydride nanovaccine platform, we investigated how several H3N2-nanovaccines incorporating combinations of IAV H3N2 proteins (i.e., HA, NA, NP, and M1) contribute to the generation of IAV-specific immunity and protection.In this work, we demonstrate the efficacy of an intranasally (i.n.) administered, 20:80 CPTEG:CPH nanovaccine encapsulating CpG 1668 adjuvant and three combinations of proteins from IAV H3N2 (A/Hong Kong/1/1968) and (A/Aichi/2/1968): H3-nanovax (HA/NP), which is analogous to the IAV protein content of H1-nanovax (HA/NP), H3-nanovax (NA/NP), and H3-nanovax (NA/M1). Our results show that i.n. administration of these H3-nanovax formulations generated immunity in the form of systemic and mucosal B cell responses that were associated with IAV-specific IgG and IgA. Further, these vaccines generated both systemic and lung-tissue resident effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and induced protection against homologous and heterosubtypic IAV challenges. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the polyanhydride nanovaccine platform possesses the capacity to “plug-and-play” new protein payloads from different strains of IAV to generate systemic and mucosal immunity as well as provide cross-strain protection against homologous and heterosubtypic IAV infection.ResultsIAV-nanovax particle characterizationVariations in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, such as size, shape, and interactions with their antigen payload can directly impact vaccine efficacy30,31. As such, we first characterized the morphology and size distribution of our H3-nanovax formulations. All three H3-nanovax formulations were found to be relatively spherical in morphology and partially aggregated, consistent with previous work32 (Fig. 1a–c). Analysis of representative scanning electron micrographs indicated that all three formulations had similar size distributions, with average diameters of 181 ± 61 nm (HA/NP), 173 ± 49 nm (NA/NP), and 171 ± 52 nm (NA/M1) (Fig. 1d). Additionally, the antigen encapsulation efficiency of each H3-nanovax formulation was determined by incubating the particles in 40 mM sodium hydroxide to rapidly degrade the polymer and release the encapsulated proteins. The released proteins were then quantified via a micro bicinchoninic acid assay. The antigen encapsulation efficiency of each H3-nanovax formulation was found to be 27 ± 2% (HA/NP), 24 ± 4% (NA/NP), and 9 ± 1% (NA/M1).Fig. 1: H3-nanovax particle characterization.Representative scanning electron micrographs of (a) H3-nanovax (HA/NP), (b) H3-nanovax (NA/NP), and (c) H3-nanovax (NA/M1). Scale bar represents 1 μm. d Size distribution of average particle diameter analyzing ~500 particles per image using ImageJ software.Full size imageAdditionally, we examined the integrity of the primary structure of the encapsulated proteins following their release from the nanoparticles relative to their original input unencapsulated counterparts. Similar to the input IAV proteins, the IAV proteins released from the nanoparticles were recognized by the appropriate antibodies specific for that IAV protein, and were observed to have a size consistent with their predicted molecular weights (HA: 71.3 kDa, NA: 76.8 kDa, NP: 54.4 kDa, and M1: 27.9 kDa) (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). These results are consistent previous observations for proteins released from polyanhydride nanoparticles22,33 and suggests that the IAV proteins encapsulated in H3-nanovax formulations maintain their structural integrity as antigens.H3-nanovax formulations encapsulating IAV proteins induce lung and lymph node resident GC B cells and viral protein targeted antibodyB cell responses, particularly in the form of class-switched germinal center (GC) B cells producing high-affinity antibodies targeted against IAV proteins, have been shown to be crucial for optimal control and protection against subsequent IAV infection34,35. Therefore, we first analyzed total B cell responses following i.n. vaccination wherein mice received a prime + boost (spaced 14 days apart) regimen of 500 µg H3-nanovax encapsulating one of three protein payload combinations (e.g. HA/NP, NA/M1, or NA/NP) + CpG or received no vaccine (naïve). At 45 or 50 days after the initial vaccination, mice were administered fluorophore conjugated anti-CD45.2 mAb intravascularly (i.v.) 3 min prior to euthanasia to allow for discrimination between circulating (i.e., CD45ivAb+) and tissue protected (i.e., CD45ivAb-) cell populations36 (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Following harvest of lung and lung-draining lymph nodes (dLN), we observed an increase in total B cells present in the lungs for all three H3 based nanovaccines relative to naïve mice (Fig. 2a, c). Consistent with this increase in total B cells following vaccination, lung-tissue resident Fas+ B cells (CD45i.vAb-CD19+Fas+) were also increased for all three vaccine groups (Fig. 2b, d). As lung-tissue resident B cells have been associated with both germinal center (GC) B cells and lung tissue-resident B cells (BRM) we next examined whether the H3-nanovax formulations induced GC and BRM cells. Germinal center B cells (CD45i.vAb-CD19+Fas+GL-7+) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c) from vaccinated mice were increased in both the lungs (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c) and lung-draining dLN (Supplementary Fig. 4: CD45i.vAb-CD19+Fas+GL7+) relative to their naïve counterparts for the H3-nanovax HA/NP and NA/NP groups. In contrast germinal center B cells were increased for H3-nanovax NA/M1 only in the dLN. As recent reports have detailed the importance of lung tissue-resident memory B cells (BRM) in contributing to early plasmablast responses as well as protection during subsequent IAV infections37,38, we next examined if H3-nanovax induced BRM. Forty-five days post vaccination, we observed an increase in BRM (CD45i.vAb-CD19+ Fas+GL7-CD38+CD69+IgM-CXCR3+) (Supplementary Fig. 3b, d) in the lungs for the HA/NP and NA/NP H3-nanovax formulations which mirrored the increase seen in GC B cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c). Consistent with our previously reported findings24,39, the presence of the IAV protein payload was necessary to increase GC and BRM B cell populations after H3-nanovax vaccination, as we did not observe significant increases in these populations when a control CpG-only nanovax (i.e. no IAV protein payload) was used (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).Fig. 2: H3-nanovax encapsulating IAV proteins induce lung-resident B cell responses.C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated i.n. with 500 μg of H3-nanovax encapsulating CpG + either HA/NP (Pink), NA/NP (Blue), NA/M1 (Purple), or left unvaccinated (naïve). Representative flow plots of total CD45i.v.Ab-CD19+ B cells (a) and Fas+ (CD45i.vAb-CD19+Fas+) B cells (b) within the lungs. At 45 days post-vaccination, lung-resident (i.e., CD45i.v.Ab-) B cells (c) and Fas+ B cells (d) were enumerated. Error bars, mean ± s.e.m. Data representative of two (c, d; M1/NA: n = 3–4 mice/group) or three (c, d); Naïve, HA/NP, and (NA/NP: n = 4–5 mice/group) independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).Full size imageConsistent with these findings, while all three H3-nanovax vaccinated groups generated total H3N2 IAV virion-specific IgG (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), total H3N2 IAV virion-specific serum and BAL IgG were significantly increased versus the other vaccine groups in mice that received H3-nanovax (NA/NP), whereas H3-nanovax (HA/NP) was elevated relative to naïve mice in both serum and BAL, and H3-nanovax (NA/M1) only showing increases relative to naïve mice in serum IgG (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Further this result is consistent with the reduced lung GC response observed after vaccination with H3-nanovax (NA/M1) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c). As IgA production is also important for protection against IAV40,41 we next quantified total H3N2 IAV virion-specific IgA levels in the BAL42. The total IAV-specific IgA in the BAL demonstrated a pattern similar to serum IgG. H3-nanovax (NA/NP) induced a significant increase in IgA when compared to naïve mice. The H3-nanovax (HA/NP) and (NA/M1) vaccines also showed higher responses than naïve mice, albeit not significantly (Supplementary Fig. 6c).These variations in total IAV-specific antibody production may be linked to responses directed towards the individual viral proteins within each vaccine formulation as well as related to the proteins’ relative abundance and/or exposure on virus particles (intact or broken) used as the target for the assay and thus could underrepresent the level of anti-IAV specific antibody present. Therefore, we next measured antibody responses using targeted assays against the individual viral proteins (HA, NA, NP, and M1) encapsulated within the nanoparticles as studies have suggested antibody against HA, NA, NP, and M1 can confer protection26,42,43,44. Therefore, to first determine the level of anti-NP antibody induced, we quantified NP-specific IgG and IgA antibody via ELISA utilizing NP from A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) (Fig. 3a–c) as the antigen target. As expected, the serum and BAL samples from naïve mice and those administered with H3-nanovax (NA/M1) did not exhibit elevated levels of anti-NP antibody. However, significant increases in anti-NP IgG were observed in the serum (Fig. 3a) for both H3-nanovax formulations that encapsulated NP (H3-nanovax (HA/NP) and H3-nanovax (NA/NP)). Similarly, when we measured anti-NP IgG in BAL samples, significant increases were observed for both NP encapsulating vaccines (Fig. 3b; H3-nanovax (HA/NP) and H3-nanovax (NA/NP)). Examination of lung-local IgA production against NP (Fig. 3c) also showed increased NP-specific IgA for those H3-nanovax formulations that encapsulated NP (H3-nanovax (HA/NP) and H3-nanovax (NA/NP)), but only H3-nanovax (HA/NP) was significantly increased. No reactivity was observed when a His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit protein was used as a target for the ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 7) demonstrating that the reactivity observed in Fig. 3a–c is to IAV-NP rather than His-tag specific. Next, we examined the ability of H3-nanovax (NA/M1) to generate anti-M1 antibodies relative to the formulations not encapsulating M1. As with NP, we quantified serum anti-M1 IgG and BAL anti-M1 IgG and IgA. While H3-nanovax (NA/M1) demonstrated significant increases in serum IgG relative to non-M1 encapsulating formulations (Fig. 3d), we did not observe significant increases in anti-M1 IgG or IgA in the BAL (Fig. 3e, f), a result consistent with the reduced lung GC response observed after vaccination with H3-nanovax (NA/M1) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c).Fig. 3: H3-nanovax encapsulating IAV proteins induces payload targeted systemic and lung-local IAV-specific antibody responses.C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with H3-nanovax encapsulating CpG + either HA/NP (Pink), NA/NP (Blue), NA/M1 (Purple), or left unvaccinated (naïve). At 45 days post-vaccination, serum and BAL were collected and serum and BAL IgG (a, b, d, e) and BAL IgA (c, f) specific for NP (A/Hong Kong/1/68, H3N2) and M1 (A/Aichi/2/68, H3N2) were quantified via ELISA. As a measure of anti-HA specific antibody against IAV A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2), HAI titers in the serum and BAL were quantified (g, h). Shown is the 1:40 titer (dotted line) that is thought to be the threshold for a protective titer. LOD (dotted line) = Limit of Detection. Anti-NA antibody in serum and BAL (i, j) were quantified via fluorescence-based NAI. LOD (dotted line) = Limit of Detection; Error bars, mean ± s.e.m.

(g, h) ****P < 0.0001 (One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).Full size imageWe next measured antibody responses targeted against the surface proteins of IAV. First, we quantified systemic and mucosal anti-HA antibody by performing hemagglutinin inhibition34 assays on serum and BAL from naïve and vaccinated mice. As expected, H3-nanovax encapsulating HA demonstrated an HAI titer exceeding the protective threshold of 1:4045 while naïve and mice vaccinated with H3-nanovax formulations lacking HA (i.e., NA/M1 and NA/NP) did not produce any anti-HA antibody above the limit of detection (LOD) (Fig. 3g, h). When we next quantified serum and BAL anti-NA antibody via neuraminidase inhibition46 assays expressed as IC50 and IC25 titers for serum and BAL respectively, we observed that samples from mice administered H3-nanovax formulations encapsulating NA (i.e., NA/M1 and NA/NP) inhibited NA-activity at levels well above the limit of detection (LOD) while samples from naïve mice and mice receiving H3-nanovax lacking NA (i.e., HA/NP) displayed no significant antibody mediated NA-inhibition above the LOD (Fig. 3i, j). Although anti-NA activity with H3-nanovax formulations encapsulating NA (i.e., NA/M1 and NA/NP) exhibited ~40–45% inhibition of NA activity for BAL samples it did not reach 50% therefore the data is displayed as an IC25 to reflect the activity observed.Interestingly, the observation that H3-nanovax (NA/M1) formulation, despite similar levels of anti-NA antibody in the BAL, had reduced GC B cell and total BAL antibody-based immunity (Supplementary Fig. 3) when compared to the H3-nanovax (NA/NP) formulation could suggest that responses to the individual protein payloads within the nanovaccine may be independent and/or in this case could relate to the reduced encapsulation efficiency of the H3-nanovax (NA/M1) formulation. However, altogether these results suggest that all formulations of H3-nanovax induce strong B cell responses in the lungs (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3) and dLN (Supplementary Fig. 4) and produce antibodies specific and selective to the IAV proteins individually encapsulated within the nanoparticles (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the data presented in Supplementary Fig. 6 (intact virions) and Fig. 3 are consistent with the finding that the protein payloads released from the nanoparticle are structurally intact, immunogenic and induce antibody responses against the corresponding IAV proteins produced during IAV infections.H3-nanovax formulations promote lung and lymph-node resident T cell responsesCD4 T cell help is important for the production of high-affinity class-switched antibodies generated in GCs as well as modulating the immune response to promote effective clearance of IAV42,47. CD8 T cells contribute to protection against IAV by eliminating infected cells via their cytotoxic capabilities, and CD8 T cells in the form of lung tissue-resident memory (TRM) are especially important to protection as they are poised for rapid responses against subsequent IAV exposures via their positioning, sensing, and alarm functions48,49. Together these CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lung mucosa are thought to be important for broad-based protection against heterosubtypic IAVs and the induction of these responses serve as an important component of our mucosal vaccine design8,48,50,51. To evaluate the capacity of H3-nanovax formulations to induce vaccine-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the lungs and lung draining lymph nodes, mice were administered a prime + boost vaccination as described above, and tissues were collected 45 or 50 days after the primary immunization. To measure this T cell response, we initially made use of a well validated surrogate marker-based approach that has proven useful in mice and humans that is based upon expression levels of CD8a and CD11a, or CD49d and CD11a, to track antigen-experienced (Ag. Expd) CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively24,52,53,54,55,56. This technique offers several advantages in that it provides a snapshot of the full T cell response against the pathogen/immunogen and is not biased by only examining the immunodominant or predicted epitopes from individual proteins from a specific virus strain, and does not require prior knowledge of all T cell epitopes or epitope density for a given pathogen. We observed that all three nanovaccine formulations generated significant numbers of antigen-experienced CD4 T cells (Ag. Expd CD4; CD4+CD11ahiCD49d+) in the lungs relative to naïve mice (Fig. 4a, d). These antigen-experienced CD4 T cells expressed markers used to classically define canonical lung TRM (CD69+CD103-, red box)51,57 (Fig. 4c, f, red box) as well as an additional lung-tissue resident population of CD4 memory T cells (CD69+CD103+, Fig. 4c, blue box), a subset which has been suggested to possess cytotoxic capabilities in other studies (Fig. 4c, g)47,58. Both subsets aside from CD69+CD103+ cells CD4 memory T cells in the H3-nanovax (NA/M1) were significantly increased in mice vaccinated with H3-nanovax formulations relative to naïve counterparts. Similarly, the antigen-experienced (Ag. Expd CD8; CD11ahiCD44+) CD8 T cell response against all three H3-nanovax formulations was also increased in the lungs compared to naïve mice (Fig. 4h, j). This increase was observed in two populations of tissue-resident cells expressing markers associated with tissue resident memory. The first CD8 TRM (CD69+CD103+) (Fig. 4i, l, red box) exhibited a uniform lung TRM signature classically associated with TRM [low Eomesodermin (Eomes), high CD49a, high CXCR3, and low CX3CR1] (Supplementary Fig. 8). The other (i.e. CD69+CD103- cells) (Fig. 4i, m, blue box) expressed some of these markers and may contain some CD8 TRM, however this population was more heterogenous in Eomes, CD49a, CXCR3, and CX3CR1 expression compared to their CD69+CD103+ counterparts, suggesting it could be a transitional population (Supplementary Fig. 8)50,59,60. Similar to our B cell findings and consistent with our prior reports24,39, the presence of the IAV protein payload was necessary to significantly increase these CD4 and CD8 T cell populations after H3-nanovax vaccination, as we did not observe significant increases in these populations when a control CpG-only nanovax (i.e., no IAV protein payload) was used (Supplementary Fig. 5c–h).Fig. 4: Vaccination with H3-nanovax encapsulating IAV proteins induces robust lung-resident T cell responses.C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with H3-nanovax encapsulating CpG + either HA/NP (Pink), NA/NP (Blue), NA/M1 (Purple), or left unvaccinated (naïve). Representative flow plots and enumeration of lung and airway resident antigen-experienced CD4 (a–g) and CD8 T cells (h–m). At 45 days post-vaccination, the total number of lung (CD11ahiCD44+) (d, j) and airway (CD11aloCD44+) (e, k) resident antigen-experienced CD4 (CD45i.vAb-CD4+CD49d+) and CD8 (CD45i.vAb-CD8α+CD44+) T cells were enumerated. TRM within the lung resident, antigen-experienced CD4 and CD8 T cells were further characterized based on expression of CD69 and CD103(CD69-CD103+ CD4): (c) (red box), (f); CD69+CD103+ CD4: (c) (blue box), (g); CD69+CD103+ CD8: (i) (red box), (l); CD69+CD103- CD8: (i) (blue box), m Error bars, mean ± s.e.m. Data representative of two (a–m; M1/NA: n = 3–4 mice/group) or three (a–m; Naïve, HA/NP, and NA/NP: n = 4–5 mice/group) independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 (One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).Full size imageIn addition to T cells in the lung parenchyma, airway-resident T cells contribute to protection against IAV via airway surveillance and cytokine production51,61,62. As past studies have shown that T cells downregulate CD11a following entry into the airways, we therefore utilized the change in CD11a expression to enumerate CD11aloCD44+ T cells that may be airway-resident T cells61,63 (CD45i.vAb-CD11aloCD44+ T cells: CD4+ or CD8+). Similar to T cells in the parenchyma, we observed significant increases for both antigen experienced CD11aloCD44+ CD4 (Fig. 4b, e) and CD8 (h, k) T cells following all vaccination regimens. While the CD11aloCD44+ methodology may not capture all airway-resident cells as newly arriving T cell may not have downregulated CD11a yet, altogether our results suggest that all three H3-nanovax formulations induce both airway and lung interstitial CD4 and CD8 T cells. Analogous increases in antigen-experienced CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were also observed in the dLN of vaccinated mice, demonstrating the vaccine’s ability to drive systemic T cell responses (Supplementary Fig. 9).To further quantify the T cell response at a specific defined epitope level, we next utilized tetramers specific for H3N2 defined NP366-374 and M1128-135 epitopes in C57BL/6 mice. Our results demonstrate that the H3-nanaovax formulations containing NP (e.g., HA/NP and NA/NP) induces CD8 T cells against NP366 whereas those lacking NP (e.g., NA/M1 and CpG only) do not (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). Similarly, only the formulation containing M1 induced CD8 T cells against the M1128 epitope (Supplementary Fig. 10d, e). Interestingly, despite inducing similar levels of total Ag. Expd CD8 T cells (Fig. 4) we observed that there were reduced numbers of both antigen-experienced and lung-resident memory TRM CD8 T cells specific for NP366 in the lungs of mice vaccinated with H3-nanovax (HA/NP) relative to H3-nanovax (NA/NP) (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). This difference was not observed in the draining lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Altogether, these results demonstrate that all three of the H3-nanovax formulations are capable of inducing antigen-experienced memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the lungs, airways, and dLN as well as drive the induction of TRM in the lungs i.e., cell populations which are known to be important for protection against heterosubtypic IAV infection8,43,48, but that for T cells specific for any single virus epitope there could be, depending on the vaccine formulation utilized, some differential accumulation/localization of the T cells.H3-nanovax formulations provide protection against homologous and heterosubtypic IAV infectionsOur previous results demonstrated that H3-nanovax HA/NP, NA/M1, or NA/NP are all capable of generating systemic and local (i.e., lungs/airways) immunity following vaccination compared to naïve counterparts (Figs. 2–4). This includes the expansion of GC B cells, generation of IAV antigen-specific IgG and IgA, and the induction of antigen-experienced and lung- and airway-resident T cells and TRM. Not surprisingly, the focus of this immunity was targeted to the antigens found within the H3-nanovax formulations (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, we next determined whether such immunity translated to reduction in IAV-associated morbidity and mortality following lethal dose homologous and heterosubtypic IAV challenge. To this end, 45 days following the initial vaccination with our three H3-nanovax formulations, naïve and vaccinated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous IAV (A/Hong Kong/1/68, H3N2) and mortality and morbidity (i.e., weight loss, lung-airway resistance (Penh)) were monitored daily. Following homologous IAV challenge, naïve and vaccinated mice from all three H3-nanovax groups had similar morbidity as demonstrated by limited weight loss and airway resistance at early timepoints (Fig. 5a, b). However, by 7 days post-challenge, naïve mice demonstrated increased morbidity in contrast to vaccinated mice, who began to regain body weight and showed significantly less respiratory distress. Further, while >40% of naïve mice succumbed to this lethal dose challenge, all three groups of vaccinated mice recovered and demonstrated 100% survival against homologous IAV challenge (Fig. 5c). While antibody can be sufficient to mediate protection against homologous IAV, our nanovaccines also generated T cell responses (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 9–10). Since T cells are known to help confer protection against heterosubtypic IAV, we therefore examined whether our three H3-nanovax formulations could confer protection against a highly stringent, lethal dose heterosubtypic H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) challenge. Importantly, all three H3-nanovax formulations demonstrated protection. The H3-nanovax (HA/NP) and (NA/NP) groups showed the greatest level of protection post-heterosubtypic challenge (Fig. 5f) with the H3-nanovax (NA/M1) mice conferring protection albeit to a lesser extent compared to the other vaccinated groups. Similar protection was observed when examining morbidity. While mice vaccinated with H3-nanovax (HA/NP) exhibited the most pronounced reduction in morbidity (days 6–9 weight loss, days 4–6 lung function) compared to the other groups (Fig. 5d, e), both the H3-nanovax (NA/NP) and (NA/M1) mice also showed reduced weight loss (NA/NP days 9–10); NA/M1 days 9–10 and improved lung function (NA/NP days 4–6; NA/M1 days 4–6) vs. naïve mice. To examine whether this reduction in morbidity and mortality and associated immunity corresponded with a reduced viral load in the lungs, we next quantified viral titers post challenge with homologous or heterosubtypic IAV. To this end, mice were vaccinated with the H3-nanovax formulations or left naïve as a control and on day 32 post vaccination challenged with either a 390 TCIU of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2, homologous) or 1108 TCIU A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1, heterosubtypic) dose of IAV. Three days following IAV challenge, lungs were homogenized, and viral titers were assessed via TCID50. Consistent with our observed HAI results (Fig. 3) and the known role of antibody to HA in reducing viral infection and protecting against matched virus strains by providing sterilizing immunity in some cases by blocking HA binding to sialic acids and entry of the virus into cells, H3-nanovax (HA/NP) vaccinated mice challenged with homologous H3N2 challenge displayed reduced viral titers relative to naive mice (Fig. 6a). Similarly, mice vaccinated with the NA/NP and NA/M1 H3-nanovax formulations demonstrated a substantial reduction (greater than a 1 log reduction) in virus, a result that would be consistent with the observed antibody, B cell and T cell immune responses (Figs. 2–4, Supplementary Figs. 3, 4, 6, 9, 10) and the known role for non-neutralizing Ab (e.g., Ab targeting NA, NP, M1) (Figs. 2, 3, Supplementary Figs. 3, 4, 6) and CD4 and CD8 T cells (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 9, 10) in providing protection after the virus enters the first cell (Fig. 5)43,64. Importantly, we observed a similar significant reduction in pulmonary virus titers in the lungs of mice from all three H3-nanovax groups that were challenged with heterosubtypic viruses, a result consistent with the observed immunity generated by the three H3-nanovax formulations and the known role for non-neutralizing Ab, CD4 and CD8 T cells, and local tissue-resident immunity in protection against heterosubtypic IAV infections. Together, these data suggest that all three H3-nanovax formulations generate systemic and mucosal immunity that is associated with reduced viral titers and protection against lethal homologous and heterosubtypic IAV challenge.Fig. 5: H3-nanovax formulations provide protection against homologous and heterologous IAV infection.C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with H3-nanovax encapsulating CpG + either HA/NP (Pink), NA/NP (Blue), NA/M1 (Purple), or left unvaccinated (naïve). At 45 days post vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous (a–c) A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) or heterologous (d–f) A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). Subsequently, morbidity (i.e., weight loss (a, d), lung-airway resistance (Penh) (b, e)) and mortality (c, f) were monitored daily. Error bars, mean ± s.e.m.

Herein, we have demonstrated the “plug-and-play” capability of the polyanhydride nanovaccine platform by developing H3-nanovax formulations containing various combinations of H3N2 IAV antigens (HA, NA, NP, and M1). These formulations were capable of inducing systemic and mucosal B and T cell immunity as well as protect against both homologous and heterosubtypic IAV infections, similar to previous reports on H1N1 IAV-nanovax and the same nanovaccine nanoparticle backbone utilized in the context of RSV24,39.Regarding the H3-nanovax formulations tested herein, the specific proteins utilized were chosen based on their importance to infection/viral replication as well as the known contributions of protective immunity against them26,27,43. HA was chosen as it has traditionally been targeted by IAV vaccines due to its critical role in the initial cellular entry of the virus during infection and the fact that neutralizing antibodies against the variable region of HA can limit cellular entry of IAV and thus provide sterilizing immunity to matched IAV strains18,66,67. Additionally, it is the only IAV protein antigen whose content is regulated in the currently licensed IAV vaccines68. As studies have suggested that existing levels of anti-NA antibody may be a better predictor of protection in humans compared to anti-HA and may contribute to protection and lower disease severity by restricting the release of newly synthesized influenza virions from cells69,70,71, we also targeted NA for two of our H3-nanovax formulations (H3-nanovax NA/NP and H3-nanovax NA/M1). The internal IAV proteins NP and M1 that were encapsulated in our H3-nanovax formulations were chosen based on their increased conservation among IAV strains as well as their ability to induce T cell immunity and protective antibody responses. NP is abundantly expressed during infection and protective T cell epitopes are found in mice and humans, including an IAV NP epitope shown to induce CD8 T cells that can cross-react against IAV and IBV in HLA-B37 individuals72. Moreover, non-neutralizing anti-NP antibodies promote recovery and lower viral titers following IAV infection via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as well as associate with viral proteins/virions to form immune complexes targeted by dendritic cells leading to increased antigen presentation and T cell immunity43,64,73. Reports suggest that antibody against M1 may also induce NK cell mediated ADCC44 and therein contribute to protection. Further, studies on the sequence of IAV M1 show this protein exhibits 95% amino acid sequence identity among strains circulating in humans and has also been identified as a conserved immunodominant CTL epitope in HLA-A2 and HLA-C*08 individuals74,75,76,77. Similarly, CD4 T cell epitopes in M1 and NP have been described for DRB1*0101 individuals77. Natural IAV infection induces B and T cell immunity against a number of viral proteins suggesting that the gold standard for broad-based vaccines that induce long-lived protection would be to mimic the diverse repertoire of immunity generated by natural infection without the associated morbidity and mortality, therein creating an environment that makes it harder for variant viruses to escape protection. Given that specific immunity targeted against each IAV antigen can have unique contributions to protection against IAV and our data demonstrating, as expected, that immunity generated by the H3-nanovax was specific to the included IAV protein payloads (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 10), future iterations of IAV-nanovax containing multiple (3 + ) viral antigens from one or multiple virus strains (i.e., H1N1 and H3N2) could further broaden immunity leading to even greater protection against circulating seasonal, pandemic, and pre-pandemic IAV strains.Among the H3-nanovax formulations tested, we observed that all three induced significant B cell responses in the lung/dLN (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 3, 4) and found IAV-specific (i.e., virion targeted) systemic (IgG) as well as mucosal (IgG and IgA) antibodies (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). Further examination of the anti-IAV antibody response demonstrated that specificity of the antibodies generated matched the viral proteins within the respective formulation’s payload (Fig. 3). Indeed, antibody against each specific antigen was increased after IAV-nanovax vaccination to levels greater than observed in naïve mice; HAI titers were above the protective 1:40 threshold45 for H3-nanovax encapsulating HA (i.e., H3-nanovax HA/NP), anti-NA Ab levels were increased after vaccination with nanoparticles encapsulating NA (i.e., H3-nanovax NA/NP, H3-nanovax NA/M1) as shown via NAI, anti-M1 IgG was increased in the serum of H3-nanovax (NA/M1) mice, and systemic anti-NP IgG and lung-local anti-NP IgG and IgA were increased by NP encapsulating nanoparticles (i.e., H3-nanovax HA/NP, H3-nanovax NA/NP). It should be noted however that H3-nanovax (NA/NP) drove the highest total (i.e., total virion) IAV-specific IgG response (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Further, the induction of these protein specific responses together with our analysis of the protein payloads liberated from the nanovaccines suggest, as we have previously observed, that there is minimal impact on the integrity and antigenicity of the encapsulated proteins as they generate virus specific antibodies capable of recognizing intact IAV virions, the source IAV proteins22,33, and inhibiting the effector functions of HA and NA (Fig. 3g–j).Herein we report the ability of the IAV nanovaccine platform to induce lung BRM responses (Supplementary Fig. 3b, d), which studies have suggested are important for early plasmablast responses as well as protection against subsequent IAV challenge37,38,78. Importantly these BRM cells are CXCR3+ which during subsequent infections allows them to be rapidly recruited to infected regions to allow localized antibody secretion37,38,78. Further H3-nanovax’s design allows for long-term local antigen depots22,79. This aspect of the vaccine may be critical in BRM induction as prior studies have shown that local antigen encounter is necessary for BRM formation after IAV infection37. Altogether, the ability of H3-nanovax to induce local GC B cells, BRM, and IgG/IgA antibodies in addition to systemic immune responses suggest that it may provide enhanced antibody mediated protection compared to currently approved IAV vaccines.Despite the inclusion of differing IAV protein payloads, all three formulations of H3-nanovax induced lung parenchyma and CD11aloCD44+ (i.e. airway-resident) CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, including TRM, that were of statistically equivalent magnitude. Interestingly, in addition to classical TRM, we observed and enumerated CD4 T cells that were CD69+ and CD103+ (Fig. 4c, g). It has been suggested that CD4 T cells co-expressing CD69 and CD103 in the lungs may be cytotoxic CD4 T cells and can contribute to direct viral control following IAV infection through class II MHC-restricted killing58,80. Regarding the CD8 TRM populations, we observed that the CD69+CD103+ cells expressed a signature consistent with canonical lung CD8 TRM. However, as it has been noted that CD8 TRM in other tissues (i.e. small intestine and liver) may be CD103+/−59, we also examined the TRM signature of CD69+CD103- CD8 T cells in the lung following nanovaccine administration. We observed that while this population expressed many of the markers associated with CD8 TRM and may potentially contain CD8 TRM, the population was more heterogenous compared to the CD69+CD103+ cells, suggesting they may be a transitional population50,59,60. Specifically, it was observed that a substantial fraction of CD69+CD103- cells were also CD49a-, therein not expressing a marker whose expression has been described to be as associated with CD8 TRM cells81,82 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Importantly, for the first time, we show that in addition to lung parenchyma-based T cell responses, the IAV-nanovax platform induces CD11aloCD44+ CD4 and CD8 T cells, a cell phenotype that is associated with airway-resident cells. These tissue-resident T cell responses have been previously shown to confer and enhance protection against subsequent infections by rapidly producing IFNγ upon re-exposures61. The observed increases in both total antigen-experienced and TRM populations in the lung parenchyma and airways are promising considering the known protective role CD4 and CD8 TRM and airway T cells have during IAV infections, especially in the context of heterosubtypic IAV infections8,10,48,49,50,51. The presence of these T cells after i.n. vaccination with all three H3-nanovax formulations was consistent with the protection we observed against a highly stringent lethal dose heterosubtypic H1N1 viral challenge (Fig. 5d–f) a model where anti-HA and anti-NA effector function blocking antibodies would not be predicted to contribute to protection.The combined humoral and cellular immunity induced by our three formulations of H3-nanovax corresponded with protection against morbidity and mortality following homologous IAV H3N2 challenge (Fig. 5a–c). While vaccinated mice were protected, heterosubtypic H1N1 challenge revealed differences in the overall magnitude of protection between the three H3-nanovax formulations, with H3-nanovax (HA/NP) and H3-nanovax (NA/NP) vaccinated mice demonstrating the greatest reduction in mortality, with ~60+ % of mice surviving while >30% of H3-nanovax (NA/M1) vaccinated mice survived. In part this reduced level of protection observed with the H3-nanovax (NA/M1) may relate to the reduced GC B cell and BAL antibody-based immunity observed with this formulation, a result that could further highlight the importance of tissue-resident immunity to higher levels of protection. Alternatively, and/or in concert with these B cell/antibody changes, the differential protection of the three H3-nanovax formulations against heterosubtypic IAV, where antibodies against HA and NA would not be predicted to contribute to overall protection, may relate to the T cells generated against the antigens encapsulated in each H3-nanovax formulation. With regard to CD8 T cell responses against NP, NA, HA, and M1, the La Gruta group has characterized the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response on day 10 post H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 infection against NP366-374, NP36-43, NP55-63, NA181-190, HA402-409, HA389-399, HA41-49, HA308-316, M1181-190, and M1128-135. In that study the NP366-374 (~7.5%) and NP36-43 (~1%) were by far the largest individual epitope responses against these proteins with total combined CD8 T cell responses to M1 (~0.6% total), HA (~1.2% total) and NA (~0.55%) epitopes of much smaller magnitudes83. Similarly, when the CD4 T cell response against A/New Caledonia/20/1999 H1N1 virus was examined in C57Bl/10 (I-Ab) mice the NP specific CD4 T cells represented ~50% of the response, with T cells against NA representing the next largest subset and with responses to HA and M1 representing a minor portion. Therefore while we observed a similar magnitude of vaccine-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses after all three H3-nanovax vaccinations (Fig. 4), the differences in protection observed between H3-nanovax (NA/NP) and (HA/NP) vs. H3-nanovax (NA/M1) (Fig. 5) may relate to the relative abundance of total epitopes and/or conserved T cell epitopes found in the H3N2 proteins and the H1N1 challenge virus, with CD4 and CD8 epitopes in NP expected to be more prevalent in the C57Bl/6:A/PR/8 H1N1 challenge model utilized here. Of note, the C57Bl/6 NP366 epitope, which is an immunodominant epitope, in the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses, examined herein in Supplementary Fig. 10, differs by two amino acids (H3N2, ASNENMDAM; H1N1, ASNENMETM), suggesting that only a fraction of the NP366 T cells generated by the H3N2 NP protein may cross-react during the heterosubtypic IAV challenge. Further while total antigen-experienced and lung-tissue resident memory T cells are similar, our results suggest that NP366-specific T cells may localize to the lungs at an increased rate in the NA/NP vs HA/NP H3-nanovax group. This differential localization and lung-resident NP366 TRM numbers could contribute to the increased protection we observe with the H3-nanovax NA/NP group after H1N1 virus challenge (Fig. 5). In contrast the M1128 epitope, which is known to generate a much smaller T cell response, consistent with our findings in Supplementary Fig. 10, is conserved between the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses in C57Bl/6 mice. Despite these differences in the degree of protection, all three H3-nanovax formulations did confer protection against the high dose lethal H1N1 heterosubtypic challenge suggesting a role for protective T cells in reducing viral titers and disease following heterosubtypic IAV challenge (Fig. 6b). Further, given this protection and the fact that we have observed protection against heterosubtypic infections in outbred mice (i.e., a model with diverse MHC haplotypes) with our H1-nanovax24, it would be expected that the three H3-nanovax formulations either alone or administered in combination may generate the multi-focused T cell response that is necessary to provide broad-based protection of outbred populations against heterosubtypic IAV viruses. Such T cell mediated immunity along with non-neutralizing antibodies against NP and M1 could provide protection even in the face of challenges with highly pathogenic heterosubtypic IAV strains.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that H3-nanovax (HA/NP), (NA/NP), and (NA/M1) induce humoral and cellular immune responses both systemically and in the lung mucosa/airways; these include lung GC B cells and BRM associated with systemic and local whole virion and protein-specific IgG and IgA. The H3-nanovaccines also generated systemic and mucosal airway and lung parenchyma antigen-experienced CD4 and CD8 T cells, including lung tissue-resident memory. Together the presence of these immune responses corresponded with protection against both lethal homologous and heterosubtypic IAV challenge. Moreover, combined with the flexibility and utility of the IAV-nanovax platform, H3-nanovax represents a significant advance in our understanding of how to confer optimal immunity and broad-based protection against multiple IAVs.MethodsIAV-nanovax synthesisMonomers based on 1,8-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxoctane (CPTEG) and 1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane (CPH) were synthesized as described previously84,85. Using these monomers, 20:80 CPTEG:CPH copolymer was synthesized using melt polycondensation for ~6 h, as described85. The final copolymer composition, purity, and molecular weight of the copolymer were characterized using 1H NMR (DXR 500, Bruker, Billerica, MA). Next, 20:80 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticles containing 2 wt.% CpG (ODN 1668, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) adjuvant as well as 1 wt.% H3N2 HA (Sino Biological, Beijing, China, Catalog # 40116-V08B) and 1 wt.% NP (Sino Biological, Catalog # 40207-V08B), 1 wt.% H3N2 NA (Sino Biological, Catalog # sino) and 1 wt.% NP, or 1 wt.% NA and 1 wt.% H3N2 M1 (Sino Biological, Catalog # 40215-V07E) were synthesized via solid-oil-oil double emulsion86. All influenza virus proteins were purchased from Sino Biological. The HA (aa1-530-his tag; >95% purity, ~65 kDa) and NP (aa1-498-his tag; >90% purity, ~54.4 kDa) proteins were from baculovirus infected insect cells, the NA (aa36-469-his tag; >90% purity, ~76.8 kDa) was produced in HEK293 cells, and M1 (aa1-252-his tag; >85% purity, ~35 kDa) purified from E. coli. The HA had a reported ability to agglutinate guinea pig RBCs at a HA titer of 0.5–5 µg/mL for 1%RBCs. Briefly to synthesize the vaccine, the protein antigens were dialyzed to nanopure water and lyophilized overnight. The 20:80 CPTEG:CPH copolymer, along with the protein antigens and CpG, was dissolved at a polymer concentration of 20 mg/mL in methylene chloride. The solution was sonicated for 30 s and then precipitated into chilled pentane (at a methylene chloride:pentane ration of 1:250). The resulting nanoparticles were collected via vacuum filtration and scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 250, FEI, Hillsboro, OR) was used to characterized morphology and size. The average size distribution of each formulation was determined by analyzing ~500 particles of each scanning electron micrograph using ImageJ software (ImageJ 1.53t, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The antigen encapsulation efficiency of each H3-nanovax formulation was determined by incubating the particles in 40 mM sodium hydroxide to rapidly degrade the polymer and release the encapsulated proteins. The released proteins were then quantified via a micro bicinchoninic acid assay (microBCA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).Primary structural analysis of IAV proteins released from polyanhydride nanoparticlesEncapsulated proteins were released by resuspension of the particles in 300–400 μL of PBS and incubation at 37 °C overnight. Suspensions were then pelleted, and supernatant was collected and quantified for protein content via micro-bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Subsequently, to confirm the integrity of the primary structure of the encapsulated protein, released samples were analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). To this end, liberated proteins from the three H3-nanovax formulations, purified HA, NA, NP, or M1 protein (source: original input Sino proteins), ECL DualVueTM Western Blotting Ladder (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA), and/or precision Plus Dual Protein Standard (Biorad Laboratories) were individually combined with 4 x LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) and ddH20 to a volume of 30 μL. Each sample was loaded into individual wells of a Novex 4–20% Tris-Glycine Plus WedgeWellTM Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Electrophoresis was performed for 30–40 min at 125 V at 4 °C in MOPS SDS buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in a mini blot module (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C at 20 V for 1 h. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 1 h, washed, and incubated with primary antibody (anti-HA: Sino Catalog #86001-RM01; anti-NA (N2): Sino, Catalog #40040-MM02; anti-NP: Invitrogen, Catalog #MA5-42364; anti-M1: Invitrogen, Catalog #PA5-32253) against their respective protein overnight at 4 °C. Following, membranes were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ECL DualVueTM Western Blotting Marker S-Protein-HRP for 1 h, washed, and the western was developed with an ECL substrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for 5–10 min. Images were obtained on a ChemiDoc MP Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Western blot images were analyzed in Microsoft Powerpoint (Redmond, WA) where blot photos were cropped and corrected using sliders for sharpness, brightness, and saturation.Mice, vaccination, and influenza virus infectionsWild type female C57BL/6 mice were bred, housed, and maintained in the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA) animal care facilities. All procedures were performed on matched mice, were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Iowa and comply with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 8–12 week-old 20–22 g mice were randomly assigned into groups for each experiment. Prior to i.n IAV-nanovax vaccinations and IAV infections, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. For each IAV-nanovax i.n. administration, mice received 500 μg of one of three formulations of H3-nanovax (containing a total of 10 μg) CpG1668 and 5 μg of each IAV protein; (i.e., HA + NP, NA + NP, or NA + M1) in 50 μL of PBS. Mice were subsequently boosted, receiving a second i.n. dose of the respective H3-nanovax formulation 14 days after the initial priming. As a control, groups of mice were administered nanoparticles containing CpG without the IAV proteins (i.e., CpG only). For IAV challenge, mice were infected i.n. with a 1108 TCIU dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) or a 390 TCIU dose of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) in 50 μL Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium. Following IAV infection, body weight, airway restriction (Penh), and survival were monitored daily for 14 days. Penh was measured using unrestrained whole-body plethysmography (Buxco Electronics, Wilmington, NC) recording volume and pressure changes over 5 min. Mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation upon reaching ≤ 70% of their starting weight.50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) assay for viral titersBriefly, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 50 µg/mL gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were added to the wells of a 96-well plate. Subsequently, homogenized lung samples were added to the top well in triplicate at a 1:10 dilution and serially diluted at 1:10. 100 µL 2.5 × 105 Maden-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were then added to the wells and incubated overnight in a humidified, 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Following overnight incubation, the DMEM from the wells was discarded and 200 µL of antibiotic containing DMEM + 0.0002% trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for a further 3 days. On day 5 following initial sample addition, each well then received 50 µL of 0.5% chicken RBC suspension (Rockland Immunochemicals, Philadelphia, PA) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h after which agglutination patterns were recorded and the TCID50 was calculated for each group.Intravascular staining to determine cellular localizationTo discriminate between circulating and tissue-resident cell populations, mice were administered 1 μg of fluorophore-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45.2 (clone 104; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) in 200 μL of PBS by retroorbital intravenous injection 3 min prior to harvest as previously described36.Serum, bronchial alveolar lavage, and cell isolationPrior to euthanasia, blood was collected in non-heparinized capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific) for serum collection. Blood samples were left at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and then collected and stored at −20 °C until analysis.Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected using a protocol modified from87. Briefly, the tracheae were cannulated with a 22-gage catheter tube (attached to a 5cc syringe) and then washed once with 1 mL of sterile PBS. Samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis. For preparation of cells, lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes were harvested after the collection of BAL fluid, digested for 30 min at 37 °C in media containing 1 mg/mL Collagenase (Type 11, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.02 mg/mL DNase-I (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), homogenized in gentleMACS™ C tubes utilizing the gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator program m_lung_02_01 (Miltenyi Biotec, Gaithersburg, MD), and subsequently strained through 70 µm MACS® SmartStrainers (Miltenyi Biotec) into single cell suspensions.IAV-specific whole virus Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs)Total IAV-specific IgG and IgA antibody against whole IAV H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/68 live virus was measured as previously described88. Briefly, wells were coated with ~3.2 × 105 TCIU50 of virus, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, washed, and then blotted dry. Serum or BAL samples were added to the top well in triplicate at a 1:50 or 1:4 dilution in 200 μL/well, respectively. Samples were serially diluted at 1:2 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Plates were washed, blotted dry, and then IAV-specific antibody was detected using the following antibodies: Biotin-SP (long spacer) AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Catalog # 115-065-071), (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgA (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) followed by peroxidase conjugated-streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) and TMB substrate (Abcam, Boston, MA). Reaction was stopped using 0.16 M H2SO4 and optical densities were measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax M5 Multi-mode microplate reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA).Hemagglutinin inhibition assaysHAI assays using mouse serum and BAL were performed as previously described89. Briefly, sera and BAL were inactivated by heating at 56 °C for 30 min and then adsorbed in a chicken red blood cell (CRBC) suspension for 30 min at different concentrations: serum was absorbed in 1% CBRC at 1:5 and BAL was absorbed in 10% CRBC at 1:2. CRBCs were pelleted, sera and BAL were recovered, and were serial diluted in 96-well round-bottom plates that were then incubated with four hemagglutination units of stock A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) virus per well for 30 min. Each well then received 1% CRBC suspension and HAI titer was measured after a 30 min incubation.Neuraminidase inhibition assaysNeuraminidase inhibition46 assays using mouse serum and BAL were performed as previously described90. Serum and BAL were inactivated by heating at 56 °C for 30 min. Briefly, 70 μL of serum or BAL were 2-fold serially diluted in 96-well round-bottom plates. 5.85 × 106 TCIU of H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/68 virus in assay buffer containing 0.1% NP-40 detergent solution was added to each well except for blank control wells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Next, 50 μL from each well was then transferred into a clear 96-well flat-bottom plate and each well received 50 μL 30 μM 2′-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA, excitation wavelength = 317 nm) working solution. Plates were covered and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, stop solution (0.824 M NaOH) was added to terminate the reaction and plates were read at 460 nm using a SpectraMax M5 Multi-mode microplate reader where OD were converted to IC50 and IC25 based on activity relative to NA-activity in the absence of antibody.Nucleoprotein (NP) and Matrix Protein 1 (M1)-specific ELISAsTotal NP-specific or M1-specific IgG and IgA antibody against whole NP (Sino Biological, Beijing, China; Catalog # 40208-V08B, Baculovirus Insect cells) or whole M1 (Sino Biological, Beijing, China; Catalog # 40215-V07E, E. coli) derived from H3N2 IAVs A/Hong Kong/1/68 and A/Aichi/2/68 respectively or control SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Sino Biological; Catalog #40150-V05H1) was measured as previously described88. Briefly, wells were coated with 2 μg/mL of NP or M1, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and ChromPure Goat IgG whole molecule (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and ChromPure Human IgG whole molecule (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted at 1:500 within the blocking solution. After blocking for 1 h, plates were washed and then blotted dry. Serum or BAL samples were added to the top well in triplicate at a 1:50 or 1:4 dilution in 200 μL/well, respectively. Samples were serially diluted at 1:2 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Plates were washed, blotted dry, and then NP or M1-specific antibody was detected using the following antibodies: Biotin-SP (long spacer) AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) or biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgA (Bio-Rad) followed by peroxidase conjugated-streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) and TMB substrate (Abcam). The reaction was stopped using 0.16 M H2SO4 and optical densities were measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax M5 Multi-mode microplate reader.Antibody staining for flow cytometrySingle-cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells) from lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes (dLN) were blocked with 2% rat serum for 30 min at 4 °C. Following blocking, cells were stained with the following antibodies to identify CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets: 1:500 rat anti-mouse CD62L (MEL-14; Biolegend, cat #: 104430), 1:500 rat anti-mouse CD4 (GK1.5; BioLegend, cat #: 100480), 1:500 rat anti-mouse CD8α (53-6.7; BioLegend, cat #: 569185), 1:250 rat anti-mouse CD49d (R1-2; Biolegend, cat #: 103606), 1:250 rat anti-mouse CD11a (M17/4; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, cat #: 741919), 1:100 rat anti-mouse CD103 (M290; BD Biosciences, cat #: 121433), 1:100 rat anti-mouse CD69 (H1.2F3; eBioscience, cat #: 104527), 1:100 rat anti-mouse Eomes (Dan11mag; Invitrogen, cat #: 14-4875-82), 1:250 hamster anti-mouseat CD49a (Ha31/8; BD Biosciences, cat #: 562115), hamster anti-mouse 1:100 CXCR3 (CXCR3-173; Biolegend, cat #: 126516), and 1:100 anti-mouse CX3CR1 (SA011F11; Biolegend, cat #: 149031). Antigen experienced T cells were identified via expression of surrogate markers as previously described53,54. Briefly, CD11ahiCD49d+ expression was utilized to identify antigen-experienced CD4 T cells (CD19-CD4+CD8α-CD45.2ivAb-), while CD11ahiCD44+ expression was utilized to quantify antigen-experienced CD8 T cells (CD19-CD8α+CD4-CD45ivAb-) in the lungs and airways (see Supplementary Fig. 2). CD44+CD45.2ivAb- CD4 and CD8 T cells were analyzed for tissue localization to the airway (CD11aloCD44+) or lung parenchyma (CD11ahiCD44+) as previously described63. Vaccine specific CD8 T cells were identified using A/Hong Kong/1/68 H2-Db NP366-374 (ASNENMDAM) and H2-Kb M1128-135 (MGLIYNRM) tetramers diluted 1:100 that were produced from monomers generated similar to as previously described91. To identify B cell subsets, cells were stained with rat anti-mouse 1:500 CD19 (1D3; BD Biosciences, cat #: 115545), 1:250 rat anti-mouse B220 (RA3-6B2; BioLegend, cat #: 558108), 1:250 rat anti-mouse IgM (B7-6; eBioscience, cat # 46-6526-42), 1:250 rat anti-mouse Fas (Jo2; BioLegend, cat #: 565605), 1:100 rat anti-mouse GL7 (GL7; Biolegend, cat #: 144610), 1:100 rat anti-mouse CD38 (90; BD Biosciences, cat #: 746476), 1:100 hamster anti-mouse CD69 (H1.2F3; Biolegend, cat #: 104527), 1:100 rat anti-mouse CD73 (TY/11.8; Biolegend, cat #: 127208), and 1:100 hamster anti-mouse CXCR3 (CXCR3-173; Biolegend, cat #:149031). Cells were then fixed with BD FACS™ Lysing Solution per manufacturer’s instructions and resuspended in PBS. Data were acquired on a LSRII (BD Biosciences) or Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).Statistical analysesExperiments were repeated at least twice unless noted otherwise. Comparisons between more than two groups at different time points were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. For comparisons between more than two groups at a single time point, a D’Agostino and Pearson normality test was performed to establish normality. Data that failed normalcy were analyzed using a Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with a Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. Data that passed normalcy were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. A P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY How Michigan became ground zero for H5 avian influenza in the USKristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption Bird flu affecting dozens of dairy herdsThe latest bird flu outbreak has affected more than 60 dairy herds since late March, according to the CDC.Fox - 5 AtlantaMichigan has become ground zero for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus that's sweeping the nation, killing turkeys, chickens and wild birds, infecting cows and other mammals — and now has sickened a third U.S. farmworker.The Great Lakes state has more dairy cattle herds known to be infected with avian influenza than any other state in the U.S., with 24 outbreaks in 10 counties as of Friday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It now also has two farmworkers with confirmed bird flu infections — transmitted to them by close contact with sick cows.Texas is the only other state where a person is known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from a cow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That state has reported 15 cattle herd infections since March. Seven other states — Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and North Carolina — also have cow herds with known infections, the USDA reported.The reason Michigan's tally of livestock outbreaks and farmworkers with avian influenza is higher than other states is not because Michigan is especially ripe for viral activity or because there's something different about the state's cows or workers, said Dr. Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response."The main reason we're detecting more infection is because we're doing very good surveillance," Monto said. "Other states need to do the same. ... It's being missed."The CDC reported May 22 that 40 people had been tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza nationally. The same day, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Free Press that 35 Michigan farmworkers had undergone testing.That means only five people who had been tested as of May 22 were from states other than Michigan. It also means the reach of the virus "is certainly more widespread" nationally than anyone currently knows, Monto said."The conclusions are pretty obvious when you hear things like that," said Monto. "If you don't look, you're not going to find it. What we need is to get serious about it in terms of how we handle surveillance because if you don't know it's there and don't have regulations in place ... it's going to spread even more."The CDC updated its testing and monitoring data Friday, saying 44 people have now been tested nationally for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and more than 390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals.The agency said it also is stepping up national surveillanceesting by:Asking local labs to send more samples for subtyping to the CDC and state public health labs to test for the H5N1 virus. Extending reporting of flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. The CDC typically stops reporting influenza hospitalizations from May-September because it’s ordinarily such a seasonal virus. So far, the CDC said its surveillance systems show no indication of unusual flu activity in people.Increasing outreach through state and local health departments to health care providers and clinics about H5N1 symptoms so avian influenza is considered when patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness and a history of exposure to animals seek medical care.How the virus came to Michigan cow herdsThe outbreak of H5N1 virus in dairy cattle — with spillover to humans — began in Texas just a few months ago. It came to Michigan in late March, when infected cows crossed state lines, said Tim Boring, the director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development."We know that a farm in Montcalm County initially (had an outbreak) as a result of cattle movement," Boring said, "and we've seen an expansion of our cases out of that general area since then."Calling the H5N1 outbreak among poultry and cattle in Michigan an "extraordinary emergency," Boring issued an order May 1 that required all dairy and commercial poultry farms in Michigan to adopt biosecurity practices to slow the spread of the virus.Among the requirements: Farms must secure animal areas, establish a perimeter and limit access. They must name a biosecurity manager and train employees, establish cleaning and disinfection practices for all with contact within the perimeter, including delivery drivers. They must keep log books tracking all who enter and leave.More: Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be nextThe order also prohibited all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, from being exhibited at fairs and festivals until there are no new cases of the virus statewide in dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. Similarly, poultry also cannot be taken to exhibitions, fairs or festivals until no new cases of the virus have been detected in domestic poultry for at least 30 consecutive days.The state agriculture department also teamed up closely with state and local health departments to ensure people would be protected, Boring said."In Michigan, we're testing in animals and we're testing in people and we've seen really strong coordination between animal and human health components within the state level, the federal level and on the local level," he told the Free Press on Friday. "Part of the reason that we've seen good responses on testing is because of the involvement of local health departments. Those are trusted community partners. They are neighbors, not folks coming in from out of town. We're taking this really seriously. It's a proactive approach. This is both an animal and a public health concern, and we're managing it as such."Still, Boring said, there are many unanswered questions about this virus, including how it spreads."We likely have a multifactorial transmission matrix going on of how the virus spreads from dairy farm to dairy farm. ... We're getting a better handle on it every day, and we're continuing to lead across the country of what the response looks like."Human cases so far have been mildAll three people known to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms.The Texas farmworker and the first person in Michigan to get ill from exposure to infected cattle reported only conjunctivitis, or pink eye. In the second Michigan case, which was announced Thursday, a farmworker had upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the CDC reported.There is concern among scientists that the impact on people could change, as more animals get infected.The more the virus spreads in animals, the greater the likelihood of human exposures and transmission, Monto said, which also increases the odds that the virus could mutate in a way that would allow H5N1 to spread from person to person or to cause more severe disease."That's why we really need to control it — not because we're sure that is going to happen, but because if that does happen, there's a chance it's going to be pretty bad," Monto said.The CDC is conducting genetic sequencing on the most recent human case in Michigan to determine what, if any changes, there might be.All three known human cases so far involved the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus that is nearly identical to the H5N1 viruses circulating in U.S. dairy cows, the CDC reported.In samples taken from the infected eye of the first Michigan farmworker, whose case was announced May 22, the CDC identified a mutation that allows mammals to be infected more easily. However, it did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.And that's key, Monto said."We're lucky that there are receptor-binding issues that are preventing it from getting into humans easily," Monto said, "because if it were easy to transmit, with all of the workers that are on these farms handling the equipment, which is heavily contaminated, we would see more cases."The virus affects animals, people differentlyThe impact of the virus on animals so far has been extremely variable, said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan."The virus behaves different in each species," said Cernak, whose work centers on developing new antiviral drugs that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak. "There are species that it gets into and they just don't seem to notice," while others get very sick and others see mass die-offs.The current H5N1 strain in the U.S. is extremely deadly in birds and cats, sea lions, raccoons and skunks.Dairy cows get sick from the virus, but don't typically die. A report from Michigan State University suggests cows on one Michigan farm with an H5N1 outbreak had high fevers and dehydration. There was a drop in rumination as well, which turns the grass they eat into energy and milk. Milk production dropped dramatically, and some pregnant cows miscarried.Last week, the USDA reported that alpacas in Idaho also have contracted the virus. And mice became sick within a day of drinking raw milk from an infected cow. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from researchers at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory that showed the mice had high levels of virus in their organs. Levels also were high in the mammary glands of two mice — even though the mice were not lactating."In elephant seals it killed 96% of the pups from last year," Cernak said, adding that the virus also devastated the bald eagle population and affected horned owls. "It's entirely possible in wild populations, there are significant risks of extinction-level events happening."More: Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to humanFor humans, he said a different subtype of H5N1 avian influenza that spread in Cambodia from 2003-23 caused severe illness and deaths."In Cambodia, the fatality rate in humans was really high, and that's the concerning thing," Cernak said. Of 64 people who contracted the other subtype of the virus, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.Could respiratory symptoms signal easier human-to-human spread?For now, as the bird flu circulating in the U.S. has remained mild in the few human cases, Cernak said he is concerned about the potential for respiratory transmission to give this virus a boost."The biggest risk that we have is that it mutates toward respiratory transmission," he told the Free Press last week — before the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state does now, in fact, have a farmworker with H5 infection and respiratory symptoms.It's unclear, however, whether having those symptoms will make it easier to spread the virus from person to person.Joe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, said it's the first time respiratory symptoms have been associated with a human H5N1 influenza case following contact with sick cows."Generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas," Coyle said."It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure."The CDC reported that the farmworker with respiratory symptoms was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored and offered antiviral medication.More outreach to farms neededDr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at U-M, said there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the current U.S. H5N1 avian influenza outbreak."Often in the health field, we are maybe appropriately focused on the humans, but the wider the outbreak is in animals, the more risk there is of humans being infected because there are more potential contacts," he said."I think everyone's trying to understand different ways that it could be spreading among dairy cattle within a herd and also between herds or between farms, and I think that's an important thing that we need to really get a better understanding of."In terms of how far it has spread in humans, that is dependent on really being able to do good surveillance, which is challenging in this situation in that it depends on people coming to attention, reporting their symptoms, getting tested."Many farmworkers are undocumented migrant workers for whom English might not be a first language and who might be concerned about being deported if they say they are sick or seek medical care."A lot of these populations are hard to reach," Lauring said. "I know MDHHS has been doing outreach to try to do as best they can with surveillance for symptoms in people to try to catch anyone who could be infected, and also then to offer testing. That's how, for example, this (first) case in Michigan was identified was through this program."Michigan, he said, appears to have done a better job than many other states. It has created a daily text-message surveillance system, available in English and in Spanish, that asks workers to detail whether they have symptoms. Anyone who answers yes is then offered testing by local public health workers.Testing is encouraged, but not required, and the federal government now is reimbursing farms for the some of the losses they have incurred from H5N1 outbreaks and testing."This is an ongoing, evolving situation and it's important to pay attention to that," Lauring said. "Fortunately, the risk to the general population is low, but we need to pay attention and reach out to farms and people working with the farms and work together to control the outbreak."'We're flying blind'Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations including the CDC, wrote on a post on her substack, "Your Local Epidemiologist," that the H5N1 situation in the U.S. is far from controlled."We are flying blind," she said. "We don’t know how this virus is spreading, where it is spreading, and if it’s becoming better at infecting humans."Lack of trust in public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers' fears of deportation and language barriers, along with farmers' concerns about the financial impact the H5N1 outbreaks all are affecting surveillance efforts."It shouldn’t be shocking that few are volunteering to test for H5N1," she wrote.Animal testing for avian influenza viruses in Michigan is done through MSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Positive results are sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for confirmatory testing, Boring said.If an animal's test result is positive, "we work closely with local and state health officials to make sure that local health is on farms, working with farmworkers, apprising them of everything they need to know about what this virus means and maintaining and tracking some human safety aspects there," he said.That includes ensuring personal protective gear — such as face shields or goggles, respirator masks, rubber coveralls and boots — are available to workers on farms with infected animals. Although wearing PPE is recommended, it isn't mandatory."We're doing everything we can to assist those human health partners to be getting equipment out to not only just farms, but within those CDC guidelines around processing plants as well."We've had a few farms take us up on that, but the base PPE that makes so much of a difference in these cases — eye protection, gloves — that is equipment a lot of farms have on hand already."Neither of the Michigan farmworkers who were infected by cows wore fully protective equipment, said Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement issued Thursday. One was splashed in the eye with milk from an infected cow and the other had "direct exposure to an infected cow.""This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms," she said.For protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recommends that anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected cow should wear:Safety goggles or a face shieldDisposable glovesBoots or boot coversA respirator, such as an N95 maskFluid-resistant coverallsHead coveringMany questions about avian influenza remain unansweredThere remain many questions with wide implications, Monto said, when it comes to how this virus is behaving.Among them, he said: For how long is a cow infectious? Will infections be sustained on farms or will they be able to be rid of the virus over time? Why are lactating cows so susceptible and why are virus particles so concentrated in their milk?"What is going on in the mixed dairy-beef cattle farms? A cow is a cow," said Monto.He noted that in one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus."Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus," the USDA reported.And though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection."We do know that raw milk is full of the virus," Monto said. "We know that we shouldn't be drinking unpasteurized milk and some people are (obsessed with) drinking unpasteurized milk."Monto said scientists still don't know whether the milk of other animals — or humans — is infectious when they contract avian influenza."This virus is now spreading wherever they shipped dairy cows. It's come all the way from Texas to Michigan. And it's come to a variety of other states," Monto said."We need to control the infection in cattle, and that will lower the probability of humans becoming infected."Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have experienced an unprecedented global spread, coupled with remarkable genetic plasticity for adaptation in birds and mammals. Although human infections remain very limited, the establishment in wild, marine, and farmed animals, including recently dairy cattle, is of concern. The role of mammalian hosts as intermediaries for zoonotic or even pandemic influenza A viruses should not be underestimated. In order to mitigate the zoonotic risk and be adequately prepared, it is essential to understand and monitor the dynamics of HPAIV H5 at the avian-mammal interface. Diversity of avian influenza virusesAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) have their reservoir in wild birds, especially waterfowl1. However, they also continue to cause losses in the poultry industry worldwide, affecting global meat and egg production, threatening wild bird biodiversity and posing zoonotic risks1. The influenza A virus (IAV) genome is segmented into eight distinct, negative-stranded, RNA gene segments. The error-prone nature of the IAV polymerase, which is responsible for viral replication, allows for constant change and adaptation1, which is highly advantageous for viral evolution. When two different IAVs infect a host cell, gene segments can be swapped (i.e., reassortment or antigenic shift) to theoretically generate 254 novel genotypes2. Moreover, stepwise mutations acquired spontaneously during viral replication, may also allow the virus to adapt to new hosts (i.e. antigenic drift). To date, AIVs have been classified into 16 hemagglutinin (HA; H1-H16) and 9 neuraminidase (NA; N1-N9) subtypes based on variation in these surface glycoproteins. The type of HA and NA define the respective subtype (e.g. H5N1) with 144 possible HxNy combinations.Early history of HPAIV H5N1The first reports of HPAIV in poultry date back to 1878 by Edoardo Perroncito in Italy3. Over a century later, in 1996, HPAIV of subtype H5N1 was identified in domestic geese in the Guangdong province (Gs/Gd), China4. In 1997, HPAIV H5N1 Gs/Gd was detected in poultry markets in Hong Kong, and 6 out of 18 infected humans died, drawing attention to the zoonotic risk of this virus group. Subsequently, HPAIV H5N1 Gs/Gd was controlled in commercial poultry, but it continued to circulate in the wild bird reservoir. In 2002, Gs/Gd-like viruses jumped again from wild birds to poultry and back to wild birds in the Qinghai Lake region5. The endemicity of this virus in wild birds and poultry, and the continuous exchange between poultry and wild birds resulted in successful evolution and diversification into numerous phylogenetic clades6. Since 2005, HPAIVs H5N1 Gs/Gd have been transmitted in several waves across regions and continents, primarily by migratory wild birds7.Currently circulating H5N1 of clade 2.3.4.4bSince 2022, HPAIVs of subtype H5 have become deeply entrenched in poultry and wild birds7,8. The subsequent panzootic clade 2.3.4.4b H5-viruses have a very wide range of avian hosts9 and show numerous spill-over infections to wild carnivores, farmed fur animals such as mink, fox and raccoon dogs, and marine mammals such as sea lions10 (Fig. 1). The unique characteristics of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4b demand a fundamental rethink of our understanding of these pathogens. Europe is now a new center for HPAIV H5 in wild birds, and reassortment with other European AIV is underway11. HPAIV H5 has been transmitted from Europe to Africa and via Iceland to North and South America. This has resulted in high overall mortality in naïve bird populations and mammals including on mainland Antarctica12,13,14. It is of great concern, that HPAIV H5 has infected well over 150 different bird species and more than 50 mammalian species (Fig. 1)15,16,17. In addition, HPAIV H5N1 of clade 2.3.4.4b has a remarkable genetic elasticity for reassortment with other AIVs resulting in a wide range of highly diverse H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8 viruses18,19. Efficient reassortment has resulted in well over 50 different genotypes8, with the HA segment as the stable element. This poses a significant challenge to the study of the epidemiology, pathobiology and genetic characteristics of these viruses20.Fig. 1: Potential hosts for the genesis of a zoonotic avian influenza virus.Mammals infected with the current AIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b present a significant risk for the emergence of zoonotic viruses. Human infections have been documented in a dairy cow farm worker. Human-adaptation markers have been identified in multiple isolates from mammals, raising concerns about the potential role of these animals as intermediate hosts for the emergence of zoonotic AIV H5N1. The figure was created with BioRender.com.Full size imageHPAIV H5N1 in dairy cattlePrevious studies at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Insel Riems, Germany, showed that a 2006 H5N1 isolate from a cat replicated inefficiently in calves following intranasal high-titer infection21. Furthermore, there have been no reports of IAV circulating in cattle, although some spill-over infections of IAV have been described22. Therefore, until recently the role of cattle in the epidemiology of IAV was considered insignificant21. In contrast, the HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13 efficiently infected dairy cattle in 202423. Infected cattle may be subclinical or clinical and the main clinical signs are a drastic decrease in milk production, changes in milk consistency, decreased feed uptake, dehydration and fever23. The infection is reported to focus on lactating dairy cows and there are very high viral loads in the milk of infected cows. The spread seems to be mainly via the milking process and transport of infected cows to other farms in different states24. Apparently, efficient cow-to-cow transmission has allowed the virus to spread to 63 dairy farms in at least 9 states (status as of 05/24/2024). Sequence analysis and phylodynamics suggest a single introduction several months earlier23,25. Fatal cases in cats after drinking raw milk from infected cows24 and an infection of a dairy farm worker in Texas with a conjunctivitis have been reported26. Another study described the transmission of H5N1 from dairy cows to raccoons and to wild and domestic birds27 (Fig. 2). In addition, H5N1-RNA has been detected in wastewater28, but the source of contamination remains unknown. Importantly, recent research has raised concerns that cattle, once considered a resilient host, may act as a novel IAV host in the future and after further adaptation of H5N129. A recent preprint reports that both avian and human IAV receptors to be present in the upper respiratory tract of cattle and at high densities in bovine udder tissues29. These results were used to consider the risk of cows being a “mixing vessel” as known in pigs and fur animals. However, no other IAVs are currently circulating in cattle. Mixing in cattle can therefore be largely ruled out for the time being15. Cattle are widely infected with another Orthomyxovirus genus, “Influenza D virus (IDV)”. Serological surveillance suggests that IDV can be transmitted to humans, although very rarely compared to AIV30. And IDV uses different receptors than IAV20.Fig. 2: The role of cattle in the transmission of HPAIV H5N1.An experimental infection of calves with an early Gs/Gd isolate of H5N1/2006 clade 2.2.2, isolated from a cat in Germany and with the PB2 mutation E627K, demonstrated inefficient replication and a lack of transmission in calves following intranasal high-titer infection21. Conversely, the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 B3.13 genotype in the U.S. replicates efficiently in the mammary gland of dairy cows and is capable of transmission to a variety of animals, including wild and domestic birds. The figure was created with BioRender.com.Full size imageSeeking answers to many questionsInfluenza A viruses are masters of mutation and adaptation. There are undoubtedly serious questions to be answered about the significant change in the epidemiology of HPAIV H5 from Asia to Europe, the dynamics of infection in wild bird reservoirs, the role of climate change in the spread of the virus, the reasons for the genetic plasticity of the current clade 2.3.4.4b viruses to reassort and adapt to new hosts, and the overall low zoonotic potential of H5 viruses from this clade31,32. Vigilance is needed to prevent new waves of infection, especially in mammals, and ultimately to prevent human infection. Dairy cows are the latest and most surprising victims in the list of AIV hosts, but they will not be the last.Further adaptation of HPAIV H5N1 to cattle must be prevented. Stringent measures such as testing regimes (e.g. via bulk milk diagnostics), strict transport controls, quarantine measures and optimized milking hygiene must be implemented. In addition, much more basic epidemiological data is needed (e.g. seroprevalence on farms, data on non-lactating animals, H5-antibody titers in sera and milk, oro-nasal shedding data). It should also be considered that the most efficient virus shedding cows should be isolated or even euthanized. As a precautionary measure, suitable vaccines should be developed and evaluated, before the virus becomes established in these hosts. ReferencesKrammer, F. et al. Influenza. Nat. Rev. Dis.

Currently, there is no H7N9-specific prevention or treatment for humans. Here, from a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case in Hong Kong, we isolate four hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), with three directed to the globular head domain (HA1) and one to the stalk domain (HA2). Two clonally related HA1-directed mAbs, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2, potently neutralize H7N9 and protect female mice from lethal H7N9/AH1 challenge. Cryo-EM structures reveal that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bind to a β14-centered surface and disrupt the 220-loop that makes hydrophobic contacts with sialic acid on an adjacent protomer, thereby blocking viral entry. Sequence analysis indicates the lateral patch targeted by H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 to be conserved among influenza subtypes. Both H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 retain HA1 binding and neutralization capacity to later H7N9 isolates from 2016–2017, consistent with structural data showing that the antigenic mutations during this timeframe occur at their epitope peripheries. The HA2-directed mAb H7.HK4 lacks neutralizing activity but when used in combination with H7.HK2 moderately augments female mouse protection. Overall, our data reveal antibodies to a conserved lateral HA1 supersite that confer neutralization, and when combined with a HA2-directed non-neutralizing mAb, augment protection.

The virus reemerged in the fall of 2013 and in the winter of later years, with the largest epidemic reported as the 5th wave in 2016–20174,5,6. Though there is limited evidence for human-to-human transmission, a few mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus might be sufficient to overcome its inefficiency for human transmission7,8,9,10. Like other influenza virus infections, the most common treatments against H7N9 are neuraminidase inhibitors Tamiflu (i.e., oseltamivir) and Relena (i.e., zanamivir), but oseltamivir-resistant strains have emerged11,12,13. Intravenous (i.v.) zanamivir, though not clinically approved, has been used on a compassionate basis in some severe cases because of favorable pharmacokinetics and in vitro susceptibility against oseltamivir-resistant strains14,15. Other antiviral treatment includes the endonuclease inhibitor Xofluza (i.e., baloxavir marboxil) that targets the viral polymerase and has been shown effective in mice against H7N9 lethal challenges16. Despite the use of neuraminidase inhibitors and endonuclease inhibitor, H7N9 case-fatality rate remains higher than 30%, and currently there is no licensed vaccine against H7N9 for humans. Concerns for a potential major outbreak warrant the development of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H7N9.Because HA is the major target for influenza neutralizing antibodies, H7-reactive human mAbs have been isolated and characterized from H7N9 acute infections17, convalescent cases18, and H7N9 experimental vaccinees19,20,21. The binding sites of these mAbs have been mapped to the HA globular head (HA1) and stem (HA2) domains. A subset of HA1-directed mAbs potently neutralized H7N9 and protected mice from H7N9 challenges at doses of 0.3, 1, 5 mg/kg or higher17,18,19,20. These HA1-directed mAbs typically neutralized H7N9 by direct interference with or around the receptor (sialic acid) binding site17,19,22. These epitopes correspond to the antigenic sites A and B as previously mapped on the surface of H3 HA23,24,25. Of note, significant antigenic drift has been documented in the HA gene of 2016–2017 H7N9 from the initial 2013 isolates17,26,27. For example, Huang et al. isolated 17 neutralizing mAbs from four cases infected in 2013 and 2014, yet only three of these mAbs were active against viral isolates from 2016 to 201717. A broad mAb FluA-20 targeting the HA1 trimer interface did not mediate neutralization in vitro, but protected mice from viral challenges by disrupting HA trimers and inhibiting cell-to-cell spread of virus21. HA2-directed mAbs have also demonstrated neutralizing activity against divergent subtypes28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35, although typically not as robust in neutralizing activity when compared to HA1 mAbs. A few HA2 mAbs, neutralizing or not, protected mice from H7N9 challenges at 5 mg/kg20, especially when engineered as mouse IgG2a, which has the highest Fc-mediated effector functions in mouse36. However, previous studies have not tested the combination of two or more mAbs that target different regions of H7N9 HA.In the post COVID-19 era, preparedness for future pandemics has become a high priority, as exemplified by the science community closely monitoring a bird flu (avian influenza A H5N1) outbreak in US cows37. Here, we aim to facilitate the development of human mAbs against H7N9, which has also been considered one of the most serious pandemic threats. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case in Hong Kong with the virus isolated as A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 H7N914. The course of this infection lasted for about one month and the treatment required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and i.v. zanamivir14. Development of plasma neutralizing antibodies was evident at recovery. The PBMC sample used to isolate mAbs was collected one year post recovery. From the isolated mAbs, we not only demonstrate potent H7N9 neutralization, but use cryo-EM analysis to delineate a conserved lateral site-of-vulnerability in the HA head, a finding of vaccine relevance.ResultsH7-reactive mAb isolationFor H7-specific mAb isolation, we purchased a soluble recombinant H7 HA protein based on A/Shanghai/2/2013 H7N9 for biotinylation, followed by streptavidin-PE conjugation. With this H7-PE bait, we stained 5 million PBMCs from the H7N9_HK2013 donor and sorted a total of 68 IgG+ B cells (defined as CD3-CD19+CD20+IgG+) that are H7-PE+ (Fig. 1a). Most of the sorted cells were at the borderline of H7-PE staining, but a few stained brightly for H7-PE. From the sorted B cells, we performed single B cell RT-PCR and recovered four H7-reactive mAbs—namely, H7.HK1, H7.HK2, H7.HK3, and H7.HK4.Fig. 1: Isolation and characterization of human H7N9 mAbs in vitro.a FACS depicting the staining and selection of H7-specific B cells from donor H7N9_HK2013 PBMCs.

Data shown are mean ± SEM. Source data are provided in the Source Data file. Similar results were independently reproduced at least once.Full size imageMeasured by ELISA, the four reconstituted mAbs bound tightly to the H7N9 HA antigen used for H7-PE staining (Fig. 1b). Pre-treating the H7N9 HA with Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) had no effect on the mAb binding profiles, indicating that these mAbs do not rely on H7 glycans for binding. After switching the ELISA coating antigen to HA1 of the matching H7N9 HA from A/Shanghai/2/2013, the binding curves of H7.HK1, H7.HK2, and H7.HK3 were fully retained, indicating that these mAbs bind to the globular head domain HA1; in contrast, H7.HK4 lost binding to H7N9 HA1, suggesting that its binding epitope is likely located in the HA2 stem domain (Fig. 1b). Because of the documented antigenic drift for 2016–2017 H7N9 isolates, we also tested the mAb binding to HA1s from A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 and A/Hong Kong/125/2017 H7N9. The binding curves of H7.HK1, H7.HK2, and H7.HK3 to both 2016 and 2017 HA1s were fully retained, and H7.HK4 did not bind to any HA1s. In addition, all four mAbs bound tightly to a recombinant H7N7 HA antigen based on A/Netherlands/219/2003 H7N7 (Fig. 1b). To non-H7 HA proteins, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 did not react with any of the tested non-H7 HA; H7.HK3 cross-reacted with H15N8 HA, and H7.HK4 cross-reacted with H10N8 and H15N8 HAs (Fig. 1b), which sequence-wise are the closest to H7 in group 2 influenza HA genes38. Western blot of a cleaved HA based on A/Shanghai/1/2013 H7N9 confirmed that H7.HK2 binds to HA1 and H7.HK4 binds to HA2 (Fig. 1c).H7-reactive mAb neutralizationUsing expression plasmids separately encoding H7 and N9 genes from A/Shanghai/4664T/2013 to pseudotype with HIV-1 NL4-3Δenv.Luc backbone39, we generated the H7N9 2013 pseudo virus and tested mAb neutralization by a luciferase readout from single round infection of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (Fig. 1d). H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 each potently neutralized the H7N9 2013 pseudo virus with an IC50 of 20 ng/mL, while the other two mAbs H7.HK3 and H7.HK4 did not neutralize at up to 10 μg/mL (Fig. 1d, Table 1). Similarly, we generated pseudo virus using the H7 from A/Hong Kong/125/2017 H7N9. Both H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 retained their neutralization titers against the H7N9 2017 pseudo virus with an IC50 of 30 ng/mL, while the other two mAbs H7.HK3 and H7.HK4 did not neutralize (Fig. 1d, Table 1). We further assessed the mAb neutralization against three live replicating H7N9 viruses, A/Anhui/1/2013, A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013, and the donor’s autologous isolate A/Hong Kong/470129/2013, for multiple rounds of infection in MDCK cells. Scored by the presence of cytopathic effect, mAbs H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 neutralized all three H7N9 live isolates with IC50s ranging 0.26–1.0 μg/mL; however, they did not neutralize any non-H7N9 influenza isolates tested, indicating that these mAbs are specific to H7N9 (Table 1). The other two mAbs H7.HK3 and H7.HK4 did not neutralize any of the tested H7N9 and therefore were not tested against non-H7N9 viruses. The neutralization IC50s of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 using pseudo viruses were about 10-fold more potent than those using live replicating viruses, suggesting that the pseudo virus neutralization is more sensitive thus useful for initial screening of neutralizing mAbs, which could then be confirmed with live replicating viruses. Similar differences in IC50 values have been reported for other HA-reactive mAbs tested by both pseudo virus and live replicating virus29.Table 1 Neutralization IC50 of H7.HK mAbs against pseudo virus or live replicating virusFull size tableComparison of H7.HK2 to previous H7 HA1-directed neutralizing mAbsThree previous mAbs representing the best from each corresponding study were compared to H7.HK2 for ELISA binding to H7 antigens and neutralization of H7N9 pseudo viruses. Cloned from plasmablasts of an acute infection in 2013–201417, mAb L4A-14 is directed at the receptor-binding site (RBS) and bound 2013 H7N9 HA1 and HA similarly to H7.HK2, retained full binding to 2016 and 2017 HA1s (Supplementary Fig. 1a) but lost vast majority of binding to H7N7 HA (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Derived from EBV transformed B cells after vaccination19, another RBS-directed mAb H7.167 bound less well than H7.HK2 to 2013 H7N9 HA1 and HA and lost substantial binding to 2016 and 2017 HA1s and to H7N7 HA. Cloned from plasmablasts after vaccination20, the non-RBS mAb 07-5F01 bound 2013, 2016, and 2017 H7N9 HA1s similarly to H7.HK2 and fully retained reactivity to H7N7 HA. Evaluated by pseudo virus neutralization (Supplementary Fig. 1c), the RBS-directed mAbs H7.167 and L4A-14 neutralized the 2013 H7N9 weaker than H7.HK2. L4A-14 neutralized the 2017 strain slightly better than 2013 H7N9, but H7.167’s activity was further reduced by the 2017 virus. The non-RBS mAb 07-5F01 neutralized both 2013 and 2017 H7N9 viruses with comparable potency to H7.HK2. Hence, evaluated by H7 antigen binding and pseudo virus neutralization, H7.HK2 is superior to the two best previous RBS-directed mAbs L4A-14 and H7.167 and matches the one best previous non-RBS mAb 07-5F01 against H7N9.H7-reactive mAb sequencesSequence analysis revealed that all four H7.HK mAbs are IgG1 (Table 2). H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 are clonal variants using IGHV4-59 for heavy chain with 8-10% somatic hypermutation (SHM) and a complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3 of 11 amino acids according to the Kabat and Chothia definition40,41,42, and IGKV2-28 for light chain with 6% SHM and a CDR L3 of 9 amino acids. Though clonally related, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 share only 3 out of 13-15 amino acid SHMs in the heavy chain V-gene and 1 out of 8 amino acid SHMs in the light chain V-gene (Supplementary Fig. 2). A putative N-linked glycosylation site is present in the light chain CDR L1 of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2. H7.HK3 uses IGHV7-4-1 for heavy chain with 7% SHM and a CDR H3 of 14 amino acids, and IGKV1-5 for light chain with 5% SHM and a CDR L3 of 8 amino acids. A putative N-linked glycosylation site is also present in H7.HK3 at the heavy chain CDR H2. H7.HK4 uses IGHV4-61 for heavy chain with 7% SHM and a CDR H3 of 13 amino acids, and IGKV1-16 for light chain with 5% SHM and a CDR L3 of 9 amino acids (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2).Table 2 Genetic composition, epitope, and neutralization function of H7.HK mAbsFull size tableH7-reactive mAb structures with HA trimerFor structural analysis, we expressed a soluble, disulfide-stabilized, and fully cleaved H7 HA trimer by transient transfection of Expi293F cells. H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bound the H7 HA trimer tightly, H7.HK3 bound less well, and H7.HK4 did not bind at all (Supplementary Fig. 3a). As expected, the three previous neutralizing mAbs all bound the H7 HA trimer tightly, with H7.167 showing weaker binding (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We next generated the antibody fragments for antigen binding (Fabs) of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 to bind the H7 HA trimer. We froze grids containing the Fab:HA complexes and determined cryo-EM structures of each Fab bound to an H7 HA trimer (Supplementary Fig. 4). A resolution of 3.62 Å for H7.HK1 and 3.69 Å for H7.HK2 was achieved (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 5, Table S1). These complex structures demonstrate that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 are highly superimposable (Fig. 2b) and their interactions with H7 are centered at β14 and extended to the surfaces of β10 and β19 (Fig. 2c). This β14-targeting surface partially overlaps with the antigenic site D towards sites A and B as previously mapped on H323,25. Analysis of the H7.HK1 epitope demonstrates that most interactions are driven by the heavy chain and consist of seven hydrogen bonds (Y52:E121, R94:G124, G99:S167, D100:T126, Y100a:T165, Y100a:S167, S100c:T126) and one salt bridge (H53:E121) (Fig. 2d). The light chain is less involved in binding, making only one hydrogen bond (Y49:Q163) and weak hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2e). The light chains of both H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 are glycosylated in CDR L1; this glycan plays no role in binding, but there is good density to support its presence. The epitope of H7.HK2 is similar to that of H7.HK1, only differing in slight contacts on the periphery (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In addition, nearly all hydrogen bonds are conserved between the two antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 6b). However, the substitution of F56S in CDR L2 of H7.HK2 results in an additional hydrogen bond with HA G129. This substitution also shifts the orientation of H7.HK2 CDR L2 slightly so that Y49 interacts with T165 for H7.HK2 instead of Q163 for H7.HK1 (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Finally, as H53 is substituted with tyrosine in the heavy chain of H7.HK2, it does not make the H53:E121 salt bridge.Fig. 2: Structural analysis of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 in complex with H7 HA trimer.a Cryo-EM structures of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 bound to H7 HA in the head region. b Top view of alignment of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 complex structures. c Surface presentation of the H7.HK1 epitope (orange) on H7 HA1, with interacting CDRs shown. d H7.HK1 heavy chain forms seven hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge with H7 HA1. e H7.HK1 light chain forms one additional hydrogen bond with H7 HA1, and the interactions are stabilized by hydrophobic residues on the periphery of the light chain interface. f Modeling published structures of H7 HA1-binding antibodies (PDB: 6II4, 6II8, 6II9, 5V2A) onto the H7.HK1 bound structure, with an escape mutation R57K (green) reported for mAb 07-5F01. Competition ELISA with biotinylated H7.HK2 binding to the H7 HA monomer, in which unlabeled competing mAbs were titrated at increasing concentrations to evaluate the effect on H7.HK2 binding. Source data is provided in the Source Data file. g Sequence analysis of N = 1,483 H7 HA1s revealed a conserved lateral patch that largely overlaps with the H7.HK1 epitope. h Modeling the binding site of human receptor analogue LSTc (red) based on a previous crystal structure (PDB: 4BSE) onto H7 from the H7.HK1 complex, showing that H7.HK1 does not compete with sialic acid on the adjacent protomer (black). Alignment of the H7.HK1 complex with a previous crystal structure of H7 (PDB: 4BSE) shows that the 220-loop (pink) required for sialic acid binding (G218-G228) is disordered and would clash with the H7.HK1 light chain if it were present. Green asterisk symbol denotes the <2 Å clash between the CDR L1 N28 and the predicted location of P221 on HA1.Full size imageTo analyze the mechanism of neutralization, we first compared the binding site of H7.HK1 to that of four other H7-reactive antibodies with published structures, L4A-14, L4B-18, L3A-44 (PDB: 6II4, 6II8, 6II9)17 and H7.167 (PDB: 5V2A)19. This analysis demonstrates that the binding site of H7.HK1 is almost completely distinct from that of these previously published antibodies, which compete for the RBS (Fig. 2f). The binding site of H7.HK1 is also distant from that of 07-5F01, which was mapped to an escape mutation R65K (corresponding to R57K here by H3 numbering) of HA120. Direct competition ELISA applying biotin labeled H7.HK2 to bind H7 HA did not detect any effective competition by H7.HK3, H7.HK4, L4A-14, H7.167, and 07-5F01 (Fig. 2f), confirming the unique location of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 epitopes. Further analysis of N = 1,483 H7 HA1 amino acid sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) revealed a conserved lateral patch (Fig. 2g) similar to what was initially identified in H1 viruses43.Strikingly, the lateral patch epitope of H7.HK1 was distal to the RBS of the protomer with which it interacted and closer to the RBS on the adjacent protomer. To further examine the relationship between the mAb binding site and RBS, the human receptor analogue Sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc) was modeled into the RBS of H7 (PDB: 4BSE)44 in the H7.HK1 complex. Interestingly, no steric clashes were observed between H7.HK1 and sialic acid bound to the adjacent protomer, and no mAb interaction with RBS (Fig. 2g). However, the HA 220-loop (G218-G228), which makes hydrophobic contacts with sialic acid has no density present in the structure of H7.HK1 or H7.HK2 bound to HA, suggesting that these antibody binding causes the 220-loop to become disordered. All previously mentioned H7 structures (Fig. 2f), as well as an additional cryo-EM structure in which Fab 1D12 is bound to the stem region of H7 HA (PDB: 6WXL)35 have consistent electron density accounting for this loop. Alignments of the H7.HK1 complex structure with the crystal structure of H7 HA bound to LSTc (PDB: 4BSE)44 demonstrate where the 220-loop would be when receptor is bound and that the light chain of H7.HK1 would clash with this loop (Fig. 2h), further supporting that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 act by causing the 220-loop to become disordered, thus preventing its interactions with the sialic acid receptor. The HA1 trimer interface mAb FluA-20 interacts with the non-RBS side of 220-loop on the protomer it interacts with21. To our knowledge, this mechanism of neutralization employed by H7.HK1 and H7.HK2—disrupting the 220-loop on H7 trimer—is distinct from previously reported HA1-directed H7N9 neutralizing mAbs, which all directly compete with sialic acid for binding to HA on the protomer they interact with17,19,21,22,28.Since the H7N9 HA gene has significantly evolved and changed in 2016–2017 compared to that of 2013 (with up to 12 amino acid substitutions in HA1), we examined the locations of mutated residues in the epitopes of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 that consist of 32 contacting residues in HA1 for both mAbs (Supplementary Fig. 7a). There are three mutations in the binding site of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2—namely, A122T/P, S128N, and R172K, appeared in 2016–2017 compared to the 2013 H7N9, and all three mutations are located at one side edge of the epitopes (Supplementary Fig. 7b), thus not altering the mAb interactions with HA1. This analysis is consistent with the intact binding of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 to both 2016 and 2017 HA1s aligned to the 2013 HA1 (Fig. 1b) and the mAbs’ retention of neutralization against the H7N9 2017 pseudo virus (Fig. 1d).H7-reactive mAb mouse protectionWe next assessed the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of H7.HK mAbs as human IgG1 in a mouse lethal challenge model. To assess mAb prophylactic effect, BALB/c mice (n = 5–10 per group from 1 to 2 experiments) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with human H7N9 mAbs one day before intranasal (i.n.) challenge of 10-fold 50% lethal dose (10 LD50) of A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 virus. Given 100 μg per mouse (equivalent to 5 mg/kg), the neutralizing mAbs H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 each fully protected mice without apparent weight loss (Fig. 3a); given 20 μg per mouse (equivalent to 1 mg/kg), H7.HK2 still fully protected mice from death (defined as ≥20% weight loss), with up to 8% average weight loss; H7.HK1 protected 7 out of 10 mice from death, with up to 12% average weight loss for mice that survived (Fig. 3a). By day 2 post challenge, the weight preservation was significantly better in mice receiving 20 μg of H7.HK1 or H7.HK2 than mice receiving the placebo mAb or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Mice receiving the non-neutralizing mAbs H7.HK3 or H7.HK4 (100 μg or 20 μg) were not protected and showed no difference from placebo mAb and PBS controls (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3: Prophylactic and therapeutic effects of human H7N9 mAbs in mice i.n. challenged with 10 LD50 of A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9.a Female mice were i.p. injected 100 μg (equivalent of 5 mg/kg) or 20 μg (equivalent of 1 mg/kg) of the indicated mAbs (as human IgG1 unless otherwise specified) one day before viral challenge; % survival (<20% weight loss) and % body weight of survived mice were plotted over time. b Female mice were i.p. injected 100 μg of the indicated mAbs one day after viral challenge; % survival and % body weight of survived mice were plotted over time. Arrows indicate the time when mAbs were administered. Control groups of a non-H7 placebo mAb and PBS were included. Data for each group were combined from 1 to 2 experiments and shown as mean ‒ SEM. Source data with P values from two-sided unpaired student’s t-test are provided in the Source Data file. Asterisk symbols denote P < 0.05, and # denote P < 0.1.Full size imageSince anti-HA2 mAbs have demonstrated Fc-mediated protection against influenza45, we converted the anti-HA2 non-neutralizing mAb H7.HK4 to mouse IgG2a—an isotype that mediates strong Fc effector function in mice, and tested it for prophylaxis in the mouse challenge model, along with mouse IgG1, which lacks Fc effector function in mice36. Given 100 μg per mouse, H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a but not IgG1 protected 4 out of 5 mice from death, with up to 17% average weight loss for mice that survived (Fig. 3a). By day 3 post challenge, the weight preservation was significantly better in mice receiving H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a than mice receiving H7.HK4 mouse IgG1 or placebo mouse IgG2a. Though survived, mice receiving 100 μg H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a lost more weight than those receiving 20 μg neutralizing mAbs H7.HK1 or H7.HK2 (Fig. 3a), indicating less prophylaxis efficiency for H7.HK4 than H7.HK1 and H7.HK2.Since the H7.HK2 and H7.HK4 mAbs bind to different sites on the HA and protect through different mechanisms, we tested the combination of suboptimal dose of 20 μg H7.HK2 (as human IgG1) with 100 μg H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a in the mouse challenge model, using 20 μg H7.HK2 (as human IgG1) with 100 μg H7.HK4 mouse IgG1 as a control. Compared to this control group, which protected 9 out of 10 mice from death and lost up to 11% body weight for mice that survived, the combination of 20 μg of H7.HK2 (as human IgG1) with 100 μg H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a fully protected mice from death, with only up to 7% weight loss, and the weight difference was statistically significant between these two groups since day 3 post challenge (Fig. 3a), indicating a beneficial role of H7.HK4 in mAb combination regimen. Overlaying the survival and body weight data of the 20 μg H7.HK2 alone group from the previous experiment (Fig. 3a), H7.HK2 in combination with H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a did not improve the body weight trough from day 4–6 post challenge as both groups fully protected mice from death with up to 7-8% weight loss; the mAb combination demonstrated a statistical trend and then significance for improved recovery of weight loss starting on day 7 post challenge (Fig. 3a).To assess mAb therapeutic effects, we first i.n. challenged mice (n = 5–10 per group from 1 to 2 experiments) with 10 LD50 of A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 virus, waited for one day, and then on day 1 post challenge i.p. injected mice with 100 μg H7.HK1 or H7.HK2 as human IgG1, or H7.HK4 as mouse IgG2a (Fig. 3b). Twelve and 13 out of 15 mice receiving 100 μg H7.HK1 or H7.HK2 one day after viral challenge initially lost weight similarly to placebo and PBS controls but then started to recover on day 5 after challenge. Therefore, the neutralizing mAbs H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 showed both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies in the mouse lethal challenge model. None of the 5 mice receiving 100 μg H7.HK4 mouse IgG2a one day after challenge survived (Fig. 3b), indicating that H7.HK4 as mouse IgG2a demonstrated measurable prophylactic effect but not therapeutic efficacy.Comparison of H7.HK1/2 to previously published lateral patch antibodiesThus far, there have been two other published structures of lateral patch-binding antibodies on the HA head, 045-09-2B05 (PDB: 7MEM) and Fab6649 (PDB: 5W6G)—both of which bind H143,46. Comparing 045-09-2B05, Fab6649, and H7.HK1 demonstrated diverse angles of approach and different heavy and light chain orientations towards the lateral patch (Fig. 4a). The epitopes of these three antibodies were all centered on the lateral patch, with the composite footprint of all three defining a lateral patch supersite of vulnerability (Fig. 4b). The epitope of H7.HK1 was most similar to that of Fab6649. However, the light chain of H7.HK1 was in a slightly higher position on the head of HA than the heavy chain of Fab6649 (Fig. 4a, b), which allowed CDR L1 to clash with the 220-loop. H7.HK1 heavy chain overlapped with the light chain of 045-09-2B05, and the heavy chain of 045-09-2B05 occupied an epitope distinct from H7.HK1, H7.HK2, and Fab6649. The epitopes of 045-09-2B05 and Fab6649 had modest overlap, centered around the conserved lateral patch (Fig. 4c colored in magenta). Of this overlapping epitope surface, there were four residues conserved between H1 and H7 (positions E121, S/T126, Y168, and R/K172). The overall structure of this site of vulnerability was also conserved between H1 and H7 (Fig. 4c). Comparison of the interactions between Fab6649, 045-09-2B05, H7.HK1, H7.HK2, and these four conserved HA residues revealed different modes of recognition for each antibody (Fig. 4d). Thus, the lateral patch supersite, as defined by Fab6649, 045-09-2B05, H7.HK1, and H7.HK2, was composed in part by residues that were conserved in H1 and H7 and could be targeted via diverse chemistries and modes of recognition.Fig. 4: H7.HK1 and two other lateral patch-binding antibodies define a conserved supersite of vulnerability on the HA head.a Representation of H7.HK1, Fab6649, and 045-09-2B05 bound to their respective HAs indicates diverse angles of approach and heavy/light chain orientations towards the lateral patch supersite. b Comparison of epitopes of H7.HK1, Fab6649, and 045-09-2B05 centering on the lateral patch defines the lateral patch supersite (blue). c A subset of epitope surface, centered on the lateral patch, overlaps between H7.HK1, Fab6649, and 045-09-2B05 (magenta). Of shared epitope surface, a subset of epitope residues is conserved (positions 121, 126, 168, and 172 by H3 numbering). d The four lateral patch antibodies contact conserved residues using diverse chemistry. Table displays the type of interaction between each residue and antibody.Full size imageDiscussionAlready endemic, adapted, and evolved in humans for 11 years, H7N9 continues to pose risk and infect humans exposed to infected poultry in China. While the current risk to public health is low, the pandemic potential of H7N9 is especially concerning if it were to gain the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission. Based on its biological features such as dual affinity for avian and human receptors, high case-fatality rate, resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, and lack of pre-existing immunity in the human populations, there is an immediate need and interest to develop human mAb prophylaxis and therapeutics against H7N9, to which a specific treatment or licensed vaccine (for humans) is not available.In this study, we identified two HA1-directed clonally related human mAbs H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 that neutralized H7N9 with potencies and mouse protection efficacies (prophylactic and therapeutic) in line with the best of previous H7N9 mAbs. Specifically, a combined phage library from three H7N9 convalescent cases yielded a single neutralizing mAb clone18, represented by the best clonal member, HNIgGA6, which neutralized H7N9 and protected mice against a lethal challenge at 5 mg/kg with up to about 10% weight loss18. Likewise, from a study of four H7N9 acutely infected cases, the best mAb L4A-14 cloned from plasmablasts protected mice against a lethal challenge at 10 mg/kg with up to about 10% weight loss17. The most potent mAb H7.167 from a study of EBV transformed B cells from five representative H7N9 experimental vaccinees neutralized H7N9 and protected mice against a sub-lethal challenge of H7-PR8 at 1.65 mg/kg without apparent weight loss19. The best HA1-directed neutralizing mAb 07-5F01 from a study of H7N9 experimental vaccinees’ plasmablasts protected mice against a lethal challenge at 0.3 mg/kg without apparent weight loss20. The broad HA1 trimer interface mAb FluA-20 from a healthy donor with extensive influenza vaccinations lacked in vitro neutralization but protected mice against a sub-lethal challenge of H7-PR8 at 10 mg/kg without apparent weight loss21. In comparison, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 protected mice against a lethal challenge at 1 mg/kg with up to 12% weight loss.We have also structurally defined the epitopes of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 to the β14-centered surface of H7 HA1, partially overlapping with antigenic site D, targeting a lateral patch43 rather than the commonly targeted RBS and trimer interface by previous H7N9 mAbs28. Structural comparisons demonstrated that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 interacted with H7 differently from L4A-14, H7.167, 07-5F01, and FluA-20. By escape mutations, a previous H3 neutralizing mAb D1-8 was mapped to the lower part of antigenic site D towards site E47; this epitope partially overlaps with the H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 epitope described here. However, without structural data, the action of neutralization by D1-8 cannot be determined. Importantly, D1-8 does not react to H7, and likewise, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 do not react to H3. Hence, D1-8 cannot replace the anti-H7N9 function of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2. The unique β14-targeting epitope on the HA1 lateral patch would render H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 favorable candidates for combination prophylaxis and therapy against H7N9 to augment protection efficacy and increase the genetic barrier for viral escape. This is supported by data showing no competition between H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 with two RBS and one non-RBS directed antibodies (Fig. 2f). Indeed, the H1 lateral patch has been a promising target for next-generation H1 vaccine strategy as previous studies showed that H1 lateral patch-binding antibodies are abundant in humans, and that they react broadly with H1 viruses and cross react with some H3 viruses46,48. Our work here demonstrates that the lateral patch is a viable epitope for H7 vaccine and therapeutic antibody development as well. Previously reported lateral patch antibodies are all restricted to expressing IGHV3 or IGHV4-39 genes and often had a Y-x-R motif in CDR H343,46. H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 are derived from IGHV4-59 and do not contain a Y-x-R motif in CDR H3. In addition, unlike other reported lateral patch antibodies, H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 disrupt the structure of the 220-loop of the H7 RBS. Therefore, the lateral patch binding site of HA1 is expanded to H7 and composed in part with residues conserved between H1 and H7, which makes it a supersite of vulnerability that could be targeted by more diverse antibodies than previously recognized.H7N9 has evolved over time and its HA gene has significantly changed in 2016–2017 compared to that of 2013. Consequently, most neutralizing mAbs isolated from individuals infected or vaccinated with the 2013 H7 HA lost reactivity to 2016–2017 isolates, requiring updated H7 immunogens for mAb and vaccine development17. We show that three mutations appeared in 2016–2017 are located at the periphery of the H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 epitopes and confirmed that the binding profiles of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 are intact to both 2016 and 2017 HA1s as compared to 2013 HA1. We also showed that H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 retained their neutralization titers against the H7N9 2017 pseudo virus. The previous RBS-directed mAb HNIgGA6 was shown to lose reactivity to V186G and L226Q mutations18 that are present in A/Netherlands/219/2003 H7N7 and A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 H7N9, respectively. Evaluated by both antigen binding and pseudo virus neutralization, H7.HK2 is superior to the two best previous RBS-directed mAbs L4A-14 and H7.167 and matches the one best previous non-RBS mAb 07-5F01 against H7N9.Lastly, we tested a suboptimal dose of H7.HK2 combining with the HA2-directed non-neutralizing mAb H7.HK4 against mouse lethal challenge. Compared to HA1 (head domain of HA), the HA2 (stalk domain) is genetically more conserved. Hence, HA2-directed mAbs typically display broader recognition of HA subtypes than HA1-directed mAbs. This is indeed the case for H7.HK4, i.e., in addition to H7N9 and H7N7, it also recognized the HAs from H10N8 and H15N8, to which both H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 had no reactivity. When converted to mouse IgG2a enabling Fc effector function in mice, H7.HK4 demonstrated moderate prophylactic protection at 5 mg/kg and augmented mouse protection of H7.HK2, supporting the inclusion of HA2-directed antibodies in a mAb combination regimen against H7N9.In summary, from a 2013 H7N9 convalescent case occurring in Hong Kong, we isolated two clonally related HA1-directed neutralizing mAbs H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 that demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies in a mouse lethal challenge model. Cryo-EM structures revealed a β14-centered site of vulnerability targeted by H7.HK1 and H7.HK2, those being the first reported antibodies to bind to the H7 lateral patch. Recognition of this conserved epitope facilitates near full binding and neutralization capacity of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 to the later 2016–2017 H7N9 isolates. This unique epitope at the lateral patch of HA1 renders H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 favorable candidates for combination prophylaxis and therapy against H7N9, which may include multiple HA1-directed neutralizing mAbs targeting different epitopes and benefit from the inclusion of HA2-directed mAbs as well.MethodsCollection of human specimensA blood specimen was collected from the H7N9_HK2013 patient about one year after recovery from a hospitalized severe H7N9 infection. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. Each specimen is unique and cannot be replaced once processed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Hong Kong and the Hospital Authority (Reference number: UW-13-265).Plasmids, viruses, antibodies, and cellsExpression plasmids encoding the H7 hemagglutinin and N9 neuraminidase based on A/Shanghai/4664T/2013 H7N9 strain were obtained from Dr. Jianqing Xu39. Codon-optimized gene encoding the H7 hemagglutinin of A/Hong Kong/125/2017 H7N9 was synthesized (Twist Bioscience) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). HIV-1 NL4-3Δenv.Luc.R-E- backbone was obtained through the NIH HIV Reagent Program as contributed by Dr. Nathaniel Landau. These plasmids were used to co-transfect 293T cells to generate H7N9 pseudo viruses. All live replicating influenza A viruses used in this study were isolated from patients and include A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 H7N914, A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 H7N93, A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 (obtained from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 H5N1, A/Hong Kong/459094/2010 H5N1, A/Hong Kong/1073/1999 H9N2, A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 H1N1, and A/Hong Kong/400500/2015 H3N2. DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of previous H7N9 mAbs L4A-14 (PDB: 6II4), H7.167 (PDB: 5V2A), and 07-5F01 (GenBank KU987563 and KU987564) were synthesized (Twist Bioscience) and cloned into the corresponding human gamma, kappa, and lambda chain expression vectors described49,50,51. Full IgG1 was expressed by co-transfecting Expi293F cells with equal amounts of paired heavy and light chain plasmids and purified using recombinant protein A agarose (Thermo Fisher). The non-H7N9 placebo mAb used in this study, AD358_n1, has been described51 and is specific to HIV-1 gp120. Human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, of which the sex is female, is the parental cell for 293T and Expi293F cell lines. 293T was obtained from ATCC (Cat. No. CRL-11268, Clone 17) and maintained as adherent cells in complete DMEM medium at 37 °C. 293T is highly transfectable and contains SV40 T-antigen. Expi293F was obtained from Thermo Fisher (Cat. No. A14527) and adapted to suspension culture in Expi293 Expression Medium at 37 °C. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line, of which the sex is female, was obtained from ATCC (Cat. No. CCL-34) and maintained as adherent cells in complete DMEM medium at 37 °C. The vendors provided certificates of analysis for the cell lines. No further authentication was performed on cell lines used in this study.Single B cell sorting by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS)A soluble recombinant HA ΔTM antigen based on A/Shanghai/2/2013 H7N9 (Immune Technologies, Cat. No. IT-003-0074ΔTMp) was biotinylated via EZ-Link (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. A39256), followed by streptavidin mediated conjugation of phycoerythrin (PE) (Invitrogen, Cat. No. SA10041). The patient PBMCs were stained with an antibody cocktail to CD3-PE-CF594 (BD Biosciences, Cat. No. 562406, Clone SP34-2), CD19-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, Cat. No. 302216, Clone HIB19), CD20-APC-Cy7 (BioLegend, Cat. No. 302314, Clone 2H7), IgG-FITC (BD Biosciences, Cat. No. 555786, Clone G18-145), and IgM-V450 (BD Biosciences, Cat. No. 561286, Clone G20-127). In addition, live/dead yellow stain (Invitrogen, Cat. No. L34968) was used to exclude dead cells. All staining antibodies were purchased from vendors providing Quality Certificates and further validated on healthy human blood donor PBMCs purchased from New York Blood Center. After washing, H7-PE+ B cells were sorted using a multi-laser MoFlo sorter (Beckman Coulter, Jersey City, NJ). Fluorescence compensation was performed with anti-mouse Ig kappa CompBeads (BD Biosciences, Cat. No. 552843). Individual B cells were sorted into a 96-well PCR plate, each well containing 20 μL lysis buffer composed of 0.5 μL RNaseOut (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 10777019), 5 μL 5x first-strand buffer, 1.25 μL 0.1 M DTT, and 0.0625 μL Igepal (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The PCR plate with sorted cells was frozen on dry-ice and then stored at −80 °C. The total cell sample passing through the sorter was analyzed with FlowJo 10.0 (TreeStar, Cupertino, CA).Single B cell RT-PCR, sequencing, and cloningFrom each sorted cell, the variable regions of IgG heavy and light chains were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into expression vectors as previously described51. Briefly, frozen plates with single B cell RNA were thawed at room temperature, and RT was carried out by adding into each well 3 μL random hexamers at 150 ng/μL (Gene Link, Cat. No. 26-4000-03), 2 μL dNTP (each at 10 mM), and 1 μL SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 18064022), followed by incubation at 42 °C for 2 h. We note that these RT parameters may be suboptimal to those described previously49,50. After RT, 25 μL water was added to each well to dilute cDNA, and the cDNA plates were stored at −20 °C for later use. The variable regions of heavy, kappa, and lambda chains were amplified independently by nested PCR in 50 μL, using 5 μL cDNA as template, with HotStarTaq Plus DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Cat. No. 203605) and primer mixes as described49,52. Cycler parameters were 94 °C for 5 m, 50 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52–55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 m, followed by 72 °C for 10 m. The PCR amplicons were subjected to direct Sanger sequencing, and the antibody sequences were analyzed using IMGT/V-QUEST. Selected PCR sequences that gave productive gamma, kappa, and lambda chain rearrangements were re-amplified with custom primers containing unique restriction digest sites and cloned into the corresponding human gamma, kappa, and lambda chain expression vectors as described49,50,51. Full IgG1 was expressed by co-transfecting Expi293F cells with equal amounts of paired heavy and light chain plasmids and purified using recombinant protein A agarose (Thermo Fisher).ELISA and competition ELISAH7N9 ΔTM HA and HA1 based on A/Shanghai/2/2013, HA1s based on A/Guangdong/17SF003/ 2016, A/Hong Kong/125/2017, and H7N7 ΔTM HA based on A/Netherlands/219/2003 were purchased from Immune Technologies (Cat. No. IT-003-0074ΔTMp, IT-003-0074p, IT-003-0075p, IT-003-0076p, IT-003-0081ΔTMp). Other non-H7 ΔTM HA proteins were purchased from Sino Biological (Cat. No. 40787-V08H, 11688-V08H, 40868-V08B, 40359-V08B, 11720-V08H). ELISA plates were coated with HA or HA1 antigens at 2 μg/mL in PBS at 4 °C overnight. For Endo H treatment, the required amount of antigen was diluted in 10x buffer and mixed with 1 μL Endo H (New England BioLabs, Cat. No. P0702S) at 37 °C for 1 h; an equal amount of antigen (untreated) was processed under identical condition without Endo H. Both treated and untreated antigens were diluted in PBS to coat ELISA plates. Coated plates were blocked with 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBS, followed by incubation with serially diluted mAbs at 37 °C for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat. No. 109-035-098) was added at 1:10,000 at 37 °C for 1 h. All ELISA incubation volumes were 100 μL/well except that 200 μL/well was used for blocking. Plates were washed between steps with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Novex, Life Technologies), with 1 M H2SO4 as terminator and read at 450 nm. For competitive ELISA, plates were coated with 2 μg/mL of H7N9 ΔTM HA. After blocking, serial dilutions of competing mAbs were added in 50 μL of blocking buffer, followed by addition of 50 μL of biotin labeled H7.HK2 at 100 ng/mL. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the plates were washed and then incubated with 250 ng/mL of streptavidin-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat. No. 016-030-084) at ambient temperature for 30 m before development with TMB as described above. Similar results were independently reproduced at least once.SDS-PAGE and Western blotCleaved HA protein from A/Shanghai/1/2013 H7N9 (HA1 + HA2, cleavage) (Sino Biological, Cat. No. 40104-V08H4) was added at 1 µg with 4x SDS loading buffer with reduced reagent and heated at 70 °C for 10 m. The protein was separated on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membrane semi-dry with the Bio-Rad trans-blot turbo transfer system. The membrane was blocked in 2% skim milk in PBS-T, followed by incubation with mAb H7.HK2 or H7.HK4 as primary antibody at 1 µg/mL in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat. No. 109-035-098) was used as secondary antibody at 1:10,000 in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoreactive band was detected with ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. A38555). Similar results were independently reproduced at least once.H7N9 neutralization assaysH7N9 neutralization was first measured with a single-round infection of MDCK cells using pseudo viruses expressing the H7 gene from A/Shanghai/4664T/2013 H7N9 or A/Hong Kong/125/2017 H7N9, and the N9 gene from A/Shanghai/4664T/2013 H7N9, pseudotyped with the HIV-1 NL4-3Δenv.Luc.R-E- backbone39. In 96-well plate, 70 μL of antibody-virus mixture were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in triplicate wells before transferring to pre-seeded MDCK cells, followed by the addition of 35 μL of medium containing DEAE-dextran at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. To keep assay conditions constant, sham medium was used in place of antibody in control wells. Infection levels were determined 2 days later with Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Cat. No. E1501). Neutralization curves were fitted by a 5-parameter nonlinear regression built in Prism 9.5.1 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The 50% inhibitory titers (IC50s) were reported as the antibody concentrations required to inhibit infection by 50%. H7N9 neutralization was next measured using live replicating influenza viruses to infect MDCK cells as described53. Briefly, serially diluted mAbs were incubated with 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of an influenza virus at 37 °C for 2 h, and 100 μL virus-mAb mixture was added to MDCK cells. After 1 h incubation, the virus-mAb mixture was removed, and minimum-essential medium with 2 μg/mL L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (TPCK-trypsin) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 72 h, and cytopathic effects were recorded. The mAb concentration that protected 50% of 5 replicate wells from cytopathology was reported as IC50. Similar results were independently reproduced at least once.H7 HA productionSoluble, disulfide-stabilized, fully cleaved H7 HA trimers were produced by transient co-transfection of plasmids encoding H7 HA (H7 SH13 DS2 6R) and Furin of Expi293F cells (Life Technologies) using Turbo293 transfection Reagent (Speed biosystem). After 5 days at 37 °C, culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and concentrated 5-fold by Tangential Flow Filtration. The recombinant HA trimer was captured by Ni-NTA (Sigma-Aldrich) through a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The imidazole eluant was combined 1:1 (v/v) with saturated ammonium sulfate, centrifuged at 4 °C, and pellet removed. The supernatant was dialyzed against 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8, and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva).Human mAb Fab preparationHuman mAb Fab fragments were produced by digestion of the full IgG antibodies with immobilized Papain (ThermoFisher) equilibrated with 25 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 10, and 2 mM EDTA for 3 h. The resulting Fabs were purified from the cleaved Fc domain by affinity chromatography using protein A. Fab purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All Fabs were buffer-exchanged into 25 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 prior to cryo-EM experiments.Cryo-EM sample preparation, data collection, and structure determinationTo determine the structures of H7.HK1 and H7.HK2 with H7 HA trimer, trimer was mixed with the antibody Fab at 1 to 1.2 molar ratio at a final total protein concentration of ~1 mg/mL and adjusted to a final concentration of 0.005% (w/v) n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) to prevent preferred orientation and aggregation during vitrification. Cryo-EM grids were prepared by applying 3 μL of sample to a freshly glow discharged carbon-coated copper grid (CF 1.2/1.3 300 mesh). The sample was vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV with a wait time of 30 s, a blot time of 3 s, and a blot force of 0. Cryo-EM data were collected on a Titan Krios operating at 300 keV, equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan) operating in counting mode. Data were acquired using Leginon54. The dose was fractionated over 50 raw frames. For all structures, the movie frames were aligned and dose-weighted55 using cryoSPARC 3.456; the CTF estimation, particle picking, 2D classifications, ab initio model generation, heterogeneous refinements, homogeneous 3D refinements and non-uniform refinement calculations were carried out using cryoSPARC 3.456.Atomic model building and refinementFor structural determination, a model of the antibody Fab was generated using SAbPred57. The Fab model and the crystal structure of an H7 HA mutant (PDB: 6IDD)10 was docked into the cryo-EM density map using UCSF Chimera58 to build an initial model of the complex. The model was then manually rebuilt to the best fit into the density using Coot59 and refined using Phenix60. Interface calculations were performed using PISA61. Structures were analyzed and figures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org) and UCSF Chimera58. Final model statistics are summarized in Table S1.H7 HA sequence analysisSearching the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) with H7Nx returned a total of N = 1511 H7 HA sequences, with N = 2 H7N2, N = 2 H7N3, N = 2 H7N4, N = 54 H7N7, and N = 1451 H7N9. After removing N = 28 duplicate or defective sequences, N = 1483 H7 amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal62, and the sequence conservation analysis was performed using AL2CO63.Mouse prophylactic and therapeutic studiesThe mouse prophylactic and therapeutic studies were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR) of the University of Hong Kong (Reference number: 4011-16) and conducted in biosafety level 3 animal facilities as described previously64,65,66. Female BALB/c mice were imported from Harlan UK Ltd, UK, and those of 6–8 weeks of age were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong. Mice were housed at temperatures between 22 to 25 °C with dark/light cycles and given access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum. For prophylactic study, one day before virus inoculation, each mouse was administered with 100 µL of mAb at 1 mg/mL intraperitoneally. For therapeutic study, infected mice were administered with 100 µL of mAb at 1 mg/mL intraperitoneally at day 1 post viral challenge. Mice in the control groups were administered with either PBS or with a non-H7N9 mAb. On the day of virus infection, each mouse was inoculated with 10 LD50 (40 μL) of H7N9/AH1 virus through intranasal route. Virus inoculation was performed under ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) anesthesia. The mice were monitored for 14 days with disease severity score and body weight recorded daily. Disease severity were scored as follow: Score 0, apparently healthy; Score 1, mild disease symptom with ruffled fur but still active; Score 2, medium disease symptom with ruffled fur, reduced activity and no weight gain; Score 3, severe disease symptoms with ruffled fur, hunched posture, labored breathing and weight loss; Score 4, moribund being very inactive, showing difficulty moving around and accessing to food and water, and weight loss. The predefined humane endpoints were either a weight loss of ≥20% or a disease severity score of 4. Mice were euthanized if the humane endpoints were reached. Each study group included 5–15 randomly allocated female mice for calculating survival rates and statistically significant differences based on the viral challenge model previously established with only female mice64,65,66. The investigators were blinded to animal group allocation during data collection.Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism 9.5.1 was used to plot the ELISA data using sigmoidal dose-response with variable slope for curve fitting and neutralization data using 5-parameter nonlinear regression for curve fitting. All quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard error (SEM). GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 was used to plot the mouse survival curves. Two-sided unpaired student’s t-test in GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 and Microsoft 365 Excel version 2404 was used for comparisons between mouse groups. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant; P values of 0.05-0.10 were considered statistical trends.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Innovators & Disruptors Economy 4.0 HealthWatch Eat Move Sleep Love Mental Health Health Essentials Spotlight On: Gut Health Watch CBS News HealthWatch U.S. to make millions of bird flu vaccine doses this summer, as cases grow By Alexander Tin Edited By Paula Cohen May 31, 2024 / 2:19 PM EDT / CBS News Bird flu cases tied to dairy cattle outbreak Third human case of bird flu tied to dairy cattle outbreak 02:08 Some 4.8 million doses of flu vaccine are now being prepared for use in response to the growing U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or H5N1, officials say. The order for the doses to be filled into vials comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a growing number of human cases linked to the unprecedented outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle this year. The supplies will be pulled from a "pre-pandemic" stockpile funded by the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. Vaccinemaker CSL Seqirus has been tasked with manufacturing the doses at its North Carolina plant. "It utilizes a highly scalable method of production and is currently positioned to deliver up to 150 million influenza vaccine doses to support an influenza pandemic response within six months of a pandemic declaration," CSL Seqirus said in a release.The doses combine bulk stockpiles of two key ingredients: an "antigen" targeted at the H5 portion of the H5N1 virus with an "adjuvant" designed to boost the immune response triggered by the vaccine. While manufacturing of these new bird flu doses is set to be completed by "later this summer," the vaccines still may not be immediately ready for use."I do want to decouple availability and manufacturing completion, because there is of course that regulatory component that would be needed to either approve or authorize actual use of the doses," ASPR's David Boucher told reporters Thursday.The FDA has previously approved other vaccines to prepare for potential H5N1 pandemics, including a vaccine by Seqirus. It is unclear how soon the FDA could grant authorization to clear use of the new shots. "While CDC's current risk assessment to the general public is low, if it is determined that the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated to prevent H5N1 influenza, then the FDA will use its regulatory pathways to take the appropriate steps to ensure vaccines are available in the timeliest manner possible," an FDA spokesperson said in a statement. Boucher also said that authorities have so far not decided whether to recommend use of the vaccines. It is unclear who would be prioritized for the first shots if they are eventually deemed to be needed and rolled out for the public."If that changes in the future, we would be looking at the population for whom vaccination would be recommended and then making any decisions on prioritization at that time," said Boucher.A panel of the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, which has discussed previous pandemic vaccines, is scheduled to meet in June to discuss H5N1 alongside its routine votes on recommendations for seasonal flu vaccines. While the CDC says the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low for now, the agency has warned that workers in places like dairy farms and production facilities are now at higher risk of infection and it has urged the industry to take precautions.At least three workers at U.S. dairy farms have tested positive this year after working directly with infected cows. The latest case in Michigan developed respiratory symptoms, officials announced Thursday, which could make it easier for the virus to spread from person to person. "Simply put, someone who's coughing may be more likely to transmit the virus than someone who has an eye infection like conjunctivitis," the CDC's Nirav Shah said Thursday. However, Shah said there is no evidence that person-to-person spread has happened so far. Contacts of the patient have so far not tested positive. Previous H5N1 spillovers around the world from different strains have also fizzled out after limited spread between people.The CDC is now looking to see if the strain that infected the latest Michigan patient might have developed key mutations that could raise its risk of spread."The mere fact that this individual displayed some respiratory symptoms, again we should be alert, but in and of itself is not a cause to change course or suggest that we're at an inflection point," Shah said.

A third person in the US has tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus, health officials announced Thursday. Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC/AP CNN — A third person in the US has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday. This is the second human case reported in the state and the fourth ever in the US. This time, in addition to some of the eye symptoms seen with previous H5N1 cases, the farmworker reported a cough and other respiratory symptoms that are more typical of human influenza infections, the health department said. “This individual had respiratory symptoms, including a cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes,” Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday.

CDC/NIAID Related article Alpacas test positive for H5N1 bird flu for the first time “What the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,” he added. Experts said that the addition of respiratory symptoms doesn’t necessarily indicate that the virus has become more dangerous or that it may transmit more easily from person to person. Instead, they say, the person probably developed lung symptoms because of the route of infection, perhaps by breathing in infectious aerosols in the milking parlor instead of rubbing their eyes with contaminated hands. “With the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,” Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for Michigan, said in a news release. “Neither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.” About 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said. Michigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct blood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past infections or exposures. The CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those who work with infected animals. Dairy cows stand together at a farm, Monday, April 1, 2024, in Clinton, Maine. Federal health and agriculture officials pledged new spending and other efforts Friday, May 10, 2024, to help track and contain an outbreak of bird flu in the nation's dairy cows that has spread to more than 40 herds in nine states. Robert F. Bukaty/AP Related article Meat from condemned dairy cow tested positive for H5N1 flu virus but did not enter food supply, USDA says The CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. “Previously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this case also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for dairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,” Shah said. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. This is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that’s currently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye infections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The person had direct contact with infected cattle and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick. Their symptoms are described as mild. The patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they are isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered antiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are being monitored, the CDC said. “Given the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,” said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns. “Every time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,” Lakdawala said. Flu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and N, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein, and the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected. It expects to have those results in the next few days. The CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

The US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan to repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National Stockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more easily. Officials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory steps. They also said there’s not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific group of people. The fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the news briefing. In the meantime, Michigan’s health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a seasonal flu vaccine. “It will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses,” the department said.

These mutations can affect the antigenic properties of the virus, influencing how well the immune system can recognise and respond to the virus, and also impact the effectiveness of influenza vaccines. The ongoing tracking of these changes and updating vaccines accordingly are a major challenge. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) system relies on genetic sequencing and extensive laboratory tests conducted by National Influenza Centres and Influenza Collaborating Centres worldwide to assess circulating influenza viruses. These test results inform decisions on vaccine updates for the upcoming season. However, this process is resource-intensive, time-consuming and requires extensive coordination among laboratories across the globe. To address these challenges, a team of researchers, led by University of Melbourne Professor Matthew McKay, Lab Head at the Doherty Institute and the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, has developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict antigenic changes in circulating influenza viruses and their capacity to evade immunity from prior infections or vaccinations. Published in Nature Communications, the model uses genetic sequence data of the viral strain and information from past influenza seasons to predict the outcome of antigenic lab tests that are crucial for determining how a viral strain will react to the current influenza vaccine, whether a vaccine update is required, and if so, what the best vaccine virus would be. University of Melbourne Dr Ahmed Abdul Quadeer, Senior Research Fellow in the McKay lab and co-leader of the research, highlighted the model’s sophistication in predicting viral strain changes. “The mapping between genetic and antigenic changes in influenza virus is complex. Our data-driven machine learning model does a very good job in learning this linkage and provides accurate predictions of the virus's antigenic properties, as we found across the 14 seasons we tested the model on,” said Dr Quadeer. Currently, only a portion of circulating influenza viruses is tested every season, due to practical constraints, such as resources, cost and time. Thanks to its capacity to swiftly analyse vast amount of data, the machine learning model has the potential to predict antigenic properties for all sequenced circulating viruses in that season. By providing a more complete understanding of the influenza antigenic landscape, the data-driven model can not only provide complementary input to existing surveillance protocols and guide vaccine strain selection, but also offers valuable insights into virus evolution. The Royal Melbourne Hospital’s Professor Ian Barr, Deputy Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute, underscored the transformative potential of the machine learning model. “Machine learning and AI tools present scientific advances that have the potential to transform our approach to managing seasonal influenza and potentially other infectious diseases,” said Professor Barr. Researchers have packaged the model for seasonal influenza antigenic prediction into an easy-to-use web application. Peer review: Shah S, et al.

That worker was employed at a different farm than the worker in the case announced on May 22.Officials say the risk to the general public is still low, and the farmworker who tested positive was given antivirals and is currently recovering from respiratory symptoms, including a cough and eye discomfort with a watery discharge. The worker did not have a fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Household contacts with the infected farmworker haven't developed any symptoms, and no other workers at the same farm have reported bird flu symptoms. "Michigan has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan," chief medical executive Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian said. "Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available. With the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow." Health officials say in both Michigan cases, neither farmworker was wearing full protective gear. "Proper use of personal protective equipment is the best tool we have to protect farm workers," Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring said. "MDARD is currently offering assistance to dairy farms in need of additional protective equipment. MDARD has and will continue to take bold actions to assist farms impacted by this disease."The first case of bird flu in a human was detected in a Texas farmworker who was exposed to infected dairy cattle. Bird flu was first detected in Michigan in dairy herds that arrived in Michigan from Texas, and have since been found in Clinton, Gratiot and Ionia counties. Earlier this month, Michigan egg producer Herbuck's Poultry Ranch announced that it was laying off about 400 employees. The company said the virus impacted its hen population at some farms in Ionia County. Guidelines issued for Michigan dairy farmsMichigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development issued guidelines for producers to help reduce the spread of avian influenza. Michigan dairy farms and poultry operations must implement the following, under the order that went into effect on May 8: Designate a biosecurity managerDesignate a line of separation to represent the perimeter of a secure area, limiting access pointsEstablish cleaning and disinfection practices and procedures at those access points for both vehicles and individuals, including deliveries of feed and other supplies, and training for employeesEstablish a logbook maintaining a record of all vehicles and of individuals who have gotten out of vehicles and crossed those access points, to be retained and made available for examination upon request by MDARD.

This marks the first time that this strain of bird flu has been detected in these gentle camelids. PDF FILE In a surprising turn of events, alpacas have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. This marks the first time that this strain of bird flu has been detected in these gentle camelids. The discovery was made by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Let’s delve into the details of this unprecedented finding. The Outbreak The infected alpacas were part of a farm in Idaho where poultry had previously tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The poultry were subsequently culled in May. On May 16, the alpacas themselves tested positive, according to a press release from the USDA. While the presence of other infected animals on the same farm was not necessarily surprising, the genetic sequence of the isolated viruses revealed a close relationship to the H5N1 strains currently circulating in dairy cattle. What is Avian Influenza? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a viral disease that mainly affects birds, although in rare cases it can infect humans and other mammals. It is caused by different strains of the influenza A virus, with the H5N1 subtype being one of the best known and most feared due to its high mortality rate in birds and its occasional ability to transmit to humans, causing severe illness and even death. Symptoms in birds include respiratory problems, swelling of the head and cyanosis of the crest and legs. In humans, symptoms may be similar to those of seasonal influenza, but can rapidly progress to severe complications such as pneumonia and organ failure. Avian influenza is of concern because of its potential to cause epidemic and pandemic outbreaks, making it a public health concern and a priority in global infectious disease surveillance and control. Alpacas and Avian Influenza In the United States, there are over 264,000 registered alpacas, according to the Alpaca Owners Association. For approximately two decades, scientists have closely monitored the H5N1 virus. Initially affecting primarily birds, the virus has recently expanded its host range to include a broader variety of wild and domestic mammals. This shift raises concerns that it may be approaching the ability to easily transmit between humans. While sporadic human cases have been reported worldwide over the years, including three in the United States, there has been no documented person-to-person transmission in the current bovine outbreak in the U.S.Continue after advertising. Implications and Future Research The detection of H5N1 in alpacas highlights the need for continued vigilance in monitoring and understanding the spread of avian influenza. Researchers must investigate the potential risks posed by this virus to both animal and human health. As the virus continues to evolve, it remains crucial to assess its ability to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts. Conclusion The recent finding of avian influenza H5N1 in alpacas underscores the interconnectedness of animal health and human health. While alpacas may seem an unlikely host for this virus, their positive test results serve as a reminder that infectious diseases can surprise us. Vigilance, research, and collaboration across disciplines are essential to safeguarding both animal populations and human communities. Sources: Available upon request.

PDF FILE In recent years, the Netherlands has taken significant steps to protect its population and poultry industry from Avian Influenza H5N1. The government of the Netherlands confirmed its plans to use vaccination as part of the preventive strategy to combat Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1, after confirming that, in practice, it is an effective measure for the protection of laying hens. This determination was preceded by a series of tests carried out last year with positive results, involving two drugs produced by the French pharmaceutical company Ceva Salud Animal and the German firm Boehringer Ingelheim. Both vaccines were administered to a group of 1,800 one-day-old chickens, guaranteeing protection for up to eight weeks after inoculation, as reported by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. The H5N1 virus: A global challenge Since 2022, sporadic cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus have been reported in humans worldwide. Most of these cases have been linked to exposure to infected poultry. Notably, there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1. However, the virus’s ability to evolve rapidly and its prevalence in wild birds and poultry continue to pose risks. The Netherlands’ approachContinue after advertising. The Netherlands has proactively addressed the H5N1 threat by implementing vaccination strategies. Here are key points regarding their approach: Vaccination for poultry: The Netherlands has prioritized vaccinating poultry, including both domestic and wild birds. By reducing the prevalence of the virus in avian populations, they aim to minimize the risk of transmission to humans. Human cases: The Netherlands reported a single case of H5N1 infection in a farm worker in April 2024. The individual had been exposed to presumably infected dairy cattle. This case highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling outbreaks in livestock. Experimental vaccines: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed experimental H5 vaccines (CVVs) that offer promising protection against the current H5N1 strains detected in birds and mammals, including dairy cattle. These vaccines are crucial tools in preventing further human infections. EMA recommendations: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently recommended standard marketing authorization for Celldemic, a zoonotic H5N1 influenza vaccine developed by Seqirus Netherlands BV. This authorization will enhance preparedness and response efforts. Conclusion The Netherlands’ commitment to vaccination and surveillance underscores the importance of a coordinated global response to avian influenza. As the virus continues to evolve, ongoing vigilance and preparedness remain critical. By staying informed and implementing evidence-based strategies, we can mitigate the risks posed by H5N1 and protect both human and animal health. Sources: Available upon request.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical interventions, including lockdowns, quarantines, masking, and social distancing, were strictly enforced in many countries to prevent spread of the novel virus. As a consequence, there was a reduction in the global incidence of other communicable viral, bacterial, and airborne infectious diseases. However, as pandemic-related restrictions have gradually lifted, many countries, especially high-income countries, are reporting a resurgence in communicable infectious diseases.1 Rise in Tuberculosis, Measles, and Influenza Although measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, measles outbreaks were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to be reported in the post-pandemic era. Between January 1, 2020 and March 28, 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was alerted to 338 confirmed cases of measles, 91% of which occurred in unvaccinated individuals and those with an unknown vaccination status. Nearly one-third of these diagnoses occurred in the first quarter of 2024, indicating a 17-fold increase relative to the number of diagnoses reported in the first quarters of 2020 through 2023.2 Given this resurgence, the CDC now considers the elimination of measles to be under threat in the US.3 The US has historically had a categorically low incidence of tuberculosis (TB) infection. However, despite a significant decline in TB incidence in 2020, diagnoses of the infection steadily increased in the US across all age groups between 2022 and 2023 (from 2.5 to 2.9 diagnoses per 100,000 persons).4 Similar findings were observed for influenza. Outbreaks of the virus were essentially nonexistent in the US during the pandemic but then returned in the winter of 2021, coinciding with the relaxation of nonpharmacological interventions for COVID-19.5 According to the CDC, there were an estimated 34 million influenza infections, 380,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 24,000 influenza-related deaths in the US during the 2023-2024 season.6 Stuart Ray, MD, Vice Chair of Medicine for Data Integrity and Analytics and Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, spoke with Infectious Disease Advisor to share valuable insights regarding the post-pandemic resurgence of communicable infectious diseases, particularly measles, TB, and influenza. What factors do you think have contributed most significantly to the post-pandemic resurgence of infectious diseases? Dr Ray: The behavioral synergies of social distancing, reduced travel, and masking led to reductions in all 3 of these airborne infectious diseases. Many complex interactions can contribute to this post-pandemic resurgence, including increased testing and surveillance, as well as hypervigilance and anxiety following the pandemic. Lack of funding and inadequate surveillance for TB contribute to this ongoing global scourge. Additionally, drug resistance continues to be a growing problem. TB rates in the US have dropped significantly since the 1960s. Although TB rates have rebounded since the start of the pandemic, they haven’t risen above the original levels of infection observed in the US in the 1960s, which is encouraging. However, drug resistance can undermine efforts to control and prevent the spread of TB. We need new drugs and a vaccine that prevents pulmonary TB, which at this time we lack. Did the interruption of routine vaccination programs during the pandemic play a role in this resurgence? Dr Ray: Although the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine prevents the lethal form of TB, we do not have an effective vaccine for pulmonary TB. Therefore, it is more of a behavioral change that is responsible for the dip in TB infections during the pandemic and its subsequent resurgence. Once TB gets into the lungs, it is very good at evading the immune response. It is hard to prevent TB infection with vaccination, but it is possible to prevent dissemination with vaccination. The vaccine schedule differs for influenza and measles. Influenza vaccines are recommended annually, with children receiving 2 doses. Adults who are unvaccinated for measles usually receive 1 dose, but 2 doses are recommended for health care workers and international travelers. As the measles vaccine is a live vaccine, it cannot be administered to immunocompromised individuals. We are playing catchup for those kids who didn’t receive their 2 doses during the pandemic. For measles, we go through periods of communal epiphanies due to vaccine failure. Influenza is very seasonal. After the pandemic, we saw a disruption of this seasonality. In temperate climates, influenza transmission generally peaks during the colder months. In tropical regions, influenza spreads during the rainy season since there isn’t a cold season. Now, however, it is thought that transmission might be attributable to crowding in indoor spaces more so than cold weather itself, which would explain why transmission essentially halted during a pandemic marked by mask-wearing and social distancing. During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, influenza vaccination rates were higher than in previous years, so we had not only behavioral changes, but also increased vaccination resulting in significantly low rates of influenza infection. Later on, vaccine hesitancy, return to normal behaviors, and indoor crowding resulted in peaks of influenza infection and sustained outbreaks with loss of seasonality. “The post-pandemic resurgence of infectious diseases is a result of increased surveillance, hypervigilance and anxiety around infection, behavioral changes, disruption of vaccine schedules, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and distrust of the healthcare system. Do you think hesitancy and misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines has contributed to vaccine hesitancy toward other infectious diseases? Dr Ray: People might choose not to get vaccinated when they see that vaccinated people are still getting infected. The notion of sterilizing vaccination — the idea that receipt of vaccine equates to zero chance of infection — is generally fiction. What we do see with vaccination is reduced disease severity, transmission, duration, and shedding, but not sterilizing immunity. What vaccines are designed to do is tilt the balance toward increased clearance of infection. For measles, vaccine hesitancy and delay has been well documented and has contributed to post-pandemic outbreaks. There is also an unfortunate intersection of xenophobia with vaccine hesitancy due to people coming to the US from overseas where rates of measles are higher. There are certain groups that resist receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but most of these people are usually still protected by herd immunity if enough of the general population is vaccinated. However, when unvaccinated individuals are not enveloped in a wrapper of herd immunity, measles can enter these vulnerable communities and present with tragic outcomes. Because measles is so transmissible, we need a high rate of immunity (~90%-95%) to maintain resilience against spread. When the rate of acquisition is lower than the rate of transmission, we sustain herd immunity. Part of the equation is building trust within the community, especially religious groups that tend to request exemption from vaccination on religious grounds. When groups that are hesitant about vaccination bear witness to the devastating impacts of those choices, many religious leaders will discuss vaccination with their congregations. This attitudinal shift requires trust and the willingness to call out misinformation. On the topic of misinformation, a Cochrane review reported that masking during COVID-19 didn’t work.7 However, wearing a mask is a behavior, and randomizing a behavior is very hard to do. Meta-analysis of a topic, such as masking, which is not suitable for this type of study, can lead to misinformation.8 Can you describe how pandemic-related restrictions can potentially lead to an “immunity debt”9 in children who are not frequently exposed to more common pathogens? Dr Ray: From a misinformation perspective, immunity debt is a risky concept. It isn’t a debt in terms of the development of the immune system. Everybody accumulates immunologic memory. If you delay those experiences, you are going to get infected at some point if you are around other people. In a sense, it is a debt without interest, meaning you aren’t necessarily going to pay more [over time]. It is true that delayed infection with certain viruses, such as varicella, can be really harmful if you get them at older ages; however, the most common respiratory viruses don’t get much worse as you age. There is also the possibility that individuals gain immunity from getting infected, rather than from vaccination. People who didn’t get influenza during the pandemic may have been more susceptible afterward when an influenza outbreak occurred in the population. In this case, the influenza infection itself is not necessarily worse, it is just that more people are getting infected. What are the most effective strategies to combat the resurgence in infectious diseases in the wake of the pandemic? Dr Ray: For each of these infectious diseases, there are different strategies to control outbreaks. We can reduce TB if we manage drug resistance and treat and screen people. For measles, we need to vaccinate unvaccinated children, reduce distrust, develop a non-live vaccine for immunocompromised individuals, and encourage vaccination among religious groups. In regarding to influenza vaccines, researchers are trying to get away from the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens to see if they can configure something that is less variable and can protect against severe disease. We also need to remove politics from vaccination, but that process will take some time. What lessons from managing the COVID-19 pandemic can be applied to controlling the spread of other infectious diseases? Dr Ray: Increased surveillance and behavioral strategies, such as social distancing and masking, can help control the spread of airborne infectious diseases, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine is pretty effective. As patients, we can see someone when we are unwell and as providers, we can provide care to patients who are sick without exposing ourselves. An important synergy with telemedicine is self-testing capabilities. One of the reasons people go to the doctor’s office when sick is to get tested for certain infections. As point-of-care home testing becomes more reliable, accurate, available, and understandable, we can couple telemedicine with self-testing. Rapid testing can also help mitigate the risk for super spreader events during which younger people are mixing with older people who might be immunocompromised or have different vulnerabilities. Instead of testing for a specific pathogen, developing general testing for the host’s immune response can also help individuals become more aware of an antiviral response they may be experiencing, which may encourage them to think twice before attending an event with at-risk individuals. The pandemic also increased awareness around proper ventilation. Normalizing mask-wearing and the use of respirators in public places to prevent infection spread can help manage risk. Measles is a human virus, so we could eradicate that if we tried. TB is an exclusively human bacterium, although there are some relatives that may be harder to eliminate. Influenza affects all animals, so it would be difficult to eradicate. Key Takeaways The post-pandemic resurgence of communicable infectious diseases is a result of increased surveillance, hypervigilance and anxiety around infection, behavioral changes, disruption of vaccine schedules, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and distrust of the health care system. Dr Ray emphasized the following points with respect to the resurgence of communicable infectious diseases: Vaccines are a public health measure — not a medical one Vaccination is a public good All interventions have inherent risks, though solutions are needed for those that are rare that can be very harmful Vaccination is a societal responsibility and not necessarily about any one person but rather the good of the whole community Building trustworthy systems is critical as distrust causes systems to fail Dr Ray: As a culture, we need to communicate about vaccines and infectious diseases in a way that helps people understand the motivations of public health and the ways in which it benefits us all. There are certain diseases we can eradicate if we got serious about it. We should view eradication of infectious diseases, particularly infections without an animal reservoir, as a goal and a gift to future generations. If we [act] now, future generations might not need vaccines for certain infections. Editor’s Note: This interview was edited for clarity and length. References: Levy C, Cohen R.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has killed or caused the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry globally in recent years, most of them laying hens, which sent egg prices rocketing. A first series of tests by Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) early last year showed that two vaccines against bird flu, produced by France's Ceva Animal Health and Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim, were effective against the virus. "In September 2023, 1,800 day-old chicks were vaccinated against bird flu. The results show that the two tested vaccines are effective against infection with the virus eight weeks after vaccination," the Dutch agriculture ministry said in a statement. "The fact that the vaccines work in practice is a very important step towards the large-scale vaccination of poultry against the bird flu virus," it said. Bird flu is raising mounting concerns as the disease is increasingly spreading to mammals, with the first-ever outbreaks detected in dairy cows in the United States raising concerns about it spreading to humans through the nation's milk supply. More transmission trials will be conducted over the next year and a half to assess the vaccines' effectiveness during the entire laying period, the Dutch ministry said. Australia last week reported its first case of avian influenza in a child who had become infected in India, while a different highly infectious strain was found on an egg farm. "The government intends to make large-scale vaccination possible responsibly, taking into account animal and public health, as well as animal welfare. Also to minimize any unfavorable effects of the vaccination on trade. That is why a step-by-step approach was chosen," it said.

Share this item with your network: By Alivia Kaylor, MSc Published: 28 May 2024 Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection predominantly found in birds but can also infect humans, especially those in close contact with poultry and waterfowl. Influenza A(H5N1) and Influenza A(H7N9) are the most notorious strains affecting humans, which can cause severe respiratory symptoms and other complications. Understanding bird flu's dynamics is crucial, given its potential severity and the increasing proximity between humans and livestock. Transmission and Symptoms Bird flu viruses can infect humans' upper respiratory tract and lungs, spreading to other parts of the body, including the brain. Human infections generally occur through direct contact with an infected animal’s body fluids, such as saliva, respiratory droplets, or feces. Symptoms mirror those of regular flu but can be more severe, including fever, fatigue, cough, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stuffy or runny nose, shortness of breath, and conjunctivitis. Severe complications can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, bacterial infections, sepsis, brain swelling, and respiratory failure. Current Outbreak and Monitoring As of May 2024, H5N1 bird flu is widespread among wild birds and has caused outbreaks in poultry and dairy cattle in the United States, with human cases remaining rare but closely monitored. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented three human cases in the US since 2022, all linked to direct exposure to infected animals. The CDC and state and local health departments continue to monitor those exposed to potentially infected animals rigorously, employing flu surveillance systems to detect H5N1 activity in humans early. Technological Advances in Detection and Monitoring Integrating advanced healthcare technology has significantly enhanced our ability to detect and monitor bird flu outbreaks. Genomic sequencing, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and wastewater surveillance have become pivotal in identifying and tracking avian influenza viruses. Genomic Sequencing Genomic sequencing allows for the detailed analysis of the virus’s genetic material, helping identify mutations that might enhance transmissibility or virulence. This technology is crucial in understanding how bird flu viruses evolve and adapt, potentially guiding the development of more effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. RT-PCR Testing RT-PCR remains the gold standard for detecting avian influenza. It can rapidly and accurately identify the presence of bird flu viruses in human and animal samples. Ensuring healthcare providers have access to RT-PCR testing kits and training is essential for early detection and control of outbreaks. Wastewater Surveillance Recent advancements in wastewater surveillance provide a noninvasive method for monitoring bird flu presence in communities. Public health officials can detect early signs of outbreaks by analyzing wastewater samples for genetic markers of influenza viruses and implementing measures to mitigate spread. Preventive Measures and Risk Mitigation Several preventive measures can reduce the risk of infection for individuals working with poultry or waterfowl. Protective clothing: Wear gloves, masks, and goggles to avoid contact with infected animals. Hygiene practices: Wash hands frequently and maintain sanitation after handling birds. Vaccination: Use avian flu vaccines for high-risk groups like poultry workers. Public health guidelines: Follow guidelines during outbreaks, such as culling infected flocks and enforcing farm biosecurity. The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly important in predicting and managing bird flu outbreaks. By analyzing large datasets, AI can identify patterns and predict where outbreaks are likely to occur, helping public health officials to prepare and respond more effectively. AI algorithms can predict potential hotspots for bird flu outbreaks by analyzing environmental factors, bird migration patterns, and historical data, enabling targeted surveillance and early intervention. Machine learning models enhance diagnostic tools, improving the accuracy and speed of virus detection; for instance, AI-driven image analysis can identify infected tissues in birds more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. Additionally, AI optimizes resource allocation during outbreaks, ensuring vaccines, antiviral medications, and medical personnel are efficiently deployed to areas most in need. Telehealth and Remote Monitoring Telehealth platforms offer a valuable tool for monitoring individuals exposed to bird flu, reducing the need for physical hospital visits and minimizing the risk of further spread. Remote monitoring technologies, including wearable devices and mobile health applications, can track symptoms and vital signs, providing real-time data to healthcare providers. This facilitates timely interventions and continuous patient care, particularly in rural or underserved areas. As bird flu threatens public health, leveraging healthcare technology is crucial in managing and mitigating its impact. From advanced diagnostic tools and genomic sequencing to AI-driven predictive models and telehealth solutions, technology can play a transformative role in enhancing our response to avian influenza outbreaks. For stakeholders, staying abreast of these advancements and integrating them into public health strategies will safeguard human and animal health.

A joint advisory issued on May 25 by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying stated that in 2024, four States — Andhra Pradesh (Nellore), Maharashtra (Nagpur), Kerala (Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Pathanamthitta districts), and Jharkhand (Ranchi) — have already reported outbreaks of Avian influenza in poultry.Also read | Does bird flu have the potential to turn into the next pandemic? "Given that Avian Influenza [H5N1] infection is highly pathogenic and has the potential to be transmitted to humans, it is imperative to take all necessary measures to minimize and prevent the spread of this infection," the joint advisory said. The Avian Influenza virus (bird flu virus) is normally maintained in circulation in nature among mainly migratory birds and is known to cause outbreaks among domesticated poultry birds probably due to spill over events when migratory birds come in contact with poultry, it said. The H5N1 is the main Avian influenza virus that has caused multiple outbreaks among poultry globally. Both types of viruses (HPAI and LPAI) may occasionally affect other mammalian species, including humans. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, the joint advisory said. Although there have been sporadic reports in humans and outbreaks among domestic and wild birds, since March 2024, there is a global concern over Avian influenza outbreaks in cattle from multiple States in the U.S. that have resulted in one reported human case of H5N1, the joint advisory stated. Avian influenza outbreaks from India in poultry have been reported since 2006 and have been jointly investigated by the Animal Husbandry and Health Departments (IDSP, NCDC). The States and Union Territories have been advised to orient all the health care workers/private practitioners on case definitions, signs and symptoms of Avian influenza. The poultry industry needs urgent reforms "Be vigilant for any unusual deaths amongst the domestic birds/poultry in your state, and if observed, please share the information immediately with the Department of Animal Husbandry so that public health action can be initiated as per the national action plan for Avian Influenza," the joint advisory said. The States have been advised to strengthen biosecurity measures in all poultry establishments, zoos, poultry markets, etc. after conducting a thorough assessment. "Comprehensive biosecurity assessments on all poultry farms are recommended. Access to farms should be restricted and stringent hygiene protocols, including the use of disinfectant footbaths and protective clothing, should be enforced. Measures to prevent contact between wild birds and domestic poultry should be implemented," it stated. The States have been asked to enhance information, education and communication tools among the general public regarding preventive measures such as minimizing the handling of dead or sick birds with bare hands and without adequate respiratory protection and following food safety measures while consuming products of animal origin. Besides, they have been asked to be prepared for all preventive measures like stockpiling of an adequate number of antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir), PPE, masks etc. Isolation wards/beds at dedicated hospitals may be required to handle any suspect case of Avian Influenza if confirmation among birds occurs in your state, the joint advisory stated. It also called for enhanced surveillance (in wet markets, abattoirs, poultry farm workers etc.) as well as expanded surveillance (in sewage samples, water bodies, crows etc.) for Avian Influenza in collaboration with National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Department of Animal husbandry and Dairying (DAHD). It emphasised on timely sharing of information besides underlined the need for strict compliance with the SARI surveillance guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by all states and its monitoring at senior level. For the States where there is an active outbreak of Avian Influenza, the joint advisory advised some additional measures. They have been asked to collect samples from cullers and surveillance workers (considered as 'at-risk' groups) on the 5th and 10th days following sanitization operations for H5N1 testing. The joint advisory has stressed on conducting surveillance for suspected human cases and providing health check-ups for cullers and poultry workers, with a duration of 10 days and stated that recommended measures for chemoprophylaxis, management, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented. It also advised following the SOPs for collecting and transporting samples from suspected cases to designated laboratories. "A coordinated response involving experts from veterinary services, health departments, wildlife and forest departments, local authorities and other relevant stakeholders is required in all Avian Influenza outbreaks. Regular meetings should be conducted to share information, assess the situation and adjust strategies accordingly," the joint advisory said.

(REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun)In short: Despite another human case of H5N1 avian influenza in the USA, authorities say the risk to human health remains low.So far the virus, also known as HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza), has spread to 67 dairy herds in nine US states.What's next? Authorities say surveillance and testing of dairy cattle will continue until the outbreak is contained.abc.net.auews/usa-avian-influenza-dairy-cattle-humans-h5n1/103855420Link copiedShareShare articleUnited States health authorities say the risk to human health from a strain of avian influenza spreading through dairy cattle remains low, even after a third case of human infection was recorded in Michigan.The two previous cases, involving dairy workers in Michigan and Texas, reported mild conjunctivitis symptoms that authorities believe were the result of direct contact with milk or other fluids of infected dairy cattle.But the third case, another Michigan dairy worker, has developed respiratory symptoms, according to the Centres for Disease Control (CDC)."As with the previous two cases, the person is a dairy farm worker with exposure to infected cows, making this another instance of probable cow-to-person spread," the CDC said in a statement. "This is the first human case of H5 in the United States to report more typical symptoms of acute respiratory illness associated with influenza virus infection, including A(H5N1) viruses."This is just the fourth case of human infection by this strain of the H5N1 virus — or HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) — in US history.Its low transmissibility combined with the mild symptoms it produces means the CDC still considers the overall risk to human health to be low."This case does not change CDC's current A(H5N1) bird flu human health risk assessment for the US general public because all three sporadic cases had direct contact with infected cows," the CDC said."Risk depends on exposure, and in this case, the relevant exposure is to infected animals," it said."The risk to members of the general public who do not have exposure to infected animals remains low."So far, the avian influenza has been detected in 68 dairy herds in nine US states.The US poultry industry has been dealing with an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza since 2022, but it's a new challenge for the dairy industry. (Unsplash: Max Kleinen)North Carolina State University department of poultry science professor Matt Koci told the ABC that it's important for the virus's spread to be contained before it has a chance to mutate, and potentially become more infectious."In cows, at least, this strain is not fatal — it seems like they're all recovering after a period of days to maybe a couple of weeks," Professor Koci said."We want to get this under control and mopped up as quickly as possible so we don't give the virus more time to potentially mutate and change."So far, there have been no indications that the virus is mutating or is changing in any way that would make this a greater risk to humans."Professor Koci said while the poultry industry, which has been dealing with an avian influenza outbreak since 2022, hasdadapted to work under stricter biosecurity controls, the dairy industry was still catching up."This is something that dairy workers haven't had to deal with before, like poultry workers have," he said.Avian influenza has been detected several times in brown skuas on sub-Antarctic islands. (Bettina Arrigoni, Brown Skua, CC BY 2.0 DEED)Infected milkWhile raw milk samples taken from infected cattle have revealed high levels of the virus, recent testing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found no live viruses in retail products.Health authorities and experts say there's no risk to human health from dairy foods that have been pasteurised. "The pasteurisation process is at a temperature and at a time that far exceeds anything that the virus could survive," Professor Koci said.Genomic analysis of the virus in cattle indicates the highly infectious strain was circulating well before the first cases were detected in Texas on March 23.Scientists at the United States Department of Agriculture and National Veterinary Services Laboratory have traced the spillover from birds to dairy cattle to early December 2023.The analysis, published on biological sciences server bioRxiv, also indicated all of the cases in US dairy cattle stem from a single transmission event.Symptoms in sick cattle include reduced milk production, loss of appetite, fever, lethargy and thickened colostrum-like milk.The dairy industry in New Zealand is on high alert for signs of sick birds following the spread of H5N1 in US dairy cattle. (Brad Markham: ABC Rural)Global spreadAvian influenza has been spreading across the globe for several years according to Massey University professor of infectious disease, epidemiology and pubic health, Nigel French."The H5N1 types have been spreading for some time, but this new variant, the 2.3.4.4b strain, which is the one that's circulating around the world and causing such a huge problem in wild birds, appears to have originated in in Eurasia and spread to every other continent except Oceania," he said.The virus has also been been detected in sea lions in South America, walrus in the Arctic and mink in Europe.The migratory waterfowl that have helped spread the virus across the globe do not transit through Australia, but the virus continues to spread to migratory birds that do pass through Australia.This week, a different strain of avian influenza, called H7N3, was detected on two separate poultry farms in Victoria, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled to limit the spread of the virus. In 2020, a similar strain led to an outbreak of avian influenza on free-range poultry farms in Lethbridge, Victoria, and the culling of over 400,000 birds.

(Reuters: Mariana Nedelcu)abc.net.auews/avian-flu-outbreaks-are-we-ready-for-another-pandemic/103914284Link copiedShareShare articleWhen Victorian health officials confirmed Australia's first human case of an avian influenza known as H5N1 last week, there were a few key details that struck some of those listening as odd.The announcement came on the same day that the state's agriculture department reported an outbreak of bird flu at a poultry farm near Meredith. But the Department of Health made clear that the two incidents were totally unrelated.In fact, the human case, a two-year-old who had recently returned from India, had been detected in early March. One of Australia's leading epidemiologists, Professor Raina MacIntyre, noted the almost three-month delay in reporting the case was "not ideal".The source of the human infection was also somewhat mysterious. Health officials confirmed the child had picked up the highly pathogenic virus while travelling in India, but did not note any close contact with sick animals or other infected humans.Two further outbreaks on Australian poultry farms followed, prompting hundreds of thousands of chickens to be culled, while deadly strains of bird flu continued to wreak havoc on the US dairy industry and wild animal populations around the world.There is an unsettling, familiar tone to all of this news, and a quiet hum of concern runs beneath it — could avian influenza erupt into the next pandemic?Some of the world's foremost experts in infectious disease and public health governance say while it is not time to panic, there is a reasonable risk that we must be prepared for. "What we worry about is those avian viruses mutating to pick up an adaptation to the human respiratory tract. That's how a human pandemic would emerge," Professor MacIntyre said.These experts share a concern that the fatigue and divisiveness wrought out by the COVID-19 pandemic present significant challenges in tackling new outbreaks head on — already they are hampering efforts to test, report and contain the outbreak in the US. They also believe we're closer to another pandemic than many people realise — but we have "a golden opportunity" to prepare now and get it right.What's going on with bird flu in Australia?First, it's helpful to understand how different outbreaks of bird flu are categorised. Avian influenza is an infectious disease that spreads predominantly among wild birds and poultry. Just like human influenza, there are several types of avian influenza viruses — these are classed broadly as either high pathogenic or low pathogenic, indicating how sick they make infected birds.What is avian influenza H5N1, and why has it been found in US dairy cows?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Australia is one of the last places on the planet free from high pathogenicity bird flu. But authorities warn there's an increased risk of an outbreak here as scientists say the world is in an animal pandemic.As with other infectious diseases like COVID-19, avian influenza viruses are divided into subtypes or "strains" and then further into clades. These subtle differences occur as the virus evolves and mutates to work around host cells' defences. Some adaptations can lead to "spillover" events, where the virus passes from one species to another to infect other animals and, in rarer cases, humans.Australia has dealt with a handful of avian influenza outbreaks over the past 15 years, including one low pathogenic strain that infected abattoir workers in 2010.Last week, Agriculture Victoria disclosed an outbreak of H7N3, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, at a poultry farm near Meredith. Later that day, Victorian health officials confirmed Australia's first human case of a different highly pathogenic strain, H5N1 — the child who picked up an infection in India.The affected Victorian properties were placed into quarantine. (ABC News: Rochelle Kirkham)On May 24, a second avian outbreak was confirmed at another Victorian poultry farm in Terang, which had commercial links with the farm in Meredith. Testing confirmed this outbreak was another H7 strain, known as H7N9.A third outbreak was confirmed last week at a mixed poultry farm in Western Australia – a low pathogenic H9N2 strain not connected to the Victorian outbreaks.State and federal authorities are working with affected industries to control the poultry outbreaks, with the infected farms under quarantine and orders for free-range and backyard flocks within restricted areas to be temporarily housed.It's important to note that the human case is not connected to the outbreaks at the poultry farms, and contact tracing has identified no further human cases in Australia at this stage.GISAID, a global database tracking infectious diseases as they evolve, identifies the human case in Victoria as H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a. Genomic sequencing shows this is connected to the virus that is currently circulating in India and Bangladesh.Another H5N1 clade, 2.3.4.4b, has been wreaking havoc across North America, Europe, and parts of Africa and South America. Avian influenza has ravaged wild bird populations across South America. (Reuters: Diego Vara)In the US, it's at the centre of the longest and largest bird flu outbreak in history, causing the deaths of more than 90 million birds. It has also been detected in dairy herds across nine US states, prompting a swathe of restrictions and control orders to stem the spread. Three human cases have been linked to the US dairy outbreak.H5N1 and other strains are also circulating in China. A woman from Fujian province died in April after falling ill with the highly pathogenic H5N6. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), she had been in contact with backyard poultry before she became ill.What's the risk of human transmission?The risk of human transmission of avian flu viruses is relatively low – it's generally picked up where there has been close contact with infected animals. Health authorities around the world are urging caution among people working in affected industries such as poultry and dairy, or other jobs handling wild animals, but overall, the risk to the general public is considered low.Professor MacIntyre, who leads the global biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at University of New South Wales, says this is due to the way this virus operates."Avian flu viruses are adaptive to birds, and birds have specific receptors in their upper respiratory tract that we do not have. Those viruses only spread easily between birds and between some mammals — not humans," she said. But that could change if the virus has opportunities to pick up adaptations that allow it to enter the human respiratory tract. Raina MacIntyre is a professor of global biosecurity within the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)Professor MacIntyre notes that avian influenza has already crossed over from animals that have traditionally carried the virus — waterfowl including ducks, geese and swans — into other wild birds and even mammals."We've seen mass die-off of sea lions and seals, red foxes, coyotes, squirrels … and we're now seeing it in 130 other wild birds that were never hosts for spreading this virus before," she said.A severe strain of bird flu has reached AntarcticaPhoto shows Rows of dead birds including skuas and penguins. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has breached the world's most remote continent. Scientists say it's only a matter of time before it reaches Australia. In South America, hundreds of thousands of sea birds have died including more than 40 per cent of Peruvian pelicans. Scores of Adelie penguins and skuas have died in "mass mortality events" across Antarctica, with H5N1 the suspected cause."Antarctica is a worry for us," Professor MacIntyre says, "because if the virus is in Antarctica, then there could be flyaways of other birds that could bring it into Australia".Professor MacIntyre says the statistical probability of the virus adapting to infect humans more efficiently is highest with the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. If this kind of mutation were to occur, she suspects it would be in Europe or the Americas.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found fragments of the H5N1 virus in samples of milk and other dairy products for sale in grocery stores. However, none of these samples returned evidence of live virus. This is likely down to the pasteurisation process, which Professor MacIntyre explains "kills the virus".Avian influenza has been detected in dairy herds across nine US states. (Reuters: Jim Vondruska)In Australia, food standards require most milk or milk products being sold commercially to meet pasteurisation requirements. Unpasteurised or raw milk — apart from goats' milk — is restricted from being sold as a food product, though there are exceptions in some states that allow local producers to sell raw milk cheese under strict circumstances.New raw milk cheese deal not so palatable to local dairies Photo shows A thick wedge of semi-hard cheese sits on a large wheel of cheese.A dozen raw milk cheeses from the United Kingdom have been approved for sale in Australia in a deal likely to please cheese lovers, but not necessarily local cheesemakers.The raw milk market appears to be growing in the US, and while the FDA has warned consumers to avoid these products given the current H5N1 outbreaks, Professor MacIntyre says this is where she has concerns."[If] people are drinking raw milk, that's where you're going to possibly have the avian virus mixing with humans and creating more chances for that mutation," she said.While there have been no human cases related to food consumption, the CDC reported that cats at a Texas dairy farm became sick after being fed raw milk from infected cows. According to the report, more than half of the cats died. For the moment, the World Health Organization, as well as centres for disease prevention and control in Europe, the US and Australia, doesn't appear to be alarmed about the risk of a wider outbreak or pandemic affecting humans. In its latest weekly update, the WHO wrote:"Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments … The zoonotic threat remains elevated due to the spread of the viruses among birds. However, the overall pandemic risk associated with A(H5) is considered not significantly changed in comparison to previous years."Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security says it's important to keep an eye on how the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b evolves."[We would be looking out for] mutations, as well as reassortment with human or swine viruses. The fact that it's infecting mammalian species — that's one of the major hurdles a flu virus has to clear for efficient human transmission. There's been some mild mammalian adaptation here and there, but not enough to change the public health threat," he said.However, as several public health and infectious disease experts have warned in the past few years, the question of another pandemic is not so much a matter of if, but when.Are we prepared for the next pandemic?Professor Kelley Lee has been studying the governance of global pandemics for years, and most recently her work with the Pandemics & Borders international research group has been reflecting on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen strategies for future outbreaks. Broadly, her work aims to answer the question: is the world prepared for another pandemic?"I would say the short answer is no, we're not anywhere near prepared. And indeed, in some ways, I think we're worse prepared than we were prior to COVID-19," she said.Professor Lee says the biggest lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic has been how global collaboration was instrumental in managing the spread and science the virus — from identifying SARS-CoV-2 as a novel pathogen, to developing vaccines and potential drug treatments.And conversely, where coordination was lacking, it slowed down the world's ability to bring the virus under control. One example was the varied approaches to imposing travel restrictions and border controls, which her research has shown came at huge economic and societal cost.Professor Lee says the varied approaches to restrictions on cross-border travel and trade around the world set up a "chaotic" dynamic. (AP: Charles Krupa)"When you have an uncoordinated introduction of policies, where every country did things differently and would change them over time … it's nothing short of chaotic," she said. "It's costly, but it's also not a good way of managing risk."Professor Lee says jockeying between countries and their citizens over access to resources, "vaccine nationalism" and other behaviours such as people hoarding ventilators and masks, did significant damage. "Populations that really needed those essential supplies didn't get them in time or didn't get them at all," she says.Over time she believes this contributed to a pervasive corrosion in trust and social cohesion."We're more divided than we were before COVID. You would think that a generational event such as this would have brought us closer together … but in general, societies are more fragmented, less cohesive, and less trusting. That kind of social environment makes us far less likely to cooperate or coordinate our efforts, from the local level all the way up to the global level."Anthony Fauci on the lessons from COVID, and the tragedy of divisivenessPhoto shows Portrait of Anthony FauciAs Anthony Fauci wraps up as chief medical adviser at the White House, he says the world must heed the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic.Professor Lee says she's seeing this play out in the ongoing Global Pandemic Accord Negotiations, which this week failed to finalise a draft agreement after more than two years of discussion. Dr Adalja, who has been advising public health bodies in the US during the recent H5N1 outbreaks, says a similar dynamic is frustrating efforts to manage the virus there.He says there has been a lack of transparency around testing, and in many cases a lack of access for public health authorities. The setting of this outbreak – in dairy farms across a dozen or so states – adds a layer of bureaucracy that has further complicated the process. At times, public health officials from the CDC haven't been in sync with the Department of Agriculture, or with the state governments which must grant access for federal health officials to carry out testing on farms."We saw with swine flu in 2009, there was reticence to really address the risk on farms, and to sample farms — this has gotten better, but we always run into this because there is a very big commercial aspect in terms of export, and domestic consumption of meat and milk," he said."So these types of things are constraining the ability to do more widespread testing, to get more important public health information out, at least to the farm workers where we think this risk is really high."On top of that, Dr Adalja notes that the stigma associated with testing for a highly pathogenic avian influenza carries a huge economic risk — Colombia has already restricted imports of beef from US states where dairy cows have tested positive, and Japan and the US have made similar moves to suspend Victorian poultry imports. But this matters on a micro level, too."Many of the people that work on these farms are migrant workers. They may not be willing to be tested because if they're sick, or if they're found to be positive, they won't be able to work, which means they won't get paid," he said.Dr Adalja is concerned that if we don't get the response right this time, it doesn't bode well for any future pandemic scenario."The problems we're seeing now are not a good indicator of how well we would handle a more serious bird flu. It's important to get this ironed out, because it's likely going to involve agriculture of some sort, whether that's poultry, cattle, or swine, so we need to have really robust surveillance of what's going on there."So what can be done?Professor MacIntyre says for Australian authorities working to contain the current poultry outbreaks, the most urgent priority should be considering financial measures to make robust testing and reporting as straightforward as possible."The biggest thing that can be done is financial compensation for farmers. Without that, there's not going to as much testing and reporting as there should be, and outbreaks won't be disclosed," she said.Professor MacIntyre wants to see action around financial support for affected industries. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)Dr Adalja is similarly focused on managing the outbreaks in livestock industries well. He says a lack of trust in public health officials is a fundamental issue to solve for efficient and thorough testing and surveillance. Involving veterinarians with established relationships in the industry is among some of the suggestions to work around this. Outside of encouraging stringent testing in these industries, Professor MacIntyre says the other sign to watch out for will be mass die-offs of birds or other wild animals.And while the current local outbreaks don't pose an immediate risk of human transmission, it's a possibility she says we need to be prepared for."In terms of the human pandemic, it's a problem for everybody. If a pandemic arises in the US or Europe, it's going to end up here. So it's in our interest to be closely monitoring for that."Professor MacIntyre views global data sharing and surveillance as paramount in those efforts. Professor Lee says this extends to all facets of infectious disease management.How scientists are protecting themselves from COVIDPhoto shows A woman pulls a 3M Aura respirator and an Aranet CO2 monitor out of her black handbagThree of Australia's leading COVID-19 experts share their personal safety strategies and reflect on what must happen if we're to blunt the growing health crisis the pandemic is causing — and prepare for the next one."We did learn that we can develop a new vaccine very quickly if we all work together … and there are a lot of scientific advances on the horizon that I think would make us more prepared," she said."But this is a really a population health challenge. It needs society to work together. If you have everybody hoarding toilet paper or masks or just looking out for themselves, that doesn't actually help them, because the virus continues to circulate."Cross-border communication is also critical, Dr Adalja says, "because we know that these types of viruses don't stay in one country, especially when they're hitchhiking on birds that migrate all over the world".And while highlighting all of these challenges may tap into a well of fear, he believes "this is a golden opportunity to get it right".Editor's note 03/06/24: An earlier version of this story stated that the Victorian child was Australia's first human case of avian influenza, which is incorrect. It has since been updated to clarify that it was Australia's first human case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.

The country has recorded the second laboratory-confirmed case of Mpox disease, an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus with potential to cause a painful or itchy rash like pimples or blisters. The new patient is the 39-year-old male who was admitted at Addington Hospital in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal without travel history to countries and regions currently experiencing the outbreak of the disease. The department working closely with the province and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) have activated contract tracing and case finding to identify and assess people who have been in contact with the patient to prevent further transmission, especially at a household and community level. This will also assist to establish if the second case was in contact with the first case confirmed in Gauteng earlier this month. Stigma and discrimination may prolong a disease outbreak by stopping people from coming forward for information or seeking testing or care, which undermines public health efforts. Thus, we urge the public and communities to support those who tested positive for Mpox to take treatment and those with suspected symptoms to go for screening and testing instead of discriminating against. Influenza Season South Africa is currently experiencing the annual influenza (flu) season which started in the week of 22 April 2024, and a number of flu strains are circulating causing severe health complications in some patients. This has been confused with COVID-19 variant which has been in circulation with low level of transmissibility and severity. The most commonly detected and circulating influenza subtype and lineage are A(H1N1) pdm09 previously known as “swine flu” because it was causing disease in pigs, followed by influenza B/Victoria and influenza A(H3N2). This is not unusual as influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 has been circulating each season as one of the annual seasonal influenza strains since 2010. Influenza A virus is more severe in adults. About 8 -10% of patients hospitalised for pneumonia and 25% of patients with flu-like illness (fever and cough) will test positive for influenza during the flu season in South Africa. According to the NICD surveillance data, the numbers of influenza cases and positivity rates are increasing rapidly, but the transmission and impact remain at a moderate level of activity for both outpatient and hospitalised cases. This means that while there is a lot of influenza circulating, it is still within the expected range for a normal influenza season. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, enough ventilation, regular handwash with water and soap/sanitiser can help to minimise the spread of the disease.

The declaration has been reviewed and published by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). This follows Northern Ireland’s declaration of freedom on 31 March 2023. The UK faced its largest ever outbreak of bird flu with over 360 cases confirmed across the country since late October 2021. We have had no recent cases of avian influenza in kept birds with the last case confirmed on 14 February 2024. The current risk to poultry from HPAI H5 in Great Britain is low. However, HPAI H5N1 continues to be found at low levels in wild birds in Great Britain and across Europe with outbreaks occurring in poultry and other captive birds in several countries in Europe. Keepers should remain vigilant and practice stringent biosecurity to protect the health and welfare of their birds. Find out how to protect your birds in our biosecurity guidance. Avian influenza (bird flu) is a notifiable animal disease. If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds you must report it immediately by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Wales, contact 0300 303 8268. In Scotland, contact your local Field Services Office. Failure to do so is an offence. Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find and instead report them using the online reporting system or by calling the Defra helpline. The UKHSA advise that the available evidence suggests viruses currently circulating in birds in the UK do not spread easily to people and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. There is no impact on the consumption of properly cooked poultry products, including eggs.

Bird flu outbreaks have been a global concernSince March this year, there has been global concern over bird flu outbreaks. The government is investigating the spread of the virus via joint efforts by the ministry of animal husbandry and the health ministry’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme(IDSP).As a matter of abundant precaution, a joint advisory has been issued by health & animal husbandry ministry respectively. The government has advised for the orientation of all healthcare works in public and private sector for signs, symptoms and case definition of avian influenza.“Be vigilant for any unusual deaths among domestic birds or poultry in your states, strengthen biosecurity measures in all poultry establishments, zoos, poultry markets. Be prepared for all preventive measures like stockpiling of adequate number of antiviral drugs (oseltamivir), PPE, masks, isolation wards at dedicated hospitals. Enhanced surveillance in wet markets, poultry farm workers as well as expanded surveillance in sewage samples, water bodies and crows etc.,” stated the advisory urging for strict and timely reporting of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases.Also Read: Bird flu outbreak '100 times worse' than Covid pandemic, say expertsThis year, outbreaks have been reported in poultry in Andhra Pradesh (Nellore), Maharashtra (Nagpur), Kerala (Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts) and Jharkhand (Ranchi).For the states where there is an active outbreak of the bird flu, the Centre has instructed to collect samples from cullers and surveillance workers on 5th and 10th days following sanitization operation for H5N1 testing.“Conducting surveillance for suspected human cases for providing health checkups for cullers and poultry farm workers with a duration of 10 days,” said the advisory while recommending the use of chemoprophylaxis, management and use of personal protective equipment.Queries sent to the health ministry remained unanswered.Catch all the Business News, Politics news,Breaking NewsEvents andLatest News Updates on Live Mint.

Using the data collected, RIVM gives insight into the key facts and figures on flu and the flu vaccine. Facts and figures are required to develop measures to combat flu epidemics. RIVM is responsible for mapping these facts and figures and carries out on-going surveillance in cooperation with partners. How often do people get the flu in the Netherlands? There are more cases of flu in some flu seasons than in others. The flu epidemic in 2014/2015 was the longest in 40 years, lasting for 21 weeks. The 2015/2016 flu epidemic lasted 11 weeks, while the 2016/2017 flu epidemic lasted 15 weeks. The long flu epidemic in 2017/2018 lasted 18 weeks, and the 2018/2019 flu epidemic ended after 14 weeks. The 2019/2020 flu epidemic was short and mild, lasting only three weeks (late January to mid-February 2020). A brief two-week resurgence of the flu epidemic in early March 2020 overlapped with the first two weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic. In the 2020/2021 winter, there was no influenza epidemic. During the 2021/2022 winter season, the number of cases with influenza-like illness consulting the GP remained relatively low (which is due to the COVID-19 pandemic a less useable source to define the influenza epidemic), the data of other influenza sources (laboratories, hospitals) led to the conclusion of an influenza epidemic in the Netherlands in week 8 of 2022. After week 20 of 2022, all influenza surveillance systems showed a declining flu trend and the late influenza epidemic was ended. Currently, from week 50 of 2022 (12-18 December 2022) onwards, there is an influenza epidemic in the Netherlands. Source: NIVEL Primary Care Database. Flu epidemic 2019/2020 The flu epidemic in the winter of 2019/2020 was relatively mild and lasted for a short time, from 27 January to 16 February 2020. A brief resurgence of the flu epidemic from 2 to 15 March 2020 overlapped with the first two weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic. During this winter, influenza A viruses were the most common. Of all influenza A viruses found in patients with flu-like symptoms at the General Practitioner, 49% were of subtype A(H3N2), 43% of subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 and only 8% of type B. More information about the flu season 2019/2020 will be available in RIVM’s annual report ‘Surveillance of influenza and other respiratory infections’, which will be published in December 2020.

It is making for a complex winter, says ESR virologist Sue Huang. This time last year, influenza was the dominant respiratory virus detected by laboratories nationwide, particularly influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B. But this year, positive flu specimens started increasing in mid-May, joining already high case numbers of SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and rhinovirus. The most common influenza strain to date is H3N2, the swine flu virus, which dominated the first post-pandemic flu season in 2022. “H3N2 is the virus we have to be careful about as it hits the elderly very hard and also very young children. So, we need to watch out for this virus,” Dr Huang says. Dr Huang, the ESR WHO National Influenza Centre director, pointed to the deaths from H3N2 in late January/early February at a Coromandel resthome. “Again, the message is that vaccination is the key for mitigating the risks.” New Zealand Doctor Rata Aotearoa has approached Te Whatu Ora for an update on flu vaccination trends compared with the same time last year. READ MORE NEWS: 'Marked' increase in pertussis cases noted by National Public Health Service NEWS: Flu vaccines are no longer free for all under-12s in NZ NEWS: COVID-19 case numbers rise again Viruses competing Last year’s flu season, with the return of H1N1 and Influenza B, had an initial early peak in April. It was a long season due to an immunity gap after the country had virtually no flu in 2020 and 2021, Dr Huang says. However, this year, it has taken until May for labs to detect a surge in influenza viruses and for the flu season to get underway. Dr Huang says another difference this year is that as the flu season starts, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV are also circulating. “COVID is still not settling in as a seasonal virus,” says Dr Huang. “So [this winter], we have all these viruses in a virus soup, and they are competing with each other, and they are interacting with each other.” She says this will result in a complex and busy respiratory-illness winter season. Three people were off sick in her own team working on the WellKiwi influenza studies, not necessarily with the flu but with other viruses. “It feels like we are already deep in the season when we are still not there yet in terms of flu.” Hospitalisations and peak to come The ESR respiratory illness dashboard shows Auckland hospitalisations for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to date are stable but higher than the same time in 2023 and over the “baseline seasonal threshold”. As of 19 May, most of the hospitalisations in children under five are due to RSV and rhinovirus. The SARI hospitalisations due to SARS-CoV-2 are like those in 2022 and 2023; the influenza hospitalisation was like that in 2023, slightly above the baseline seasonal level. Last year, influenza hospitalisations peaked in April, late June/early July and September. Cumulatively, the peaks meant the season was considered moderately severe. Pre-pandemic, the flu season usually peaked in July/August. Dr Huang says usually high flu activity lasts eight to 10 weeks in a normal flu season. She says with the 2024 season underway in May, we could see elevated flu levels in June, with maybe a peak in late June. Sentinel GP testing seeing more flu too Influenza and RSV were also detected in the last two weeks of patient swabs carried out in the community by GPs and nurses under the ESR’s sentinel GP practice surveillance system. The ESR respiratory illness dashboard shows that in mid-May, rhinovirus was overtaken by flu and RSV as the most commonly detected virus from sentinel practices, along with a small spike in metapneumovirus. In an emailed response, ESR epidemiology team leader Andrea McNeill says, to date, the agency has 75 general practices participating in its network of respiratory surveillance sentinel sites nationwide. “We have fewer practices than we would like in the Counties Manukau region and are continuing to try to recruit additional practices,” Dr McNeill says.
