Central to the replication cycle of influenza viruses is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which transcribes and replicates the viral RNA genome. The polymerase undergoes conformational rearrangements and interacts with viral and host proteins to perform these functions. Here we determine the structure of the 1918 influenza virus polymerase in transcriptase and replicase conformations using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We then structurally and functionally characterise the binding of single-domain nanobodies to the polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. Combining these functional and structural data we identify five sites on the polymerase which are sensitive to inhibition by nanobodies. We propose that the binding of nanobodies at these sites either prevents the polymerase from assuming particular functional conformations or interactions with viral or host factors. The polymerase is highly conserved across the influenza A subtypes, suggesting these sites as effective targets for potential influenza antiviral development.

The currently circulating influenza A viruses are thought to be the evolutionary progeny of the virus that caused the 1918–1919 global pandemic, which was responsible for between 50 and 100 million deaths worldwide. The 1918 influenza virus is thought to have jumped from waterfowl into humans and is considered the ‘founder virus’ that has contributed viral genome segments for all subsequent epidemic and pandemic strains. It remains unclear why this virus was so highly pathogenic, but several viral factors as well as secondary bacterial infections have been implicated in the high lethality of the virus1.The genome of influenza A virus is composed of eight different negative-sense RNA segments packaged in the form of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. Each vRNP consists of oligomeric viral nucleoprotein (NP) and viral RNA (vRNA), which form a large loop arranged as a helical filament, with the viral polymerase bound to the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the vRNA2. The influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a heterotrimeric multifunctional machine composed of polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2) and polymerase acidic (PA) subunits, that catalyzes both primer-independent replication (vRNA to complementary RNA (cRNA) and cRNA to vRNA synthesis) and primer-dependent transcription (vRNA to mRNA synthesis) in the nucleus of infected cells. PB1 houses the polymerase active site, whereas PB2 and PA contain, respectively, cap-binding and endonuclease domains required for transcription initiation by cap-snatching3,4,5,6. High-resolution structures of the complete viral polymerase from a number of human, avian and bat influenza A viruses, as well as influenza B, C, and D viruses have been determined7,8,9,10,11. These structures have revealed that the polymerase is a highly flexible macromolecule that can assume a variety of distinct conformations, enabling the polymerase to perform both transcription and replication that require different initiation and termination mechanisms. The polymerase genes are among the most highly conserved genes of influenza viruses and as such the polymerase represents an ideal target for antivirals. Current influenza therapeutics target the neuraminidase and polymerase and inhibitors such as baloxavir (Xofluza) and favipiravir have been approved for use in a limited number of countries. However, mutations allow the virus to escape inhibition by these compounds and therefore further antivirals are required12. Recently, nanobodies, comprising the variable domain of single-chain camelid antibodies also referred to as VHH, have emerged as novel antiviral agents for both extracellular and intracellular targeting of viral proteins13.In this work, we determine structures of the polymerase from the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and identify sites on the surface of the polymerase that are sensitive to inhibition. Using single-particle analysis (SPA) cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, we determine the binding location of 20 nanobodies on the RNA polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. Functional analysis of the nanobodies shows that a subset of nanobodies strongly inhibits polymerase activity in vitro and in cell culture, and efficiently reduces virus growth. Combining functional and structural data we discover sites of vulnerability on the polymerase and link these to the inhibition of specific polymerase functions, identifying and validating targets for drug discovery.ResultsStructural characterisation of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus polymeraseWe co-expressed the three subunits of the RNA polymerase from influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) virus in insect cells and purified the heterotrimeric complex. In vitro transcription assays showed that the recombinant polymerase was active (Supplementary Fig. 1). Polymerase with added capped RNA primer and vRNA promoter, comprising the 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences of vRNA, was used for EM grid preparation. We observed monomeric polymerase heterotrimers as well as both dimeric and tetrameric assemblies (Supplementary Fig. 2). The dimeric polymerase species were highly similar to the previously observed dimer implicated in cRNA to vRNA synthesis7. However, severe preferential orientation prohibited accurate 3D reconstruction of both dimeric and tetrameric forms. After 2D and initial 3D classification of the monomeric particles a consensus refinement of the particles yielded a high-quality map. Further 3D classification of this map yielded four maps into which models were built, resulting in four distinct polymerase structures. In all four structures the core of the polymerase composed of PB1, the C-terminal domain of PA and the N-terminal one third of PB2 was fully resolved, while the flexible domains including the N-terminal endonuclease domain of PA and the C-terminal two thirds of PB2 showed different arrangements or remained unresolved. To aid in map interpretation the programme deepEMhancer was used for low abundance conformations (Supplementary Fig. 3)14. Both the 5′ and 3′ vRNA promoters, but no capped RNA primer, was observed in all structures. The 5′ promoter was fully ordered forming the hook structure bound by PB1 and PA as observed previously11. Only eight bases at the 5′ end of the 3′ promoter were observed, four of which form a duplex with the 5′ promoter while the remaining four are oriented towards the polymerase active site. The seven 3′ terminal unresolved bases of the 3′ promoter strand have likely entered the active site but remain unresolved.The most complete structure (class 1), representing ~15% of the particles, shows an almost completely ordered polymerase heterotrimer with only the C-terminal nuclear localisation signal (NLS) domain of PB2 remaining unresolved (Fig. 1a). The overall conformation of the polymerase is similar to the previously observed conformations implicated in transcription although with some differences in the exact location and orientation of the C-terminal domains of PB2, comprising the mid, cap-binding, linker (which together with mid forms a rigid-body domain mid-link), 627 and NLS domains7,15,16. Specifically, the cap-binding domain is rotated by ~90° relative to the polymerase core with the cap-binding site facing away from the product exit/primer entry channel (Supplementary Fig. 4a). This conformation of the cap-binding domain is stabilised through a correlated rotation of the 627 domain by 26°. The co-rotation of these domains leads to a new interaction between the 424 loop of the cap-binding domain and residues 585–588, 624 and 625 of the 627 domain, instead of the previously observed interaction of the 424 loop with PB1 residues7,15,17. However, the overall fold of the 627-domain remains the same as observed in previous structures.Fig. 1: Cryo-EM structures of the 1918 polymerase in three conformations.Monomeric conformations of the 1918 polymerase in full transcriptase (class 1) (a), partial transcriptase (class 2a) (b), or replicase conformations (class 3) (c).Full size imageAs shown previously, the PB2 cap-binding domain can rotate during transcription11 and here we identify another stable conformation. This conformational flexibility allows the cap-binding domain to probe the environment for capped RNA and capture the cap, orient the uncleaved capped RNA into the PA endonuclease domain and then insert the cleaved capped primer into the polymerase active site through the product exit/primer entry channel. We propose two possible roles for the observed conformation. This cap-binding domain position could represent a conformation where the polymerase is probing the environment, waiting to capture an uncleaved capped RNA still associated with host RNA polymerase II5. Alternatively, this may be an intermediate position that occurs after cleavage of the capped RNA but before the primer enters the polymerase active site. The cap-binding domain moving away from the polymerase core may help it to accommodate primers of variable length, reported to range between 8 and 15 nucleotides18,19,20, and orient their 3′ end into the active site.The class 2a and class 2b structures, representing ~78% of the particles, are similar to the class 1 structure; however, the flexible C-terminal domains of PB2 remain entirely unresolved (Fig. 1b). The two structures (class 2a and class 2b) differ in the orientation of the PA endonuclease and the ordering of the priming loop, a hairpin that protrudes from the PB1 thumb subdomain into the polymerase active site and is involved in the positioning of the template and/or initiating nucleotide in the polymerase active site7,15,21. For class 2a the location and orientation of the PA endonuclease relative to the polymerase core is identical to that in the class 1 structure and very similar to that previously observed in the transcriptase conformations of the polymerase7,15. In the class 2a structure, as in the class 1 structure, the priming loop is fully ordered despite no template RNA being resolved in the active site. In the class 2b structure, the PA endonuclease, together with the C-terminal helices of PB1 and the N-terminal helix of PB2 with which it forms a rigid body, is rotated by 20° relative to the core of the polymerase (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This rotation leads to new interactions between the PA endonuclease and the polymerase core mediated through PA Lys22 interacting with PB1 Thr156, Glu159, and Ser160 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Interestingly, this rotation correlates with disordering of the priming loop.The last structure (class 3), representing ~7% of particles, shows a polymerase with a fully ordered core, including the priming loop, and the PB2 cap-binding and mid-link domains, but lacks the PA endonuclease and the PB2 627 and NLS domains (Fig. 1c). The resolved PB2 domains are arranged in a conformation similar to that observed in crystal structures of the apo human H3N2 and avian H5N1 influenza A virus and influenza C virus polymerases as well as cRNA-bound influenza B virus polymerase and, more recently, the cryo-EM structure of the influenza C virus polymerase dimer in complex with host acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32A (ANP32A), described as a replicase (Supplementary Fig. 4c)7,8,17,22. It is tempting to speculate that, in solution, in the absence of ANP32A and polymerase dimer formation there is nothing against which the PB2 627 domain could pack and so it remains flexible.Taken together, our characterisation of the polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus has yielded a number of important observations. The polymerase is highly dynamic with multiple oligomers and conformations present in a single sample. We observe the flexible PB2 C-terminal domains in conformations described for both the transcriptase and replicase conformations, while most molecules show no ordered PB2 C-terminal domains. No vRNA template is observed in the polymerase active site; however, we are able to resolve the priming loop in most structures. These data suggest the ordering of the priming loop is uncoupled from the ordering of RNA in the polymerase active site and is perhaps related to the position of the PA endonuclease domain. We were able to resolve the flexible C-terminal domains of PB2 in a new arrangement, similar to that described for the transcriptase7,15. Specifically, we resolved the PB2 cap-binding domain in a new orientation that we propose is important for capturing an uncleaved capped RNA or orienting the cleaved capped RNA primer into the active site. Interestingly, no capped RNA was observed although the reasons for this remain unclear. We envisage that these structural insights hold true for all influenza A virus polymerases as there is a very high degree of sequence homology among the A strains (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c), although we cannot exclude the possibility that some of these conformations are due to unknown characteristics of the 1918 influenza polymerase.Structural characterisation of the 1918 influenza virus polymerase in complex with nanobodiesA panel of 24 nanobodies (Nb8189-Nb8212) was generated against recombinantly expressed and purified polymerase of an H5N1 influenza A virus as described previously7. Using cryo-EM we determined the structure of 17 polymerase-nanobody complexes at resolutions between 4.5 and 6.7 Å; this is sufficient resolution to accurately position each nanobody bound to the polymerase heterotrimer (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 1). In addition to the core of the polymerase which was resolved in all structures, the PA endonuclease was resolved in the majority of structures (excluding Nb8189, Nb8190, Nb8192, Nb8196, Nb8202), while the C-terminal domains of PB2 remained unresolved in all structures. The nanobody binding sites were spread across the surface of the polymerase with related nanobodies binding at the same site (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).The most populous binding site, termed site 1, is on the PA endonuclease with five nanobodies (Nb8198, Nb8199, Nb8200, Nb8203, Nb8209) that bind at an interface formed by the short helix α1 (residues 1–10) and the long helix α6 (170–185) (Fig. 2a). On the PA linker (site 2), that links the N-terminal PA endonuclease domain and the PA C-terminal domain and wraps around PB1, we observe three nanobodies; Nb8202 and Nb8210 bind identically at residues 220–240 and Nb8204 binds at residues 250–265. Nb8207 binds to a unique position, termed site 3, at the product exit channel contacting both PB1 and the N-terminal region of PB2. The PA C-terminal domain is the binding site for eight nanobodies which cluster into four groups (sites 4a–d) across the surface of the domain. Nb8192 and Nb8205 bind to PA residues 426–445 (site 4a) with Nb8205 also making a minor contact with the PB1. Three nanobodies (Nb8189, Nb8190, Nb8201) bind at an interface formed by PA residues 615–630 and PB1 residues 10–15 (site 4b). Nb8191 binds to the PB1 N-terminus and PA residues 405–420, 531–534, 551–557, and 624–626 (site 4c). Nb8196 somewhat overlaps with Nb8191, binding to PA residues 262–268, 624–626 and 705–712. Finally, Nb8206 binds uniquely to PA residues 309–321 and 555–558 (site 4d).Fig. 2: Nanobody binding sites of the 1918 polymerase determined by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography.a Composite model showing the binding position of each nanobody on the surface of the 1918 polymerase determined using cryo-EM. C-terminal domain of PA, PA-C; N-terminal one third of PB2, PB2-N. b–d Crystal structures of PB2 cap-mid-link and nanobody complexes.Full size imageFive nanobodies, Nb8193, Nb8194, Nb8195, Nb8197, and Nb8208, were unresolved by cryo-EM, and as the C-terminal domains of PB2 are disordered in our datasets, we suspected that these nanobodies may bind to this region. To test this hypothesis, we purified proteins comprising either the cap-binding and mid-link domains (cap-mid-link, residues 250–538) or the 627 and NLS domains (627-NLS, residues 538–759). Four of the nanobodies bound to cap-mid-link causing a peak shift in size exclusion chromatography; only Nb8195 did not bind (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Crystallisation of the cap-mid-link-nanobody complexes yielded crystals that diffracted to resolutions of 1.7 Å for the Nb8193 complex and 1.9 Å for the Nb8194 complex (Fig. 2b–d, Supplementary Table 2). Nanobodies Nb8193 and Nb8194 form site 5a, each interacting with the cap-binding domain residues Arg389, Asp390, and Arg482. Nb8193 forms additional contacts with Arg264 from the mid domain and Thr524 from the linker region. We also determined the structure of Nb8208 bound to the cap-binding domain at a resolution of 3.1 Å, a product of in-drop proteolysis from crystallisation screens set up with the complete cap-mid-link construct. Nb8208 binds to site 5b interacting with residues Glu391, Asp466, The468, and Glu472 (Fig. 2d). The cap-mid-link-Nb8197 complex failed to produce diffraction quality crystals but, based on the similarity of its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), Nb8197 likely binds at a similar position as Nb8193 and Nb8194. We have not determined the structures of Nb8211 and Nb8212 which, based on their similarity to Nb8200 and Nb8198 (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b), respectively, are expected to bind to the PA endonuclease.Nanobodies inhibit polymerase activity in vitro and viral growth in cell cultureTo assess the inhibitory effect of nanobodies on polymerase activity, we performed an in vitro polymerase activity assay using recombinant RNP complexes derived from the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. β-globin mRNA was added to the vRNPs to facilitate primer-dependent transcription, in the presence of an excess of purified nanobody. These assays showed that a subset of nanobodies significantly inhibit transcription and/or vRNA to cRNA replication with Nb8207 being particularly potent (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 8a). Interestingly, we observe different potencies for nanobodies that bind at similar locations, for example Nb8189 and Nb8190 which bind the same site on the C-terminal domain of PA; this is likely due to differences in the affinities of each nanobody for a given site. To investigate the effect of nanobodies on polymerase activity in cellular environment, we used a minireplicon luciferase-reporter assay, in which each nanobody was expressed along with polymerase subunits and NP from the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and a negative-sense vRNA encoding luciferase (Fig. 3b). This assay revealed that most nanobodies, including the ones identified as inhibitory in the in vitro assay, show strong potency in cells. Some nanobodies, such as those binding to the PA endonuclease domain which showed no or minor inhibition in the in vitro assay were strongly inhibitory in the minireplicon assay, suggesting that this surface of the endonuclease is involved in an important function that is not required for in vitro activity but is essential in the more complex minireplicon assay.Fig. 3: Effect of nanobodies on 1918 polymerase function and virus growth.a Effect of nanobodies on the activity of recombinant 1918 RNP in the presence of a source of capped primer.

Data are mean ± s.e.m. n = 3 independent transfections and infections for each set of nanobodies. PFU plaque-forming units. Ordinary one-way ANOVA was used to compare the viral titres in the presence and absence of nanobodies at a given time point. P values are as follows: for Nb8190 P = 0.0007, P = 0.0067, P = 0.0331 and P = 0.0199, for Nb8207 P = 0.0006, P = 0.0063, P = 0.0301 and P = 0.0185, for Nb8210 P = 0.0084, P = 0.0925, P = 0.3444 and P = 0.0696, for Nb8191 P = 0.1030, P = 0.0009, P = 0.0141 and P < 0.0001, for Nb8192 P = 0.1227, P = 0.0008, P = 0.0136 and P = < 0.0001, for Nb8208 P = 0.1179, P = 0.0011, P = 0.0205 and P = 0.0025, and for Nb8210 P = 0.7246, P = 0.9865, P = 0.2269 and P = 0.0340, at 16, 24, 32 and 48 h post infection, respectively. P < 0.05 is considered significant. For quantification of viral RNA levels during the course of infection, see Supplementary Fig. 8b. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageBased on data from the in vitro and minireplicon assays, we selected a subset of inhibitory nanobodies that bind at different sites and carried out viral growth assays in cells expressing the selected nanobody prior to infection with a reassortant influenza A/WSN/33 virus encoding polymerase and NP of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus (Fig. 3c). Nb8190, Nb8191, Nb8192, and Nb8207 caused a significant reduction in viral titre at most time points tested. Nb8208 showed a strong inhibition at the early time points but viral titres were not reduced at 48 h post infection. Nb8210, used as a negative control, had only a minor or no effect on viral growth as reported previously7. Viral RNA quantification was carried out at each time point and showed a decrease in mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA levels that match the decrease in viral titres (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Nanobody expression was verified by western blot and had no effect on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b).Next, we evaluated the inhibitory mechanisms of these nanobodies. To assess the effect of nanobodies on viral transcription we first addressed whether they have an effect on primary transcription, i.e. the production of viral mRNA from the incoming vRNPs. To assay the effect of nanobodies on this process we performed a primary transcription assay by infecting cells that had been pre-transfected with plasmids to express each of the selected nanobodies. Protein synthesis was blocked at the onset of infection through addition of cycloheximide, which prevented cRNA accumulation and vRNA synthesis, isolating the viral transcription process from replication. Nb8190, Nb8191, Nb8192 and Nb8207 were shown to significantly inhibit viral mRNA synthesis (Fig. 4a). During infection the influenza virus polymerase must interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to facilitate access to 5′ capped RNA primers snatched from nascent Pol II transcripts that are used by the viral polymerase to prime viral mRNA synthesis23,24,25. To probe the effect of nanobodies on this interaction, the binding of purified recombinant 1918 polymerase to a Pol II CTD mimic peptide consisting of four heptad repeats, phosphorylated on serine-5 of the heptad repeats, was measured in an in vitro binding assay. Nb8191 and Nb8192 were found to significantly reduce the binding of the polymerase to the CTD peptide (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4: Inhibitory mechanisms of nanobodies.a Effect of nanobodies on primary transcription by a reassortant A/WSN/1933 virus polymerase and NP of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus in HEK293T cells transfected to express the indicated nanobodies.

Plasmid to express PB1a (no PB1a) (c) or PB1 (no PB1) (d) was omitted as negative control. Data are mean ± s.e.m. n = 3 independent transfections and infections. Ordinary one-way ANOVA was used to compare the relative cRNA levels (c) or RNA levels (mRNA, cRNA and vRNA combined) (d) in the presence and absence of nanobodies. P < 0.05 is considered significant. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo assess the effect of each nanobody on the first step of viral genome replication, vRNA to cRNA synthesis, we carried out a cRNA stabilisation assay26. In this assay, prior to infection and cycloheximide treatment, the cells are transfected to express influenza virus NP and polymerase subunits including a catalytically inactive PB1 subunit (PB1a). Under these conditions cRNPs are produced which are inactive due to the incorporation of the inactive PB1 subunit. Quantifying the cRNA from these infections shows that all the selected nanobodies significantly reduced cRNA accumulation (Fig. 4c). To assay for the second step of replication, cRNA to vRNA synthesis, we replaced the catalytically inactive PB1 with wild-type to allow replication to proceed and produce progeny vRNA. All selected inhibitory nanobodies dramatically decreased vRNA accumulation and caused a reduction in secondary mRNA production (Fig. 4d).Finally, to address whether the observed inhibitory effects can be generalised across different influenza A virus subtypes, we performed minireplicon luciferase-reporter assays using polymerase subunits and NP from influenza A viruses belonging to H3N2, H5N1 or H1N1 subtypes. These results demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of the nanobodies is conserved across different influenza A virus subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 9c).DiscussionIn this study we have solved the structure of the RNA polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus in four distinct conformations. These conformations show features common with previously determined structures implicated in either transcription or replication. In a conformation characteristic of a transcriptase we observed a novel arrangement of the PB2 cap-binding domain. This finding is in agreement with the idea that this domain is extremely flexible, which allows it to sample the environment for nascent host capped RNA, bind to it and then orient it towards the PA endonuclease for cleavage, followed by positioning of the short capped RNA product into the polymerase active site for transcription initiation. We also observed a correlation between the ordering of the priming loop in the active site and the position of the PA endonuclease, suggesting crosstalk between the two. However, the significance of this observation remains unclear.In our attempt to map inhibitory sites on the polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we have determined the structure of 20 nanobodies bound to the polymerase heterotrimer or a fragment of the PB2 subunit. A combination of in vitro and cell-based polymerase assays and virus growth inhibition assays led to the identification of multiple sites on the polymerase surface that are sensitive to inhibition by nanobodies (Fig. 5a, b). In order to transcribe viral genes and replicate the viral RNA genome the influenza virus RNA polymerase must interact with viral and host factors and adopt at least three distinct conformations to act as a transcriptase, replicase, or encapsidase4. We speculate that binding of nanobodies most likely inhibits polymerase function by locking it in a particular conformation, preventing it from assuming a particular functionally important conformation or inhibits interactions with viral or host factors.Fig. 5: Inhibitory sites on the 1918 polymerase.a Binding position of inhibitory nanobodies mapped on to the transcriptase conformation of the polymerase (PDB ID: 7NHX). Note that the binding of Nb8190 and Nb8207 is for illustration purposes only; the binding of these nanobodies is incompatible with the transcriptase conformation shown. Subunits and domains are coloured as follows: PA (yellow), PB1 (blue), PB2 N-terminal domain (grey), cap-binding domain (bright green), mid-link (red), 627 domain/NLS (dark green). 5′ and 3′ vRNA promoters are coloured purple and pink, respectively. b Location of each nanobody interaction site annotated with biological function. C-terminal domain of host RNA polymerase II, Pol II CTD.Full size imageThe site bound by Nb8207, one of the most potent nanobodies identified in our study, is located at the product exit channel, formed by PB1 and the N-terminal region of PB2. Binding of a nanobody at this site inhibits RNA production in both transcription and replication without affecting other polymerase activities such as CTD binding (Figs. 4a–d, 5a, b). We speculate that nanobody binding could inhibit RNA exit by blocking the product exit channel or might prevent the polymerase from assuming an active conformation as binding of a nanobody at this site is incompatible with the packing of the C-terminal domains of PB2 in both transcriptase and replicase conformations.The site bound by Nb8208 is located on the cap-binding domain of PB2. This region of the PB2 cap-binding domain packs against the PB1 palm subdomain in the encapsidase conformation of the polymerase as observed in the dimeric polymerase bound by the host protein ANP32A (Fig. 5a, b)22. Nanobody binding at this site severely affected both steps of replication but had no effect on primary transcription, Pol II CTD binding and polymerase activity in vitro in agreement with the idea that binding of Nb8208 affects formation of the ANP32A-bound dimeric polymerase.We have identified several inhibitory sites on the C-terminal domain of PA. The site bound by Nb8190 corresponds to a site against which the 627 domain of PB2 is packed in the transcriptase conformation, potentially preventing the polymerase from assuming the transcriptase conformation. Accordingly, Nb8190 inhibited transcription although it had no effect on the binding of the polymerase to Pol II CTD (Fig. 4a). The site bound by Nb8191 overlaps with the binding site of the Pol II CTD23,24 and, indeed, this nanobody was found to inhibit the binding of the viral polymerase to the CTD of Pol II and, consequently, inhibit transcription (Fig. 4a, b). The site bound by Nb8192 overlaps with the polymerase dimer interface that has been identified as important for cRNA to vRNA replication7. Binding at this site would therefore prevent polymerase dimerisation and, in agreement, Nb8192 was found to inhibit RNA replication (Fig. 4c, d), as demonstrated previously for Nb82057 which has a binding site overlapping with that of Nb8192. Although the site bound by Nb8192 has not been shown to contribute to Pol II CTD binding our data suggest that it might play a role as Nb8192 also inhibited Pol II CTD binding and transcription. Overall, our data reinforce previous findings that the PA C-terminal domain plays a central role in multiple functions during RNA synthesis including Pol II CTD binding during transcription and providing a polymerase dimerisation interface during replication (Fig. 4a–d).In summary, we have solved the structure of the RNA polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. We have also identified sites on the polymerase surface that are sensitive to inhibition by nanobodies and proposed inhibitory mechanisms. These inhibitory sites are highly conserved across the polymerases of influenza A virus strains (Supplementary Figs. 5a–c, 9c) and as such present exciting therapeutic targets for small molecule compounds or inhibitory peptides.MethodsNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomised and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.CellsHuman embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T), Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK), and Sf9 insect cells were sourced from the Cell Bank of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) + 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) and Sf9 cells were maintained in Sf-900 II serum-free medium. Cell lines have not been authenticated but tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Protein expression and purificationThe three polymerase genes from influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) virus were codon optimised for insect cells and synthesised (Synbio Technologies). Genes were then cloned into the Multibac system with protein expression and purification carried out as previously described7. The nanobodies were generated and purified as previously described7,27. In brief, plasmids encoding C-terminally His-tagged nanobodies were transformed into Escherichia coli WK6, grown in LB supplemented with 0.1% glucose (w/v), 1 mM MgCl2, and 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to OD600 = 0.7, induced overnight with 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) at 28 °C and collected by centrifugation (3500 × g, 15 min). Nanobodies were released from the periplasm by osmotic shock. Soluble nanobodies were separated from the protoplasts by centrifugation (4000 × g, 30 min), and recovered from the clarified supernatant by binding to Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). Nanobodies were next eluted from Ni-NTA resin by applying 500 mM imidazole and concentrated by centrifugation using Amicon Ultra Filters (Sigma, 10 kDa cut-off). Nanobodies were buffer exchanged into 25 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl for storage at −20 °C. Sequence comparison of the nanobodies was carried out using Clustal W28. The cap-mid-link construct (residues 247–536 of PB2) from influenza A/duck/Fujian/01/2002 (H5N1) was expressed and purified as previously described29.Cryo-EM sample preparationTo determine the structure of the polymerase an approach similar to that described by Kouba et al was utilised16. Briefly, polymerase was mixed with a 1.2 molar excess of vRNA promoters (5′ vRNA 5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′, 3′ vRNA 5′-GGCCUGCUUUUGCUAUU-3′ with a 3 nucleotide long extension at the 3′ end (italics)) and a 50 molar excess of Baloxavir acid (Aobious) and left on ice for 10 min. Subsequently a 1.5 molar excess of synthetic capped mRNA primer (m7GpppAm-AUCUAUAAUAG) and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mM were added. To allow limited extension of the product, nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 1 mM CTP, and 1 mM ApCpp (adenosine-5′-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20 °C overnight before being applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl. The eluted sample was concentrated to 0.9 mg ml−1 and before grid preparation the sample was diluted 1:3 with HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 37.5 mM NaSCN, 0.0075% (v/v) Tween20 to give a final protein concentration of 0.25–0.3 mg ml−1. A volume of 3.5 μl was applied to glow discharged Quantifoil Holey Carbon (R2/1, 200 mesh, either gold or copper), blotted for 3.0–3.5 s and plunge frozen in liquid ethane. Grids were prepared using a Vitrobot mark IV (FEI) at 100% humidity. To prepare polymerase-vRNA-nanobody complex, first polymerase was mixed with a 1.2 molar excess of vRNA promoters (5′ vRNA 5′-pAGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′, 3′ vRNA 5′-GGCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′) and applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl. Then a 1.5 molar excess of purified nanobody was added to vRNA-bound polymerase concentrated to 0.9 mg ml−1. Grids were prepared as above.Cryo-EM image collection and processingFor the initial structure determination of the polymerase, data was collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios equipped with a K2 Summit (Gatan) camera and a GIF Quantum energy filer at the Oxford Particle Imaging Centre. The data was collected using SERIALEM30. Data was processed on-the-fly using cryoSPARC-Live V2.1531. Data were motion corrected and the CTF estimated using patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2). Particles taken from a subset of the dataset, picked using the cryoSPARC blob picker, were used to generate templates for complete picking using the cryoSPARC template picker. To remove bad particles, 2D classes were generated before particles from good classes were subjected to ab initio model generation followed by heterogeneous refinement. Particles from one class were then refined with non-uniform refinement and per particle CTF refinement to give a consensus refinement to 2.79 Å. Further heterogeneous refinement using eight copies of the consensus model enabled the discrimination of three discrete conformations within the dataset. The conformations with resolved polymerase core and PA endonuclease were further classified using 3D-variability analysis and models showing similarly ordered priming loop and endonuclease density were combined (Class 2a/b). These were all subsequently refined using a final non-uniform refinement32. To assist with the interpretation of maps for the other two conformations the deepEMhancer programme14 was used to locally sharpen the complete transcriptase (Class 1) and partial replicase (Class 3) conformations. The wideTarget model provided the most easily interpretable maps. A comparison of the unsharpened and deepEMhancer maps is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.For model building the structure of the A/NT/60/68 influenza virus polymerase (PDB ID: 6RR7) was used as an initial model that was first changed to the polymerase sequence of the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 influenza virus then rigid-body fit into the map with ChimeraX V1.133. Iterative cycles of COOT34 and real-space refinement in PHENIX35 were used to improve model geometry and the fit to the map. Model geometry was monitored using MolProbity36. For the complete transcriptase and partial replicase conformations, the model of the polymerase core with the resolved PA endonuclease and priming loop PL was first positioned using ChimeraX V1.1437 before the PB2 C-terminal domains were generated and manually placed into the appropriate density. These models were then rigid-body real-space refined in PHENIX. Manual adjustment of the C-terminal PB2 domains in COOT was used to achieve domain connectivity and make gross changes to the model. Due to the somewhat poorly resolved nature of these regions only restrained real-space refinement was carried out on these areas.The polymerase-vRNA-nanobody complex data were collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios microscope with either a K2 Summit (Gatan) and GIF Quantum energy filter or Falcon 3 detector or on a 200 kV Glacios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) microscope with a Falcon 3 detector at the Oxford Particle Imaging Centre. Automated data collection was carried out using EPU versions 2.3–2.5. Sample specific cryo-EM data collection parameters have been summarised in Supplementary Fig. 2. Data processing was carried out within cryoSPARC versions V2.12–3.0. Briefly, raw movies were first motion corrected, before the contrast transfer function was estimated by Gctf v1.0638 and micrographs of poor quality were removed. Particles were subsequently picked by the blob picker and classified by 2D classification to provide templates for template based picking. Iterative 2D classification produced a pool of particles from which three initial models were generated, with the classes showing extra density further refined with a non-uniform refinement. For some datasets, particles were further classified with 3D-variability analysis in cryoSPARC V2.13–2.15. As the maps were not of sufficient quality to build the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) ab initio, a model for each nanobody was generated using SWISSMODEL39, and the CDR loops removed. This approach was taken as modelling of CDRs is highly inaccurate and this approach avoids possible misinterpretation of our models. To generate models, the resolved polymerase core with PA endonuclease and priming loop conformation (Class 2b) and the nanobody structure was fit in UCSF Chimera V1.17. Note that some of the nanobody-related densities appear to have more volume than expected (for example Nb8204); this could be due to severe preferential orientation affecting the reconstruction or the presence of a C-terminal linker and His-tag. All maps and models have been deposited in the EMDB and PDB, respectively. Cryo-EM figures were prepared using ChimeraX V1.133. Cryo-EM data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Supplementary Table 1.SEC analysis of nanobody binding to cap-mid-linkOne hundred microliters of cap-mid-link at 1 mg ml−1 was mixed with a 1.5× molar excess of either Nb8193, Nb8194, Nb8195, Nb8197, or Nb8208 and applied to a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated in 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM DTT.Crystallisation of nanobody-cap-mid-link complexesPurified cap-mid-link was mixed with a 1.5× molar excess of either Nb8193, Nb8194, or Nb8208 and applied to a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated in 20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM DTT. Fractions containing the cap-mid-link-nanobody complex were concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 and 100 nl was mixed with 100 nl reservoir solution for a sitting drop crystallisation experiment. The Nb8193-cap-mid-link complex formed crystals in a condition containing 20% w/v PEG3350 and 200 mM (NH4)2 citrate. The Nb8194-cap-mid-link complex formed crystals in a condition containing 25% w/v PEG3350, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The Nb8208 complex crystals formed only after 6 weeks in a condition containing 20% w/v PEG3350, 1 M (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM BIS-TRIS propane, pH 5.5. Prior to diffraction experiments all crystals were cryoprotected by addition of 20% v/v glycerol to the crystallisation solution and frozen in liquid nitrogen.Diffraction and structure solution of nanobody-cap-mid-link complexesAll data were collected at Diamond Light Source on beamline I03. Data reduction for all datasets was carried out with autoPROC and STARANISO40. Molecular replacement in PHASER41 was carried out using cap-mid-link (PDB ID 6S5V) and nanobody (PDB ID 6QPG) structures as search models. Molecular replacement for the Nb8193 found two copies of the cap-mid-link construct and two copies of the nanobody in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. For the Nb8194 dataset one copy of the cap-mid-link and one copy of the nanobody was found. Initial searches with complete cap-mid-link failed for the Nb8208 dataset; truncation down to a cap-binding domain only allowed PHASER to place two copies of this domain and two copies of the nanobody. Subsequently iterative rounds of refinement in real and reciprocal space were carried out using COOT34 and PHENIX35, respectively. Refinements were carried out without the use of Ramachandran restraints. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarised in Supplementary Table 2. Crystallography figures were prepared with PyMOL.In vitro polymerase transcription assayIn vitro polymerase transcription assays were carried out as previously described21. In short, a cap-1 structure was added to a synthetic 11 nucleotides long RNA (5′-ppGAAUACUCAAG-3′) or 20 nucleotides long RNA (5′-ppAAUCUAUAAUAGCAUUAUCC-3′) (ChemGenes) by mixing 1 μM of RNA with 0.25 μM [α-32P] GTP (3000 Ci mmol−1; Perkin-Elmer), 0.8 mM S-adenosylmethionine, 0.5 U μl−1 vaccinia virus capping enzyme (NEB) and 2.5 U μl−1 2′-O-methyltransferase (NEB) in a 20 μl reaction at 37 °C for 1 h. The product was isolated using 16% w/v denaturing PAGE, excised, eluted overnight in distilled H2O and desalted using NAP-10 columns (GE Healthcare). Transcription reactions were performed using the capped RNA primer in a 3 μl reaction mixture containing 0.4 pmoles purified polymerase, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM UTP, 0.5 mM CTP, 0.5 mM GTP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2U ul−1 RNasin, 0.5 μM 5′ vRNA promoter (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′), 0.5 μM 3′ vRNA promoter (5′-GGCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and kept at 0 °C overnight. Equal volume of 2x RNA loading dye containing 80% formamide, 1 mM EDTA and bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol was added followed by incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Products were resolved by 20% w/v denaturing PAGE and visualised via phosphorimaging on an FLA-5000 scanner (Fuji). Experiments were performed with three independently purified batches of polymerase expressed in insect cells.PlasmidsThe pCAGGS-PB1-1918, pCAGGS-PB2-1918, pCAGGS-PA-1918, pCAGGS-NP-1918 plasmids expressing the polymerase subunits and NP of influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus have been described42. The pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2, pcDNA-PA, pcDNA-NP plasmids expressing the polymerase subunits and NP of influenza A/NT/60/1968 (H3N2), A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Fujian/01/2002 (H5N1) viruses have been described43,44. The plasmid expressing vRNA, encoding a luciferase-reporter gene, under the control of a human RNA polymerase I promoter has also been described45. The pcDNA-PB2-1918-TAP plasmid expressing PB2 of influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 with a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag that consists of a calmodulin binding domain (CBD), a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, and two copies of protein A, was cloned by replacing the PB2 open reading frame of pcDNA-PB2-TAP46 with that of pCAGGS-PB2-1918. The pHW2000 reverse genetics plasmids for influenza A/WSN/33 have been described47. The pHW2000-PB1-1918, pHW2000-PB2-1918, pHW2000-PA-1918 and pHW2000-NP-1918 plasmids were cloned by transferring the open reading frames from the corresponding pCAGGS plasmids and inserting the non-coding 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences of A/Brevig Mission/1/191848. The mammalian cell expression plasmids of C-terminally His-tagged nanobodies were generated by PCR amplification of the of the nanobody genes from the bacterial pMESy4 nanobody expression plasmids7 and cloning of PCR products into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing.Purification of recombinant RNPRecombinant RNPs of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus were generated by transfecting 5 μg of each plasmid encoding PB1, PB2, PA and NP of influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus and the neuraminidase vRNA of influenza A/WSN/33 virus into ~0.16 × 108 HEK293T cells in a 15 cm dish. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole cell lysates were harvested 48 h post transfection. RNPs were affinity-purified using IgG Sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare) and released using Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease (Thermofisher Scientific) in 2 ml cleavage buffer, containing 10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Igepal, 1× PMSF, 1 mM DTT and AcTEV (1U per 100 μl IgG Sepharose), as described previously49.In vitro RNP activity assay and primer extension analysisA total of 10 μl of recombinant RNP was mixed with 20 ng rabbit globin mRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) as primer donor, 200 ng of purified nanobody or equivalent volume of nanobody purification buffer7, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.5 mM CTP, 0.5 mM UTP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 2U μl−1 RNasin in a reaction volume of 20 μl. After 4 h incubation at 30 °C, RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA levels were analysed using primer extension as previously described21. In brief, RNA was reverse-transcribed using excess 32P-labelled primers specific to positive-sense mRNA and cRNA. Primer extension products derived from mRNA and cRNA can be distinguished based on size because of the presence of globin mRNA-derived sequences at 5′ end of mRNA. Primer extension products were separated by 6% w/v denaturing PAGE and visualised by phosphorimaging on an FLA-5000 scanner (Fuji). Analysis was carried out using ImageJ (Fiji) and Prism 8 (GraphPad). Experiments were performed with three independently purified batches of RNPs.Luciferase minireplicon assayApproximately 0.16 × 106 HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.04 μg of each plasmid encoding PB1, PB2, PA and NP of influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1), A/NT/60/1968 (H3N2) or A/Fujian/01/2002 (H5N1) virus, 0.2 μg of plasmid encoding a luciferase vRNA segment, and 0.8 μg nanobody plasmid or an empty pcDNA3 vector. Cells were collected 20 h after transfection, and total cell lysates were obtained by adding 100 μl Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega) to the cells, followed by vigorous shaking for 10 min. The presence of luciferase enzyme was determined using a luciferase-based detection system following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). In brief, 100 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) was added to 20 μl of whole cell lysate in a 96-well opaque plate. The plate was immediately read in microplate reader SpectraMax M3 (Molecular Devices). Two technical replicates were carried out for each transfection and mean values were calculated. These mean values for three independent transfections were used in subsequent analysis in Excel (Microsoft) and Prism 8 (GraphPad).Influenza virus reverse geneticsRecombinant influenza virus was produced by reverse genetics as described previously47. In brief, ~0.6 × 106 HEK293T cells, cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS, were transfected with 0.5 μg of each pHW2000 plasmid encoding PB1, PB2, PA, NP of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 and HA, NA, M, NS of A/WSN/33 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 24 h post-transfection, cell medium was replaced with DMEM with 0.5% FCS and supernatant was collected 48 h after replacing the medium. The efficiency of reverse genetics was evaluated by titrating the supernatant on MDBK cells, in a standard plaque assay. Viral amplification and serial passages were performed by infecting MDBK cells at an M.O.I. of 0.01 in MEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS and L-glutamine.Virus growth analysisApproximately 1 × 106 HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA plasmid encoding Nb8190, Nb8191, Nb8192, Nb8207, Nb8208, and Nb8210 or an empty pcDNA3 vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, 20 h after transfection, cells were infected with a reassortant influenza A/WSN/33 virus encoding polymerase and NP genes of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. Cell culture medium was collected 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after infection, and virus titres were determined by plaque assay. At each time point, total cellular RNA was also extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and viral RNA levels were analysed by primer extension.Cell viability assayApproximately 1 × 106 HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA plasmid encoding nanobodies or an empty pcDNA3 vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell viability was determined 24 h post-transfection using a CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells infected with a reassortant influenza A/WSN/33 virus encoding polymerase and NP genes of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 for 48 h served as positive control.Binding assay of influenza virus polymerase to Pol II CTDBinding of purified viral polymerase to a four heptad repeat synthetic Pol II CTD mimic peptide phosphorylated on serine-5 of the heptad repeats in the presence of nanobodies was determined as previously described25. In brief, 20 µg Pol II CTD mimic peptide were bound to 10 µl streptavidin agarose resin (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed twice with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES [PAA catalogue no. S11-001], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % (v/v) Igepal, 1 mM PMSF), blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in wash buffer, before 4 µg of 1918 polymerase, with or without a twofold excess of nanobodies over polymerase, was added to the peptide-coated beads followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Complexes were washed five times with wash buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).Primary transcription, cRNA stabilisation and replication assaysFor the primary transcription assay ~0.2 × 106 HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 µg of pcDNA nanobody expression plasmids. For the cRNA stabilisation and replication assays the cells were also transfected with 0.4 µg of each of pCAGGS-1918-PB1a (for cRNA stabilisation assay) or pCAGGS-PB1 (for replication assay) and pCAGGS-PB2, pCAGGS-PA, pCAGGS-NP plasmids. At 48 h post-transfection cells were infected with a reassortant influenza A/WSN/33 virus encoding polymerase and NP genes of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in the presence of 100 µg/mL cycloheximide. Total cellular RNA was harvested 4 h post-infection using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and RNA levels were analysed by primer extension.Western blottingWestern blotting to determine the expression of nanobodies was carried out using a specific goat anti-alpaca polyclonal antibody conjugated to HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch), while actin was blotted using a rabbit anti-β-actin primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and then goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) or Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) were used for detection. Note that the anti-alpaca polyclonal antibody exhibits varying levels of affinity for different nanobodies; hence, band intensities for different nanobodies in western blots are not directly comparable.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

All Rights Reserved.January 11, 2022By Sara LaJeunesseHERSHEY, Pa. — Acceptance of a combination influenza-COVID-19 vaccine among minority individuals is higher than for the COVID-19 vaccine alone, according to new research led by Penn State. The results suggest that bundling COVID-19 vaccines or boosters with influenza vaccines may be a convenient option to increase future uptake of both vaccines among minorities. “Millions of people in the United States remain unvaccinated to COVID-19 due to persistent vaccine hesitancy,” said Robert Lennon, associate professor of family and community medicine, College of Medicine, Penn State. “As new variants continue to emerge, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to have a disproportionate impact on minority individuals given historic disparities in health care access and quality. It is critical to improve access to and education about vaccines for these individuals.” According to Lennon, some vaccine manufacturers have announced that they are pursuing the development of a combined COVID-19-influenza vaccine. “This is important,” he said, “because our research suggests that a combination vaccine may entice more minority individuals to get vaccinated than either the COVID-19 or influenza vaccine alone.” In their study, Lennon and his colleagues — including Ray Block, Brown-McCourtney Career Development Professor in the McCourtney Institute and associate professor of political science and African American studies, Penn State — collaborated with the African American Research Collaborative (AARC), an organization dedicated to bringing an accurate understanding of African American civic engagement to the public discourse. Together, the team developed a survey and conducted a national telephone and online poll of more than 12,887 U.S. minority adults — including Latino/a/X, Black/African American, Asian American or Pacific Islander, Native American/American Indian and White — from May 7-June 7, 2021. “Our goal was to determine the acceptability of a combination influenza-COVID-19 vaccine compared to influenza or COVID-19 vaccines alone in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults,” said Lennon. “This is the largest COVID-19 vaccine intention study that we know of; certainly, it’s the largest for underserved minorities.” To assess acceptance of the seasonal flu vaccine alone, the team asked participants, “Do you plan to get the flu vaccine this year? (a) yes, (b) no or (c) don’t know/unsure.” The team assessed acceptance of an annual COVID-19 vaccine by asking participants, “Some medical professionals think COVID-19 vaccines may need to be taken annually, similar to the seasonal flu vaccine. Would you say (a) I would definitely take an updated COVID-19 vaccine once per year, (b) I might take an updated COVID-19 vaccine each year or (c) I would not take an updated COVID-19 vaccine each year.” Acceptance of a combination COVID-19-flu vaccine was measured by asking participants, “Would you be willing to take a combination COVID-19-flu vaccine as one shot every year to protect yourself from both COVID-19 and influenza? (a) yes, (b) no or (c) don’t know/unsure.” The team found that 45% of respondents said that they have, will certainly or will most likely get a COVID-19 vaccine, while 58% said they would get an influenza vaccine. For a combination influenza-COVID-19 vaccine, overall acceptance was 50%. The findings published on Dec. 7 in the journal Vaccine. “It is interesting that acceptance was higher for the combination vaccine than for the COVID-19 vaccine,” said Block. “This may be due to the convenience of getting two vaccines in one visit or even concern over increased exposure during two visits compared to one. I think we could get some people who are hesitant to consider getting vaccinated if they know they can do them both at the same time.” Block noted that another explanation for the finding that more people would be willing to get a combination vaccine than a COVID-19 vaccine alone could be that the long history of influenza vaccine safety helped to reduce some participants’ concerns over the newness of the COVID-19 booster. “The fact that approximately half of the population we surveyed said they were willing to accept a combination vaccine suggests that bundling COVID-19 boosters with the highly accepted influenza vaccines may be a convenient option to increase uptake of vaccines among minorities,” said Lennon. “An optimal approach may be to offer a combination vaccine first, and if refused, offer individual influenza or COVID-19 boosters to accommodate those who will accept only one.” Other authors on the paper include Eric Schneider, senior vice president for policy and research, The Commonwealth Fund; Laurie Zephrin, vice president for advancing health equity, The Commonwealth Fund; Arnav Shah, senior research associate, The Commonwealth Fund; and members of The African American Research Collaborative 2021 COVID Group.

"We're swimming in Covid right now," said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious diseases physician at Children’s Hospital Colorado. At the same time, he said, there have been steady increases in flu cases, around 20 to 40 new cases over the past month. Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicInfluenza activity is “on the way up,” O’Leary said, but it’s “by no means overwhelming at this point.”Nationwide, three children have died from the flu this season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first two fatalities occurred in December and were the first pediatric deaths due to the disease in over a year.Flu hospitalizations have also steadily increased, totaling up to 33,000 from Oct. 1 through Jan. 8, according to preliminary data from the CDC.The number of flu-related hospital admissions reported to the federal government declined slightly over the last week, to 1,804, but the cumulative hospitalization rate so far this season is higher than the rate for the entire 2020-21 season, according to CDC data. The highest cumulative hospitalization rates for this year are for adults ages 65 and older, at 9.6 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, said Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist who leads the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team.That's followed by children ages 4 and under, at 4.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, she said, and adults between ages 50 and 64, at 2.9 hospitalizations per 100,000."At this time, it appears that this season is falling within the range of what is more seen during January during a typical flu season," Brammer said. The seasonal flu essentially vanished in the U.S. last year as more people worked from home and practiced social distancing due to the pandemic. But as states eased restrictions and more Americans returned to work, health experts predicted that there could be a more severe flu season this year.By all measures, it has been. The CDC estimated that there's been between 970 and 2,900 flu-related deaths in the U.S. since Oct. 1. To be sure, the number of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths still pale in comparison to those for Covid.U.S. Covid hospitalizations set a new record Thursday, increasing by 78 percent in the last two weeks to an average of 148,731 hospitalizations per day, according to an NBC News analysis of Department of Health and Human Services data. The nation is reporting an average of 1,890 Covid deaths per day.The surge in Covid hospitalizations is believed to be fueled by the supercontagious omicron variant.While the rise in flu hospitalizations may not have a huge impact on hospitals right now, doctors worry a continued increase could affect already overwhelmed hospital staff."When patients come into the hospital with the flu, that certainly presents some challenges in managing volumes in the emergency departments," said Akin Demehin, director of policy at the American Hospital Association. "To the extent that any of these patients need to be admitted to this hospital, that adds some strain."Health care workers are also at risk, he said."It also just doesn't have to be a doctor or a nurse being out that potentially has an impact on hospitals," he said. "It could be any of the other critically important workers from folks who cleaned the rooms to the respiratory therapist."So far, the eastern and central parts of the nation are seeing the most flu cases, but that could change, as influenza is often unpredictable, Brammer has previously said. She urged the public to get vaccinated against the flu, saying the flu vaccine is the best way "to protect yourself and your family from the potentially deadly consequences of a flu infection.""Additionally, there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness," she said. "CDC recommends prompt treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications."Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

James Li3 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 12, Article number: 505 (2022) Cite this article 4098 Accesses 4 Citations 3 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Assay systemsImmunochemistryInfluenza virus AbstractCurrent methods used for diagnosis of acute infection of pathogens rely on detection of nucleic acids, antigens, or certain classes of antibodies such as IgM. Here we report a virus enzyme assay as an alternative to these methods for detection of acute viral infection. In this method, we used a luciferin derivative as the substrate for detection of the enzyme activity of influenza viral neuraminidase as a means for diagnosis of influenza. The resulting commercial test, the qFLU Dx Test, uses a different supply chain that does not compete with those for the current tests. The assay reagents were formulated as a master mix that accommodated both the neuraminidase and luciferase reactions, thereby enabling rapid and prolonged production of stable light signal in the presence of influenza virus in the sample. The assay was evaluated using depository throat swab specimens. As expected, the assay exhibited similar detection rates for all influenza types and subtypes except for A(H7N9), which exhibited lower detection rate due to lower viral titer in the specimens. When throat swab specimens were diluted with the sample buffer of the test kit and tested with the qFLU Dx Test. The sensitivity and specificity were 82.41% (95% confidence interval: 79.66–85.84%) and 95.39% (95% confidence interval: 94.32–96.46%), respectively, for these diluted specimens in comparison to a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The uniqueness of the qFLU Dx Test as an enzymatic assay makes it highly complementary with currently available methods.

Current methods rely on detection of viral nucleic acids, antigens, or specific antibodies, which tend to compete with the same sources of key materials and lead to shortage of supplies. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates rapidly, which may affect the efficacy of these diagnostic assays. Here we propose an alternative method for detection of acute infection of a pathogen. Many viral pathogens contain unique enzymes, the activities of which may be effective diagnostic markers. Some of these enzymes had been successfully used as therapeutic drug targets, indicating that they should also provide sufficient specificity of diagnosis of infection.Here we report a biochemiluminescent assay for detection of influenza viral neuraminidase (NA) activity as a means for detection of influenza. Influenza viral neuraminidase is an effective target of a newer generation of influenza therapeutic drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme, suggesting that a unique and specific substrate can be designed for use in diagnosis. A substrate derivatized with firefly luciferin improves the sensitivity considerably. Further improvement makes the assay suitable for use in point of care settings.Like SARS-CoV-2 virus, influenza virus constantly mutates itself, and can easily be transmitted from one individual to another, annually affecting 5–10% adults and 20–30% children in the world1,2. It is estimated that globally, annual epidemics of influenza lead to 3–5 million cases of severe illness, which may require hospitalization, and about 250,000–500,000 deaths3. An uncontained pandemic influenza may lead to far worse consequences4. Rapid diagnosis of epidemic or pandemic influenza plays an important role in effective management of influenza and public health.Rapid influenza diagnosis tests (RIDTs) intended for detection of active infection, which can be completed within 30 min, fall into two categories, i.e., those that detect viral antigens and those that detect viral nucleic acids. The antigen assays have a number of drawbacks, the most significant one being lack of sensitivity4,5,6,7,8. Molecular-based influenza assays, which detect the viral nucleic acids, offer better sensitivity. Among these tests, however, only a few can be completed within 30 min9,10,11,12,13,14 and thus suitable for point of care use. Antigen and nucleic acid assays suffer from a common drawback in that they all rely on static epitopic or genetic sequences, which are susceptible to mutations. Indeed, the lateral flow based RIDTs were found to be less sensitive for detection of the pH1N1 virus during the H1N1 pandemic15.Influenza viral NA activity as a diagnostic marker for influenza had been previously explored. A colorimetric substrate specific for influenza viral NA was developed and successfully used in an assay for detection of influenza, demonstrating the feasibility of this strategy16,17,18,19,20. A more sensitive chemiluminescent substrate derivatized with dioxetane was subsequently developed and used in a test for influenza diagnosis21,22. Although the chemiluminescent assay had 88% clinical sensitivity in comparison to culture method when nasal aspirate specimens were used23,24, the assay was too complex for it to be widely adopted for clinical use, particularly for point of care use.Here we report a biochemiluminescent assay using a luciferin derivatized substrate for specific detection of influenza viral NA activity3,25,26. The assay reagents were formulated as a lyophilized master mix to simplify the assay procedure, which essentially is a one-step assay (Fig. 1). Presence of influenza viral NA in the reaction generates stable light signal, which lasts for at least 2 h. The stable light signal can be detected using a simple luminometer. The entire detection procedure takes approximately 15 min. Because firefly luciferase/luciferin is a highly sensitive biochemiluminescence, the qFLU Dx Test is sensitive. The present work demonstrated the feasibility of using viral enzyme activity as a means for detection of acute viral infection.Figure 1Biochemiluminescence Reaction. The qFLU Dx Test uses 4, 7-dimethyl neuraminic acid -O-luciferin as the substrate for detection of influenza virus. In the presence of Type A or B influenza virus, viral neuraminidase cleaves the substrate to release the luciferin moiety, which is oxidized to oxyluciferin by luciferase to generate light signal. Since the substrate is continuously cleaved the neuraminidase to result in luciferin that is continuously oxidized to generate light signal, this is a “real time” assay with glow light feature.Full size imageMaterials and methodsqFLU Dx test procedureThe assay is referred to as the qFLU Dx Test or Assay. All reagents were present in a master mix that was lyophilized as a reagent bead. One reagent bead is for one reaction. The reaction is initiated upon addition of a sample in the sample buffer. The resulting reaction solution contains the following active ingredients: 0.012 mg/mL substrate, 0.024 mg/mL firefly luciferase, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 15 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM CaCl2. The substrate and luciferase were produced in-house by Cellex while the other ingredients were purchased from Sigma or FishserScientific.As illustrated in Fig. 1, the substrate is cleaved by the NA in a sample to release luciferin, which is then detected with luciferase that is present in the master reagent mix. Presence of influenza viral NA in the reaction generates stable glow light signal that can be detected with a luminometer.A swab sample was inserted into qSample buffer tube (2.0 mL) for sample elution. To perform detection, 0.25 mL of the sample was added to the test tube containing a master mix reagent bead. Following swirling of the sample solution to dissolve and mix the reagent bead, which took approximately 10 s, the reaction tube was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The test tube was then placed in Helios 2000 Version 1.0 Analyzer for signal detection. Cutoff value in relative light unit (RLU) was pre-set for the Helios 2000 analyzer.For samples that were not collected in qSample Buffer, the samples were diluted 1:1 with 2× qSample Buffer and then used for detection as described above.Signal to cutoff value (S/CO) was used to interpret the test results. Since the relative light units (RLU) were used for luminometers and different brand of luminometers may define RLU differently, luminometers from different manufacturers should be calibrated. The cutoff value (CO) used in this study was set at 220,000 for Helios 2000 luminometer by testing approximately 400 negative nasal swab specimens. Helios 2000 was then used to calibrate the RLU of Helios 200 by repeatedly testing serially diluted samples. The cutoff RLU value for the Helios 200 was 220 (1/1000 of the Helios 2000 cutoff value). Samples with a S/CO value of 1.0 or above were considered positive.Sources and propagation of microbial organismsInfluenza virus strains A/CA/072009 and A/NC/39/2009 were from Dr. Larisa Gubareva’s laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These virus strains were propagated in Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells according to the WHO protocol. Other influenza viruses were purchased from ATCC and used without propagation. The subtypes were provided for all type A virus (Table 2). The type B virus isolates tested were collected before 1983 when there was only one lineage of circulating type B virus.Detection of retrospectively collected clinical specimensThese specimens were collected during 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 influenza seasons in Asia as part of a public health surveillance program. The clinical specimens were collected as throat swabs, eluted in 3 mL of veal infusion broth or Hank’s salt solution and frozen at − 70 °C or below. 0.4 mL of the sample was subjected to nucleic acid extraction using magnetic particles. The resulting nucleic acids were used in a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection and typing of influenza viruses using the AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies, CA) and primers and probes recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). 0.3 mL of the sample was diluted with an equal volume of 2× qSample Buffer. 0.25 mL of the diluted sample was used for the qFLU Dx Test. Since these samples were not collected specifically for the present study and were unlinked from the donor identities, the study described here was not considered one, which involved human subjects.Data analysesExcel software was used for statistics analyses.InstrumentsqFLU Dx Test uses a luminometer for detection of light signal. Portable desktop luminometers Helios 200 and Helios 2000 were used to measure the light signal in the studies.ResultsReaction kineticsTo assess the chemiluminescence reaction kinetics of the qFLU assay, a cultured influenza virus strain (A/WS/33) was diluted with 1× qSample Buffer to various concentrations and tested using the qFLU Dx Test. Signal intensity was recorded over a period of 60 min. The data showed that the signal reached plateau at approximately 5 min and was stable for at least 60 min after the initiation of reactions (Fig. 2). Thus, valid signal could be collected for influenza diagnosis between 5 and 60 min. A 15 min incubation at room temperature before signal detection was used for the qFLU Dx Test during the current studies.Figure 2Reaction kinetics. A reaction was initiated by adding 250 µL of sample containing an influenza virus to qFLU Dx Test master mix bead. The sample contained various concentration of virus (0–200,000 TCID50/mL. Compared to the negative sample, positive signal was detected within 2 min and stabilized at about 5 min. The signal was collected over a period of 60 min for each reaction. The signal intensity (RLU) was plotted against the time to establish a time course reaction kinetics.Full size imageAssay linear rangeThe qFLU Dx Test was designed to be a semi-quantitative assay. This study was carried out to assess the analytic linear range of the qFLU Dx Test. Samples containing various concentrations of an influenza virus strain (A/CA/07/2009) were tested with the qFLU Dx Test. A scattering plot using the log transformed virus concentrations and signal intensity (RLU) was constructed to estimate the correlation coefficient (R2) over the virus concentration range. The correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.9967 (95% CI 0.9690–1.0; Fig. 3) over a range of 4 logs.Figure 3Linearity and linear range. A scattering plot between the signal intensity (relative light units, RLU) collected at 15 min after reaction initiation and influenza virus concentrations of A/pH1N1/CA/07/2009, both in log units. There was a linear relationship (R2 > 0.99) between the signal intensity (RLU) in log units and virus concentrations in log units with a linear range of greater than 4 logs.Full size imageAssay analytical sensitivityTo assess the analytical sensitivity of the qFLU Dx Test, a recombinant NA derived from Aurkey/Wisconsin/1/1966 (H9N2) and produced in Sf9 insect cells as a His-tagged protein was sequentially diluted in 1× qSample Buffer. Each diluted sample was tested in five replicates. Quantitative signal intensity related to neuraminidase concentrations was observed (Table 1). Signals above the background were detected when NA concentration was 0.08 ng/mL or higher; above cutoff signals (220,000) were detected when NA concentration was 2.22 ng/mL or higher (Table 1). Table 1 A recombinant influenza viral neuraminidase was serially diluted in qSample buffer.Full size tableLimit of detectionLimit of detection (LoD) was defined as the lowest concentration tested at which 95% of replicates was positive but further dilution would result in less than 95% positivity rate. The virus stock was first serially diluted, and three replicates were tested. A concentration resulting in all three positive test results but one more dilution resulting in at least one or more negative test results was considered preliminary LoD concentration. Twenty replicates were then tested at the preliminary LoD concentration. If at least 19 of the twenty replicates were tested positive, the concentration was considered the LoD concentration. Two influenza virus strains (A/pH1N1/CA/07/2009 and A/pH1N1/NC/37/2009) were diluted to concentrations approaching the limits of detection with signal to cutoff (S/CO) ratios close to 1.0. Twenty replicates were tested for each dilution for both virus strains. 100% replicates were positive for strain A/CA/07/2009 when tested at 995 TCID50/mL or higher and for strain A/NC/37/2009 when tested at 953 TCID50/mL or higher (Table 2). Thus, the LoD for A/pH1N1/CA/07/2009 and A/pH1N1/NC/37/2009 were 995 and 953 TCID50/mL, respectively.Table 2 Various virus strains were diluted to concentrations that generated a signal intensity close to the cutoff signal.Full size tableOther influenza virus strains were purchased from ATCC, diluted in 1× qSample Buffer without propagation and tested in triplicate at various concentrations. All influenza virus strains exhibited NA activity and could be detected with the qFLU Dx test. The lowest concentration resulting in positive detection for all replicates is listed in Table 2 for all virus strains.The virus isolates used in this study were collected from 1933 to 2009. All showed neuraminidase activity that could be detected with the qFLU Dx Test, indicating that despite expected mutations accumulated over time, these viruses have retained the neuraminidase activity detectable with the substrate used in the qFLU assay.Detection of retrospectively collected clinical specimensThe qFLU Dx Test was evaluated using 2215 frozen clinical specimens collected as throat swabs during 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 influenza seasons. All these specimens had been previously tested and, if positive, typed/subtyped with RT-PCR assay according to the WHO protocol (for an updated protocol, please refer to https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/Protocols_influenza_virus_detection_Jan_2020.pdf). Since these specimens were not eluted in qSample Buffer, 0.3 mL of the specimens were mixed with an equal volume of 2× qSample Buffer and tested with the qFLU Dx Test. The PCR test results were unknown to the technicians before the qFLU Dx Test was performed.Of the 2215 specimens, there were 739 RT-PCR-positive specimens, of which there were 593 and 146 influenza virus Types A and B, respectively. Of the 593 influenza virus Type A specimens, there were 173 A(H1N1), 95 A(pH1N1), 305 A(H3N2), and 20 A(H7N9) specimens.The RT-PCR method was used as a comparator test for estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the qFLU Dx Test. Overall, the qFLU Dx Test had a sensitivity and specificity of 82.41% (95% confidence interval: 79.66–85.84%) and 95.39% (95% confidence interval: 94.32–96.46%), respectively, when compared to the RT-PCR assay (Table 3). Both types A and B virus had similar sensitivity of 82.80% and 80.82%, respectively. In addition, all influenza virus A subtypes except for A(H7N9) had similar sensitivity (Table 4). The qFLU Dx Test detected 14 of the 20 RT-PCR positive A(H7N9) specimens. It is interesting to note that the average signal strength (RLU) for the specimens containing the H7N9 virus was significantly lower than the other virus subtypes and Type B virus (Table 4). This may be due to lower viral load, lower specific activity of the enzyme, fewer enzyme molecules per virion particle, or other unknown reasons.Table 3 The sensitivity and specificity of the qFLU Dx Test were computed using the RT-PCR test results as the comparator test.Full size tableTable 4 The RT-PCR positive samples were grouped according to influenza virus types (A or B) and Type A subtypes (H1N1, pH1N1, H3N2 and H7N9).Full size tableThe throat samples used in the study were collected in 3 mL virus transport medium, which was further diluted 1:2 or 6 mL total volume/swab for use in qFLU Dx Test. In contrast, an antigen test normally uses a nasal swab eluted in 1 mL the swab specimen or about 6 times as concentrated as the specimens used in the present study.DiscussionDiagnostic assays, particularly those that can be used in point of care settings, play an important role in pandemic and epidemic management as vividly demonstrated in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the markers they detected, these diagnostic assays fall into two broad categories, the molecular assays which detect nucleic acids and immunoassays that detect antibodies or antigens. Here we reported another type of assay, which detects viral enzyme activities for detection of a viral infection.Most pathogenic viruses contain unique enzymes, which can be used as diagnostic markers. Viral enzyme assays provide several unique features. The key materials used in these assays are different from those used in molecular assays or immunoassays. Consequently, the enzyme assays do not compete with the supply chains of molecular assays or immunoassays, which is important as a pandemic may cause sudden and huge increase in demand of diagnostic tests. In addition, enzyme assays are generally less susceptible to virus mutations, which can happen during a pandemic or epidemic such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The present study showed that the influenza virus isolates collected in 1930’s could still be detected with the qFLU Dx Test for their neuraminidase activity (Table 1). On the other hand, molecular assays and immunoassays are vulnerable to virus mutation as they depend on nucleic acid or protein sequences. Moreover, the enzyme assays can also be converted to drug resistance tests as many of these enzymes are also pharmaceutical drug targets.The qFLU Dx Test described here is a biochemiluminescence assay, which detects the enzyme activity of influenza viral neuraminidase. In the presence of influenza virus, the assay produced stable light signal, which could be detected with a simple luminometer. The assay was simple and rapid. When throat swab specimens were used and tested in 1:2 dilution (one part specimen to two parts of qSample buffer), the assay showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 82.41% and 95.39%, respectively (Table 3). The assay showed similar detection rates for all influenza virus types/subtypes except for A (H7N9). The lower detection rate for A/H7N9 was likely due to lower viral load in the specimens, lower specific activity of the neuraminidase of this subtype virus, fewer NA molecules per virion particle, or other unknown reason (Table 4). Since neuraminidase activity of influenza virus is involved in dissimilation of the virus, the lower signal in H7N9 clinical specimens is worthy further investigation.The assay showed remarkable analytical sensitivity at less than 1 ng/mL neuraminidase. The clinical sensitivity was lower than expected. The lower clinical sensitivity can be attributed to the use of throat swab specimens, which were eluted in a large volume and were further diluted in the present study. Use of nasal swab specimens eluted in smaller volume of buffer without dilution should result in much improved clinical sensitivity as nasal swabs contain much higher viral load and sample dilution can lower the sensitivity.As expected, the substrate used in the qFLU Dx Test showed high specificity in analytical studies without cross reactivity with other viruses or bacterial species (see Supplemental Data). The test can tolerate a wide range of potentially interfering substances (Supplemental Data). These performance characteristics suggest that the qFLU Dx Test is suitable for clinical use. In summary, the data presented here showed that the qFLU Dx Test, which is based on detection of influenza viral enzyme for influenza diagnosis, may be a viable alternative for rapid diagnosis of influenza. This assay is easy to use, rapid and, thus, suitable for point of care use. Many pathogenic viruses also have enzymes that can be exploited for use as diagnostic markers.

Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development workers in hazmat suits have been removing the bodies of dead cranes from shallow, muddy waters.Photograph by Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance, Getty ImagesANIMALSWILDLIFE WATCHDeadly bird flu threatens Israel's wildlife, triggers hunting banThe outbreak is 'worst blow to wildlife' in the country's history.ByDina Fine MaronJanuary 10, 2022•6 min readIsrael has canceled the final month of its five month-long hunting season in a bid to contain a severe bird flu outbreak that’s killed as many as 8,000 wild cranes and sparked concerns about infection among threatened bird species.Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg tweeted in December that this outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu is the “worst blow to wildlife” in Israel’s history and that the full extent of its damage is “still unclear.” The January hunting ban will help limit human-wildlife interactions. The ministry says it’s concerned that hunters unwittingly could spread the disease by carrying the virus on their shoes, tires, or via the dogs they use to collect the ducks and pigeons they shoot. Also, other birds disturbed by hunters may fly to new sites, spreading the virus. (The ministry did not respond to requests for comment about if there’s any evidence that hunters already had contributed to spread in these ways.)H5N1 was first detected at Israeli poultry farms about two months ago and it’s since been confirmed as the cause of death among common cranes, with a fifth of the population of majestic, long-necked birds already infected, according to Israeli authorities.Each fall, the cranes migrate from Russia, Ukraine, and Scandinavia to wintering grounds in Ethiopia and elsewhere, including Israel, where tens of thousands await the spring, many around a lake in the Hula Valley. There, in the north of the country, workers in hazmat suits have been scooping up the bodies of cranes from the water and surrounding areas.As with human influenza viruses, there are many strains of avian influenza, some more deadly than others. H5N1 is particularly virulent this season. It has hopscotched across Europe, where thousands of barnacle geese died in Scotland last month, and recently spread to North America.Avian flu can sicken other animals too, including those that eat infected birds or their remains. To help control its spread in Israel, about a million farmed turkeys, ducks, and hens have been killed, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.People rarely have contracted H5N1, and typically only after lengthy exposure to infected birds. The last reported H5N1 human infection occurred in India in July 2021. So far, no Israeli cases have been detected, but last week, a case in southwestern England was reported to the World Health Organization, although the particular strain still has to be identified. Israeli governmental guidance advises that poultry and eggs are safe to eat if they’re properly cooked. The hunting ban is a “preventive measure” to protect both wildlife and people, says Yoav Perlman, the director of BirdLife Israel, an arm of the nonprofit Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. His group has been helping count the thousands of dead cranes. He says a few other wild birds—mostly pelicans, herons, and some raptors—have been confirmed with the virus.Crane deaths are tapering off, but “we are concerned that avian flu might hit raptors, especially eagles in the Hula Valley and other valleys where cranes concentrate,” Perlman says. Hula Valley is important as a wintering site for globally threatened greater spotted eagles and eastern imperial eagles and for white-tailed eagles, which are threatened in Israel. The eagles are scavengers and have been seen feeding on dead cranes in the Hula Valley, he says.Other threatened birds at risk in Israel include the endangered white-headed duck, with about 10 percent of its global population passing the winter in Israel at reservoirs also used by cranes and other waterbirds, according to Perlman. Also, he says, the globally threatened MacQueen’s bustard shares foraging and roosting sites with cranes in the northern Negev.Origins of the deadly virusThe H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996, in geese in China, and in humans in 1997 during a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong. In subsequent years, it’s been found in many countries around the world, showing up in Israel in March 2006, where it’s occurred almost every year since. The current outbreak is different, Israeli officials say, because it’s causing massive mortality rates among infected birds.“No one knows why this time it’s so severe,” says ornithologist Yossi Leshem, a professor emeritus at Tel Aviv University. Humans may have helped fuel some of the transmission, he says. As part of a government bird feeding program designed to keep the cranes from eating farmers’ crops, workers put out corn for them, causing dense concentrations of the birds in a small area. “It almost certainly increased the infection rates of this avian flu outbreak,” Perlman adds.For the future, Perlman says, “relevant conservation authorities and stakeholders will need to think hard about the feeding and the role of feeding.” But for now, they’re watching for further signs of H5N1. “This is by far the largest avian influenza event in cranes globally,” he says. It’s “unprecedented, and we need to investigate what happened.”Wildlife Watch is an investigative reporting project between National Geographic Society and National Geographic Partners focusing on wildlife crime and exploitation.

This article is 2 years old Endemic and seasonal, the future of coronavirus? The terms "endemism" and "seasonality" are increasingly used to refer to the covid-19 pandemic. They are sometimes incorrectly associated with the severity of the disease or with the premature end of the pandemic. What do they mean? Does SARS-CoV-2 fit these definitions? Will it ever do so thanks to vaccines? SMC Spain 13/01/2022 - 10:15 CET Versión en castellano We cannot yet know whether covid-19 will be endemic or seasonal, but this has no implications for the severity or severity of the disease. / Adobe Stock. What does it mean for a disease to be endemic? A disease is endemic when it is continuously present in a population in a given geographical area, as defined in Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice, third edition. For example, malaria is endemic in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. What is the difference between endemic, epidemic and pandemic? While an endemic refers to a constant presence of cases that do not exceed what is expected, an epidemic is an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases above what would be expected in that geographic area. In a pandemic this phenomenon occurs across several countries. Is covid-19 endemic? The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is still in the so-called pandemic phase, according to the 2005 WHO model based on influenza pandemics, which was revised after the 2009 pandemic. After phases 5 and 6 there is an inter-pandemic phase in which recurrent events may still occur. Finally, the post-pandemic phase is reached, in which the disease recovers its activity to typical seasonal levels. Phases of a pandemic. / WHO.This model is based on influenza and is not necessarily extrapolable to the current coronavirus pandemic, whose future is more uncertain. "For covid-19, other theoretical models have been proposed that attempt to contemplate non-pharmacological interventions, such as a spiral one that proposes a gradual decrease in response actions," explains Adrián Aginagalde, director of the Public Health Observatory of Cantabria. Will covid-19 be endemic one day? "Not all acute respiratory infections need to become endemic," Aginagalde qualifies. "The phenomenon is common for influenza viruses, but we don't know it for the others, so the post-pandemic phase may contemplate other scenarios, not just endemicity." Endemicity is common in influenza, but the post-pandemic phase of the coronavirus may involve other scenarios Adrián Aginagalde, director of the Public Health Observatory of Cantabria "Beyond the decrease in risk and the phenomenon of novelty that accompanies the appearance of any disease, we have no precedents where a coronavirus has been epidemic and then endemic," says Aginagalde. The case of the coronavirus responsible for MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) would be an exceptional example, "without sustained transmission between humans and with a complex zoonotic cycle". What does it mean for a disease to be seasonal? "We can speak of seasonal disease when its prevalence is linked to a time of year," explains health climatologist Dominic Royé, who has published research on this phenomenon in relation to SARS-CoV-2. The most typical example is influenza: although it circulates all year round, the highest number of cases occurs in winter. The factors that determine seasonality are very varied. "There are environmental factors such as temperature and humidity that influence transmission, because dry cold helps to increase it. There are also sociocultural factors, such as social contact and the longer stay indoors," Royé explains. Is covid-19 seasonal? So far, the coronavirus has caused peaks in cases, hospitalizations and deaths at different times of the year. In the case of Spain, and after the initial explosion in spring 2020, these have been observed in months such as November, January, April and July. This CDC graph compares deaths from covid-19 and influenza in recent years. While the latter appears almost mathematically around week 50, SARS-CoV-2 has to date been much more chaotic. Deaths from influenza and covid-19. / CDC."I currently consider it not to be a seasonal disease," Royé explains. "As long as high-impact waves are occurring, I don't see a trend toward seasonality." As long as high-impact waves are occurring, I don't see a trend toward seasonality in covid-19 Dominic Royé, health climatologist In the case of the covid-19 pandemic, Royé has studied other factors at play. "The variation in the effective reproduction number explained by government interventions is six times larger than for the average temperature," he says. In other words: "Environmental effects exist [in the case of SARS-CoV-2], but their effect is moderate and, in addition, our habits and government interventions have much more influence." Will covid-19 ever be seasonal? "Estimating the timing is still very difficult," comments Royé, who believes that this step will occur if covid-19 becomes endemic after the pandemic phase. Aginagalde recalls that MERS "does not seem to have a clear seasonality and has not decreased its overall lethality or morbidity." If it becomes seasonal and/or endemic, will that mean that covid-19 has become milder? "Seasonality does not decrease severity," says Aginagalde. He explains that many acute respiratory infection pandemics start "off on the wrong foot" at a time of year that does not fit their typical seasonality, but subsequently become seasonalized and flare up in specific periods without diminishing their severity. "A simple example of the fact that being epidemic and seasonal does not change the severity can be seen in influenza: the intensity of the 2017-18 season was considerable compared to previous years and that did not mean it was no longer epidemic or seasonal," he adds. In other words, seasonality is a label that describes the distribution of a disease over time without implications for its severity or mildness. Dengue fever, chickenpox, malaria, Chagas disease, tuberculosis and smallpox are or have been endemic in many areas of the planet, regardless of their severity Something similar happens with the concept of endemism, which only refers to the constant presence of a disease in a geographic population. Dengue fever, chickenpox, malaria, Chagas disease, tuberculosis and smallpox are or have been endemic in many areas of the planet, sometimes for thousands of years, regardless of their severity. But don't viruses attenuate over time? The idea that parasites evolve towards a more or less peaceful coexistence with their host in an almost predestined way is a widely held dogma, but often criticized by evolutionary biologists. Counterexamples range from measles to polio to rabies to AIDS. Paul W. Ewald, an evolutionary biologist specializing in parasitism, extensively criticized this dogma in his 1994 book Evolution of Infectious Disease. "Few ideas have been so entrenched in the literature [...] Few ideas in science have been so widely accepted with so little evidence. And few ideas are so at odds with the fundamental principles on which they are supposedly based," he wrote. By principles he was referring to the theory of evolution by natural selection. The idea that parasites evolve towards a peaceful coexistence with their host in an almost predestined way is widespread, but is criticised by evolutionary biologists Criticism is based on the fact that natural selection acts at the level of the individual, without thinking about the common good of the species or the future. Therefore, the parasite does not care what happens to the host once it has been successfully transmitted, so attenuation is not an inevitable fate. For example, in diseases such as AIDS and covid-19, the virus can be transmitted long before the patient reaches the hospital. A separate issue is that the population immunity achieved against a new pathogen, through infections or vaccines, may give the impression that the disease is no longer as harmful as it was at the beginning. So what is the future of the covid-19 pandemic? "If it were to follow the model of the 1918 flu, there would be a seasonalization and a reduction in its spread and severity," comments Aginagalde, who considers that it is not "the best precedent" due to the extraordinary wartime circumstances in which this pandemic took place. "Nor do the cases of the influenza pandemics of the 1950s and 1960s, which were of short duration, seem extrapolable; or the Russian flu of 1889, which caused excess mortality for many years afterwards without losing intensity in the different waves, as did most of the nineteenth-century flus." "It could happen [that SARS-CoV-2 ends up being endemic and/or seasonal], but we have no data on previous coronaviruses to extrapolate from and influenza pandemic models have limitations to support the claim without a hint of doubt," Aginagalde adds. "We have to answer honestly that we want it, but we don't know."

(AP Photo/National Museum of Health)ExpandBy Charles SelleUPDATED: January 14, 2022 at 5:36 PM CSTLots of folks think this is the worst of times. It’s year two of a raging pandemic. Inflation is at the highest level since the early 1980s. There are fears our democracy is under attack.Add climate change to the stressful mix. It’s so bad Illinois students can now take up to five mental health days off because of the strain of today’s world.For those who are dealing with life’s day-to-day struggles in early 2022, I offer the book: “The Great Influenza.” First published by John M. Barry in 2004, it is subtitled: “The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.”As the title hints, the book is about the 1918-19 influenza epidemic, and a portend to what we are suffering through more than a century later. Before the “Spanish flu” pandemic faded in 1920, an estimated 21 million people worldwide died, many of them young men and women in the prime of life.Author Barry believes the global death toll from the influenza could be at least 50 million worldwide, perhaps even 100 million. Of those, more than 675,000 were Americans, a figure we surpassed some months ago in the current pandemic.COVID-19 deaths worldwide total 5.5 million. Of those, more than 842,000 were in the U.S.; 28,900 in Illinois and 1,170 in Lake County. If you come down with the coronavirus in Illinois right now, chances are high that it’s the omicron variant, which now accounts for around 95% of the country’s reported cases.Although the 1918 pandemic began in the U.S., most likely Kansas, it picked up the “Spanish flu” moniker because newspapers in Spain actually reported on the extent of the outbreak. That was unlike other European nations, and the U. S., which were under censorship rules during World War I in order to keep citizen morale high.Military bases suffered overwhelmingly from influenza, with more troops dying from influenza than in combat. In the U.S. alone, more than a million men and women were under arms in the waning months of World War I. The H1N1 influenza virus ravaged the population of those in their 20s and 30s, killing more of them than older Americans. Not spared from the rapid spread of the disease was Naval Station Great Lakes, whose first cases were reported on Sept. 7, 1918, believed to have been brought to the base from Boston-area transfers. At the peak of the influenza outbreak, September to November 1918, some 941 Great Lakes sailors died from the virus.“At this base, influenza ripped through the barracks very much like an explosion,” Barry writes of Great Lakes. He quotes a nurse at the Navy base adjacent to North Chicago, who remembered bodies “stacked in the morgue from floor to ceiling like cord wood.”Ambulances arrived daily, “and stretcher bearers carried sick sailors in and bodies out,” he said. To save time before their deaths, nurses would attach tags to the left big toes of living sailors with their names, ranks and hometowns, according to one account in Barry’s book.At the time, Lake County had one of the largest military populations in the nation due to Great Lakes, an adjacent aviation camp, and Fort Sheridan. Fear of the virus was rampant.Capt. W.A. Moffat, Great Lakes commander, issued a statement attempting to allay panic. He admitted there were 4,500 cases of influenza on base among 45,000 sailors, Barry says.Moffat pointed out the death rate was “comfortingly low” at 1.5%, so the situation remained “under control.” That didn’t assuage anybody. Unlike today’s panoply of lifesaving medical options, there were no vaccines to combat the influenza virus, and nothing close to hospital intensive care units.Of course, influenza jumped from the Navy base to the civilian population of a then mainly rural Lake County, claiming hundreds of victims, most of them along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Two of them were Waukegan author Ray Bradbury’s older siblings, Samuel and Betty Jane, born before him.In Waukegan, North Chicago, Lake Forest, Libertyville and other county towns, health officials closed every theater and public hall, along with some schools. The Libertyville-based Independent-Register newspaper reported all naval personnel were prohibited from visiting Waukegan until the disease came under control.The Waukegan YMCA was turned into a hospital for those affected. The Navy base brought in nurses from Chicago to care for sailors after military doctors were overwhelmed. Hygiene patrols scoured the region, with the power to send coughing people home.By Sept. 30, 1918, all churches, schools and theaters in areas near Great Lakes and Fort Sheridan were closed indefinitely, as well as all public dances canceled, the Independent-Register reported. Highland Park made plans for the Exmoor Country Club to be turned into a hospital that could accommodate 100 patients.All totaled, some 23,500 Illinoisans died in 1918 and 1919 from influenza, according to Illinois Department of Public Health data. And, they were grisly deaths, according to Barry’s account.“Symptoms were terrifying,” he writes. “Blood poured from noses, ears, eye sockets; some victims lay in agony; delirium took others away while living.” Three deaths among family members were common; some died in less than 12 hours after contracting the virus.As government officials tried to reassure the nation, they minimized the danger to the public. Said one federal health official: “There is no cause for alarm if precautions are observed.”Those precautions included wearing masks in public and distancing from their fellow Americans.Sound familiar?Charles Selle is a former News-Sun reporter, political editor and editor. sellenews@gmail.comTwitter: @sellenews Originally Published: January 14, 2022 at 12:36 PM CSTShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Most PopularMost PopularNew Illinois casino might harm Horseshoe, Hard Rock, gaming expert saysNew Illinois casino might harm Horseshoe, Hard Rock, gaming expert saysWeek 10 recap: Caleb Williams sacked 9 times and Chicago Bears offense a no-show in ugly 19-3 loss to New England PatriotsWeek 10 recap: Caleb Williams sacked 9 times and Chicago Bears offense a no-show in ugly 19-3 loss to New England PatriotsIllinois families adopt and train 59 miniature horses rescued from ‘gut-wrenching’ hoarding situationIllinois families adopt and train 59 miniature horses rescued from ‘gut-wrenching’ hoarding situationColumn: The Chicago Bears can’t go on like this.

During the 2021 competition, 21 schools participated from 11 states while battling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Carolina reported nearly 8,000 flu vaccinations, ranking No. 1 among medium-sized universities. With around 3,400 vaccinations, Wayne State University placed second among medium-sized universities. The University of Wisconsin, Madison, won the large-university category with around 18,000 vaccinations.What accounts for the University’s winning streak?“Our Tar Heels really care about each other,” said Amy Sauls, Campus Health director of pharmacy and professional services. “They know that when they get vaccinated, it’s not only to offer themselves the best protection that they can have against the flu, but it’s also to help keep their community safe. That’s really reflected in our vaccine numbers.”Tar Heels are also fiercely competitive.The flu, a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, can cause mild to severe illness. During the 2019-20 flu season, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described as “moderate,” an estimated 38 million people were sick with flu, requiring 400,000 hospitalizations and resulting in 22,000 flu deaths.Sauls said one of the best ways to protect yourself against flu is to get vaccinated, as well as to follow protocols such as handwashing and covering coughs and sneezes. “The flu vaccine is not 100% effective, but it is the best tool we have in our toolbox.”Side effects from the vaccine, she said, are minimal. “You’ll probably have a sore arm, maybe for about a day afterwards. Some people may feel just a little under the weather, but the flu vaccine cannot give you the flu. It’s not a live virus vaccine.”Flu vaccination rates remain flat in the United States, with less than half of the population getting vaccinated each season against influenza. Alana’s Foundation, created in 2009 in memory of Alana Yaksich, a 5-year-old who died of influenza in 2003, hopes to change that through awareness campaigns and competitions like the College & University Flu Vaccination Challenge.Sauls said it’s especially important to get a flu shot during the COVID-19 pandemic. “You certainly would not want to get flu on top of COVID. But if you get the flu and you’ve been vaccinated, the likelihood is that your symptoms would not be nearly as severe as if you had not gotten vaccinated,” she said. “Getting both vaccines is the best protection we can offer.”And it’s not too late to get your shot for the current flu season.“We usually offer flu shots until the beginning of April, because flu outbreaks can happen as late as March,” Sauls said. Vaccines can also protect those traveling to foreign countries, where flu seasons can differ. The exact timing and duration of flu seasons varies, but in the United States, influenza activity often begins to increase in October and peaks between December and February, although significant activity can last as late as May, according to the CDC.A vaccination received this semester won’t count toward another national title, but it will help protect you. And you’ll have another chance to support Carolina in the 2022 national championship.Sauls, for one, wants to see the winning streak continue. “It’s a traveling trophy, so we’re glad we haven’t had to ship it off in the last four years. Mainly, we’re glad that our students, faculty and staff are getting vaccinated.”Where are flu shots available?Student Stores Pharmacy (located on the third floor of the UNC Student Stores building) and Campus Health Pharmacy (basement of Campus Health) offer no-appointment flu shots for students, faculty and staff during weekday operating hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mon.-Fri.). Bring your insurance card. Medicare plans are not accepted.Categories CoronavirusYou May Also Like...

Cancerwise 2022 01 ‘Flurona’: when flu and COVID-19 collide Top Jump To: Back ‘Flurona’: when flu and COVID-19 collide BY Cynthia DeMarco January 12, 2022 Medically Reviewed | Last reviewed by an MD Anderson Cancer Center medical professional on January 12, 2022 If you’ve heard the word “flurona” recently, but aren’t quite sure what it means, you’re not alone. Many people have expressed confusion about this mashup of the words “influenza” and “coronavirus.” Though it may sound like a brand new disease, flurona isn’t some strange mutant hybrid of these two viruses. It just describes a situation in which someone contracts both the flu and a COVID-19 infection at the same time. To learn more about flurona, and what cancer patients in particular need to know, we reached out to Chief Infection Control Officer Roy Chemaly, M.D. How long has flurona been around? I believe the term itself was coined fairly recently in Israel, but there were a few cases of simultaneous flu/coronavirus infections reported as far back as January or February 2020 in China. That was the height of flu season at the time. So, it occurred very early on in the pandemic. How many flurona cases have there been to date, and where has it been reported? Here at MD Anderson, we haven’t seen any patients with it yet. But it’s been reported on virtually every continent now: Europe, Asia, the Americas, even Australia. Based on the published studies I’ve seen, I would say there have been at least 2,000 cases worldwide. But there are likely at least a few more than that. They just haven’t been documented. Is getting more than one virus at the same time considered unusual? No. Not at all. It doesn’t happen that often, and it depends on the season and the circulating viruses, of course, but the elderly and very young have been getting two and even three respiratory viral infections simultaneously for years and years. The most common culprits are: influenza rhinoviruses, several of which cause the common cold respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) These viral infections can happen in any combination, or even all at once. So, it’s not really a new phenomenon. What are the symptoms of flurona? Are they any different from those of the individual diseases? No. People with flurona can exhibit any combination of the symptoms that normally accompany each virus, including the ones that overlap, such as: fever headache body aches runny nose cough sore throat sinus congestion So, there’s no specific set of symptoms that really points to someone having flurona. How have people who’ve developed flurona fared? Were their symptoms or death rates any worse than those of people who only had one viral infection at a time? We were really worried about that early on, which is why we campaigned so hard in 2020 and 2021 about getting vaccinated against both to prevent a “twindemic.” If getting one upper respiratory virus was bad, we reasoned, then getting two must be worse. But when we put what limited data was available together, we found that there was really not much impact on mortality with two viruses among the general population. So, that was a welcome surprise. And while some patients did have more severe symptoms, others had only mild ones. The same went for variables like the need for advanced care (e.g. a respirator), and how long it took people to recover. It really was a mixed bag. What are the implications for cancer patients and the immunocompromised if they get both COVID-19 and the flu — or even two other viruses — at once? There’s no data for that yet, so it’s really hard to say. We always worry about patients and survivors whose immune systems are suppressed, whether it’s due to steroids or cancer treatments. If someone is sick enough to be under our care, we never really know how they’re going to react if they get an infection on top of it. The good news is that there’s not really much flu virus circulating right now. One reason is that people have been pretty good about wearing masks and social distancing. And if these behaviors can prevent exposure to one virus, then they can prevent exposure to others, too. But both COVID-19 and flu vaccinations have also played a part in reducing the number of simultaneous infections. What can cancer patients and survivors do to protect themselves from the so-called flurona? We have good treatments and prevention methods available for the flu. And we have some treatments and prevention methods available for the coronavirus. But vaccinations may not work as well in people who are immunocompromised. And the one monoclonal antibody we have that may work against the omicron variant is in very short supply. So, I would say continue taking the same preventive measures you already have been: wear a mask practice physical distancing avoid large gatherings get vaccinated against both the flu and the coronavirus, and get additional doses or booster shots as soon as you can to better prevent COVID-19, as directed by your care team. It’s always better to focus on prevention rather than to depend on “cures” — or effective treatments — to save the day. Request an appointment at MD Anderson online or by calling 1-877-632-6789.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 13-Jan-2022 Building better antivirals: Understanding interactions between drugs and viruses key to being ready for variants and the next pandemic New study reveals why remdesivir works on some viruses like SARS-CoV-2 but not on others like the flu Peer-Reviewed Publication University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry image: A uniform model of the mechanism of action (MOA) of remdesivir. The light blue oval represents a viral RNA polymerase. The priming strand and template are shown in white and green circles, respectively. 1. Residues of Motif F (dark blue) position the template for nucleotide incorporation. As an example, the incoming uridine triphosphate (UTP) binds the complementary adenosine (A) in the template. 2. The adenosine analog remdesivir (R) contains a bulky modification that clashes with motif F. As a consequence, UTP incorporation is inhibited. view more Credit: Matthias Gotte New research shows for the first time why the antiviral drug remdesivir works against some viruses but not others—a finding that improves our understanding of how antiviral drugs interact with viruses at a molecular level, which will be key to developing the broad-spectrum therapies needed to battle against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and get ready to fight the next one. The paper, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, reveals the inner workings of the drug remdesivir against different families of viruses. Remdesivir has been given to more than nine million COVID-19 patients worldwide, and is so far the only small-molecule antiviral drug that has Health Canada approval to treat the disease. Until now it was not understood why remdesivir works in lab tests against some viruses including coronaviruses, Ebola, hepatitis C and Nipah virus, but not against others such as influenza and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Matthias Götte, professor and chair of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Alberta, noted that it all comes down to how well the drug tricks the polymerase, which is the replication engine of the virus and the target of remdesivir. “Remdesivir is very well incorporated by the polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 and not so well by other viruses where it does not work,” he said, adding that once it is incorporated, the drug inhibits all viral polymerases tested in the study. Now that the interactions between remdesivir and several other viruses are better understood, the next step will be to modify the compound to be better accepted by the polymerase of a broader range of other viruses. “What we would like to have when the next pandemic strikes — and it's not a question of if, it's a question of when — what we need to have on the first day is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent,” Götte said. Timing is Everything Another key to successful antivirals is timing. Clinical trials have shown that remdesivir reduces the risk of hospitalization by 87 per cent when it is given early in the course of illness, but because it is currently only available intravenously, it’s sometimes given too late to have its full effect, Götte explained. The United States and Europe recently recommended remdesivir for early use in outpatients with mild to moderate disease, and Götte hopes Canada will follow suit. While vaccination remains the most important available tool against SARS-CoV-2, he said remdesivir continues to be effective against the Omicron variant and could play an important role in reducing the burden on our health system. Götte said the new Pfizer oral antiviral drug that is awaiting Health Canada approval appears to be just as effective as remdesivir at preventing hospitalizations when given early. Another orally available antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has just been given FDA approval for use against COVID-19 in the United States, even though it appears to prevent only about 30 per cent of hospitalizations. It also shows activity against other viruses, including influenza. For Götte, the more antiviral options we have available, the better. If a new virus strikes, it will take time to develop a vaccine, and treatments will be needed around the world while we wait. The ideal situation would be to treat patients with more than one antiviral at a time, much like the “cocktails” used for HIV and hepatitis C. “When you combine antiviral drugs, it is more efficacious, more potent, and you reduce the likelihood of the virus developing resistance to any one drug,” he said.

Before beginning a long-delayed year of research at Cambridge University’s Clare Hall, I was required to spend two days in voluntary isolation, a new protocol amid the surging Omicron variant. As two days turned to six—between mailing my PCR test and awaiting delayed results—I kept asking myself that one incessant (and tiring) question: When will it all end? I grew even wearier of my answer: I don’t really know. Not only are historians generally lousy at predicting the future, the history of pandemics can only tell us so much about when a pandemic in our modern, hyperconnected world might become history.Though I’ve had three vaccinations and took every precaution to travel as safely as possible, each airport between Detroit and Heathrow was teeming with utter confusion and potential contagion. People doubtlessly out of patience, in another wave of the endless pandemic, were wearing (predominantly cloth) masks with their noses exposed, others bumped into one another without concern, and there was no personal space at all, let alone 3 to 6 feet. By the time I was in the car on the way to my new apartment I was treading in a puddle of sweat and anxiety, with the notion of quarantine rapidly shifting from an academic subject to an uneasy reality.ABOUTHoward Markel is the George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and the author of The Secret of Life: Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick and the Discovery of DNA’s Double Helix, Quarantine! ,and When Germs Travel.As I remained locked in my room, my knowledge of 700 years of quarantines far worse than the one I found myself in failed to comfort me. For centuries, beginning in 1348 with the quarantining of ships in the port of Venice to fend off the Black Death, the whole thrust of public health intervention for smallpox, diphtheria, cholera, influenza, and many other epidemic diseases boiled down to little more than capturing the infected and placing them far away. Quarantine islands in the US and abroad well into the 20th century were prison-like, with a shortage of nurses and doctors, not to mention kindness, warmth, or food. Patients there either conquered the microbe with their own immune systems or died from the infection.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.I, meanwhile, had all the conveniences of a luxurious modern quarantine: a lovely apartment, personal computing, internet, food delivery, central heat, a smartphone, and access to every season of The Crown (which I binged), alongside almost every other show and movie ever made. Nonetheless, being formally isolated, especially when it's long after one thought isolation would be necessary, is, well, terribly isolating. Just 12 hours after moving into my new digs, as dusk turned to darkness, I had an incredibly strong desire to take a long walk.Who would know? I thought. It’s so dark out, and I’m wearing a mask, so who would be able to identify me?The desire to break the rules and go outdoors is an aspect of almost every quarantine I’ve studied. For example, in 1892 the New York Commissioner of Health complained to the press how immigrant Russian Jewish children quarantined for typhus fever were climbing out the windows and fire escapes to play with their friends, potentially spreading a deadly disease and prolonging the outbreak. Locked away 22 months after I first locked myself away with the rest of the world in March 2020, I empathize with these children, just as I have some empathy for the millions of beyond fed-up people who are essentially declaring the pandemic over themselves by flouting rules designed to staunch the spread of Omicron. Still, that empathy has worn quite thin over the past several weeks of the widely circulating Omicron variant, which will continue to prolong the pandemic’s ending.Public health experts maintain that after the epidemiological curve plummets from hundreds (or more) cases and deaths per day per 100,000 people to fewer than 5 cases and deaths per day, for many successive days, officials will have a pretty good chance of declaring that Covid is no longer a pandemic. But as Omicron continues to swell, we’re not even close to that. As long as the virus circulates widely, and so many people around the world remain unvaccinated, more will sicken and die. Wanting to contribute to the end, I finally listened to my conscience and gave up on my walk, locked the door, and went to bed.Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanDismaying as it is that individuals and nations alike are unwilling to reimpose the measures necessary to help end this pandemic, the comforting fact is that we know more about how to end this pandemic than we’ve known about ending any other pandemic in history. On a scientific level, the specificity of genomic composition—for determining the Covid virus’s variation—was unimaginable for influenza in 1918, an era when doctors did not yet know the causative organism behind the pandemic. In fact, the four waves of the 1918 pandemic may well have been different variants of influenza or even another virus—we simply do not know because the pathological tissue has been buried and decomposed; only those reposing in permafrost have a chance of producing such answers.We now know that social distancing, no matter how boring, tedious, or difficult, works to help prevent the spread of this illness and ultimately end the pandemic. This statement is based on the billions of data points collected during the past two years.Although I hate to put myself out of business as a historian of quarantines, I must insist that in managing our contagious future, in ensuring that future pandemics end sooner than our current one, we will no longer look to our distant past for pandemic control because those eras no longer reflect our hyper-connected world, where news, information, disinformation, and scientific data travel at the speed of electrons. That is why this is the pandemic I will be studying and teaching in the years to come. This is the first pandemic where we have had so many tools for surveillance, identification, and means to determine the virus’s ever-changing genome and viral dynamics. The public health problems that have emerged during this pandemic are 21st-century problems and demand 21st-century approaches. The other epidemics still have much to teach us, but studying Covid is our best hope for succeeding when the next pandemic strikes.After watching the clock in my apartment for six days, I received a reminder of the problems that need to be studied: The laboratory processing my test told me they had lost my specimen. Off to a mall with hundreds of maskless people I went to take a £79 ($108) rapid test—which, happily, came back negative. I walked out of my quarantine and into an uncertain present, which, if we take the pains to study and learn from it, will better inform our future.More From WIRED on Covid-19📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!As Omicron surges, the youngest kids wait for vaccinesThe world must decide what “endemic” means for CovidRapid at-home Covid tests—and where to find themHow to put a vaccine card on your phoneHow to find a vaccine appointment and what to expectNeed a face mask?

And not only is it not a new disease, it isn't even a new phenomenon.Despite the initial reports making their way around the world when a woman was confirmed to have both the flu and COVID-19, this was not figurative flurona patient zero. No, flurona - though it wasn't called that at the time - has been around for at least two years. Stay updated with the latest news!

At the time, a man had entered a medical center in Queens and was first diagnosed with the flu. He was tested again and by early March, he had tested positive for COVID-19 as well. This man, along with his wife and two children, were early flurona cases, way back at the beginning of the pandemic.And they weren't even the first cases. No, those may just be from a study in China from early 2020 that noted many cases of simultaneous infection between the flu and coronavirus. And it isn't just limited to these two places, either.According to The Washington Post, flurona cases had already been detected in the US, Brazil, Hungary, the Phillippines and even Israel again before this latest report helped coin the term.According to Filipino Health Department technical advisory group member Dr. Edsel Salvana, the first COVID-19 death outside of China in early 2020 (which was in the Philippines) was an instance of co-infection, as reported by ABS-CBN.This patient, according to Salvana, was a Chinese national who had COVID-19, influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia all at the same time.The flu (credit: Wikicommons)If flurona cases are nothing new, why are we only hearing about it now?Because of an unrealized fear returning once again.People began getting worried about both diseases spreading simultaneously in what some experts termed a "twindemic," though rather than being about a new disease, it was about countries being able to handle this double outbreak.With healthcare systems all over the world overwhelmed with rising COVID-19 cases, the fear of also having to deal with the flu was a serious concern.But this twindemic never happened.Why? That's unclear, but there are many possible reasons. Among the main ones is the fact that due to COVID-19 lockdowns and everyone wearing masks, flu season itself simply wasn't as severe. This is backed up by data showing that in the last flu season, cases in the US were significantly lower than normal, as noted by the Atlantic.Now, however, we're hearing about it again.But there is another reason to be worried right now. Due to the prevalence of new variants like the Omicron variant and the newly discovered variant in France, the virus is especially contagious. Omicron has already been shown to be more transmissible than some prior strains, making cases of co-infections even more possible now.Where has flurona been found?Flurona is nothing new, so there are other cases. Since the recent high-profile case of an unvaccinated pregnant woman in Israel, the Jewish state has found other flurona cases, including another pregnant woman.Brazil has found several cases as well, as have Hungary, the Philippines and the US. Many cases have been found to be younger, though this isn't too surprising - especially in children.“In rare occasions, I’ve seen five different viruses detected in the same child. Usually, a kid who was in daycare,” Dr. Juan Dumois, a Pediatric infectious diseases physician at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, told ABC News, explaining how uncommon co-infections are in children.Vials with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine labels are seen in this illustration picture taken March 19, 2021. (credit: REUTERS/DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION/FILE PHOTO)What are the symptoms of flurona? Can vaccines protect you from flurona?As flurona is just having the flu and COVID-19 at the same time, the symptoms are exactly that. There are other similarities too. Both the novel coronavirus and the flu spread in very similar ways, such as via the respiratory system, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The at-risk groups are also largely the same, such as frontline medical workers, elderly people, those with underlying conditions and people who are pregnant. But that doesn't mean everything is exactly the same. Some people who contract flurona have worse symptoms than others, and largely, the reason for this is simple: Vaccinations.“If you are vaccinated, the disease is very mild,” Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Campus gynecology director Arnon Vizhnitser told The Washington Post.Both COVID-19 and the flu have vaccines available, and being inoculated – and in the case of COVID-19, getting the booster shot – is the best way of limiting the severity of flurona. And as both diseases spread in a similar way, the way of preventing its spread is also similar: Social distancing and wearing masks.Also, despite not being a new disease, there is a worry about having both at once – especially for certain at risk groups. This is because both viruses that make up flurona target the human respiratory system, which can make people struggle, such as children under the age of two and adults over the age of 65.“When the immune system starts fighting a virus in the respiratory system in the lungs, that attack causes an inflammatory reaction that results in a production of more mucus in the lungs,” Dumois told ABC News, which can lead to less oxygen in the blood and difficulty breathing.Other experts have also said something similar. Back in September, Dr. Adrian Burrowes, a family medicine physician and assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Central Florida, warned CNN that flurona could be "catastrophic" for one's immune system that could lead to higher rates of mortality.But, as noted by the WHO, preventative measures such as getting vaccinated, social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, ensuring ventilation and avoiding super spreader events are both ideal ways of keeping safe amid both outbreaks of this twindemic.

The intent of this work is to better understand influenza from an RNA-centric perspective to provide local, structural motifs with likely significance to the influenza infectious cycle for therapeutic targeting. To accomplish this, we analyzed over four hundred thousand RNA sequences spanning three major clades: influenza A, B and C. We scanned influenza segments for local secondary structure, identified/modeled motifs of likely functionality, and coupled the results to an analysis of evolutionary conservation. We discovered 185 significant regions of predicted ordered stability, yet evidence of sequence covariation was limited to 7 motifs, where 3—found in influenza C—had higher than expected amounts of sequence covariation.

Of these, Alpha, Beta and Gamma are able to infect humans. Respectively, these genera consist of one species each: influenza A, B and C. Within each genome, influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) consist of eight viral RNA (vRNA) segments, and influenza C virus (ICV) consists of seven. IAV is considered the most threatening species to human health, possessing multiple antigenically distinct sub-types that can infect human and non-human hosts—allowing for the antigenic shifts that lead to global pandemics1,2. The deadliest example of this for influenza was in 1918, when an H1N1 variant killed an estimated 50 million people globally3. Due to this consistent threat, IAV has received a majority of our attention and resources; however, concerns over evolving lineages of IBV continue to mount4. This development has led to the current quadrivalent vaccines, which protect against two IAV strains and both main IBV lineages (Victoria and Yamagata)5. ICV is associated with mild respiratory symptoms in a majority of cases, however it has been found to cause serious illness in children6,7. All three clades are therefore worthy of additional study.It is imperative to continue to take the lessons learned during prior pandemics and apply them toward future potential threats. Work from the first SARS outbreak led to a World Health Organization response model that was tested against the H1N1 outbreak8. Despite the considerable action taken prior to the outbreak, vaccine supply and distribution met a number of roadblocks that decreased efforts to slow its spread8. These impairments were improved upon and ultimately tested by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Development and approval time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were on an unprecedented time scale, becoming the new model for future pandemics9.This new prevention model can be reapplied to influenza, however the biggest issue in influenza vaccine development is target availability. Current influenza vaccines involve an antibody response to the head domain of the hemagglutinin protein, one of two viral surface proteins2,9. The targeting of surface proteins is a common therapeutic approach, but influenza’s hemagglutinin is a particularly variable target, resulting in vaccines with short shelf lives and limited efficacy9. Advances in vaccine production (e.g., mRNA vaccines9) hold great promise in mitigating flu-related illnesses and death, yet there still remains a critical time gap between viral discovery and vaccine distribution. In that gap, it is necessary to have effective treatments for dealing with active infections. Only four drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of influenza, with many influenza strains already evolving some level of drug-resistance10. Additional therapeutic modalities for treating influenza infections are therefore sorely needed.One alternative approach would be the targeting of conserved RNA secondary structures critical to the viral life cycle. For example, recent work on enterovirus has found an RNA stem loop that undergoes a conformational change when an inhibitor is used, repressing translation11. This example is novel in that the 5ʹ UTR of the mRNA forms an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to promote cap-independent translation, and that a small molecule library was used to effectively target RNA structure in the IRES11. Similar work was conducted against the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift stimulatory element, using small molecules to disrupt the secondary structure and inhibit a critical ribosomal frameshift12. While knowledge of what constitutes a “good” viral RNA target remains nascent, and there exist few examples within literature, it is imperative to develop a list of novel therapeutic targets using the tools currently available. With this in mind, it is useful to revisit and thoroughly define the influenza structurome to gain new insights on potential therapeutic targets.Almost a decade ago, all three major clades of influenza were analyzed for conserved RNA secondary structural motifs in silico13,14. Subsequent experimental work focused on validation of local structural motifs15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22, testing their potential function23 and building global secondary structure models of their genomic vRNA24 and individual positive-sense RNAs25. More recent work using chemical crosslinking coupled to RNA-seq has focused on defining long-range intra- and inter-segmental RNA-RNA interactions that could be significant to genome packaging26. Despite this extensive in silico and experimental work on influenza structure/function, space remains for additional analyses—particularly those significant to drug discovery. This provided the motivation for our current study, where we apply the ScanFold pipeline to influenza virus. ScanFold is a program that divides the analysis of RNA secondary structure into two steps: firstly, long sequences are decomposed into multiple overlapping analysis windows, where each fragment is folded in silico and various thermodynamic properties are calculated; secondly, models of structure and predicted ordered biases in structure are combined to generate consensus base pairs that are weighted by their contribution to unusual ordered-stability. In this way, ScanFold provides local scans of the folding landscape across an RNA and discrete local motifs with high propensity for ordered (likely evolved) structural motifs27.In contrast to previous analyses of influenza, which focused on individual windows and limited homology14, our current approach focuses on a single sequence and is able to define motifs (and their extent) in a robust and reproducible manner. For example, ScanFold has been successfully applied to analyze the genomes of Zika and HIV27, human herpes viruses28 and most recently to SARS-CoV-2—where models were used to rationally design a small molecule inhibitor of viral frameshifting29. An additional motivation for this current study is the analysis of conservation of motifs of interest. Most previous studies of influenza virus RNA secondary structure applied simple conservation metrics that were unable to define statistically significant covariation. In this current work we sought to assess structure-related sequence covariation using rigorous methods. Thus, by revisiting influenza with contemporary approaches, we hope to provide additional basic insights to guide investigations into influenza biology and to expand the list of potentially druggable RNA motifs in these viruses.ResultsMaps of local RNA structural propensity across influenza A, B and CTo generate maps of local secondary structural propensities, each segment and strand of IAV, IBV, and ICV was submitted to ScanFold-Scan for analysis (46 RNAs accounting for 81,892 nucleotides of sequence data scanned). IAV sequences (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) were selected due to their prevalence in experimental studies, while IBV and ICV reference sequences (B/Lee/1940 and C/Ann Arbor/1/50, respectively) were selected to provide structural data applicable to the broadest range of viral targets. A scanning window of 120 nucleotides (nt) with a single nt step size resulted in over 75,000 almost fully overlapping (119 nt) analysis windows. For each window scanned, several key features were predicted: a minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure and its associated change in Gibb’s folding free energy (ΔG°, a measure of thermodynamic stability); a thermodynamic z-score that compares the MFE ΔG° of the natively ordered sequence to the average ΔG° of 100 randomly shuffled versions of the sequence (z-score, the stability order-bias of the sequence); a partition function, from which is derived an ensemble centroid structure (best representative of the ensemble of probable conformations); and the ensemble diversity (ED, an indication of the volatility of the structural ensemble). Overviews of every RNA scanned are available in Supplemental File 1, and the raw data may be accessed on the RNAStructuromeDB (see “Data availability”).A summary of average ScanFold-Scan results for each clade, segment and strand can be found in Table 1. One of the key features of this analysis is the mapping of local z-scores across each influenza segment and strand using an approach adapted from Clote et al.30. The z-score metric is an indication of unusual ordered-stability, where negative values indicate the number of standard deviations more stable the MFE ΔG° of the natively ordered sequence is versus a pool of randomly shuffled sequences, which can indicate that a sequence has been driven by evolution to fold into a stable secondary structure. Alternatively, higher z-scores indicate a higher, less stable predicted MFE ΔG° versus the shuffled pool, signifying an evolutionarily driven region that breaks up native pairing contacts. A broad picture of the range of z-scores can be seen in Fig. 1. IAV had an overall average z-score (zavg) of −0.51 ± 1.14 and −0.53 ± 1.14 for the positive and negative strand, respectively, IBV had −0.56 ± 1.11 and −0.60 ± 1.07, and ICV had −0.63 ± 1.12 and −0.63 ± 1.08. The negative trend observed in these data indicate some potential for influenza being inherently structured and are in-line with previous predictions performed on influenza, which found similar skews in predicted z-score31.Table 1 Average ScanFold metrics and extracted motifs for each strand.Full size tableFigure 1z-score violin plots of each influenza virus, with positive (blue) and negative (red) strands for comparison. While the range of z-scores observed is broad, there is a visual trend toward the negative (structured) across all clades, with IAV segments 7 and 8 being noticeably lower than other segments. Data from ScanFold, 120 nt window, 1 nt step, 100 randomizations, 37 ˚C. Image adapted from BoxPlotR51.Full size imageNotably, only IAV positive segment 7 (−1.19 ± 1.23), IAV positive segment 8 (−1.21 ± 1.42), and IAV negative segment 8 (−1.24 ± 1.22) had zavg below −1, indicating that they are globally ordered. Only these segments/strands approached the z-score values we29 (and others32) recently predicted for the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (average z-score −1.4929)—raising interesting questions about the potential roles of globally ordered RNA structure in each RNA. In SARS-CoV-2, a likely role is in genome packaging and post-transcriptional gene regulation, whereas in influenza, which consists of minus (−) sense vRNAs that are packaged and plus ( +) sense RNAs, the likely role is post-transcriptional control and genome replication/packaging. Potential evolutionary pressure to form structures useful in post-transcriptional gene regulation and packaging are likely different for the (−) versus the ( +) RNAs, but as these RNAs comprise sense/antisense pairs, such pressures are likely to have “echoes” across each strand. Thus, the forces working on influenza RNA structure are likely more complex than those of SARS-CoV-2.Even in segments/strands without global z-score biases, however, significantly low regions were observed (Supplemental File 1). This can be assessed from the percentage of nucleotides per segment with z-scores below a given threshold, the % zavgt (Table 1). This latter metric was calculated in the second ScanFold stage, ScanFold-Fold (further discussed in the next section), where overlapping window z-score values are partitioned per nucleotide—giving a per-nucleotide metric to assess propensity for ordered stability. Here, it becomes more apparent that influenza is predominantly biased toward ordered structure, as a majority of nucleotides showed a predominant shift toward negative zavgt. Further lowering the zavgt threshold to below −2, the percentages range from a high of 28.40% for IAV 8 ( +) and a low of 0.90% for IAV 4 ( +). Interestingly, IAV 4 ( +) still had 6 predicted motifs with at least one unusually stable (< −2 zavg) base pair (bp). Potential implications of this are the existence of structure within influenza sequences, with varying degrees of structure across each segment. These regions were of particular interest, and were further analyzed to address this implication.Identification of local motifs with propensity for ordered stability and potential functionalityIn the second stage of our analysis, ScanFold-Fold was used to identify the base pairs that most contributed to low z-score windows identified by ScanFold-Scan. This was accomplished by generating z-score weighted consensus structures where recurring base pairs in overlapping low z-score windows are favorably weighted. This resulted in numerous low z-score base pairs across influenza virus RNAs (listed in Table 1 and Supplemental File 1). A major feature of ScanFold-Fold is that z-score weighted consensus base pairs can be partitioned into discrete and unique local structural motifs. An example of these motifs can be seen at the 3ʹ end of ICV 5 (−), where three motifs are predicted in close proximity (1642–1678, 1684–1744, 1747–1800) (Supplemental File 1). While ICV 5 (−) has a zavg of −0.56 ± 1.32, the range from 1642 to 1800 nt has a zavg of −4.21 ± 0.63. This is the lowest zavg observed for any predicted motif. The total number of motifs with at least one unusually stable bp was 185 across the 46 sequences motifs (all 185 motifs, locations, and structures are available in Supplemental File 2). Notably, ICV 3 ( +) had 12 motifs, 7 of which have zavg below −2 (sequence and zavg, respectively: 328–353 nt, −2.09 ± 0.53; 357–403 nt, −2.29 ± 0.18; 908–988 nt, −2.34 ± 0.40; 1984–2006 nt, −2.10 ± 0.08; 2009–2023 nt, −2.40 ± 0.03; 2026–2066 nt, −2.51 ± 0.08; 2070–2129 nt, −2.33 ± 0.04).Several structural motifs were previously reported for IAV ( +)14,16,17,18,19,20,21,23,25. We were able to recapitulate one of them fully in our current analysis (Fig. 2), a multibranch loop from IAV 7 ( +)23. This motif, designated 7_1, has a zavg of -2.31 ± 0.27. While the published structure was from a different sequence than that used to generate our ScanFold data (AF389121.1 vs. NC_002016.1, respectively), the two sequences are 99.4% identical. The ScanFold motif is slightly shorter than the previously published structure (130–217 vs. 134–213), which was predicted using RNAz33. The four basal stem base pairs are absent in the ScanFold model, as they fell above the -2 z-score cutoff used to define motifs, and were therefore excluded prior to refold via RNAfold33. Notably, if the entire segment is refolded using the low z-score (< −2) structure as a folding constraint, the resulting global model restores these pairs (see “Data availability”). In general, ScanFold motifs are small, as the goal of the program is to identify highly-stable local folds.Figure 2(Left) ScanFold data for IAV 7 ( +), with motif 7_1 and 7_4 designated by a blue box. M1 and M2 versions of this transcript are illustrated for reference. The base pair track (bp track) shows arcs correlating to base pairings, where blue arcs have a < −2 score, green arcs have a < −1 z-score, yellow arcs have a < 0 z-score, and gray arcs have a z-score > 0. (Right) Motif 7_1 correlates with the published multibranch loop23, aligning with our reference sequence after global refold (gray boxes). Motif 7_4 has an extended hairpin that occludes any formation of the 5′ pairing or pseudoknot structure around the 3′ splice site (739–740, purple triangles), but a global refold reveals the published 3′ pairing25. Two sequence variations from our reference sequence are annotated at 136 and 655. ScanFold z-scores are overlaid in each nucleotide circle, with blue designating < −2 z-score. Structural images were adapted from VARNA, and the genome illustrations were adapted from NCBI.Full size imageAll but one of the remaining published motifs analyzed contain pseudoknot structures (non-nested base pairs). The folding algorithm used in ScanFold, RNAfold, is unable to predict pseudoknots due to the complexity of non-nested pairing, and instead predicts the nested MFE for a given window. ScanFold predicted motifs near the previously published IAV 7 ( +)25,34 pseudoknot/hairpin spanning the 3' splice site of this RNA, but failed to reconstruct the pseudoknot (Fig. 2). This conserved region is vital for the alternative splicing and production of the ion channel protein M234. The pseudoknot and hairpin conformations share two internal pairings (5′, 714–727, and 3′, 732–768) with a non-nested pairing (707–742) forming only in the pseudoknot conformation. Using a -2 threshold to extract motifs, the 5′ and non-nested pairings were overpowered by the upstream motif IAV ( +) 7_4 (637–722), while the 3′ pairing did not meet the threshold. Lowering the threshold to -1, the 3′ pairing can be partially recovered. Further, a global refold at either z-score threshold resulted in a near complete recovery of the 3′ pairing. IAV ( +) 7_4 is able to occlude the 5′ and non-nested pairings due to the structure’s low zavg (-2.78 ± 0.45), whereas the 5′ pairing fell above the default threshold (−1.44 ± 0.63). It should be noted that the initial research that predicted this pseudoknot did not find any low z-score structures in this region; rather, the potential for structure was deduced from analysis of constraints on codon evolution25. The pseudoknot was then modeled using DotKnot35, which uses pairing probabilities in a heuristic approach for non-nested base pair identification25.Beyond these previously-described motifs, novel structures were also predicted. To assess evolutionary evidence for conserved structure within each motif, we performed covariation analysis. Much of the initial work on structure conservation in influenza virus focused on simple metrics of conservation (e.g., the percent preservation of base pairing across alignments) and highlighted potentially supportive mutations; however, the statistical significance of such variation was not previously assessed. Recently, powerful and user-friendly approaches have emerged for covariation analysis of RNA structure36,37,38, which can identify statistically-significant covariation39,40. We performed covariation analysis using the cm-builder pipeline36, which chains together the homology discovery suite Infernal38 with R-Scape40 to provide a robust statistical framework for assessing the potential significance of sequence covariation (structure supporting mutations). Covariance analysis was conducted against a database of 438,519 influenza sequences available from the NCBI Influenza Virus Database (see Materials and Methods).Only 7 out of 185 low z-score motifs had any covariation identified by R-Scape (examples in Figs. 3 and 4, all motifs available in Supplemental File 2, and covariance data available in Supplemental File 3). Of those, only 3 motifs (ICV ( +) 5_7 vs. all databases, and ICV ( +) 6_2 and 6_4 vs. ICV database) had observed covarying base pairs above the expected number predicted for the input alignment. Covariance calculations for motif IBV (−) 4_2 (1725–1835) showed 4 bp observed to covary with 29.5 ± 1.2 bp expected. The highest number of covarying base pairs were observed in ICV ( +) motif 6_2 (44–111) (Fig. 4); 4 bp were observed with 0.0 ± 0.1 bp expected within the ICV database. ICV ( +) 6_4 (557–662) was predicted to have 1 observed bp against the ICV database, with 0.0 ± 0.0 bp expected (Fig. 4). Only one motif, the 8 bp hairpin ICV ( +) 5_7 (456–477), showed evidence of broad conservation across multiple influenza clades (Fig. 4). ICV ( +) 5_7 showed a single observed covarying base pairing when 0.0 ± 0.2 were expected. These results were based on 24 sequences (13 IAV, 11 ICV), all coding for the segment 5 nucleocapsid protein. All 24 sequences align with our IAV 5 ( +) reference sequence from ~ 1139–1165, with the IAV sequences containing up to an 8-nucleotide insertion not seen in ICV. Interestingly, this insertion aligns within ICV ( +) 5_7’s hairpin loop without disrupting the existing structure. Looking at IAV ( +) 5 in this region (Supplemental File 2), the ordered motif IAV ( +) 5_4 was predicted in this region (1145–1159), but failed to refold as an individual motif due to only consisting of two base pairs. The global refold maintains this motif, however, and can be seen as a very small arc next to IAV ( +) 5_3 (Supplemental File 1).Figure 3ScanFold analysis for motifs (top to bottom panels, respectively) IAV ( +) 4_1, IAV (−) 6_3, IBV (−) 1_3, and IBV (−) 4_2 (locations designated with blue boxes). The base pair track (bp track) shows arcs correlating to base pairings, where blue arcs have a < −2 score, green arcs have a < −1 z-score, yellow arcs have a < 0 z-score, and gray arcs have a z-score > 0. The R-Scape calculations showed observed base pair covariance (highlighted in green), but the number of observe covarying pairs fell below the expected value (given the sequence alignment).

Structural images were adapted from VARNA, and the genome illustrations were adapted from NCBI.Full size imageComparison of ScanFold predicted structures to available DMS-MaPseq dataUsing publicly available probing data for IAV (H1N1 strain)41, we were able to conduct a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis comparing DMS-MaPseq data to all ScanFold -1 ΔG z-score predicted structures within all 8 positive-sense IAV segments (see “Methods” for greater detail). Briefly, reactivity values are constrained from lowest to highest values at regular (e.g., 1%) intervals and constrained positions are considered to be paired at their corresponding thresholds. Here, constrained DMS-MaPseq datasets were cross referenced to ScanFold predicted structures to yield a true positive rate (TPR) and a false positive rate (FPR) of prediction. The results of this analysis (Fig. 5 and Supplemental File 4) showed that ScanFold predicted structures had a non-random fit and agreed well with the probing data. In an ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of how well the data fit and an AUC value of 0.5 would indicate a random fit and a value of 1.0 would indicate a perfect fit. ScanFold predicted structures for all 8 IAV segments had AUCs which ranged from 0.63 for segment 4 and up to 0.83 for segment 8 (Fig. 5).Figure 5A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis comparing in silico ScanFold −1 z-score predicted structures to DMS-MaPseq data for IAV (H1N1) segments 1–8. The true positive rate (TPR) is shown on the y-axis and the false positive rate (FPR) on the x-axis. Each segment is shown with a unique color and data point marker: segment 1, light blue and a diamond; segment 2, orange and an asterisk; segment 3, grey and an x; segment 4, yellow and a square; segment 5, dark blue and a circle; segment 6, green and a triangle; segment 7, purple and a cross; segment 8, maroon and a dash. The associated area under the curve (AUC) is shown below each segment in the legend.Full size imageDiscussionInfluenza RNAs consist of a short (~ 25 nt) untranslated region followed by one large (or multiple overlapping) open reading frame(s). Maintenance of coding potential is a strong evolutionary constraint that can severely limit the available compensatory mutations that also preserve functional RNA structures (e.g., base pairs from wobble sites in codons)14,21. In fact, the reciprocal effect of structure on codon use led to the initial discoveries of several elements including the IAV 7 ( +) pseudoknot/hairpin structure14,25. Prior research using mutual information, assessing linkages between evolving sites, found signal across several stem-loop structures identified in representative strains of hemagglutinin (segment 4) RNA17. This was observed to be most prominent in H5 and H7 subtypes, with varying representation across all 16 subtypes17. However, Gultyaev et al. had noted in prior research that it was difficult to maintain significance across all subtypes due to the vast number of influenza variants, and that covariance was most likely subtype-specific18. Unfortunately, this hypothesis was not supported by a follow-up analysis using our A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strand against all known IAV H1N1 variants; no covarying base pairs were observed across all segments and strands. It should be noted here that the absence of covariation in RNA structure is not necessarily evidence of a lack of function37, and that the work to identify these structures should not be dismissed outright based on this one method.Given the deep pool of sequences and the ordered structural stability seen across influenza (Fig. 1), the relative scarcity of covariance is initially quite surprising. These findings echo recent debates over the potential covariation in structured long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, where initial analyses using R-Scape found little evidence of covariation in key lncRNAs (such as Xist and HOTAIR), despite numerous studies that supported structure models and functions for them40,42. Subsequent work challenged this finding43, however the significance of covariation in these RNAs remains a point of contention. Similarly, previous studies posited the existence of conserved structural elements which were (at least for IAV) subjected to subsequent structural probing20,21,23,24,44,45,46 and functional analyses13,14,17,18,19,22,25,31. No motifs with statistical evidence of covariation were found in IAV, and the few hits we did observe were in ICV; indeed, the only motif with wide conservation (across clades) was found in ICV. With this is in mind, it appears that only a few motifs in influenza are evolving under strict structural constraints.Our previous study of SARS-CoV-2 found similar results in that, despite extensive evidence of ordered stability, only 57 out of 524 motifs showed evidence of covariation29. It may be that viral RNA secondary structures can be extensively ordered to fold into stable conformations, but that the evolutionary pressures acting on them are fairly loose. Namely, ordered RNA secondary structural stability may be important for viral function, but specific base pairs may not be strongly selected for by evolution. The idea that some viral RNA secondary structures, particularly in influenza, may be under loose structural constraints is supported from recent work on IAV using chemical crosslinking. Extensive long-range intra- and inter-segmental RNA-RNA interactions were identified in IAV using the method 2CIMPL44. An interesting finding of this study was that ablating inter-segmental base pairs had less of an impact on viral reassortment than one would predict due to multiple redundant inter-segmental interactions44. It may be possible that a similar pattern of redundancy is at play within local influenza RNA structures.Additionally, our previous SARS-CoV-2 analysis noted that, despite the ScanFold results being purely in silico, they were in agreement with a variety of structure probing data sets (determined via ROC analyses) and that significantly low z-score structures agreed best with probing data29. Interestingly, we observe similar levels of agreement of ScanFold predicted structures to available probing data for IAV in this study (via ROC analysis). Furthermore, when previous ScanFold analyses were performed with incorporation of probing data, global trends in the ΔG z-scores were largely unaffected29 indicating that the z-score metric can highlight significantly stable regions with or without probing data. Significantly, the z-score metric can highlight interesting trends in the data. For example, in Table 1 there are remarkable biases predicted across different segments/strains. For example, in IAV the two spliced segments (IAV 7 and 8; Table 1) were the only ones to have evidence for global structural ordering (overall z-score < −1 across the sequence) in the ( +)RNA. Notable, in IAV 7 here is a significant strand bias for ordered folding favoring the ( +)RNA that is not the case for IAV 8—suggesting that structure plays more significant roles in the ( +)RNA of IAV 7, potentially for splicing, vs. the genomic (−)RNA. Whereas, in IAV 8 structure could be significant to both the ( +)RNA and (−)RNA; in the latter case, perhaps in genomic packaging. These interpretations are, however, complicated by the lack of global ordering in the spliced segments from IBV and ICV: IBV 8 and ICV 6/7. When focusing on local regions near the splice sites, however, instances of ordered structure were predicted at the 5′ splice sites of IBV 8 (nt 75) and ICV 7 (nt 213) both fall within motifs comprised of z-score < -1 base pairs (Supplemental File 1); however, the 3′ splice sites: IBV 8 nt 731 , ICV 6 nt 753, ICV 6 nt 902, ICV 7 nt 527 nt were not embedded in predicted motifs. One notable limitation of our approach is that ScanFold cannot predict pseudoknots, which were previously proposed for the 3′ splice sites of IBV and ICV13. Notably, structural dynamics between pseudoknots and hairpins may also be significant for splicing of influenza; the static weighted-consensus structures of ScanFold would not reflect this either.Another interesting consideration is the potential roles of ordered structure in constraining influenza sequence evolution. As noted above, the bulk of each genome segment is comprised of coding sequence (sometimes multiple ones), which is a major constraint. Focusing on the 12 low z-score base pairs (< -2) that fell within coding regions, the majority (8/12) had at least one paired nucleotide falling within a wobble position, while 3 base pairs had both nts falling within wobble positions. These observations are in-line with previous work on IAV, which noted localized suppression of synonymous codon usage47, which was found to overlap previous predictions of conserved RNA secondary structure14, which may be constraining available synonymous substitutions.ConclusionScanFold provides comprehensive in silico analyses of structure within the three major clades of influenza virus. This work complements previous investigations in its focus on the discovery and advancement of local motifs of interest. While not as structured as SARS-CoV-2, ScanFold analysis shows influenza to have a propensity toward structure on the whole. Further, little covariance within influenza is statistically significant, perhaps owing to the sheer magnitude of similar variants that make covariance a difficult metric for the analysis of influenza18,42. The presented report also highlights significantly low z-score regions, which have been shown to correlate well with highly structured sequences29. The identification of 185 novel motifs in this work will hopefully lower the barrier to entry for further structure/function analysis of influenza. Further, the motifs provided here, alongside previously described structures, represent high-value targets for additional work to: (i) analyze their functions, (ii) develop 3D models combining computational and biophysical techniques, and (iii) assess their druggability.MethodsScanFold analysisSegment nucleotide sequences were downloaded from NCBI for A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 for IAV, B/Lee/1940 for IBV, and C/Ann Arbor/1/50, for ICV (all accession numbers are available in Supplemental File 2). ScanFold27 was applied to these sequences, utilizing a 1 nt step, 120 nt window size, 100 randomizations, 37 ˚C on positive and negative strands. These ScanFold parameters have been previously optimized27,48,49. All ScanFold Data is available at RNAStructuromeDB50.To focus on local motifs most probable to be structured, the ScanFold 120 nt window, positive and negative strands, < −2 z-score results were the focus of further evaluation. Motif structures were then extracted, with motifs being considered separate if they had at least two nucleotides between structures. These structures were then refolded via the ViennaRNA package RNAfold33, and any structures that completely unfolded were removed from the motif pool. The only exception was IAV 4 ( +), which lacked any < −2 z-score motifs. In this case, the < −1 results were included for covariance analysis. Known motifs (e.g., the IAV 7 ( +) pseudoknot) were also manually added to the motif pool for covariance modeling.CovarianceWith highly structured motifs now available, the cm-builder script37 was used to build a covariance model for each segment and database. This script utilizes Infernal38, RNA Framework36, and R-Scape40 to analyze motifs against sequence databases, resulting in a list of highly structured and highly conserved motifs. The influenza nucleotide databases were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus Database, selecting for each type, filtering for full-length only, and collapsing identical sequences. These sequences were downloaded on 12 January 2021, resulting in 381,893 IAV, 55,958 IBV, and 668 ICV sequences. Each motif was analyzed against an IAV-only, IBV-only, ICV-only database, as well as a database of all available sequences. All resulting covariance models were then compiled (Supplemental File 3), and any observed covariance was assessed for significance (Supplemental File 2). IAV H1N1 segments were downloaded on 9 November 2021 (107,762 sequences), and all IAV H1N1 motifs were tested for covariance; no covariance was observed.Receiver operating characteristic analysis of ScanFold predicted structuresScanFold predicted structures for positive-sense IAV segments which contained −1 ΔG z-score base pairs or lower were cross referenced to available DMS-MaPseq41 probing datasets using ROC analysis, which measures how well the predicted model fits the in vivo generated data. In this analysis, reactivity data files (generated by Simon et al.) for each IAV segment had their reactivity sorted from least to most reactive and the lowest values were constrained to be paired at 1% intervals from 0 to 100 percent. Nucleotide positions constrained to be paired are then cross referenced to the predicted ScanFold structure (at every constraint threshold) to determine whether that position is a true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), or false negative (FN) and this is used to determine a true positive rate (TPR) and a false positive rate (FPR) at each threshold. Equations (1) and (2) show the TPR and FPR formulas respectively:$$TPR= \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$ (1) $$FPR= \frac{FP}{FP+TN}$$ (2) Here, a TP occurs when the nucleotide position is paired in the corresponding connectivity table (CT) file and considered paired at the corresponding constraint threshold; a FP occurs when the position is unpaired in the CT file and paired at the reactivity threshold; a TN is unpaired in the CT file and unconstrained at reactivity threshold; and a FN is paired in the CT file and unconstrained at the reactivity threshold. In this way, a completely unconstrained reactivity file, when compared to a CT file, will yield TPRs and FPRs of zero and completely constrained files will yield values of one. If a model fits the corresponding data, the TPR will rise significantly faster than the FPR initially, generating a curve with a larger AUC. If a model is random in regard to the data, the TPR and FPR will rise at an equal rate, generating a roughly 45-degree line. Results of our ROC analysis of IAV are visualized in Fig. 5 and raw data is in Supplemental File 4.

Although we have acclimated to colder environments through behavior adaptations over time, humans began in a tropical climate and are not naturally well-adapted to the cold. To survive, we learned to build shelter and preserve food, activities that, while life-saving, may also expose us to new microbial threats and challenges. Respiratory Infections: Why Do They Happen More Often in Winter? The influence of cold weather on the likelihood of contracting respiratory infections has been noted over hundreds of years. Influenza is derived from the Italian term influenza di freddo, which means "influence of the cold," and was used in Italy during the 1300s to describe the illness. While most have probably heard at least once in their lives that it's dangerous to go outside with wet hair because one will catch a cold, that is, in fact, a myth. As it turns out, lack of humidity is a significant driver of influenza infections in the winter. Influenza is spread by respiratory droplets in the air, which in warmer, humid weather take on more moisture and fall to the ground faster. In cold, dry climates, the respiratory droplets can stay in the air for longer, thereby infecting people more often. Combine this with indoor crowding and the closeness that comes with moving indoors and trying to stay warm, and it is a recipe for respiratory ruination.

Food Storage One of the most significant challenges associated with cold winter months is a lack of fresh food, and human survival has long depended on storing enough summer and autumn food to last until spring. Research demonstrates that ancient hunter-gatherers used the help of bacteria living in lakes to preserve meat during the winter months. It is believed that after successfully hunting a mammoth, indigenous people placed the meat in small, cold lakes where lactobacillus bacteria produced lactic acid and preserved muscle mass. Lactic acid-producing bacteria have long been used in the food industry to prevent food spoilage, since lactic acid prevents bacterial growth and the production of biologic amines, which ultimately contribute to the breakdown and rotting of food. Simply stated, ancient hunter-gatherers figured out how to extend the “shelf-life” of the food they hunted. Newspaper clipping following botulism outbreak in 1931. Source: USDA.gov. Though bacteria may play additional roles in preserving food, through pickling and fermentation, they can also lead to deadly food spoilage. In 1795, Napoleon put out a call and offered a large reward for anyone willing and able to invent a new method of food preservation. The popularity of canning picked up in the U.S. after the tin can and the mason jar were developed in the 1800s. By World War 1, canning was a major part of the war effort; however, this new methodology was not without risks. Despite development and publication of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommendations for proper canning practices in 1917, several people died from improperly canned peas contaminated with Clostridium botulinum in 1931. This was followed by the largest botulism outbreak recorded in U.S. history, which resulted from improperly canned peppers served at a restaurant in 1977. Gram-positive, Clostridium botulinum. Source: pixnio.com. In Canada, botulism outbreaks have been centered around the country’s native population since 1985. Most of the reported cases since 1985 have been due to the contamination of traditionally prepared marine mammal meat, particularly from seals and Beluga whales. Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus that produces one of the most potent known neurotoxins, which can cause muscle paralysis and death if ingested. Therefore, proper canning precautions must be taken to prevent contamination and subsequent illness when prepping food for a long winter (or quarantine). The Little Ice Age and the Plague From the early 1300s to 1850, the world experienced a significant cooling period called the "Little Ice Age." During this time, average global temperatures dropped nearly 4°F, which was enough to significantly impact crops and cultural practices worldwide. A massive grain shortage in Europe and North Africa necessitated import of grain from the Middle East. However, when the first trade ships arrived, most sailors were already dead, and survivors suffered from advanced signs of bubonic plague, including oozing buboes and pneumonia. The cause of such destruction onboard the trade ship was an infestation of rats, which carried fleas harboring the Yersinia pestis bacteria. These fleas found new hosts in their European and American destinations, ultimately infecting new rats. The rat population may have exploded, in part, due to increased biomass resulting from increased precipitation during the Little Ice Age. At the same time, the cool and humid conditions created by the Little Ice Ace may have supported flea survival and breeding. Combined with poor sanitary conditions and crowding, the plague killed more than 20 million people in Europe by the end of the epidemic. While the incidence of plague did not seem to increase during the winter months, the Little Ice Age serves as a great example of how cooler temperatures and climate change can significantly impact agriculture and cultural practices, which in turn may introduce pathogens into populations that have not previously experienced their wrath. Make Winter Safer The chill of the winter season encourages people to slow down, retreat and reflect. The increased hours of darkness and quiet allow one to think a little harder about staying healthy and protecting others during the winter season. To prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, cover your cough or wear a mask. Maintain distance from others if you are sick, and avoid attending or hosting crowded events. Ensure that all food is cooked and prepared correctly to prevent foodborne illnesses. Finally, consider steps that can be taken to help protect the planet and reduce the impact of climate change; we never know which pathogen is around the corner waiting for the opportunity (and ideal conditions) to strike.

In this Clinical Outlook, we highlight current and future approaches for the use of influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure. Landmark meta-analyses of data from observational studies and small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have underscored an association between influenza vaccination and sizeable reductions in mortality and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes1,2. These findings have led to the instigation of several large trials to examine the effect of seasonal influenza vaccines on CV outcomes3,4,5,6. A 2021 meta-analysis comprising almost 240,000 patients with CV disease (CVD) reported that influenza vaccination was associated with a 28% and an 18% reduction in relative risk of all-cause and CV death, respectively, and a 13% reduction in relative risk of major adverse CV events over a median follow-up of 20 months, compared with placebo or no vaccine2. Subsequently, the multicentre IAMI trial3 reported that the administration of an inactivated influenza vaccine shortly after hospital admission for myocardial infarction (MI) or high-risk stable coronary artery disease was associated with a 28% reduction in risk of major adverse CV events, a 41% reduction in CV mortality and a 41% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo. The efficacy of individual vaccine formulations in high-risk patients with CVD has yet to be established, but so far no differences have been found in cardiopulmonary outcomes between a high-dose trivalent and a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine in patients hospitalized for acute MI or heart failure4.Of note, the effect sizes seen so far with influenza vaccination for secondary prevention of CVD are similar to those of guideline-directed therapy with statins, β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been shown to reduce CV mortality by approximately 20–25%7 (Fig. 1). At present, three large RCTs are evaluating the cardioprotective effects of influenza vaccination in different populations, including DANFLU-1 and IVVE5,6.Fig. 1: Strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across the lifespan.Given that influenza vaccination reduces the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death to a similar, if not greater, extent to guideline-approved CV disease (CVD) preventative therapies such as aspirin, influenza vaccines should be a mainstay of the arsenal for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin-receptor blocker; ARNI, angiotensin-receptor–neprilysin inhibitor; BB, β-blocker; BP, blood pressure; DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy; HF, heart failure; MI, myocardial infarction; MRA, mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist; SGLT2i, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor.Full size imageinfluenza vaccines continue to be under-utilized in patients with CVDDespite the near-universal guideline recommendations for influenza vaccination in patients with CVD, influenza vaccines continue to be under-utilized in patients with CVD8. Alongside persistent vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, this under-utilization is attributable to the limited, platform-agnostic effectiveness of existing influenza vaccine strategies (approximately 40–60% protection against infection), which cannot facilitate rapid mass production of vaccines in response to new circulating mutations of influenza viruses8. This current strategy also underestimates the full cardioprotective potential of influenza vaccines — yet another argument in favour of fast-tracking the development of universal influenza vaccines to protect against all pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses.In a first step towards the clinical development of a universal influenza vaccine, Nachbagauer and colleagues evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a chimeric haemagglutinin-based universal influenza vaccine in healthy individuals with previous exposure to influenza infections and vaccinations9. The universality of this vaccine platform relies on weaknesses inherent in the structure of the influenza virus. All influenza viruses have two main glycoprotein spikes present on the viral envelope surface: haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Traditional influenza vaccines elicit strain-specific neutralizing antibodies against the variable globular head domain of haemagglutinin, which demonstrates immunodominance (a phenomenon of immunity whereby a small number of specific peptides are selected as representative epitopes of a given antigen to the immune system for physiological efficiency). In contrast to the variable head, which is highly susceptible to antigenic drift and allows the virus to mutate and escape neutralization, the stalk domain of haemagglutinin, although immunosubdominant, is more conserved, and therefore holds promise as a vaccine target to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies. In a first-in-human study, a single administration of an adjuvanted, inactivated, split virion, chimeric haemagglutinin-based vaccine led to a safe, broad, robust and long-lived immune response in healthy young individuals, which persisted even 18 months after a booster dose9. The antibody response also showed functional activities akin to those seen with protection from standard influenza vaccines, which indicates that these activities might also have a role in the protection induced by newer vaccine platforms. Looking to the future, the development of chimeric and mosaic haemagglutinin vaccines for other strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses are currently underway, with the ultimate goal of combining them into a trivalent vaccine against all drifted seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic influenza viruses.The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated biotechnological investment in mRNA-based vaccine technology, while increasing public awareness of unconventional vaccine platforms. In 2021, Moderna enrolled 180 healthy adults into a phase I/II trial of a quadrivalent mRNA-based influenza vaccine, and began to test an mRNA-based respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in a phase II/III trial that will involve an anticipated 34,000 participants10. Sanofi and Pfizer have also initiated phase I trials of their own mRNA-based influenza vaccines, given the advantages of this vaccine platform over conventional platforms, such as accurate strain selection and broader immune responses. These vaccines can also theoretically be manufactured more quickly and easily combined into polyshots against various antigens, both within and across viruses. The potential downside of such an approach is patient tolerability, because post-vaccination symptoms tend to be more intense than with traditional vaccines. However, these transient, non-serious risks may be worth the benefit of protection against respiratory infections and associated CV events.The same advances in vaccine platforms also hold promise for the future use of influenza vaccination for cardioprotection. First, the reported reductions in mortality and major CV events that result from the administration of technically ‘subpar’ traditional influenza vaccines are already sizeable. Therefore, boosting vaccine effectiveness for longer durations, reductions in antigenic evasion and increased coverage across more viral strains might translate to even larger effect sizes. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has also underscored the vicious cycle between viral respiratory infections in general and cardiopulmonary diseases. Therefore, combining vaccines against influenza, RSV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into a single polyshot is likely to increase the cardioprotective effects of the vaccine strategy.To conclude, ongoing and future investigations of the efficacy, safety and cardioprotective effects of a myriad of universal vaccine platforms for influenza and other viruses are taking us one step closer towards the ideal of an effective vaccine to reduce the risk of CVD.

But experts do not really believe the future will be Covid free. Rather, many prominent academics believe that Covid-19 is here to stay, perhaps in less virulent and disease-inducing forms than it originally presented as. World renowned technology tycoon and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, believes something similar. Earlier this week, in a Twitter conversation with Professor Devi Sridhar (who is Professor and Chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburg), Gates was asked by Dr. Sridhar: “Final question- what everyone wants to know -> how and when will the pandemic be over? Does omicron show that we can ‘live with COVID’? Or are other dangerous variants around the corner in 2022?” Gates had a composed and poignant response: “As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.” As alluded to above, Gates is certainly not the only one that believes this sentiment. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated early on: “The Omicron variant likely will spread more easily than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus…” Since its proliferation, this aspect of the new variant has largely been confirmed by public health experts, as Omicron has rapidly dominated the majority of new Covid-19 coronavirus infections worldwide in the last month. However, the pathological effect caused by Omicron is still largely unknown, with many saying that it produces less severe disease. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor If this is indeed eventually proven to be true—that Omicron is more transmissible, yet less severe in its disease process—then perhaps Gates and public health experts are onto something significant. This pattern would follow similar traits to other common viruses prevalent among the human population, such as rhinovirus (the “common cold”) and influenza (the “flu”)—both of which are noted to be certainly more transmissible, but typically (not always) entail less severe outcomes. Indeed, if coronavirus ends up as such, it may potentially become just another seasonal respiratory illness.

Everyone is now in pharmacies looking for medicines to combat this outbreak and despite the fact that traditionally these drugs rise in prices in December due to the flu processes that occur, the current situation is atypical due to Covid-19. FILE / LD Santo Domingo, DR There is currently a shortage of medicines in the local market, which the Association of Representatives, Agents and Pharmaceutical Producers Incorporated (ARAPF) associates to an excessive consumption in the last weeks by the population mainly due to the number of cases of influenza, the fear of the new variant of Covid-19 and the increase of flu-like processes typical of the date. This low availability was mainly reflected in anti-flu, anti-allergic, and vitamins used to treat this type of condition, confirming the ARAPF. Regarding the challenges presented by the global supply chain, ARAPF states that the local pharmaceutical sector took the necessary precautions to meet the demand for these drugs at Christmas time, which due to the change in weather, is usually higher than in other months of the year, allowing the logistical challenges not to impact the availability of medicines. “However, due to the various viral conditions, the demand was higher than anticipated and because of this, the last weeks of the month witnessed a low availability of these products,” he said. At the request of Listin Diario, the association explained that this low availability would not be prolonged and that in the next few days, these medicines would be supplied regularly, so this situation would not represent a major problem for the Dominican health system. Price increases Many people have recently come down with the flu. They are all now in the pharmacies looking for anti-flu drugs to combat this outbreak, and although, according to one pharmacist, in January, drugs tend to go up in price, this year has a particularity. Since December 25, 2021, according to an employee of a well-known local pharmacy, all anti-flu drugs are being highly sought after, which has increased the demand for these medicines. Sold out The pharmacist commented to this newspaper that some anti-flu medicines have even sold out and that there is no information as to when they will reappear, as is the case of the Algho pill, which sells for RD$46 per sachet of two tablets, and of the honey, onion and watercress syrup which is worth RD$306, which is only available in a few of the pharmacies consulted by this newspaper. Among the flu and cold medicines that increased in price was Broncochem in tablets of two, which went up from RD$25 to RD$30, while the syrup of the same brand increased from RD$225 to RD$250. The collaborator of one of the pharmacies consulted indicates that the Winasorb anti-flu tablet went up between three and five pesos. Apart from Alghero, it is one of the medicines selling the most, running out quickly. Antifludes capsules have had an increase of RD$25 to RD$30. Even though the COVID infections of the Omicron variant have skyrocketed, another pharmaceutical company assured that Ivermectin has maintained its price and its demand is stable. Prices of the best sellers Listin Diario also compiled the prices of the most consumed generic drugs in the Dominican Republic. However, it wasn’t easy to evaluate if they have gone up since the pharmacies updated their systems with the costs. The collaborators consulted do not remember precisely the increase some of them might have. Ponstan pills cost RD$35 per tablet. The sachet of two Winasorb capsules costs RD$15, and Sumigran Plus is RD$34 per unit. FIGURES 40 Relaxing weights. Dorixina Relax costs RD$40 each, and acetaminophen MK goes for RD$7 a unit. 30 Anti-allergic. Dominicans frequently consume Loratadine (RD$30 a unit) and Cetirizine (RD$16 each) for allergies. 26 For pain. The compound Sertal, used for pain (RD$26 a unit) and Ranitidine (RD$9 a unit), and omeprazole, the latter two to protect the stomach. 0 0 votes Article Rating Subscribe Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Label {} [+] Name* Email* Website Δ Label {} [+] Name* Email* Website Δ 1 Comment Oldest Newest Most Voted Inline Feedbacks View all comments alfredo January 16, 2022 9:03 am Whatever happened to the miracle vaccine…jjjjjjjjjj 1 Reply COVID-19 November 9, 2024 | 8:34 am26 cases of leptospirosis registered in one monthIn the last four weeks, the country reported 26 probable cases of leptospirosis, a...November 9, 2024 | 8:00 amMore changes in hospitals, three new directorsNational Territory—Mario Lama, the director of the National Health Service (SNS), swore in three...November 4, 2024 | 8:20 amAuthorities dismantle counterfeit medicine operationSanto Domingo.- The Dominican Public Ministry, in collaboration with the National Police, CECCOM, and...November 2, 2024 | 8:37 amRespiratory problems affect children and adultsNational Territory – Several types of respiratory viruses circulate in the Dominican Republic, affecting...November 1, 2024 | 8:11 amPublic Health intensifies malaria control effortsSanto Domingo.- The Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Public Health (MSP) is intensifying its malaria...October 30, 2024 | 4:52 pmPro Consumidor grants 30-day extension for removing sun-exposed water bottlesSanto Domingo.- The National Institute for the Protection of Consumer Rights (Pro Consumidor) has...

Europe is slowly starting to think soPublished Wed, Jan 12 20223:49 AM ESTUpdated Wed, Jan 12 20226:33 PM ESTHolly Ellyatt@HollyEllyattWATCH LIVEKey PointsThere are growing calls in Europe for the coronavirus to be treated as an endemic illness, like the flu.Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, is the latest leader to suggest it's time to reevaluate Covid.Britain's government has already told the public that it must "to learn to live with the virus."People walk in Regent Street, in London.SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty ImagesLONDON — There are growing calls in Europe for Covid-19 to be treated as an endemic illness like the flu despite strong warnings from global health officials that the pandemic is far from over.Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, is the latest European leader to stick his head above the parapet by suggesting it's time to reevaluate Covid. He called on the EU to debate the possibility of treating the virus as an endemic illness."The situation is not what we faced a year ago," Sanchez said in a radio interview with Spain's Cadena SER on Monday, as Spanish schoolchildren returned to their classrooms after the holidays."I think we have to evaluate the evolution of Covid to an endemic illness, from the pandemic we have faced up until now," he added. Sanchez said it was time to open the debate around a gradual reappraisal of the pandemic "at the technical level and at the level of health professionals, but also at the European level."Sanchez's comments mark something of a departure from fellow leaders on the Continent, however, with most of them focused on the immediate challenge of tackling alarming numbers of Covid cases caused by the omicron variant, which is highly infectious but widely appearing to cause less severe illness more akin to a cold than the flu symptoms seen with earlier variants.France, for example, has been reporting more than 300,000 new daily cases in recent days and Germany reported 80,430 new infections on Wednesday, the highest recorded in a single day since the pandemic began, according to Reuters.Sanchez's comments echo those made in the U.K. by politicians last year with Prime Minister Boris Johnson telling the British public that they would have to "learn to live with the virus."Read moreOmicron symptoms could seem like a cold — but don’t underestimate this variant, experts warnWith that in mind, the British government has had to hold its nerve in recent weeks by not introducing new restrictions on the public, despite what Johnson described as a "tidal wave" of cases caused by omicron.The U.K.'s Education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC on Sunday that the country was on the road "from pandemic to endemic" as the government said it could reduce the period of self-isolation for vaccinated people who test positive for Covid from seven days to five (as with the latest guidance in the U.S.) to alleviate staff absences in the workplace and the massive economic disruption caused by Covid.watch nowVIDEO2:1002:10Novartis CEO: We're moving toward filing Covid drug from Molecular Partners with FDASquawk on the StreetWith omicron cases appearing to fall in the United Kingdom (despite the number of infections remaining at high levels), Britain's strategy could have helped it overcome an omicron peak sooner rather than later with one public health expert saying the U.K. will be one of the first countries in the world to emerge from the pandemic.Speaking at a seminar Monday, professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that "the U.K is the closest to any country in being out of the pandemic if it isn't already out of the pandemic and having the disease as endemic."WHO warns no 'endemicity' yetMany epidemiologists and virologists have stated that Covid — which first emerged in China in late 2019 before spreading around the world, causing more than 313 million cases to date, and over 5 million deaths — is here to stay and will become an endemic disease eventually.That means that there will be persistent but low-to-moderate levels of Covid in any given population in future but that the virus should not be causing excessive levels of infection or spreading from country to country (which would make it a pandemic again).The World Health Organization is warning that it's too soon to consider Covid an endemic disease, however. It cautioned Tuesday that the global outbreak is far from being at an endemic stage as it estimated that more than half of the people in Europe and Central Asia could be infected with Covid in the next six to eight weeks as omicron spreads.Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday, Dr. Catherine Smallwood, a senior emergency officer at WHO Europe, said it's too soon to suggest the world is moving into an endemic phase of Covid."In terms of endemicity, we're still a way off, and I know there's a lot of discussion around that right now," Smallwood said."Endemicity assumes that there's stable circulation of the virus, at predictable levels and potentially known and predictable waves of epidemic transmission," she said."But what we're seeing at the moment coming into 2022 is nowhere near that, we still have a huge amount of uncertainty, we still have a virus that's evolving quite quickly and posing new challenges so we're certainly not at the point of being able to call it endemic. It might become endemic in due course but pinning that down to 2022 is a bit difficult at this stage."watch nowVIDEO5:0205:02Pfizer CEO Bourla: Omicron-specific Covid vaccine will be ready by MarchSquawk BoxSmallwood noted that widespread vaccination coverage would be key to moving to such a scenario but, for now, the conditions for endemicity were not being met.Marco Cavaleri, head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency, the EU's drug regulator, said Tuesday that "nobody knows when exactly we'll be at the end of the tunnel" in terms of the pandemic becoming endemic, but added that progress is being made."What is important is that we are moving towards the virus becoming more endemic but I cannot say we've already reached that status, so the virus is still behaving as a pandemic," he told a press briefing."Nevertheless, with the increase of immunity in the population, and with omicron there will be a lot of natural immunity taking place on top of vaccination, we will be moving fast towards a scenario that will be closer to endemicity."Booster conundrumCovid vaccination remains patchy around the world. While rich countries roll out booster shots and even discuss the possibility of fourth Covid jabs, poorer countries are still introducing their initial doses and many people remain unprotected by vaccines that have been proven to reduce the risk of severe infection, hospitalization and death.According to Our World in Data, 59.2% of the world's population has received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine but only 8.9% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose.watch nowVIDEO3:5803:58Pharmaceutical CEOs speak to their upcoming Covid vaccines, treatmentsNews VideosBooster shots are not unproblematic, however, with scientists at the WHO and elsewhere warning that continual boosters are not a viable strategy.The EMA's Cavaleri said Tuesday that "repeated vaccinations within short intervals will not represent a sustainable long-term strategy.""If we have a strategy in which we give boosters every four months, we will end up potentially having problems with immune response ... so we should be careful with not overloading the immune system with repeated immunization," he said."And secondly of course there is the risk of fatigue in the population with continuous administration of boosters." Ideally, Cavaleri said, "if you want to move towards a scenario of endemicity, then such boosters should be synchronized with the arrival of the cold season" and be timed to be given with flu vaccines."We will have to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting," he said.More CNBC health coverageFTC sues drug middlemen for allegedly inflating insulin pricesPfizer says drug for deadly cancer condition that causes weight loss shows positive trial dataGilead says its twice-yearly shot cut HIV infections by 96% in trialSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

KOLKATA: The weather see-saw that the city was witnessing might lead to spike in various viruses, including that of influenza, doctors warned. As predicted by the Met office, it rained in pockets in the city on Tuesday evening. Brought in by a western disturbance, this weather system has not only caused the untimely showers but also blocked the path of chill-bearing Northwesterly winds.The Alipore weather office has warned of more rain in Kolkata and other parts of Bengal.âWe can expect more thundershowers till Friday, after which the sky will start clearing up,â said Regional Meteorological Centre director (weather) G K Das. The maximum and minimum temperature on Tuesday remained above normal. While the day temperature is expected to slip below the normal by Wednesday, due to rain and cloud cover, nights will be warmer. âWe expect the cloud to start disappearing from Kolkata skies by Saturday. The chill should return by next week,â said Das.âThe warmer temperature will facilitate virus replication, including those of influenza. While the infection itself could be not of major concern, the overlapping symptoms will confuse both doctors and patients,â said Partha Sarathi Karmakar, professor, medicine, College of Medicine & Sagore Dutta. Doctors have flagged health concerns caused by the unseasonal rain and the temperature flip-flop. Health experts fear the rise in number of mosquito-borne diseases and respiratory and GI infections, apart from influenza-like illness. âThis abrupt weather change could trigger chest and respiratory infection, especially in the elderly. People might catch cold and cough, which could be overlapping with those with Covid-19 symptoms,â said internal medicine specialist Rahul Jain of Belle Vue Clinic.Doctors said while the temperature fluctuation could make one susceptible to respiratory infections, the untimely rain could again aggravate mosquito-borne diseases. âThis sudden change in weather can also aggravate the condition in people who are suffering from asthma and related diseases. The temperature change can bring in more viral infections,â said pulmonologist Sushmita Roy Chowdhury of Fortis Hospital.According to Dibyendu Raychaudhri, associate professor of paediatrics, children can also be susceptible to viral and influenza,apart from waterborne and mosquito-borne aliments. âThis weather change could lead to kids falling sick due to infections caused by rhino, adenovirus and syncytial virus, in addition to diarrhoea and dengue,â said Raychaudhuri of Bankura Sammilani Medical College.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousHow to make vrat-friendly Coconut Peanut Chutney at homeFoodHow to make your 'Curry patta' plant grow fasterLifestyle10 plants that can be grown without soil (you only need water!)Lifestyle10 countries known for their wildlifetravelâ10 things you should never say to an older personâLifestyleâ10 stunningly beautiful parrots in the worldâLifestyle10 most iconic animals from the world of fiction and literatureLifestyle10 animals that live in waterLifestyle10 types of vegetable-based cheela for healthy breakfastFood8 signs a child is smarter than averageLifestyle Next123 Photostories From earning Rs 500 per month to making it to the Forbes list, having a net worth of approximately Rs 300 crores and more: Rags to riches story of Kapil Sharma5 dry fruits that help reduce uric acid levels naturally8 animals that help Earth heal and howBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showKrushna Abhishek recalls his controversial elimination from Jhalak Dikkhla Jaa: Govinda mama was the guest and they evicted me from the show in front of him5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationshipsSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesFrom keeping his second marriage under wraps to converting to Islam; A look at Bigg Boss 18 contestant Vivian Dsena's Personal Life revelationsWeekly Horoscope: October 14th to 20th, 2024123Hot PicksThe RockAir India Bomb ThreatUS Election Timeline 2024Christopher ColumbusSpaceX Starship LaunchDonald Trump Assassination AttemptCody RhodesTOP TRENDINGBucky IrvingTom BradySamantha IrvinJerod MayoLouis Rees ZammitMike MccarthyDiddy ListTaylor SwiftStone ColdDonald TrumpTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteDiwali 2024 Date: When is Deepawali?

Picture: Fota Wildlife ParkTue, 11 Jan, 2022 - 16:48Michelle McGlynn    Birds in Ireland's zoos and wildlife parks have been moved to indoor habitats to protect them from the spread of bird flu. While no cases have been reported at these facilities, cases of avian influenza have been detected among wild birds and on poultry farms in Ireland.Both Fota Wildlife Park and Dublin Zoo have moved the majority of their birds indoors as a precautionary measure in accordance with direction from the Department of Agriculture. Among the bird species that are isolating indoors are the Humboldt penguin, blue-throated macaw, ostrich, citron-crested cockatoo, waldrapp ibis, Chilean flamingo, and Indian runner duck.The current strain of bird flu — H5N1 — is described as being "highly pathogenic" and has led to the largest ever outbreak in Ireland and the UK.Chilean flamingoes are among the birds being moved to indoor habitats at Fota Wildlife Park on Fota Island in Cork Harbour. Picture: Denis MinihaneDue to the virulence and transmissibility of the flu, the decision was taken to isolate the birds indoors to minimise the risk of any outbreaks through contact with other birds.In Fota, the birds have been indoors for almost a month and are expected to stay there for up to two more months.Although not ideal, Sean McKeown, Director of Fota Wildlife Park says the birds are coping well with being indoors.The change is easier for some species than others. For example, when the penguins go through the phase of moulting their feathers, they would not be particularly active anyway. The birds may be kept in until the peak of the bird flu season passes around March but Mr McKeown is hopeful that the small number of cases recently means it will end sooner. "One of the things that we have done in the past is we have vaccinated our birds and protected them that way," he said. Currently, there is no vaccine available but we hope there will be quite soon. The immunity offered by the vaccine only lasts a few months but it would provide the opportunity for the birds to be released sooner.Bird flu is introduced to Ireland when birds migrate south for the winter and Mr McKeown believes there may be a link between climate change and the increased incidence of bird flu."The weather is milder when they are making the migrations and they don't exert as much energy so a sick bird could probably complete the journey," he explains, "whereas before it wouldn't have done it."Avian flu affects domestic bird stock more than those found in Fota and Dublin Zoo but, with bird droppings the most common route for the disease to spread, it is important that contact between birds is reduced as much as possible.Wild birds and birds of prey are also affected but generally are more resilient to it compared to farmed birds which are often inbred over the years to produce more eggs or meat.Read MoreThird outbreak of bird flu on Irish farm Irish Examiner’s WhatsApp channelFollow and share the latest news and stories More in this section Body recovered from base of cliff in Clare Gardaí concerned for welfare of missing Cork woman Garda member injured after hit and run in Cork Bird FluH5N1Place: CorkPlace: DublinPerson: Sean McKeownOrganisation: Dublin ZooOrganisation: Fota Wildlife Park 'Phenomenal' number of drivers caught watching Netflix while behind wheelREAD NOW Subscribe Now Lunchtime News Sign up to the best reads of the week from irishexaminer.com selected just for you.
