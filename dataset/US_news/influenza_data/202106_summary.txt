- New Zealand implemented stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including lockdowns, border closures, and physical distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19.
- As a result of these NPIs, there was a significant reduction in influenza and other respiratory viral infections in New Zealand in 2020.
- This finding suggests that NPIs can be effective in controlling pandemic influenza and other respiratory viral threats.
- The use of NPIs, such as lockdowns and border closures, is not currently recommended for pandemic influenza control, but the success in New Zealand supports their implementation.
- The study emphasizes the importance of implementing and adhering to NPIs to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.
