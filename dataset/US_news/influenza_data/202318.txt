To describe the pattern of influenza circulation and timing of seasonal epidemics, we analyzed data from influenza-like illness (ILI) specimens on surveillance wards of sentinel hospitals during 2014–2018. Among 1,890,084 ILI cases, 324,211 (17.2%) tested positive for influenza. Influenza A virus (particularly A/H3N2), which circulates annually, was detected in 62% of cases, compared with influenza B virus in 38% of cases. The detection rate of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses were 3.56%, 7.07%, 2.08%, and 3.45%, respectively. Influenza prevalence was generally stable over the four years analyzed, but obvious outbreaks occurred in 2015–2016 (17.28%) and 2017–2018 (22.67%), with B/Victoria and B/Yamagata contributing to these outbreaks, respectively. In the south, a characteristic peak in infections was detected in the summer (week 23–38), which was not detected in the north. Influenza B was found high frequency in school-age children (5–14 years) with 4.78% of B/Victoria and 6.76% of B/Yamagata. Therefore, the epidemiological characteristics of seasonal influenza were complex in China during 2014–2018, presenting distinctions in region, season, and susceptible population. These findings underline the importance of enhancing year-round influenza surveillance and provide a reference for the timing and variety of influenza vaccination.

It is responsible for annual, seasonal epidemics worldwide that cause a substantial burden on healthcare services, despite decades of surveillance and pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions1. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the influenza virus causes 3 to 5 million severe infections and 290,000 to 650,000 fatal infections annually worldwide2. In China, the number of annual influenza-associated excess deaths was 18.0 and 11.3 per 100,000 in northern and southern cities, respectively3. Viruses of influenza A and B lineages are the main causes of the disease burden in humans4. The epidemic strength of influenza B is lower than that of influenza A in China. However, influenza B is more prevalent in some regions in certain years, and the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages were reported to be alternately dominant in the winter-spring months5.Throughout the world, influenza shows seasonal prevalence and high incidence in temperate regions in the winter and spring. However, in tropical regions, especially in Asia, influenza seasonality is highly diverse, with semi-annual and year-round epidemics, as well as year-round cycles6,7,8. China is a country with a vast territory encompassing a diversity of climatic zones (temperate, subtropical, and tropical), and factors such as the minimum temperature, hours of sunshine, and maximum rainfall affect influenza seasonality. The annual periodicity of influenza A increased with latitude and showed diversified spatial patterns and seasonal characteristics. Epidemics of influenza A peaked in January–February in northern China (latitude ≥ 33°N) and April–June in southernmost regions (latitude < 27°N), and dominant semi-annual periodicity was observed with peaks in January–February and June–August (latitude 27.4°N–31.3°N)9. Despite the vast amount of study on seasonal influenza, the epidemiological characteristics of seasonal influenza have not been well described on a national scale in China. Consequently, analyzing surveillance data with different populations, periods, and regions of specific influenza types, subtypes, and lineages is crucial to develop policies and strategies for the prevention and control of the influenza epidemic, as well as understanding influenza persistence worldwide.China established an influenza surveillance system in 2000, which is conducted in 31 provinces (autonomous regions or municipalities) in mainland of China, under the management of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), providing weekly reports from 410 laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals in each province10. In this study, we used the results of weekly viral surveillance of influenza surveillance wards of sentinel hospitals to estimate the influenza case rate in China between 2014 and 2018. We identified and compared the seasonality and epidemiological features of seasonal influenza subtypes, as well as regional differences between north and south China. Based on our findings, we provide guidance on developing specific vaccine recommendations and on the prevention and control of influenza.ResultsOverall characteristics of influenza-positive cases﻿From 2014–2018, 1,890,084 outpatients or inpatients diagnosed with influenza-like illness (ILI) cases were enrolled ﻿for specimen collection in the surveillance wards of the sentinel hospitals. Of these, 324,211 ILI patients were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza, and 173,119 (53.4%) were male. The median age was 12.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 5.0–33.0 years), 86,713 (26.7%) were 0–4 years old, 107,774 (33.2%) were ﻿5–14 years old, 34,165 (10.5%) were 15–24 years old, 74,323 (22.9%) were 25–59 years old, and 21,236 (6.6%) were ≥ 60 years old (Table 1). The median age of ILI patients with confirmed influenza was 12.0 years, compared to 8.0 years in those without confirmed influenza.Table 1 The frequency of influenza viruses and proportion for influenza type /subtype by subgroups.Full size tableAcross the four seasons, the confirmed average annual number of influenza infections was 81,053 (95% CI: 30,199, 131,907), corresponding to a detected positive rate of 17.2% (95% CI: 9.9% to 23.6%) in ILI cases (Table 1). Influenza types/subtypes detected included A/H1N1(pH1N1) influenza (67,368, 3.56%), A/H3N2 (133,581, 7.07%), A (subtype not identified) (209, 0.01%), B/Victoria (39,308, 2.08%), B/Yamagata (65,184, 3.45%), B (subtype not identified) (17,980, 0.95%), and co-infection (581, 0.03%). Additionally, influenza-positive samples were detected with a percentage of 22.05% in lower respiratory tract specimens and 17.15% in upper respiratory tract specimens.Seasonal characteristics of influenza virusesDuring the four-year surveillance period, we found three epidemic periodicities of the seasonal influenza virus. The first pattern was the annual periodicity of infection cases during winter. In the surveillance year 2016–2017, the estimated peak of influenza-positive detection rate of the weekly count was 25.1% in week 50. The second pattern was the semiannual periodicity of infection cases during the surveillance years 2014–2015 and 2015–2016, which presented two peaks of influenza-positive detection rate in the summer and in the winter-spring. For these two time periods, the influenza epidemic in the summer season peaked at week 30 with a positive detection rate of 20.1% and 22.3%, while the epidemic in the winter-spring peaked at weeks 52 and 12 with a positive detection rate of 25.1% and 41.8% for the years 2014–2015 and 2015–2016, respectively. The third pattern was the year-round periodicity of infection cases during the surveillance year 2017–2018. The influenza epidemic continued in the spring of the previous year, then peaked twice in the summer and winter-spring. The estimated summer peak was in week 33 and the winter peak was in week 4, and the positive detection rate at these peak times was 21.2% and 48.3%, respectively (Fig. 1a).Figure 1Weekly distribution of the positive detection rate of influenza virus from 2014 to 2018. (a: National distribution; b: Distribution in northern China; c: Distribution in southern China).Full size imageThe positive detection rate of the influenza virus was undulatory according to seasonality. The highest influenza-positive detection rate occurred in winter (weeks 50–11), followed by summer (weeks 23–38), spring (weeks 12–22), and autumn (weeks 39–48). The epidemic of influenza A occurred in summer and winter, while the epidemic of influenza B occurred in winter and spring. With semiannual periodicity, influenza virus A/H3N2 was the most prevalent in the summer, peaking at a weekly positive rate of 20.1%–22.3%. Additionally, in winter-spring, A/H1N1 or influenza B were the most prevalent viruses after the peak of A/H3N2 at the same periodicity. A/H1N1 was mainly detected in winter-spring accompanied by influenza B viruses, such as B/Victoria in 2015–2016 and B/Yamagata in 2017–2018. B lineage identification occurred without regularity, with epidemic outbreaks of a particular lineage being detected every few years, e.g., 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 (Fig. 1a).Characteristics of influenza epidemics by regionThe characteristics of influenza epidemics vary between the north and south of China, which is likely due to the wide range of climatic zones spanning from the northern mid-temperate region to the southern subtropical and tropical regions5,11. Local influenza outbreaks were mainly recorded in the northern provinces, e.g., Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and Gansu in 2015–2016; however, in 2016–2017, influenza was prevalent in both northern and southern provinces (Fig. 2). During the outbreaks from 2014–2018, the most affected provinces in mainland China were Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, and Zhejiang.Figure 2Distribution of the positive detection rate of influenza virus among provinces for different years. (a: 2014–2015; b: 2015–2016; c: 2016–2017; d: 2017–2018; e: 2014–2018). The maps were generated using ArcGIS (version 10.2, URL https://www.esri.com/).Full size imageIn northern China, there was an increase in influenza activity from December to May, presenting as a winter-spring seasonal peak during 2014–2018. Additionally, the predominant types/subtypes of influenza virus in the north were different for each seasonal peak of influenza activity (Fig. 1b). Virus A/H3N2 was predominant during the winter peak (accounting for 52% of positive samples) and B/Yamagata was predominant during the spring peak (accounting for 27% of positive samples) during 2014–2015. Viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 were detected simultaneously with B/Victoria or B/Yamagata (accounting for 43% or 25% of positive samples) during the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 winter peaks, respectively. Interestingly, only A/H1N1 (accounting for 49% of positive samples) and A/H3N2 (accounting for 40% of positive samples) predominated during the winter peak or the winter-spring peak in 2016–2017, with no detected outbreak of influenza B virus (Figs. 1b and 3).Figure 3Distribution of the positive detection rates of different subtypes/lineages among provinces. (a: A/H1N1; b: A/H3N2; c: B/Victoria; d: B/Yamagata). The maps were generated using ArcGIS (version 10.2, URL https://www.esri.com/).Full size imageIn southern China, influenza activity among ILI patients peaked in both the winter-spring months and the summer months (weeks 23 to 38) each year. The predominant types/subtypes of circulating influenza virus in the south for the summer months of each influenza season were the same, mainly involving A/H3N2. Similar to the north, the predominant types/subtypes of circulating influenza virus in the south for both the winter and spring months of each influenza season varied from season to season (Fig. 1c and Fig. 3). During the winter-spring months of the study period, the types/subtypes of influenza virus were A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata during 2014–2015 (accounting for 34% and 60% of positive samples, respectively); A(H1N1) and B/Victoria during 2014–2015 (accounting for 56% and 40% of positive samples, respectively) and 2016–2017 (accounting for 47% and 38% of positive samples, respectively); and A(H1N1), B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria during 2017–2018 (accounting for 61%, 28%, and 10% of positive samples, respectively).Influenza virus activity among age groupsDuring the four-year period analyzed, the positive detection rate of influenza virus varied by age group, with the highest overall rate being among school-age children of 5–14 years old (25.86%), followed by 15–24-year-olds (19.64%), ≥ 60-year-olds (17.38%), 25–59-year-olds (17.16%), and 0–4-year-old (11.65%). For the influenza A virus, the positive detection rate of A/H3N2 (7.07%) and A/H1N1 (3.56%) among all age groups. The age distribution curve showed that the A/H1N1 positive detection rate remained relatively constant, whereas A/H3N2 showed two obvious peaks in 15–24-year-olds and ≥ 60-year-olds, at almost one-third of the rate of A/H1N1 (Fig. 4a). For influenza B viruses, the positive detection rate of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata peaked in the 5–14-year-old group (4.78% and 6.76%, respectively). The age distribution curve showed a single peak for B/Victoria, and this virus was rarely detected among those aged ≥ 40. However, detection of B/Yamagata decreased in adults ≥ 18 years of age, then increased again in the 40-year-old age group, and finally peaked among 54–63-year-olds (Fig. 4b).Figure 4Correlation between age and the proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza, from 2014–2018. (a) A/H1N1 and A/H3N2; (b) B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we compared the relative contribution of the different virus types and subtypes to influenza epidemics and investigated the spatial–temporal patterns of seasonal influenza activity in northern and southern China during four consecutive seasons (2014–2015 to 2017–2018). On average, A/H3N2 caused nearly one-half of all cases and was epidemic in all four seasons. The circulation patterns of the other three main influenza viruses differed substantially from those of A/H3N2, and their contributions to seasonal epidemics and dynamic patterns need to be further studied. Influenza B virus caused major outbreaks in two of the four seasons (2015–2016 and 2017–2018), confirming its role as an important contributor to the seasonal influenza burden, which has similarly been observed in other regions of the world12. In particular, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata made a significant contribution to the influenza burden in 2015–2016 and 2017–2018, respectively. Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of the two influenza B virus lineages will provide valuable insights into the appropriate modification of current influenza vaccination programs.We identified three epidemic periodicities of seasonal influenza viruses during the surveillance period from 2014–2018, including annual periodicity, semiannual periodicity, and year-round periodicity. The epidemic durations for viruses with annual periodicity were longer than those with semiannual periodicity; epidemics with annual periodicity lasted for 38 weeks (week 34 to 12) in the winter-spring seasons, while epidemics with semiannual periodicity lasted for 16 weeks (week 22 to 38) in the summer seasons and 20 weeks (week 50 to 18) in the winter-spring seasons. In addition, the epidemic with year-round periodicity continued from week 14 of the previous season in winter and spring, and epidemics with semiannual periodicity continued for another influenza season. This finding highlights the importance of understanding influenza circulation patterns in China.Seasonal influenza infections exhibit a strong seasonal cycle, both according to the longitude and latitude, in most cases. Distinct seasonality has previously been reported in China: northern provinces (latitudes > 33°N) experience winter epidemics, southernmost provinces (latitude < 27°N) experience peak activity in spring, while provinces at intermediate latitudes experience semi-annual epidemic cycles13. On the basis of the influenza surveillance data from 2014–2018, we identified similar epidemiological characteristics, with southern China having earlier primary peaks in the winter-spring months and an obvious secondary peak in the summer months, whereas northern China had one peak of similar amplitude in the winter-spring months each year. Despite the observed differences in latitude, there remained uncertainty regarding the main driver of the influenza epidemics. Climatic parameters, such as absolute humidity, temperature, and rainfall, cause differences in influenza epidemiology (including the timing, periodicity, and patterns of transmission). Recent laboratory and epidemiological evidence suggests that low humidity conditions facilitate the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus in temperate regions, resulting in annual winter epidemics14.Published data from 29 countries from 1999 to 2014 suggested that young children (< 5 years of age) were more affected by seasonal influenza A/H1N1, older children (aged 5 to 17 years) by influenza B, young adults (aged 18 to 39 years) and older adults (aged 40 to 64 years) by influenza A/H1N1, and older people (aged ≥ 65 years) by influenza A/H3N215. Our study indicated that influenza positivity was high among school-age children (5 to 14-year-olds), especially for B/Victorian and B/Yamagata. This revealed that influenza B virus infections are of specific concern among pediatric patients because of the increased risk of severe disease16. Future research should prioritize the study of influenza epidemiology in this age-specific population, to optimize prevention strategies and the composition and timing of administration of the influenza vaccine. Additionally, the current trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) is lack of B/Y antigen and quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) should be timely updated for better prevention against type B influenza virus.Despite the availability of influenza surveillance data greatly improving since the 2009 pandemic, there are still some gaps in the data that may be seen as limitations of the present study. First, the number of reported influenza cases (in each season and overall) varied widely across provinces, and this influenced our analysis of the regional characteristics of influenza epidemics. Second, we did not analyze the effects of climatic parameters (humidity, temperature, and rainfall) on influenza epidemiology. Third, the detailed co-infection distribution of different influenza viruses is not available in our database. Moreover, due to the update of influenza surveillance guidelines in 2017, and the improvement of detection technology capability from 2014 to 2018, may affect the positive rate of influenza detection.In conclusion, our study uncovered the intriguing characteristics of influenza seasonality and defined the predominant circulating virus types and subtypes in different regions of China. Furthermore, our findings revealed patterns of age‐specific susceptibility to influenza infection. Such information is valuable for estimating the disease burden of influenza and evaluating the target groups and optimizing the timing of vaccination and other preventive measures against influenza. Further surveillance studies are warranted to confirm these seasonality patterns and to ensure that the influenza strains circulating in different provinces are consistent with WHO vaccine recommendations.Methods.Epidemiological dataData of outpatients or inpatients diagnosed with ILI were collected from the national influenza surveillance network from 2014–2018 and included sex, age, date of sampling, respiratory specimen type, the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases by virus type (influenza A and B), and the number of ILI specimens tested in 31 Chinese provinces. ILI was defined as a measured temperature ≥ 38 °C with the presence of either cough or sore throat. Hospital infection control and local CDC staff entered epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data into an electronic database that was transmitted weekly to the national China CDC 3,11. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Participating hospitals and laboratories used a standard operating protocol (SOP) of surveillance that included guidelines for patient enrollment, specimen collection, laboratory testing, data recording, and management, developed by China CDC17.National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China decided that since data from patients with ILI was part of continuing public health surveillance and implemented national surveillance guidelines. All participants and/or their legal guardian(s) in this study agreed with an informed consent to provide information such as sex, age and area, and specimen testing for influenza during their enrollment. This project and the above procedure for obtaining consent were approved by the ethical review committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC, Beijing, China).Specimen collection and testingAfter hospital admission and verbal consent from eligible ILI cases- or their parent/guardians, ﻿physicians collected the upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab or pharyngeal swab) and lower respiratory tract specimens (aspirate, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung puncture aspirate) within 24 h of enrollment, following standardized procedures. Specimens were immediately placed in a viral transport medium (VTM) and stored at 4 °C at the local hospital. These specimens were transferred to the closest influenza network laboratory (provincial or prefecture CDC laboratories) within 48 h of collection. The local influenza network laboratories stored the specimens in VTM at − 70 °C prior to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), or virus isolation and detection using a hemagglutination-inhibition test (HI test), following the standard protocol17. We defined a patient with laboratory-confirmed influenza as any ILI patient with a ﻿respiratory specimen that tested positive for influenza virus by RT-PCR or HI test. If any one of the influenza viruses was detected in the specimens, the patient was considered to be positive. One virus identified was labeled as a single infection, and two or more etiologies were co-infection.Data analysisThe positive detection rate was calculated by dividing the number of samples that tested positive for the influenza virus by the total number of samples tested. The age-specific influenza positive detection rate by subtype/lineage was calculated as the number of specimens that tested positive for each subtype/lineage (numerator) among ILI cases recruited for specimen collection (denominator) in each corresponding age group18. A surveillance year was defined as the period ranging from calendar week 14 of one year to calendar week 13 of the next year17. The surveillance week started on Monday and ended on Sunday. The 12th week to the 22nd week of each year is spring, the 23rd week to the 38th week is summer, the 39th week to the 48th week is autumn, and the 50th week to the 11th week of the following year is winter. The start of an influenza epidemic period was defined as the first week during which the positive rate of influenza virus testing was higher than 10% and stayed above that level for at least four consecutive weeks. The end of an influenza epidemic period was defined as the first week during which the positive rate was lower than 10% and stayed at that level for at least four consecutive weeks19. Based on influenza activity, climate, and geography, we divided China into two distinct regions, north and south, for the analysis and interpretation of influenza surveillance data. The Qinling Mountain–Huaihe River serves as the dividing line between north and south China20. Data were performed using Microsoft Excel (Version 2021, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), Stata version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) and ArcGIS (version 10.2, ESRI Inc.; Redlands, CA, USA; URL https://www.esri.com/).

Scott Nolen May 01, 2023 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is testing the efficacy of a handful of vaccines against the current strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) hoping to stem the spread of the largest outbreak of bird flu in the nation’s history. The virus has so far been reported in all but one state, Hawaii, and has resulted in the deaths of nearly 60 million poultry. While four vaccines are licensed for avian influenza—HA subtype, H5N1, H5N3, and H5N9—none are approved for the more virulent strain, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, found in the current outbreak. This strain likely originated in wild birds, subsequently reached commercial poultry operations, then spilled over into nonhuman mammals, including mountain lions, coyotes, and bottlenose dolphins, which many have ingested infected birds. Researchers with the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) started testing four vaccine candidates this April, beginning with single-dose trials, according to a USDA spokesperson. Initial data from the trials are expected to be available this May. Researchers expect to have two-dose vaccine challenge studies with results in June. Given the many challenges of vaccine development and approval, a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spokesperson says it is critical that bird owners look at what they can do immediately to protect their flocks now. Should these trials be successful—and should the USDA continue development—the next step is identifying manufacturers interested in vaccine production, the spokesperson continued. Once one or more manufacturers are identified, more than a dozen stages must be completed before vaccine delivery, starting with feasibility work by the manufacturer and culminating with product label submission and review. Among those manufacturers is Zoetis, which announced on April 5 its development of an avian influenza vaccine geared toward currently circulating strains. According to the company, distribution of a vaccine effective against the current HPAI strain would take roughly a year. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) is responsible for regulating animal biologics, including vaccines. Vaccine candidates are reviewed and approved by CVB to ensure they are safe, potent, pure, and effective, i.e., well-matched against the genetics of the current virus strain. While typical timeframes for development and approval of animal vaccines are two and a half to three years, the USDA spokesperson noted that manufacturers may expedite development in emergency situations, resulting in a shortened licensure timeframe. While vaccination can substantively reduce mortality and has the support of some sectors of the poultry industry, others worry that vaccinated birds could still contract the disease and transmit it, effectively masking the spread of the virus and hindering surveillance efforts. There is also concern about the rapidity with which HPAI can mutate, which could reduce the efficacy of a vaccine. Given the many challenges of vaccine development and approval, the USDA spokesperson said it is critical that bird owners look at what they can do immediately to protect their flocks now. “Biosecurity is the best defense against HPAI,” the USDA spokesperson said, “and USDA strongly encourages all bird owners to review our resources, such as our factsheet on managing wildlife to prevent the introduction of avian influenza, evaluate their biosecurity plans, and develop a strategy to prevent any exposure to wild birds or their droppings.” Another major issue with vaccinating for HPAI is the potential loss of export markets, said Dr. Karen Grogan, clinical associate professor of avian medicine at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine. Historically, naturally infected birds cannot be differentiated from vaccinated birds, so countries impose trade restrictions rather than risk domestic poultry flocks, Dr. Grogan explained. “The way that you preserve trade is you have a vaccine that allows you to do what’s called the DIVA strategy, that is, differentiate infected from vaccinated animals,” she said. “One approach is creating a vaccine using a neuraminidase type that’s different from the circulating virus that you could test for serologically.” Viral neuraminidase is a type of neuraminidase found on the surface of influenza viruses that enables the virus to be released from the host cell. An HPAI vaccine might also be approved for special bird collections, such as those exhibited at zoos, Dr. Grogan added. “A lot of these decisions would have to be made within USDA with input from industry and stakeholders, she said. “You would also see a lot of input from the researchers at ARS given their research about a vaccine’s efficacy in a number of potential settings.” View a timeline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that gives a summary of significant highly pathogenic avian influenza and low-pathogenicity avian influenza outbreaks in birds, infections in animals and people, and events from 2020-22.

Pediatric Deaths5 deaths were reported (1 occurred in 2021-22 season and 4 occurred in 2022-23 season). All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Directional arrows indicate changes between the current week and the previous week. Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page. A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page. Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. Nationally, outpatient respiratory illness is below baseline, and nine of 10 HHS regions are below their respective baselines. The number and weekly rate of flu hospital admissions remain low. During week 17, 36.0% of viruses reported by public health laboratories were influenza A and 64.0% were influenza B. Of the 12 influenza A viruses detected and subtyped during week 17, 3 were influenza A(H3N2) and 9 were influenza A(H1N1). Four influenza-associated pediatric deaths that occurred during the 2022-2023 season were reported this week, for a total of 149 pediatric flu deaths reported so far this season. CDC estimates that, so far this season, there have been at least 26 million illnesses, 290,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu. The majority of influenza viruses tested are in the same genetic subclade as and antigenically similar to the influenza viruses included in this season’s influenza vaccine. All viruses collected and evaluated this season have been susceptible to the influenza antivirals peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir, and all viruses except for one (> 99.9%) have been susceptible to the influenza antiviral oseltamivir. CDC continues to recommend that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine as long as flu activity continues. There are also prescription flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness; those need to be started as early as possible. U.S. Virologic Surveillance Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable (change of <0.5 percentage points).

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC genetically characterized 2,813 influenza viruses collected since October 2, 2022. To reflect the genetic diversity of the HA genes in recent A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses, new subclades have been designated. The vast majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected in the U.S. this season express HA genes belonging to 6B.1A.5a.2, but this clade has been split into the 2a and 2a.1 subclades. All A(H3N2) viruses collected thus far in the U.S. this season express HA genes belonging to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, and this clade has been split into multiple subclades. The new subclade designations improve the ability to track the evolution and co-circulation of multiple groups of influenza viruses.

Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: One hundred and sixty-two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 158 (98%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/588/2019-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant- based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): Two hundred and three A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HINT, and 191 (94%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: Forty-five influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 2, 2022, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria B/Yamagata Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 2,801 1,023 1,622 156 0 Reduced Inhibition 1 (<0.1%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 2,801 1,023 1,622 156 0 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 2,801 1,023 1,622 156 0 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 2,716 979 1,583 154 0 Reduced Susceptibility 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-S247G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care-seeking behaviors have changed, and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settings not captured as a part of ILINet or at a different point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide during week 17, 2.0% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) compared to week 16 and is below the national baseline of 2.5%. Nine of 10 HHS regions are below their respective baselines; Region 9 is at baseline. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group More than 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) for all age groups (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, and 65+ years) in week 17 compared to week 16.

FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. A total of 18,105 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2022, and April 29, 2023. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in week 17 was 0.1 per 100,000 population. The weekly rate observed during week 48 (week ending December 3, 2022) is the third highest peak weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010-2011; this follows the 2017-2018 season which peaked during week 1 (week ending January 6, 2018) and the 2014-2015 season which peaked during week 52 (week ending December 27, 2014). The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 61.9 per 100,000 population. This in-season cumulative hospitalization rate is similar to the end-of-season hospitalization rates for 4 seasons (2014-2015, 2016-2017, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 seasons) and lower than the end-of-season hospitalization rate for the 2017-2018 season, going back to 2010-2011. When examining rates by age, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among adults aged 65 and older (184.3). Among adults aged 65 and older, rates were highest among adults aged 85 and older (337.7). Among persons aged <65 years, hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were highest among children aged 0-4 years (80.3), followed by adults aged 50-64 years (67.1). When examining rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (87.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (81.2), Hispanic/Latino persons (54.5), non-Hispanic White persons (53.0), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (27.2). Among 18,105 hospitalizations, 17,315 (95.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, 617 (3.4%) with influenza B virus, 30 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 143 (0.8%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among 4,524 hospitalizations with influenza A subtype information, 3,388 (74.9%) were A(H3N2), and 1,136 (25.1%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. Based on preliminary data, of the 5,393 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations with more complete data, 3.8% (95% CI: 3.1%-4.5%) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 3,761 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 97.1% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,394 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 37.1% were pregnant. Among 1,298 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 66.0% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma, followed by neurologic disease, and obesity.

Robert F. Bukaty / AP Photo Avian Flu Outbreaks in Marine Mammals Mark New Era for Deadly Virus A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has killed thousands of wild birds and is now infecting seals and other marine mammals. Researchers know the virus can jump from birds to mammals, but they are on alert to see if it can be transmitted from mammal to mammal. By Andrew S. Lewis • May 4, 2023 Facebook Twitter Email Last June, the phones at Marine Mammals of Maine began ringing — a lot. People walking the craggy shoreline of Casco Bay, which stretches north and south of Portland, were reporting sick or dead seals. Late spring and early summer, as pups begin to set off on their own, are usually the rescue and rehabilitation center’s busiest time, but the volume of calls kept increasing. “We were dealing with three times the number of animals we would normally be dealing with,” says Lynda Doughty, the center’s executive director. One harbor seal’s behavior stood out. The animal was, Doughty recalls, “neurologic” — its weight and overall nutrition were fine, but in addition to coughing and sneezing, it was twitching and seemed disorientated. The young male’s condition was rapidly declining, and Doughty’s thoughts turned to the many recent reports of wild birds — like raptors and gulls — infected with a new strain of H5N1, a highly contagious avian influenza. She worried that whatever ailed the rapidly declining seal could spread to the other seals crowding the center and made the difficult decision to euthanize. Then she called Wendy Puryear. Avian influenza previously didn’t appear to spread between mammals. But this new variant has proven different. When Marine Mammals of Maine has a dead animal whose illness cannot be identified following a gross necropsy, it often sends tissue samples to Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University whose recent research has focused on how avian influenza moves from birds to mammals and then to other mammals. At the university’s Runstadler Lab, Puryear and her team ran PCR tests on swab samples from the seal. When they came back positive, the team overnighted a sample to a federal lab for confirmation. “I needed to make absolutely sure of the results before I sounded the alarms,” Puryear says, “because I anticipated all of the big wheels that would immediately be put in motion.” NEVER MISS AN ARTICLE Subscribe to the E360 Newsletter for weekly updates delivered to your inbox. Sign Up. It was the world’s first confirmed case of this latest, extremely virulent strain of H5N1 in marine mammals, and it wouldn’t be the last. By the end of July, more than 330 harbor and gray seals had died from the virus — enough that the National Marine Fisheries Service immediately declared an “unusual mortality event” for pinnipeds along the Maine coast. In the months that followed, it became clear that H5N1 was hardly contained to North America. Infections in seals and sea lions have since been confirmed in Europe, Russia, and South America. The most severe die-off was of more than 3,000 sea lions in Peru this winter. A member of the Marine Mammals of Maine response team swabs a harbor seal to test for avian influenza. Marine Mammals of Maine Avian influenza viruses are classified as either low or highly pathogenic, based on how lethal they are to poultry, and some “low path” strains can mutate into “high path” influenzas. The current variant of H5N1 is one of the most virulent high path avian influenzas ever documented, experts say. It originated in farmed geese in Guangdong, China in 1996, and by 2005 wild birds were spreading the virus in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Last year, Puryear was a coauthor on a study led by Nichola Hill, a University of Massachusetts-Boston biologist, that examined how migrating seabirds, like gulls, have played a significant role in spreading H5N1. In a briefing with reporters last month, Hill noted that the first detection occurred in December 2021, in Newfoundland, when a great black-backed gull and poultry at a noncommercial farm became infected at about the same time. The disease has since killed nearly 59 million poultry and 6,715 wild birds across the U.S., including endangered species like the sandhill crane and the California condor. According to Hill, estimates of global wild bird mortality range from 10,000 to a million individuals. Just one year after the 1996 Guangdong outbreak, H5N1 reached Hong Kong, where it was detected in humans for the first time: 18 people were infected and six died. Though there have been only 890 human cases since the Hong Kong outbreak, the virus has a fatality rate of 50 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control. What kept H5N1 from infecting more people is that it didn’t appear to spread between mammals: it moved only from bird to mammal through direct contact with body fluids or feathers. But this new variant has proven different. When it raced through a mink farm in Spain last October — triggering the euthanization of the facility’s 50,000 animals — the question of whether H5N1 could spread between mammals was answered. “I think a large, looming question for a lot of us is, ‘Do these latest outbreaks represent a new era for bird flu?’” Hill said in the briefing. “And the answer is yes.” Several recent cases in other parts of the world illustrate how little is known about H5N1 in marine mammals. Puryear and Hill are among a cadre of scientists and researchers in the Gulf of Maine region who have been watching the evolution of avian influenza infection in marine mammals since 2011, when the variant H3N8 killed 162 young harbor seals in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. In fact, there have been periodic outbreaks of avian influenza in seals in the Americas and Eurasia going back to at least 1972. It had generally been assumed that those were bird-to-seal events, or one-off “dead-end spillovers,” which don’t spread between mammals. But after the 2011 die-off, Puryear, Hill, and other colleagues decided to test that assumption. Was influenza “out there circulating in marine mammals as well?” Puryear asked. ALSO ON YALE E360 Unraveling the causes of the pandemic, and preparing for the next. Read more. To gather data on as many marine mammals as possible, the researchers teamed up with NOAA’s Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program, which includes a network of small rescue and rehabilitation centers. Through collaboration with Doughty and her team, Puryear was able to obtain fluid, tissue, or swab samples from every reported seal stranding in Maine, both alive and deceased. That data, combined with those compiled from three years’ worth of site visits to gray seal rookeries, where health assessments were performed on more than 300 animals, allowed the researchers to determine that — in gray seals, at least — low path avian influenza infection is in fact not restricted to spillover events. “What we found is it’s pretty much always there,” Puryear says. “There wasn’t a year that we didn’t pick up influenza in the gray seals, going all the way back to 2012.” Like the common cold perpetually circulating among first graders, low-path avian influenza circulates more or less continuously among gray seals, which makes them more vulnerable to dangerous high-path variants. That understanding, Puryear continues, made it “not at all surprising when H5N1 made its way [from birds] into the seals” last year.

ERNESTO BENAVIDES / AFP via Getty Images Deborah Fauquier, a veterinary medical officer with the National Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program, says that, as of now, it appears that last summer’s outbreak of H5N1 in Maine resulted from bird-to-seal transmission, not mammal to mammal. “We’ve been continually testing, and we haven’t seen a positive since July 15,” Fauquier says. “So at the moment it seems to be these very perfect storms, where you have really sick birds near seals that are congregating, and we’re getting these individual spillover events.” Several recent cases in other parts of the world, however, illustrate how little is known about H5N1 in marine mammals. By the end of 2022, the variant was circulating widely in South America but especially in Peru, where the death toll of wild birds eventually reached 50,000, according to some researchers. Then, from January through February of this year, more than 3,000 sea lions fell sick and died. On Isla San Gallán alone, 1,112 individuals, many of them pregnant females, perished. Many of the sea lions necropsied tested positive for H5N1. Because of the high number of deaths in such a short time, and with studies suggesting the virus had spread between minks in Spain, researchers concluded, “we cannot rule out that the virus has adapted to mammals and that sea lion-sea lion transmission has begun in Peru.” Puryear says that there are most likely two explanations for these outbreaks in such high concentrations of marine mammals. The first is that there’s a very low “species barrier” between birds and seals, and that with such a large number of infected wild birds at the moment, there is “lots of virus being shed and available for large numbers of unique parallel infections.” The second explanation, she says, is that there is “at least some degree of transmission occurring between the mammals themselves, as described with the mink.” The first known case of avian influenza in a cetacean was found in a dead bottlenose dolphin in Florida last March. Such an escalation in H5N1’s virality in mammals would mark a frightening new chapter in the evolution of avian influenza, and scientists like Hill and Fauquier reiterate that the evidence still isn’t there. Hill has since reviewed the H5N1 sequences taken from some of the Peruvian sea lion tissue samples. “When we look at the genetics of the virus, it’s not telling us that we have achieved mammal to mammal transmission yet,” she said in the April briefing with reporters. Nevertheless, she added, “All eyes are on the Peru and other South America outbreaks that are going on right now.” A similar mass mortality event seems to have occurred near Dagestan, Russia in December. Though little is known yet about the outbreak, reports from Russian media indicate that about 700 Caspian seals died that month, according to the infectious disease blog Avian Flu Diary. One blog post included a press release by Dagestan State University that confirmed that some of the seals had tested positive for “avian influenza.” Though it was too early to conclude that the virus caused the die-off, Alimurad Gadzhiev, the director of the university’s Institute of Ecology and Sustainable Development, noted that H5N1 had been responsible for a mass wild bird die-off on a nearby island in early summer. Because of past avian influenza infections documented in seals and sea lions, these recent die-offs are not unexpected, considering how contagious and virulent H5N1 is. Recent reports of cetacean infections, however, are troubling. The first known case was detected in a dead bottlenose dolphin found in Florida last March. Then a harbor porpoise in Sweden tested positive in June. This past February, two dolphins in the United Kingdom died of the virus. A worker with Marine Mammals of Maine tends to a seal. Marine Mammals of Maine For now, Fauquier says, the sporadic, one-off nature of these dolphin strandings shows that the virus is still not that effective in spreading between cetaceans. “We have tested dolphins and whales on and off for influenza in general, and I don’t know if I’ve ever had a positive for low path ever,” she says. “It’s just not a very common thing.” It’s also reassuring, Fauquier adds, that there have not been any positive H5N1 infections in Maine seals so far this year. If no new cases emerge during this year’s pupping season, which is underway, Fauquier and her colleagues at the National Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program recommend closing the unusual mortality event (UME) declaration, which would stop active investigation by the program’s working group, as well as some federal funding. But, Fauquier says, “we’ll continue to monitor even if the UME closes, because we want to make sure that, if it becomes seal-to-seal, we’ll know that right away.” MORE ON YALE E360 Before the next pandemic, an ambitious push to catalog viruses in wildlife. Read more. If H5N1 resurfaces in the Gulf of Maine this spring, Doughty will likely handle the first infected seal. The outbreaks of the past have taught her to expect the unexpected and to react quickly when her instincts tell her something serious is on the horizon. “Because birds don’t stop flying their migrations, and seals don’t stop swimming in the Gulf of Maine and through the Northwest Atlantic,” Doughty says. “We need to be on alert every year now — what may be the next new strain?” Facebook Twitter Email Andrew S.

"Or those that have underlying immunosuppression or preexisting conditions that are respiratory or cardiac heart related in nature," Mickelson said.The tricky part is puppies often need exposure to other dogs."Here in particular, that's where we're really focusing our vaccine efforts around those really young that are in puppy classes or training classes as well," Mickelson said.

Video Ad Feedback This is what an ethical and eco-sustainable farm with 6,000 chickens looks like 02:36 - Source: CNN CNN — The United States is facing what some experts are calling “a new era for bird flu.” Since January 2022, the country has been battling the biggest outbreak yet of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wildlife. The virus is a major threat to commercial and backyard flocks, and it has started to show up in hundreds of mammals, including a handful of pet cats. The risk to humans is low; there has been only one human case of this virus in the US since the outbreak began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and nine cases globally, mostly among people who work with birds. The CDC says there are trials underway of vaccines that could be used to protect humans in case the virus changes and becomes more of a threat. Separately, the US Department of Agriculture, the US National Poultry Research Center and labs at a handful of American universities have been experimenting with vaccine candidates to be used in birds. The USDA’s Agriculture Research Service started trials of four vaccine candidates for animals in April and expects to have initial data on a single-dose vaccine available this month. A two-dose vaccine challenge study – in which animals are exposed to the virus to see how well the vaccine works – should produce results in June. A sign at the entrance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is seen, Tuesday, April 19, 2022, in Atlanta. A decision by a federal judge in Florida to throw out a national mask mandate for public transportation across the U.S. created a confusing patchwork of rules for passengers. The CDC recently extended the mandate, but the court decision put the mandate on hold. Ron Harris/AP CDC confirms case of bird flu in Colorado man but says the public health risk assessment remains low If the animal vaccines look to be protective, the USDA’s next step would be to work with manufacturers on whether it would be feasible to use them. One manufacturer, Zoetis, announced April 5 the development of a vaccine geared toward currently circulating virus strains. The company says it would take about a year to get to the distribution stage in the US. Vaccines are already available in other countries, including China, Egypt, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and Vietnam, and some nations are vaccinating their commercial flocks. However, in the United States, not all poultry experts are ready to use a vaccine, even if one becomes available – at least, not yet. Instead, their focus remains on eradicating the virus. Eradication and vaccination As of April 26, the CDC says, nearly 58.8 million poultry have been affected by avian flu since January 2022. The virus has been detected in at least 6,737 wild birds, and the number is likely to be much higher. There have been poultry outbreaks in 47 states. Although this is the worst outbreak in history, improved biosecurity measures have vastly reduced the number of cases in the commercial sector, according to the USDA. When the outbreak began in early 2022, there were 51 detections among commercial poultry. In March 2023, there were only seven.

FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images Bird flu isn't a direct threat to humans yet, experts say, but they're keeping a close eye on the virus The USDA says close surveillance work among its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and state and industry partners led to the reduction in cases. Generally, there ares two ways of confronting this kind of highly infectious disease in poultry, according to Rodrigo Gallardo, a professor in poultry medicine and a specialist in avian virology at the University of California, Davis. “One of them is through vaccination action. And then the other one is through eradication,” he said. In the United States, the latter is the approach for now, Gallardo said. If farmers detect even a single case in a flock, they will put down the birds right away. “The virus keeps replicating and amplifying if the birds are alive, so the only way of stopping the replication and limiting the dissemination is by depopulation,” Gallardo said. Tom Super, the senior vice president for communications for the National Chicken Council, the national trade association for the US broiler chicken industry, said in an email to CNN that although it supports the ongoing discussions about a vaccination program, “currently we support the eradication policy of APHIS and believe that right now this is the best approach at eliminating [bird flu] in the U.S.” The US Poultry and Egg Association said it’s “certainly a topic of discussion,” but the organization doesn’t have a position on implementing a vaccination program. Complications of vaccinations A vaccination program comes with several complications, Gallardo said. Vaccinated birds would be protected, but with this highly infectious disease, they still could shed some virus that could infect unprotected birds. “So vaccination, in that case, creates amplification if it is not done right,” Gallardo said. Plus, it’s difficult to detect the disease in vaccinated birds. Birds that are vaccinated don’t always show signs if they’re sick, so it would be hard to know what birds to keep separate from the others. Tests also have a hard time telling the difference between antibodies generated by vaccination and antibodies from an infection.

Sebastian Castaneda/Reuters Explosion of sea lion deaths in Peru amid deadly bird flu outbreak “If you’re not able to diagnose it, it might spread more than what it would do if you are able to diagnose it and eradicate it,” Gallardo said. Countries that have chosen the vaccination route see more endemic strains develop, meaning the virus is never really totally wiped out. “This is a very variable virus, and if you don’t update the vaccine that you’re applying to meet the change in the virus, then you won’t be able to completely protect the birds. Partial protection means more birds will be spreading the virus,” Gallardo said. A vaccine has never been used against highly pathogenic avian influenza in the US, according to the USDA. The agency created a vaccine after an outbreak in 2014 and 2015, but that involved a different strain, so it wouldn’t work on the latest version of the virus. The logistics of a vaccine like this are difficult, said Dr. Yuko Sato, an associate professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University. “You have to make sure that the new vaccine will protect against this current virus and hope that it doesn’t mutate or change so that the vaccine will continue to be protective,” Sato said. “The vaccine is not a silver bullet. This is not going to prevent infection of the birds, so in order to have an exit strategy as the country, you would have to make sure that if you vaccinate, if you still have positive birds, you have to be able to make sure that you could stamp out the virus. Otherwise, we’ll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.” Vaccines may threaten bird businesses Another concern: Birds are a big business in the US. Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Grizzly bears test positive for bird flu in Montana, officials say The US has the largest poultry industry in the world, with 294,000 poultry farms. The market size for chicken and turkey meat production alone for 2023 is projected to generate $57.8 billion, according to market analysis firm IbisWorld. Bird flu has hurt business in the US, but it could do so in a bigger way if the nation vaccinates poultry, according to the National Chicken Council. “The National Chicken Council does not support the use of a vaccine for [bird flu] for a variety of reasons – the primary one being trade. Most countries, including the US, do not recognize countries that vaccinate as free of [bird flu] due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the disease. Therefore, they do not accept exports from countries that do vaccinate,” Super wrote in his email. The US broiler industry is the second largest exporter of chicken in the world. It exports about 18% of the chicken meat produced in the United States, valued at more than $5 billion annually. “If we start vaccinating for [bird flu] in the U.S., the broiler industry will lose our ability to export which will have a significant impact on the industry – while costing billions and billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every year,” Super said.

With the way the disease is spreading, scientists would also probably have to vaccinate wildlife – which is nearly impossible. Of the birds affected in this outbreak, about 76% are commercial egg-laying hens, 17% are turkeys, and only 5% are broilers, the chickens used for meat, Super said. The rest of the cases have been among ducks, backyard chickens and game birds. “So the U.S. poultry sector that least needs a vaccine would have the most to risk from using one,” he said.

They included monitoring, reporting and research to assess impacts, learn about the disease and help with recovery; regulating human access to bird colonies to prevent disturbance; removing and disposing of dead birds; rescuing and euthanising wildlife; vaccinating captive-bred colonies of threatened species and developing local responses for specific bird colonies. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The risk of the virus arriving in Australia has been considered low because there are no duck species – one of the main movers of the virus – migrating to Australia.But experts have warned the risk the virus will arrive is increasing and that this would most likely occur through migratory shorebirds, which are also hosts for the virus.Every spring 8m shorebirds fly to Australia along the east Asia/Australasia flyway.Booth said Australia had invested millions of dollars preparing for the arrival of livestock diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, African swine fever in pigs and avian influenza in poultry.She said there had not been a similar level of preparation for major wildlife diseases and this was “a major gap in Australian biosecurity”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Pennsylvania, roughly 4 million chickens on seven egg farms were lost because of avian influenza. The disease hit four egg farms in Maryland and accounted for most of the state’s losses.Layer losses have generally been rising nationally over the past 10 years. Numbers peaked during the avian influenza outbreak in 2015 and COVID-19 market disruptions in 2020.Last year’s losses were one-third higher than in 2015, when 50 million chickens and turkeys were lost to avian influenza. More than 58 million birds have been lost in the current outbreak since February 2022.During an avian influenza outbreak, some birds die directly from the disease. But many of the losses are from the depopulation of infected farms, which is intended to prevent the disease from spreading to other farms.Chicken, egg and turkey production all declined last year. Broilers — which saw smaller bird losses from avian influenza than other poultry sectors did — increased production, according to USDA.The value of poultry products grew sharply thanks to inflation and reduced supply.Avian influenza continues to threaten poultry of all kinds.

The virus originally spawned from the bird flu and has stabilized within canines, although there’s still no jump to humans. Continued adaptation in mammals could mean an eventual threat to humans.The so-called dog flu may be moving ever closer to infecting humans, according to a new Chinese study.The H3N2 avian influenza virus—highly contagious and lethal in the bird population—successfully jump to dogs around 2006. And it hasn’t gone away. Instead, according to a study published in eLife by scientists at the China Agricultural University, it is stabilizing and adapting to better recognize human-like receptors.“Our results showed that canines may serve as intermediates for the adaption of avian influenza viruses to humans,” the study says. For a human population that “lacks immunity” to the canine version of the virus, that’s cause for concern, the study warns.The bird flu spreads quickly in avian populations, but without the ability to effectively infect mammals, the concern over human-to-human transmission has as yet remained relatively low. While it is still a risk for humans that encounter the avian flu, the receptor molecule infected by the virus doesn’t pass the virus to other humans beyond the initial infection. That could all change with a successful adaption of the virus into a mammal, especially if that mammal is showing additional adaptation toward human transmission.Related StoryDeadly Bird Flu Could Soon Evolve to Kill Humans“The changes in the canine virus apparently are making it better adapted to transmit within mammals, as you might expect after such a long period in dogs,” James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, told The Telegraph. “The virus does not seem to pose particularly worrying health threats to dogs.” But Wood adds that, even though it may be good news that the virus has not yet hopped from dogs to other mammals, it might also mean that the virus just hasn’t hit on the right mutation yet. ”One might be more concerned about the longer-term pandemic potential in other species, such as humans.”The study tested 4,000 sick dogs and found that one in 20 had the H3N2 virus, although it was a version of the virus that had mutated to better match the genome sequence of a human virus.Ian Jones, University of Reading professor of virology, tells The Telegraph that the adaption into a more mammal-like virus is natural because of the time it has spent in the canine population. “At the moment,” he says, “I judge this data warrants attention but that the case for a threat is not clear.”The study calls for continuous surveillance and risk assessments related to the canine flu, citing no pre-existing human immunity. Jones, though, says humans may offer up some defenses against the virus. And Wood notes that even as the dog flu numbers increase, albeit slowly, there’s no case of a human infected with the dog flu.Just where the bird flu-turned-dog flu may go next isn’t a sure thing, but scientists will be watching.Tim NewcombJournalistTim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

Avian flu could change that A California condor takes flight over the Ventana Wilderness, near Big Sur, in this 2017 photo. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) By Louis SahagúnStaff Writer May 5, 2023 5 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print Famed for its bald, leathery visage and astonishing wingspan, the federally endangered California condor symbolizes both a species on the brink of extinction and a thundering success story for conservationists.Just 22 condors existed when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began a captive breeding effort in the early 1980s. Today, there are 183 in California and 541 on the planet.Now, however, the majestic scavengers are facing a biological catastrophe they may not be able to overcome. Advertisement Federal wildlife officials have confirmed that an outbreak of avian influenza has killed 21 condors in Arizona and Utah since early March. That’s nearly 20% of the 116 condors that were patrolling the skies above Grand Canyon and Zion National Parks.Now, the Fish and Wildlife Service and its conservation partners are scrambling to devise emergency strategies to protect the remaining condors from contracting a virus that has already killed hundreds of millions of poultry and untold numbers of wild birds around the world, according to a recent World Economic Forum report. Climate & Environment Epic snowpack upends rhythms of life for many species in Sierra Nevada range The whiplash change from extreme drought to epic snowpack is having very different outcomes for different species throughout California.May 1, 2023 “We’re reevaluating multiple aspects of our condor recovery program to keep it moving forward,” said Ashleigh Blackford, California condor recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “But the challenge is this: How do we implement new strategies without doing more harm than good?” Advertisement Avian influenza has been around for years, but this particular strain is lethal to wild birds in a way no other strain has been, Blackford said. “It’s a puzzle we are trying to get through without triggering setbacks.”That won’t be easy. Many of the strategies under consideration are untested and conflict with programs that have made condors largely reliant on humans for safe refuges, veterinary tests, breeding programs, and food free of contamination from lead ammunition.For example, condors frequently dine at communal feeding stations stocked with roadkill deer and still-born calves donated by local dairies. But that routine may increase their risk of infection because the virus is spread through airborne transmission from infected birds and indirectly through contact with saliva, mucus or feces. Advertisement Discontinuing the use of feeding stations, however, could increase the chances of condors dying of lead poisoning from spent ammunition left in the carcasses of hunted animals such as ground squirrels and coyotes.Blackford described the situation as “a real conundrum.”Bird flu has not yet been confirmed in condor populations in California and Baja California, Mexico.There have been no new reports of sick or deceased condors since April 11, officials said. As of Thursday, two condors that tested positive for avian flu were recovering.The FWS has asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to expedite approval to vaccinate captive and free-flying condors against the highly pathogenic avian influenza known as H5N1. Climate & Environment This dirt parking lot in the San Gabriel Mountains is a magnet for migrating birds How did a dirt parking lot in the San Gabriel Mountains become a major flyway for migrating birds? Scientists can only guess.April 17, 2023 As of this week, however, animal health officials were still studying how to use a poultry vaccine on condors, including those that soar over the Sierra Nevada range.The virulent nature of H5N1 has prompted nonprofit conservation organizations to launch a series of efforts. They include preventing future exposure to the virus, caring for ailing condors, and improving biological safety procedures for staffers and field crews. Advertisement Bird flu is considered low risk as a human health concern, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the World Health Organization has described increased reports of the virus jumping to a variety of mammals, including humans, as “worrying.”The nonprofit Peregrine Fund of Boise, Idaho, which operates a captive breeding program and manages the Arizona-Utah flock, said it has halted the use of communal feeding and watering stations for the foreseeable future and is “evaluating when conditions will allow for condor releases to resume.”Separately, Kelly Sorenson, executive director of the nonprofit Ventana Wildlife Society of Monterey, Calif., said his group recently raised $85,000 to buy 10 “quarantine pens” for use in the event that California’s condor populations test positive for H5N1.“It’s sad to think,” he said, “that this horrible avian flu emerged when the California condor was on the threshold of becoming a self-sustaining, free-flying population.”If the overall population continues to grow, the vulture that scientists know as Gymnogyps californianus may be eligible for down-listing from endangered to threatened within a few decades, researchers say.Now, in a worst-case scenario, wildlife authorities might have a difficult time finding enough facilities able to take in and care for a large number of condors stricken with the virus. Advertisement The Los Angeles Zoo, which has been at the forefront of condor captive breeding efforts for three decades, said it has no plans to accept condors that have tested positive for bird flu. California Recent drought-busting storms mean misery for allergy sufferers in Southern California So far, allergy experts say, Southern California’s pollen levels are moderate for this time of the year. But the worst is yet to come.March 30, 2023 But zookeepers, it said, are required to adhere to strict biosecurity protocols, such as wearing masks and gloves and dipping their shoes and boots in disinfectant before entering a condor enclosure.The Oakland Zoo said it is prepared to accept and treat as many as 30 infected condors if necessary.“We have the only veterinary hospital in California offering to take in sick condors,” said Erin Dogan, spokeswoman for the Oakland Zoo. “Our veterinarian has been in close contact with the Fish and Wildlife Service about the Arizona condor mortalities.”On another front, the Center for Biological Diversity has asked the Fish and Wildlife Service to stop processing incidental take permits for California condors sought by prospective wind energy projects until “the effects of the bird flu are fully analyzed.”The request was prompted by a recent controversial decision by federal wildlife agencies to help wind energy companies breed condors in captivity so that they can replace birds that are killed by the massive wind converters.

Study: The Threat of Impending Pandemics: A Proactive Approach. Image Credit: blvdone/Shutterstock Background The ongoing occurrence of disastrous health-associated events, whether on a broad scale, i.e., pandemic level, or in small communities, such as periodic infectious agent outbreaks, warrants a swift, target-oriented, and well-organized team for confronting the adverse health repercussions. While ongoing recovery from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, the battle against new emerging and/or re-emerging pathogenic organisms like Mpox, novel variants of the Influenza virus, the Zika virus, the Ebola virus, and Yellow Fever (YF) virus continues. A global, focused, multisectoral, interdisciplinary, and collaborative approach is required to optimize health and prevent future pandemics. About the review In the present review, researchers highlighted pandemic-causing viruses and described proactive steps required to prevent future pandemics. Introduction to pandemics Pandemics declared as public health emergencies of international concern, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), SARS, the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) Influenza pandemic, Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, and Mpox, are dominated by zoonotic transmission or animal-to-human spillover, most of which originate from wildlife species. The conventional epidemiological triad can explain the transmissibility of pandemic-causing viruses. E.g., the triad formed by the host (human), the YF virus, and increasing breeding regions for Aedes mosquitoes, resulting from urbanization, deforestation, and an increase in global air travel, has escalated opportunities for YF virus transmission among non-endemic nations. The main causes of pandemic occurrence include the emergence of novel infectious pathogens with cross-species zoonotic transmission; longer survival among immunocompromised individuals; evolving viral variants with an increase in mutations that enhance infectivity, transmissibility, and immune-evasiveness; population emigration at a mass scale; an increase in livestock production; deforestation and expansion of cities; an increase in travel; climatic changes; and increased animal-human interactions. E.g., concerning SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs such as MERS, fauna that closely inhabits humans, such as bats and camels, function as viral reservoirs, whereas SARS-CoV-2 transmits through aerosol or droplets, more severely affecting the young, elderly, and individuals with comorbidities. Likewise, in the 2022 Mpox outbreak, an unusual surge in cases was reported in non-endemic zones, particularly among males having sexual intercourse with males (MSM). A proactive approach to pandemic preparedness The continual evolution of viruses demands an increase in contact tracing efforts and improved sequencing abilities to assess the transmission of circulating and mutating viral variants and detect unusual epidemiological events. A well-articulated and one-health approach is required to improve global pandemic preparedness. The main alarming signs of pandemics are an abrupt rise in case counts (MERS, Ebola, and Mpox) and case clusters expanding beyond endemic regions (YF, Mpox), disease occurrence beyond known species (MERS, Avian Influenza), and unrecognized clinical manifestations (microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome in Zika virus). Therefore, pandemic preparedness must focus on research on pathogens with potential, the estimation of viral spillover into humans, disease occurrence in non-endemic areas, and continual surveillance. The development of more effective, overall, targeted, and updated vaccines, an increase in vaccination coverage, adherence to standard contact precautions, and antiviral medications may aid in lowering pandemic risks. Further research must elucidate viral transmission, evolutionary characteristics, ecology, and infection pathophysiology to enhance drug development. Health authorities must increase investments and funding to increase health infrastructure and increase the availability of skilled personnel for diagnosis and testing. Travel history, vaccination status, and prior history of virus exposure are important determinants that need to be reported and assessed. Programs established for improved population health surveillance and providing global alerts include the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the Stop Mpox Outbreak mission, and the global Eliminate Yellow Fever epidemics (EYE) strategy for YF. Targeted surveillance in hotspots (regions of human mobility around wildlife and microbial biodiversity) is critical for detecting and mitigating emerging infectious diseases. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Emerging Pandemic Threats program identifies hotspot regions by experts in virology, epidemiology, informatics, veterinary medicine, and genetics across 20 nations. Systematic and periodic scanning for viral spillovers, particularly among sentinel populations like butchers, susceptible animals, vets, and wet market workers, is required. Portable, digitalized, real-time, and on-site diagnostics with short turnaround times are needed that satisfy WHO’s Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-Friendly, Rapid/Robust, Equipment-Free, and Deliverable (ASSURED) criteria. Conclusion Based on the review findings, the interplay between humans, animals, and their environments requires a multidisciplinary, collaborative, global, and proactive one-health approach for continual surveillance, hotspot identification, and increased research on viral epidemiology. In addition, digital, rapid, and accurate real-time diagnostics and the availability of effective vaccines and drugs alongside increased funding are required to improve pandemic preparedness.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In 2021, avian influenza evolved into a new form – a new and remarkably lethal variant first found in Europe. Bird flu is usually most dangerous to birds kept in close quarters, such as chicken farms. But as it spread around the world, the highly pathogenic HPAI A(H5N1) variant began killing millions and millions of wild birds too. Seabird colonies in the UK have been decimated. The virus can kill up to half of the birds it infects. It has also spread into sea lions and seals. Luckily, it doesn’t spread easily in humans. More than 50 million birds have already been culled over 37 countries in a bid to slow the spread. Australia’s birds have so far dodged this bullet. Our isolation has kept us safe for now. Antarctica’s birds have stayed safe too. But if this variant makes it here in the lungs of a migratory shorebird, our unique birds will be at extreme risk. Black swans, for instance, are especially vulnerable to all types of avian flu. The federal government will boost surveillance measures when large flocks of migratory birds begin arriving later this year. It’s unlikely to be enough, as we enter a time of high risk from September onwards. Birds and seals around the world have died from the H5N1 variant, as in this image of workers burying pelicans on a Peru beach. AAP Could it really get here? Yes. Surveillance of Australia’s vast coastlines is all but impossible. Instead, the government is likely to focus on the major wetlands and shallow inlets which attract migratory birds. Every year, around eight million birds take the East Asian-Australasian Flyway – a route stretching from the Arctic Circle down through east and south-east Asia to Australia and New Zealand. Is the H5N1 flu lethal enough to be self-limiting? Not necessarily. A bird could get a mild dose and still be infectious when it arrives. That means there’s a good chance this variant could arrive. It would only take one infectious shorebird to trigger outbreaks. If it gets here, the virus would decimate poultry farms and wild birds, just as it has overseas. In densely populated farms, it can kill 90-100% of all birds. It could pose an extinction threat to iconic birds such as black swans, which have an immune deficiency making them particularly at risk. Flocking birds like rainbow lorikeets and corellas would also be at extra risk of catching the virus. Black swans are particularly vulnerable to this virus. Mitchell Luo/Unsplash, CC BY Federal Agriculture Minister Murray Watt has dismissed the idea Australia is unprepared. He said his government had been “closely monitoring the global HPAI situation” and had boosted early warning efforts. But what we don’t have is an action plan for what happens if the virus does arrive, as seems likely. Responses like the mass destruction of beehives after the devastating varroa mite arrived are unlikely to work for a virus. A tailored vaccine could help domestic birds, but it would be all but impossible to administer to wild birds. Over time, birds with natural resistance would survive and breed populations back up. But endangered species or those particularly vulnerable would find it much harder to bounce back. Read more: Australia's iconic black swans have a worrying immune system deficiency, new genome study finds Haven’t our birds survived bird flu before? Yes, but not quite like this one. In 2020, three egg producers in Victoria had an outbreak of another highly pathogenic influenza variant, H7N7. To stop it spreading, authorities culled all birds in the farms. This variant emerged when low pathogenic viruses carried by local wild birds evolved into a deadlier form. While authorities stopped its spread on poultry farms, they could do nothing about the wild reservoir of the virus. Bar-tailed godwits travel thousands of kilometres to get to Australia and New Zealand. One could be carrying the virus. AP If H7N7 is still around, it could pose even more problems. When two different influenza virus subtypes infect the same host cell, their genetic material can mix to create a new virus, which could be milder – or more severe. Australian scientists have researched the impact of low pathogenic avian influenza on many bird families, which gives some insight into how highly pathogenic avian influenza may spread in Australia. For instance, arid areas would likely be better protected from the virus, which does not like dry conditions. But can we act in time? We know what to do when there’s an outbreak in domesticated birds. But if the virus gets into wild birds and takes off, we have no plan. Rapid monitoring and surveillance of wildlife pathogens is a major gap in Australia’s biosecurity framework – and one we should fill. We must prepare COVID from bats or raccoon dogs. Ebola from bats. Avian flu from birds. As we back nature into a corner, we can find ourselves more exposed to the viruses wild animals carry. So far, the HPAI H5N1 strain is only known to have jumped into humans a handful of times. That’s lucky. Around 800 people have contracted one of the variants of bird flu since 2003. Of these, more than half died. That’s a similar death rate to many of the birds dying of the avian flu elsewhere in the world. The main protection we have at present is the fact avian flu finds it hard to infect us in the first place. To save our birds – and potentially, ourselves – we need a better way to detect and track viral outbreaks in wildlife, particularly those which could jump across into humans.

A melanoma study just looked at a vaccine in combination with immunomodulatory therapies that looked amazing. We may have to expand our scope beyond infectious diseases with vaccines. This technology, especially the mRNA technology, has amazing potential. But from an infectious disease standpoint, we’re starting to see the arrival of some things that I’d most like to see. A couple of years ago, before things were in phase 3, if you’d asked me what I wanted to see, RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and CMV [cytomegalovirus] would have been at the top of that list.In fact, in March, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of 2 RSV vaccines. This is a huge step forward in the vaccine space and the infectious disease space. We know that RSV is a significant player in small children, but what a lot of folks don’t recognize is that this is a big deal in adults, especially adults over age 60. RSV vaccines for adults, especially over age 60, are going to take some big-time education [and require] a change in mindset. This needs to be 1 of the spaces where we think about how to best reach otherwise healthy 60-year-olds, to convince them or have an infrastructure in place to ensure that they get this vaccine. With RSV, you’re seeing a lot of movement with a couple of vaccines that probably will be approved in the next 3 to 6 months.CMV vaccines are starting to creep up through phase 3, which is extremely exciting. From a hematologic-malignancy standpoint, we see a lot of problems due to CMV. I’d very much welcome a vaccine in that space. It would be a huge help for patients with hematologic-malignancies and other cancers. It would be very welcome.The other thing that’s very exciting is this continued drumbeat, which you’ve seen in the literature, around a pan-influenza vaccine. We have to come back for our seasonal [vaccine] every year because the viruses change every year. Are there things that we could do to not have to worry as much about what the influenza virus is doing as far as changes go? There have been some exciting developments in this space. The New England Journal of Medicine published an implications of a basic science paper about the evolution of mRNA technologies in the flu vaccine and the ability to create a 20-valent flu vaccine, which is very cool looking. It works well in animals, which is really exciting.There’s also been a lot of work developing flu vaccines that don’t go after the hemagglutinin, which changes every year, but [instead] go after the stock of the virus of influenza, that doesn’t change and is highly conserved. There has been a lot of cool evolution in that space because the influenza vaccines, while good, aren’t good enough. Many times patients have said to me, “I hear it doesn’t work,” or, “I hear it’s only 50% effective this year”—excuse after excuse about why not to get it. We need to do better in the influenza space, and we can. I’m cautiously optimistic that some of these developments that we’re seeing in the literature will bear fruit in yielding much better influenza vaccines.Transcript edited for clarity.Recent VideosRelated Content New Chronic GVHD Treatments Show Promise, but Long-Term Outcomes Are Not Well UnderstoodLaura Joszt, MAOctober 28th 2024ArticleA single-center retrospective study found the approval and use of new agents to treat chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is associated with quality-of-life improvements.Read MoreGVHD Cannot Be Wholly Prevented, so Effective Treatments Are Needed, Says Dr. Daniel WolffLaura Joszt, MAOctober 18th 2024ArticleChronic and acute graft-versus-host disease are managed differently, affect different organs, and impact patients in different ways.Read MoreEvolving Role of Statins in Managing CV Risk in HIV | ID Week 2024Peter Wehrwein, Managing Editor;Laura Joszt, MAOctober 18th 2024ArticleStatins have had an evolving role in the management of cardiovascular risk in people living with HIV, explained Michelle Cespedes, M.D., M.S., professor of medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Mount Sinai Health System.Read MorePulmonary Hypertension Diagnosis on Top of ILD Subsequently Increases Healthcare Use, CostsLaura Joszt, MAJuly 23rd 2024ArticleFor patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), a subsequent diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension substantially increases utilization of healthcare resources as well as costs.Read MoreInvestment in Vaccine Development is Low.

But how would our lives change if they were to suddenly disappear from our backyards?Experts are warning if a highly pathogenic form of avian influenza reaches our shores the consequences could be dire, with some species driven to extinction.Internationally, the HPAI H5 mutation has killed millions of birds and infected hundreds of species and Australia and Antarctica remain the only continents to remain free of the virus. While authorities have eradicated outbreaks of the disease in domestic poultry eight times, the Invasive Species Council is warning the country is ill-prepared to cope if it spreads to wild birds.Australia's suburbs would be dramatically changed if native birds became infected with avian influenza. Source: Getty (File)Biosecurity expert Dr Carol Booth told Yahoo News Australia that while she expected some deficiencies in the plan, she was surprised at the country’s lack of preparedness. "I was rather shocked," she said.Australia’s Department of Agriculture (DAFF) responded to her concerns, advising it has a nationally agreed framework to tackle the disease, but Dr Booth remains concerned that its focus is on livestock species like chickens and turkeys. “I had assumed that the poultry plan probably also focused on wildlife. It certainly mentions wildlife, but it’s not a plan for what to do if it infects wildlife,” she alleges.What would happen if bird flu infected Australia’s wild birds?Sea and shorebirds would likely be first impacted.The disease could spread quickly among flocking birds.Falcons and other predators could become ill from eating the sick and dead.Based on its spread overseas, avian influenza would most likely spread to Australia via shorebirds which migrate to our shores in the spring.HPAI H5 has caused tens of thousands of localised outbreaks — it decimated flocks of birds on the Farne Islands in the UK in July last year. While the disease started in birds it has also infected badgers, foxes, bears, cats, pigs, dolphins, minks and seals. It also killed thousands of sea lions along Peru’s coast this year.Australia's native bird species would likely be highly susceptible to avian influenza and die in great numbers. Source: Getty (File)Because the disease has never become endemic in Australia’s native birds, Dr Booth said it’s hard to predict how it will respond.“Australian species are likely to be highly susceptible because they're immunologically naive,” she said. “You have descriptions overseas of seabird colonies overseas where the ground is littered with dead bodies of adults and chicks — three-quarters of the colony are dead because of the very rapid and deadly spread.”How did Australia eradicate bird flu in poultry?The first avian influenza outbreak occurred in Australia in 1976, and the most recent outbreak was in 2020. It affected three egg farms, two turkey farms and an emu farm.Australia, like most overseas nations, combats the spread of the virus with quarantine, culling and disposal of the birds.Read more news about birds here:How your friends can avoid being swooped by smart magpiesFears as mystery illness kills masses of birds and mammals'Scary' new bird disease linked to plastic consumption100 dead ducks dumped in front of Premier Dan Andrews' officeFast bird flu facts:Bird flu killed an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia this year.The current outbreak is the largest in history.Over 140 million farmed birds have been killed to prevent its spread.There are concerns it could drive multiple species of birds overseas into extinction.What's next in stopping the spread?DAFF told Yahoo News its nationally-agreed-upon approach to combatting disease outbreaks was updated in 2022 and its wild animal response is currently under review. As variants of avian influenza have killed humans, DAFF says it recognises the connection between animal, environment and human health.“Prevention and response strategies for wild birds in Australia will also be informed by risk assessment work currently being undertaken by Wildlife Health Australia, and by ongoing consultations with key stakeholders and networks, as well as lessons learned from wild bird outbreaks elsewhere in the world,” a spokesperson said.While the Invasive Species Council has secured a meeting with the government next week to discuss the issue, Dr Booth clarified there have been no guarantees that it will heed their warning about the threat.She argues Australia faces a problem of “insufficient resources” for its biosecurity system, putting it under “great strain”. Therefore she believes the focus has been on agricultural diseases including foot and mouth disease, African swine fever, lumpy skin disease and varroa mite.Historically, eight Australian species are presumed extinct because of disease. If Australia's government plans to keep its promise of no more under its watch then Dr Booth believes it will need to strengthen its focus on avian influenza's potential impact on wildlife.Do you have a story tip?

Conservationists are warning that it could mean the extinction of some seabird species, as breeding colonies have been particularly badly hit.The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) estimates that “many more than 20,000” wild birds have died in the UK since the current outbreak began in October 2021. However, the Guardian has studied data from devolved governments and nature organisations that shows the actual figure is at least 50,000 between October 2021 until the start of April 2023.Experts say this number is still likely to be a gross underestimate as there is no national monitoring and most carcasses are never found and not counted.Already this year, there are reports that black-headed gulls, which start nesting in early April – before most other seabirds - have been badly hit across the country. According to the RSPB, 1,200 birds have died on their nature reserves in total in 2023, the vast majority of which are black-headed gulls, and there have been early reports of fatalities coming in from Europe.Conservationists at the Wildlife Trust said they had “never seen mortality this high before” at Yorkshire’s largest black-headed gull colony at North Cave Wetlands nature reserve, where 10% of the 2,000 breeding pairs of black-headed gulls have died. However, there are signs they could be over the worst of it.David Craven, regional manager at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, said: “After an initial spread through the colony, which saw a very rapid rise to 10% mortality, we are now seeing a slowing in the numbers of dead and dying birds, which leads us to hope that this means the disease within the colony is burning itself out.”NatureScot said it had not yet received any reports of mass mortalities among wild birds this year.The Guardian figures show that more than 36,000 birds have died from avian flu in Scotland, with seabirds and waterbirds the worst hit. At least 13,000 Svalbard barnacle geese died in the winter of 2021-22 – a third of the total population.In England, 7,300 deaths were recorded in total, which is divided between two sites off the Northumberland coast – the Farne Islands (an estimated 6,000 deaths) and Coquet Island (1,300 deaths estimated), where rare birds such as arctic terns, black-headed gulls and common terns were among those most affected.map showing locations of major bird flu deaths in UK and bar chart showing numbers Reports from Wales came from a single Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) site – Grassholm, west of Pembrokeshire – where an estimated 5,000 northern gannets died. The UK is home to 60% of the planet’s northern gannets, with the population likely to be affected for decades as they are a long-lived species that is slow to reproduce.“This is the first collation of deaths in all species since the first signs of high mortality in autumn-winter 2021,” said Dr Helen Baker, from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), a public body that advises the UK government. “It shows both the full extent of spread of the disease across the UK and also that the minimum estimate of losses is higher than early figures.”The data collected by the Guardian focused on major seabird and waterbird breeding and wintering grounds, whereas other species, such as raptors, are more likely to die alone, so it is harder to know the full impact of the disease.The government publishes data on positive tests for avian flu in wild bird carcasses but does not estimate how many birds have died. The data for England and Wales shows there were 1,600 positive tests between October 2021 to March 2023.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “We are tackling this outbreak – which poses a significant threat to the UK’s wild bird populations – using the very latest scientific evidence and international best practice.”Separately, Northern Ireland has counted 550 deaths during this outbreak.Prof James Pearce Higgins, director of science at the BTO, said: “These updated estimates underline the magnitude of impact that avian influenza has had on wild bird populations, particularly the UK’s internationally important seabird populations.“Ongoing surveys and monitoring at seabird colonies this summer will help us quantify these impacts further, as many infected birds are likely to have died undetected,” he added.In the UK, more than 60 species have been affected by bird flu. Claire Smith, RSPB senior policy officer, described the Guardian’s figures as an “underestimate” and said: “Sadly, we are not surprised by these figures and it reflects what we saw across our nature reserves last year and what we are seeing worldwide.View image in fullscreenTen mute swans were killed by avian flu at Berrington Hall, an SSSI in Herefordshire, last December. Photograph: Will Watsonaturepl.com“It is difficult to get absolute numbers for several reasons, including the remoteness of sites, that birds will fall off into the sea and the fact that bird flu monitoring was not well set up for wild birds last year.”She added: “The outbreak continues this spring as we are seeing positive tests and high numbers of deaths of black-headed gulls in colonies across the Midlands and eastern England. We also have concerns about many raptor species.”The National Trust, which owns the Farne Islands, is already bracing itself for thousands of deaths again this breeding season as seabirds return. Already, three new positive cases of bird flu have been detected on the islands and they have been closed to visitors.Farne Islands shut to visitors over fears of new avian flu outbreakRead moreBaker said the BTO and JNCC were working towards a fuller assessment of all data for individual species. She added: “Although this estimate might be slightly higher [than the Guardian figures], it will still be a minimum and it will not be possible to assess the impact for most species until after new counts of nesting birds in seabird colonies are completed over the coming summer.”Since this latest outbreak of avian flu in 2021, 8.3 million poultry birds died or have been culled in the UK, according to Defra. In total, 20 million birds are slaughtered every week for human consumption.Explore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionBird fluAnimalsWildlifeInfectious diseasesVeterinary medicineVeterinary sciencenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Marcus Garvey Academy in Detroit will reopen Monday after an outbreak of illnesses at the school. WDIV CNN — After a spate of student illnesses prompted the temporary closure of a Detroit school, the district says two students were diagnosed with the bacterial illness Haemophilus influenzae. Two students at Marcus Garvey Academy were diagnosed with H. flu, Chrystal Wilson, assistant superintendent of communications with the Detroit Public Schools Community District, said Friday. Last year, the number of brain abscesses in children in and around Las Vegas, Nevada, rose from the expected four or five to 17. BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Doctors watching for more cases after mysterious cluster of brain infections strikes kids in southern Nevada The pre-K through eighth-grade school closed this week after “a number of students” in the lower grades became ill. Wilson said that fewer than 25 of the school’s 310 students were sick. The school will reopen Monday, she said. Earlier this week, she said, the school “experienced an unusually high rate of flu-like symptoms including student fevers, and vomiting, namely at the early grade levels.” The closure also followed the death last week of a kindergartener who attended Marcus Garvey Academy, the school district said in a statement. The student’s cause of death is pending, the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office said Friday. “The student came to school with flu-like symptoms,” Wilson said.

(Stafford County Public Schools) Stafford County Public Schools A Virginia high school will stay open while hundreds of students call out sick with flu-like symptoms Haemophilus influenzae, or H. flu, is a disease caused by bacteria that can lead to illnesses such as ear infections and bronchitis or more serious bloodstream infections, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. It is not the same as illness caused by influenza viruses. “These bacteria live in people’s nose and throat, and usually cause no harm. However, the bacteria can sometimes move to other parts of the body and cause infection,” the CDC says. The bacteria spreads through airborne particles and typically infects children under 5 or adults 65 and up. Vaccines for Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) are recommended for children starting at 2 months old, according to the CDC, but they do not protect against other types of H. flu.

The Detroit Health Department said in a statement Wednesday that it is working with the school district to monitor the illnesses and reminded the public that vaccines are available. “The Detroit Health Department offers vaccinations to children and adults to protect against many childhood diseases,” it said. “Vaccinations are also available at pediatric centers and primary care providers.” CNN’s Tanika Gray contributed to this report.

Photograph: Jude LaneResearchers took blood samples from 18 apparently healthy adult gannets with both normal and black irises. The samples were tested for bird flu antibodies to determine whether the birds had been infected previously. Eight tested positive, of which seven had black irises.Dr Jude Lane, a conservation scientist for the RSPB and lead author of the study, said the “fascinating” discovery that gannets that had survived avian flu infection no longer had the usual iris coloration could prove a useful non-invasive diagnostic tool.“The next steps are to understand its efficacy, if it applies to any other species and whether there are any detrimental impacts to the birds’ vision,” she said. “Ophthalmology exams will also be needed to determine what is causing the black coloration.”‘We feel more prepared’: Farne Island faces another season battling avian fluRead moreHigh numbers of dead gannets were first spotted in Iceland in April last year. By the end of June, bird flu outbreaks had occurred in five Canadian colonies and in the Channel Islands. Outbreaks in 12 British and Irish colonies followed in a clockwise pattern with the last infected colonies recorded in September. Unusually high mortality was recorded at all but one of the 41 monitored colonies (75% of the 53 North Atlantic colonies of gannets).On the Bass, the researchers calculated that survival rates of adult birds between 2021 and 2022 was 42% lower than the preceding 10-year average. The full extent of how many birds died during that period will not be confirmed until the birds return this breeding season.The Farne Islands, a popular archipelago of seabird breeding islands off the Northumberland coast, are closed to visitors because of new outbreaks of avian flu this spring.The study was a collaboration between the RSPB, the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University and the Animal Plant Health Agency, in partnership with the Scottish Seabird Centre. The headline of this article was amended on 4 May 2023. The surviving gannets’ irises turn from blue to black, not black to blue as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsBirdsRSPBBird fluWildlifeAnimalsBiologyMedical researchnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyParrots missing from London zoo found behind Cambridgeshire garden28 Oct 2024Safe sex for seagulls?

Check details here Should you get the flu vaccine? Check details here With rising cases of Covid-like fever, know who should get extra protection with influenza shots. Written by Shubhangi Shah April 30, 2023 01:15 IST Follow Us CEPI will provide up to $3.6 million to support the optimisation of the saRNA-platform technology, the production process, and yield. Flu shots are common in western countries like the US, where people get vaccinated against seasonal influenza for short-term protection. And, given the rising number of Covid as well as influenza cases, Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, advises who is a suitable candidate for these shots. He says, “It is important to consult with your doctor before deciding to take the flu vaccine, but the flu vaccine is generally recommended for people who are at higher risk of developing severe complications from the flu, such as young children, elderly individuals, pregnant women, and people with underlying health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. For individuals who have a strong immunity system and they decide not to take the flu vaccine, it is important that they continue practising good hygiene techniques like washing your hands, staying home if feeling sick, eating healthy foods and taking vitamins during this season.” Do these seasonal vaccines protect from all virus causing influenza? Seasonal influenza vaccines are designed to provide protection against the most common strains of influenza viruses that are expected to circulate during a particular flu season. The World Health Organization (WHO) makes recommendations each year about which influenza strains should be included in the seasonal vaccine.Also Read One-third Indians with obesity fail to recognise their condition, widespread misconception leading to delayed treatment Myth vs Fact: Can cough syrup help you get pregnant?

Doctors explain Also read: ED searches Byju Raveendran’s house, office; Here’s a look at his Rs 25,000 crore net worth, lifestyle, family, salary & more However, the seasonal influenza vaccine may not provide complete protection against all strains of influenza virus. In some cases, the vaccine may be less effective against certain strains of the virus that are not included in the vaccine. Additionally, the effectiveness of the vaccine can vary depending on factors such as the age and health status of the individual receiving the vaccine, as well as the match between the vaccine strains and the strains that are actually circulating in the community. Despite these limitations, getting a seasonal influenza vaccine is still recommended by public health authorities as the best way to reduce the risk of getting the flu and its associated complications. Are there any immunity boosting treatments people should opt for? Each person immune system is different therefore different techniques work different for each person’s immune system, but here are a few general tips one should follow to keep immunity levels high: * Eat a balanced and nutritious diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. * Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. * Get enough sleep and prioritise good sleep habits. * Manage stress through meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises. * Engage in regular physical activity and exercise. * Practice good hygiene by washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and keeping your living spaces clean and sanitised. * Remember, there is no magic bullet for boosting immunity. It’s important to focus on overall health and wellness habits to support your immune system.

How to avoid social spreading and what is the time period one should avoid other people, like till they have fever or subsiding of all symptoms? There are some key differences between the two illnesses that can help healthcare professionals distinguish between them. To avoid spreading either illness, it is important to practice good respiratory hygiene, including covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze. You should also wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. You should avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are feeling unwell. If you have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or the flu, it is recommended that you isolate yourself for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms, or until you have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication, and other symptoms have improved. It is important to note that the duration of isolation or quarantine may vary depending on individual circumstances, such as severity of illness or exposure to someone with the virus. It is best to follow the guidance of your healthcare provider or public health officials.

A man gets vaccinated. (Photo: iStock/Pornpak Khunatorn) Sabrina Ng Jalelah Abu Baker @JalelahCNA Sabrina Ng & Jalelah Abu Baker 06 May 2023 06:09PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: It was a regular day in Ms Alina Boey's life when she suddenly realised she had dropped a dress size, without any changes to her lifestyle. She had lost almost 7kg and that made alarm bells ring in her head. It prompted her to go for a thorough medical check-up, and while her bloodwork turned out regular, a further scan showed that her right lung was inflamed. It took multiple hospital trips and tests before she was eventually diagnosed as having pneumonia, a lung inflammation that most often follows bacterial or viral respiratory infections. But that was only the start of her medical issues. Ms Boey developed various skin conditions such as hives, while another pre-existing condition - eczema - also flared up. Her doctor said these could be linked to immunity issues triggered by her pneumonia, she told CNA. As she continues to battle her health issues, doctor visits are “exhausting”, Ms Boey said. “In terms of quality of life, it's not easy, I think mentally, especially." THE EFFECTS OF PNEUMONIA While Ms Boey’s conditions are not life-threatening, for others like her who are not vaccinated against pneumonia, more severe issues could arise. This includes heart attacks for those who have underlying heart diseases. “Sometimes patients do not know that they have underlying heart diseases such as coronary artery disease or blockages,” said Dr William Kristanto, cardiologist at The Cardiac Centre in Farrer Park Hospital. “What happens is that when they get admitted for pneumonia, this pneumonia triggers a cascade of inflammatory response that then triggers off the heart blockage condition, causing heart attacks.” Dr Kristanto said the majority of patients admitted for pneumonia are those who have compromised immune systems or are above the age of 65. Dr Julio Ramirez, chief research scientist at Norton Infectious Diseases Institute said his centre’s research in the last couple of years has shown that while a “significant number” of patients hospitalised for pneumonia get discharged and go home, their health may not be as good as before. “They never go back to baseline or there are other medical problems that emerge after pneumonia,” said Dr Ramirez from Norton Healthcare in Louisville, Kentucky. “This is why at this moment, the best way to consider pneumonia is that (it) is not just a lung problem. It is a systemic problem (that) affects the lungs affects the heart, the liver, the kidney.” He added that pneumonia may not be just an acute three-week illness, but one that can affect an individual for years down the road. And for seniors, getting pneumonia could mean a decrease in life expectancy. THE NEED FOR VACCINATION While they may need it the most, it is vulnerable groups like seniors who do not understand the need for vaccination against pneumonia, said Dr Kristanto. He added that some elderly patients also tend to confuse pneumonia jabs with flu jabs. They think pneumonia jabs are only needed during flu season or when one travels. “(It’s only) when I spend time explaining to them that it's not just the influenza vaccine (that’s available), but there's pneumococcal vaccination as well that they realise ‘oh, you mean there's more than one respiratory illness out there’,” he said. On the back of World Immunisation Week last week, he urged family doctors to correct such misconceptions so that patients will have a better understanding and are more likely to get vaccinated. Dr Ramirez similarly urged people to get vaccinated against pneumonia. Several viruses and bacteria can cause pneumonia, the doctors said. According to HealthHub, frequent causes include the common cold, influenza, COVID-19 and pneumococcal disease. “Contracting one episode of pneumonia doesn't give you immunity against all the viruses or bacteria out there. So definitely, you still need to get your full protection with the various pneumonia and influenza vaccinations available,” Dr Kristanto said. He and Ms Boey called for more patient awareness and education. “The message has to be loud and clear out there that there is a need to get protected, especially in the vulnerable population,” said Dr Kristanto.

The first results of laboratory investigations have been received from the Scientific Institute for Food Safety, Animal Health and Environment "Bior", which show the presence of the avian influenza virus gene in seven out of 11 dead wild birds from the Daugavpils Esplanade pond. The PVD indicated that the isolated avian influenza virus type was H5N1. This type has also been identified in Latvia in previous years. Currently, H5N1 is the dominant type of avian influenza in other European countries. The laboratory investigation is still ongoing to determine the pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus type of avian influenza. The PVD calls on the population not to visit the area and not to touch dead birds in order not to endanger their health and prevent further spread of the disease. The PVD also asks not to allow domestic animals to access the area and not to bring sick and emaciated wild birds home, to animal shelters or veterinary clinics, as avian influenza cannot be treated. As reported earlier, there were fears that avian influenza may be present in Daugavpils after the Food and Veterinary Service (PVD) received information about a mass die-off of black-headed gulls at the Esplanade pond in Latvia's second-largest city. The PVD suspected that this could be related to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds, and tests were carried out as a matter of urgency to establish if this is indeed the case. The PVD calls on residents not to visit the mentioned territory and not to touch dead birds, in order not to endanger their health and prevent the further spread of the disease. In addition, the PVD calls on poultry keepers to observe biosecurity requirements more carefully than ever and to immediately inform their veterinarian or the PVD about illness or sudden death of poultry. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is an acute, highly contagious infectious disease of birds characterized by high mortality. Reservoirs and ponds are regarded as common distribution points of the virus for wild birds, especially waterfowl, which can develop the disease without characteristic symptoms.

(Supplied: State Library of Western Australia)abc.net.auews/victorian-nurse-diary-rare-insight-spanish-flu-perth-quarantine/102154120Link copiedShareShare articleSusie Cone hoped her service as a nurse in The Great War would take her to Europe, but it was on a sandy beach in Perth that she would make her biggest wartime contribution and find herself most exposed to death and peril.Susie, from Gippsland in Victoria, was one of a handful of nurses who volunteered to care for Australian soldiers returning from home with the deadly Spanish Flu at the Woodman Point quarantine station in Western Australia.Dozens of soldiers and four of Susie's own colleagues would die of the disease at the quarantine station, a place Susie herself described as "hell".Susie Cone's diary has been digitised for the first time by the Public Records Office of Victoria. (Supplied: Public Records Office of Victoria)Her diaries which have recently been digitised for the first time by the Public Records Office of Victoria, are believed to the only primary source in existence of what life — and death — was like in that place.The two small diaries covering her time at Woodman Point were held in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Archives until recently.Her entries describe the constant battle to keep desperately ill men alive while dealing with shortages of medicine and clean clothing and watching her fellow nurses succumb to illness and, in some cases, die.It was a far cry from the adventure Susie had envisioned when she set sail for Europe just weeks before.Eager to see the world as a wartime nurseThe Wyreema was a passenger ship that was repurposed for use as a hospital ship during the First World War. (Supplied: State Library of Victoria)Susie Cone and a contingent of her fellow nurses left Australia onboard the recently requisitioned passenger ship the Wyrema in October 1918."Edgecombe and I are in a cabin together. there are 46 sisters and a matron, some hundreds of troops and officers on board," she wrote in her diary.In November they reached Cape Town in South Africa, which was to be a waypoint in their journey to Europe, but the ship's arrival coincided with the signing of the Armistice which ended the war. Susie and her shipmates were told they would not be sailing on to Europe, but would instead be heading back home."This old tub and her load are bound for old Aussie once more," she wrote."What a terrible disappointment for everybody. We all expected at least to get to England."Disappointed, Susie and her fellow nurses headed for home onboard the Wyrema, not anticipating that a rather unwelcome visitor was also on its way to Australian shores — the Spanish Flu.Deadly influenza outbreak reaches AustraliaFour nurses died while caring for soldiers at the Woodman Point Quarantine Station. (Supplied: Friends of Woodman Point)HMAT Boonah, which had also docked in South Africa as the Armistice was signed, headed for home with 3,000 troops onboard. By the time the ship reached Western Australia, 300 men were sick with influenza.Susie Cone and 20 of her colleagues volunteered to care for the men at the Woodman Point quarantine centre in Perth."About 10am the boys began to come up from the jetty. Our tents and hut were soon full. Poor lads were in a terrible plight. Filth and dirt all over them, terribly sick," she wrote in her diary."We had no drugs, no clean shirts or pyjamas to put on them. All we could do was to wash them and get them as comfortable as possible. Three died the first day."An extract from Susie Cone's diary from December 1918. (Supplied: Public Record Office of Victoria)Over the coming day, more men would die as the nurses did what they could with little food and medicine in a place Susie described as "nothing but dust, sand and flies and sickness"."This place is HELL," she wrote on December 12.Sister Rosa O'Kane died from Spanish Flu at Woodman Point in December 1918. (Supplied: Queensland State Archives)"No letters from home. Very miserable and lonely."Days later, her fellow nurse Sister Rosa O'Kane succumbed to influenza and died."Poor old O'Kane died early this morning," Susie Cone wrote in her diary."One can hardly realise that she is gone. Everybody very depressed about it. We gave her a military funeral today at 4pm."It's sad to see how we old Wyremians have decreased. Only nine of us on duty now."As 1918 drew to a close, the entries in Susie's diary make mention of more nurses becoming ill, including Ada Thompson and Hilda Williams.The last entry in her diary for 1918 consists of just two words: "Tommy died."Ada Thompson was the second nurse to die at the camp and was followed three days later by Hilda Williams. A fourth nurse, Doris Ridgway died a day later after being on duty at the camp for just a few days."Ridgway died this evening. Such a dear little girl," Susie wrote.Susie Cone wrote in her diary about the death of fellow nurse Doris Ridgway, describing her as a dear little girl. (Supplied: Public records Office of Victoria)Susie herself came down with influenza a week later but, despite feeling "rotten" and "weak", recovered and resumed her duties. She was the last of the original contingent of nurses from the Wyrema on duty at the camp.On January 25 her nursing stint at Woodman Point came to an end and she was cleared to travel back home to Victoria, which was news that came as a welcome relief to the young nurse."Packed up this evening ready for Fremantle in the morning. Too good to be true," she wrote.Susie left the quarantine station and returned home but two of the nurses who died — Rosa O'Kane and Hilda Williams — remain buried at Woodman Point.A memorial marks Rosa O'Kane's grave, with the words "For Valour" inscribed at the top.Posted Sat 6 May 2023 at 9:09pmSaturday 6 May 2023 at 9:09pmSat 6 May 2023 at 9:09pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBarron Trump and AOC give us clues about the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron stands with his mother and father Four foreign nationals found on Croker Island say they paid money to be taken to AustraliaTopic:Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander)Photo shows Croker IslandTeacher's aide may have saved lives of children in horror pre-school crash, police sayTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Floral tributes left outside a schoolRex given $80m lifeline, as ACCC warns Qantas controls 65pc of market and prices are upLIVEPhoto shows A Regional Express (REX) aircraft unloads at Charleville Airport in south-west Queensland.'I feel really ripped off': Artist slams Optus after alleged unconscionable sales conductTopic:Telecommunications Services IndustryPhoto shows An Aboriginal woman holding up a piece of fabric with artwork on itPopular nowBarron Trump and AOC expose the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a split screen image.
