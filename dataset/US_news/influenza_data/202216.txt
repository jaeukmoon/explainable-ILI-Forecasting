Here, we report the discovery of an anti-IAV microbial metabolite called APL-16-5 that was originally isolated from the plant endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp. CPCC 400735. APL-16-5 binds to both the E3 ligase TRIM25 and IAV polymerase subunit PA, leading to TRIM25 ubiquitination of PA and subsequent degradation of PA in the proteasome. This mode of action conforms to that of a proteolysis targeting chimera which employs the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome machinery to chemically induce the degradation of target proteins. Importantly, APL-16-5 potently inhibits IAV and protects mice from lethal IAV infection. Therefore, we have identified a natural microbial metabolite with potent in vivo anti-IAV activity and the potential of becoming a new IAV therapeutic. The antiviral mechanism of APL-16-5 opens the possibility of improving its anti-IAV potency and specificity by adjusting its affinity for TRIM25 and viral PA protein through medicinal chemistry.

It is estimated that annual seasonal flu leads to 3–5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths1. Seasonal influenza vaccines do not replace anti-influenza drugs, especially in the event of unexpected influenza pandemics, or for the treatment of patients who respond poorly to vaccination2. Because of the emergence and transmission of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 strains, which are resistant to the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine3, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir which have been prescribed for treating most influenza virus infections4,5. Recently, the nucleoprotein inhibitor baloxavir marboxil was developed to target the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the viral polymerase subunit PA6,7. However, approximately 90% of the influenza strains circulating during the 2008–2009 flu season were found to be resistant to NA inhibitors. The new inhibitor baloxavir marboxil presented a low genetic barrier against pre-existing resistance8,9. Therefore, novel and effective drugs are urgently needed to control influenza virus infection, particularly the emergence of new highly pathogenic influenza strains.Viral enzymes have been the primary targets of the majority of the antiviral drugs approved for clinical use. In the same vein, the IAV RNA polymerase complex has long been pursued for the discovery of anti-IAV drugs. The functional IAV RNA polymerase complex contains viral proteins PA, PB1, PB2 and NP. The function of NP is to coat and protect viral RNA. PA is an endonuclease, cleaves in the 5’ region of host mRNA. The 10 to 15 nt 5’ mRNA fragment is anchored to the PB2 subunit and used by the PB1 polymerase as a primer to initiate the synthesis of nascent viral RNA10. This mechanism of viral RNA synthesis is named “cap snatching transcription”. A few drugs have already been developed that target the IAV RNA polymerase complex11. The most successful one is balovaxir that inhibits PA endonuclease activity, and has been licensed in Japan and the United Sates. Pimodivir acts on PB2 and prevents PB2 from binding the 5’ cap structure of cellular mRNA fragment. Favipiravir can inhibit PB1 polymerase activity.Here, we report that a natural compound called APL-16-5 (previously named asperphenalenone E), which was isolated from the plant endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp. CPCC 40073512, significantly inhibits the replication of influenza virus in cultured cells and mice. Our data showed that APL-16-5 acts by binding to both the E3 ligase tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and viral polymerase subunit PA. This allows TRIM25 to recognize and ubiquitinate PA which is subsequently degraded by proteasome. Our results support the development of APL-16-5 as a new anti-influenza drug in light of its protection of mice from lethal influenza virus infection.ResultsIdentification of APL-16-5 as a potent anti-IAV drug targeting de novo viral replicationDuring screening of microbial metabolites for IAV inhibitors, we identified several phenalenone derivatives, including APL-16-5 and APL-16-1 (Fig. 1a). These inhibitors exhibited potent anti-IAV activity, with submicromolar EC50 ranging from 0.28 to 0.36 μM (Fig. 1b), determined by infecting a HEK293T-Gluc reporter cell line with influenza A virus A/WSN/33, as previously described13. In contrast, a phenalenone derivative APL-16-2 showed negligible inhibition of IAV, with an EC50 of 61.2 μM (Fig. 1a, b). All phenalenone derivatives tested herein exhibited low cytotoxicity, with CC50 > 100 μM in several cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1a), suggesting that the observed antiviral effect was not due to cytotoxicity. APL-16-5 presented the strongest IAV inhibition and was therefore selected for further investigation. Next, we found that in addition to inhibiting IAV in HEK293T cells, APL-16-5 potently suppressed multiple strains of IAV and influenza B virus in both A549 and MDCK cells (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, no significant inhibition of hepatitis C virus or ZIKV was observed (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Together, these data suggest that APL-16-5 is a potent and specific inhibitor of the influenza virus.Fig. 1: Identification of APL-16-5 as a potent IAV inhibitor targeting de novo viral replication.a Molecular structure of compounds APL-16-5, APL-16-1 and APL-16-2. b Dose–response curves for the antiviral activity of APL-16-5, APL-16-1 and APL-16-2 were generated based on Gluc activity in HEK293T-Gluc cells infected with WSN/33 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 for 24 h, then Gluc activity was determined (n = 3).

The results showed that APL-16-5 effectively inhibited IAV infection when added within 2–6 h, particularly within 2–4 h post infection when IAV RNA is transcribed and inhibited by RNA polymerase inhibitor ribavirin (Fig. 1c). The relatively prolonged inhibition by APL-16-5 (up to 6 h) compared with ribavirin (up to 4 h) may result from the different antiviral mechanisms of these two drugs. We found no effect of APL-16-5 on the nuclear import of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immediately after IAV infection, as opposed to the marked inhibition of viral RNA nuclear import by the known IAV entry inhibitor nucleozin14 (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggesting that APL-16-5 does not affect the early post-entry event until viral RNP enters the nucleus. Moreover, a similar inhibitory effect of APL-16-5 was observed in cells infected with a single-round IAV (Supplementary Fig. 1e), compared to that of wild-type IAV, suggesting that APL-16-5 exerts its antiviral activity prior to the late stage of viral infection and reinfection of progeny virus. These data suggest that APL-16-5 most likely inhibits viral RNA transcription.To further examine this antiviral mechanism, the effect of APL-16-5 on viral RNA transcription was assessed using the IAV mini-genome replicon A549-5Ps, a cell line that stably expresses IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) subunits (PA, PB1, and PB2), NP, and a vRNA-like reporter gene Gaussia luciferase (Gluc)13. The results showed that APL-16-5, but not the control compound APL-16-2, caused a dose-dependent reduction in Gluc expression (Fig. 1d). Further supporting the impairment of viral RdRp function by APL-16-5, the levels of all three species of viral transcripts (vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA) were significantly reduced in IAV-infected cells treated with APL-16-5, but not in those treated with APL-16-2 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1f). These data suggest that APL-16-5 inhibits influenza virus infection by diminishing viral RNA levels.APL-16-5 induces proteasome-dependent degradation of PANext, we investigated how APL-16-5 diminishes viral RNA levels. First, the effects of APL-16-5 on the levels of PB1, PB2, PA, and NP, which are expressed in the IAV mini-genome replicon were assessed. Interestingly, treatment with APL-16-5 (10 μM) markedly decreased the levels of all viral RNP components, while the PA protein was most sensitive to APL-16-5 treatment at a lower concentration of 2 μM (Fig. 2a). Since the expression of each viral gene in the IAV mini-genome replicon is controlled by the promoter in the plasmid DNA, independent of viral RdRp activity, the inhibitory effect observed with APL-16-5 did not result from defective RdRp. Thus, the RdRp inhibitor ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, inhibited RdRp activity (Fig. 1d), but did not affect the expression of viral RdRp subunits (Fig. 2a). To examine the response of each subunit of the viral RdRp complex to APL-16-5, we expressed PA, PB1, PB2, and NP individually. APL-16-5 was found to cause a significant reduction in the level of PA, but not in that of PB1, PB2, or NP (Fig. 2b), which was corroborated by quantification analysis of Western blot (Supplementary Fig. 2a). As a control, treatment with APL-16-2 had no effect on the expression of these viral proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Previous studies have shown that co-expression of the RdRp subunits increased the level of each component compared with the expression of individual subunits, suggesting that the formation of an RdRp complex may have stabilized all components. Therefore, it is possible that by reducing the level of PA, APL-16-5 may have also decreased the levels of other RdRp components, as shown in Fig. 2a.Fig. 2: APL-16-5 induces proteasome-dependent degradation of PA.a Western blot analysis of lysates from A549-5Ps cells following treatment with DMSO or APL-16-5.

Indeed, western blot analysis revealed that APL-16-5 treatment led to a marked reduction in PA following the treatment of cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 2c), whereas the level of PB1 was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 2d). To quantify the decay kinetics of PA, we constructed a vector expressing PA-luciferase fusion protein, whose expression was sensitive to APL-16-5 treatment and luciferase activity quantitatively reported the level of PA protein (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Using this reporter, we observed that APL-16-5 and another active compound APL-16-1, but not APL-16-2, reduced the half-life of PA protein from 18.8 h in control cells to 4.25 and 6.58 h in treated cells, respectively (Fig. 2d), suggesting that APL-16-5 and APL-16-1 accelerate the degradation of PA. Furthermore, the APL-16-5-induced destabilization of PA was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2e), suggesting an important role of the proteasome in the depletion of PA protein by APL-16-5. This mechanism of action is supported by the results of the ubiquitination assay that showed that APL-16-5 induced the dose-dependent ubiquitination of PA (Fig. 2f), but not PB1 (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Thus, we concluded that APL-16-5 specifically induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of PA by inducing PA ubiquitination.IAV develops resistance to APL-16-5 by mutating PATo explore the possibility that the viral PA protein is the target of APL-16-5, we examined the effect of PA overexpression on the anti-IAV activity of APL-16-5. The results showed that increasing the expression of the PA protein, but not the PB1 protein, gradually alleviated the inhibitory effect of APL-16-5 on IAV replication (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). This rescue effect by PA overexpression was also observed for APL-16-1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b), suggesting the PA-specific anti-IAV activity for both APL-16-5 and APL-16-1, because no such effect was observed for the antiviral effects of ribavirin (Supplementary Fig. 3c). These data suggest that reducing expression of the viral PA protein by APL-16-5 and APL-16-1 contributes significantly to their anti-IAV activity.Fig. 3: APL-16-5 inhibits Influenza A virus (IAV) by targeting PA for degradation.a HEK293T-Gluc cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of PA plasmid DNA, followed by A/WSN/33 infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 and treatment with APL-16-5 (2 or 10 μM) for 24 h, then Gluc activity was determined and PA levels were assessed by western blot. For PA (0 μg vs. 0.8 and 1.2 μg): (p = 0.0034 and p = 0.0007, p = 0.0015 and p = 0.0015, p = 0.0505 and p = 0.0541, respectively). b HEK293T-Gluc cells were infected with wild-type or mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 and treated with APL-16-5 or ribavirin at the indicated concentrations for 24 h, then Gluc activity was determined.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo further demonstrate that APL-16-5 targets PA, we selected APL-16-5-resistant IAV by passaging IAV in the presence of APL-16-5. The selected IAV showed a 7.5-fold increase in the EC50 of APL-16-5 compared with that of the wild-type IAV (Supplementary Fig. 3d), but remained fully susceptible to ribavirin (Fig. 3b). We then sequenced the APL-16-5-resistant IAV and identified two common mutations, N228K and AS704-705H (a mutant containing A704H followed by the replacement of S705 with a stop codon, resulting in the loss of six amino acids from the C-terminus of PA) of the PA protein (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Next, we introduced two mutations, N228K and AS704-705H (briefly A704H), either individually or in combination, into the wild-type PA gene and showed that the IAV with both N228K and A704H was resistant to APL-16-5 inhibition (Fig. 3c). This PA double mutant was completely resistant to APL-16-5-induced degradation (Fig. 3d). The single mutant N228K or A704H expressed at lower levels, and showed moderate resistance to degradation by APL-16-5. Collectively, these results suggest that the viral PA protein is at least one of the primary targets of APL-16-5. We noted that the drug-resistant viral mutant was still inhibited by high concentration of APL-16-5 albeit to a much less extent (Fig. 3b, c), although the mutated PA was almost fully resistant to degradation by APL-16-5 (Fig. 3d), which suggests that APL-16-5 may act on more targets than PA to achieve its potent antiviral activity.APL-16-5-induced degradation of PA is dependent on TRIM25To determine the cellular mechanism underlying APL-16-5-induced PA degradation, SPR-LC-MS/MS was used to screen cellular proteins that bind to APL-16-5, as described previously15,16. Briefly, APL-16-5 was immobilized on a sensor chip and incubated with lysates of A549 cells followed by SPR and mass spectrometry analysis to identify and rank host proteins that potentially interact with APL-16-5. Among 79 total hits (score >200), five candidates were enriched in the protein degradation pathway (Fig. 4a). Next, we knocked down each of these genes using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and found that the inhibition of IAV by APL-16-5 was markedly abolished in cells transfected with siRNA targeting TRIM25 but not the other genes (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4a). This suggested that TRIM25 is required for the anti-IAV activity of APL-16-5. We also used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a TRIM25-knockout cell line, and observed that the anti-IAV activity of APL-16-5, but not that of ribavirin, was dependent on TRIM25 (Fig. 4c). Supporting these observations, overexpression of TRIM25 in TRIM25-knockout cells restored APL-16-5 inhibition of IAV close to that in the parental cells (Fig. 4d). We also noted that overexpressing TRIM25 by transfection of TRIM25 DNA increased the inhibition of IAV by APL-16-5 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Together, these data demonstrate a key role of TRIM25 in the anti-IAV activity of APL-16-5.Fig. 4: The anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity of APL-16-5 is dependent on TRIM25.a Schematic representation of the APL-16-5 molecular capture protocol and summary of ubiquitin-related candidates. b TRIM25-knockdown cells were infected with IAV A/WSN/33 in the presence of increasing amounts of APL-16-5 (2 μM or 10 μM).

Indeed, TRIM25 knockout markedly inhibited APL-16-5-induced PA degradation (Fig. 4e). As a control, knockdown of another E3 candidate, HERC5, did not affect APL-16-5-induced PA degradation, indicating that HECR5 is not involved in the anti-IAV activity of APL-16-5 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). As expected, PA underwent ubiquitination in wild-type cells but not in TRIM25 knockout cells, even with high concentrations of APL-16-5 (Fig. 4f). These data suggest that the cellular E3 ligase TRIM25 is required for APL-16-5-induced ubiquitination and PA degradation, and thus plays an essential role in the anti-IAV activity of APL-16-5. This essential role of TRIM25 does not preclude the involvement of other cellular factors in APL-16-5-induced PA degradation, which awaits further investigation.APL-16-5 induces ubiquitination of PA by engaging TRIM25The substrate specificity of each E3 ligase is often determined by their interaction. Therefore, we investigated whether APL-16-5 induces the ubiquitination of PA by promoting the interaction between TRIM25 and PA. First, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and noted a low basal level association of TRIM25 with PA, this association increased with increasing concentrations of APL-16-5 (Fig. 5a). The low level of PA found in the immunoprecipitated materials may represent either a non-specific binding or an indirect association in other complex. To validate this observation in cells, we performed an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), in which protein interactions are detected as individual fluorescent dots. Again, interactions between TRIM25 and PA were only detected in cells treated with APL-16-5 (Fig. 5b, upper panel). When MG132 was used to block the degradation of PA by APL-16-5, more and brighter fluorescent dots were detected (Fig. 5b, lower panel), accompanied by increased levels of PA (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Quantification of fluorescence revealed a four-fold increase in the colocalization between TRIM25 and PA as a result of MG132 treatment (Fig. 5c). In contrast, a co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that APL-16-5 was unable to promote the interaction of TRIM25 with double PA mutant (Supplementary Fig. 5b), which was shown resistant to APL-16-5 inhibition (Fig. 3c) and APL-16-5-induced PA degradation (Fig. 3d). These data suggest that APL-16-5 function by promoting the interaction of PA with the E3 ligase TRIM25 and render PA a substrate for ubiquitination by TRIM25. Of note, results of PLA showed interactions of TRIM25 with PA (Supplementary Fig. 5c), but not with PB1 in cells expressing PA, PB1 and PB2, suggesting that PA but not the other subunits of viral polymerase complex is targeted by APL-16-5.Fig. 5: APL-16-5 links TRIM25 to PA and induces PA ubiquitination.a Immunoprecipitation analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated concentrations of plasmid DNA, and treated with APL-16-5 (2 or 10 μM) or APL-16-2 (10 μM). b In situ PLA was performed to detect the interaction between TRIM25 and PA in the presence of APL-16-5 (10 μM) or APL-16-2 (10 μM), with or without MG-132 (5 μM).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo further define the mechanism of APL-16-5 action, we examined the binding affinity of APL-16-5 to purified TRIM25 and PA using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) kinetic binding assay. The results showed that APL-16-5 bound to both TRIM25 and PA in a concentration-dependent manner, with fitted KD values of 18 and 11 μM for TRIM25 and PA, respectively (Fig. 5d, e). Similarly, another anti-IAV compound, APL-16-1, bound to both TRIM25 and PA, whereas APL-16-2 bound to PA but not to TRIM25 (Supplementary Fig. 5d, e). Importantly, in the BLI assay, TRIM25 only bound to PA in the presence of APL-16-5, whereas APL-16-2 had no effect (Fig. 5f), further supporting the heterobifunctional nature of APL-16-5 to link TRIM25 and PA. Moreover, the results of the in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that PA was polyubiquitinated by TRIM25 in the presence of APL-16-5, rather than APL-16-2 (Fig. 5g). This suggested that the APL-16-5-mediated interaction between TRIM25 and PA is sufficient to trigger the ubiquitination of PA by TRIM25. Interestingly, when cells were treated with both APL-16-5 and APL-16-2, PA levels were restored to those observed in the untreated cells (Fig. 5h). Since APL-16-2 also binds to PA, it must have diminished the binding of APL-16-5 to PA through competition, thus abrogating APL-16-5-mediated PA degradation. This finding further supports that APL-16-5 functions via a heterobifunctional mechanism that requires interaction with both the E3 ligase and substrate. It should be noted that APL-16-5 failed to promote the interaction of TRIM25 with the double PA mutant in a Co-IP assay (Supplementary Fig. 5b), which provides indirect evidence on the action of APL-16-5 and the resistant mechanism. Measuring the affinity of PA mutants to APL-16-5 should provide more direct support.To further test whether APL-16-5 acts as a bifunctional molecule, we performed a dose-response study of PA degradation and ubiquitination at high concentrations of APL-16-5, to determine if hook effect occurs. Hook effect is specific for bifunctional molecules which bind to both E3 ligase and substrate; thus at high ligand concentrations, individual binary complexes become saturated, which impedes the formation of the E3 ligase–substrate–ligand ternary complex and causes a loss of substrate degradation. In contrast, molecular glues have no measurable affinity for the free substrate, thus do not exhibit hook effect. The results showed that APL-16-5 gradually lost its activity of reducing the level of PA (Fig. 5i) and inducing PA ubiquitination in cells (Fig. 5j) and in cell-free assays (Fig. 5k) at high concentrations, which further supports a biofunctional mechanism. In contrast, APL-16-5 did not affect the degradation of SIRT7 by TRIM25 (Fig. 5l), which most likely rules out the possible non-specific inhibition of TRIM25-mediated protein degradation at high concentrations of APL-16-5. Together, these data suggest that APL-16-5 acts by binding to both TRIM25 and PA, and induces TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PA.APL-16-5 protects mice from lethal IAV infectionFinally, we investigated whether APL-16-5 could protect mice from lethal IAV infection. First, we treated rodent BHK21 cells with APL-16-5 and observed a substantial decrease in expression of the viral PA protein (Supplementary Fig. 6). This suggests that APL-16-5 can target IAV PA protein in mice as a result of the high homology between human and mouse TRIM2517. Next, we inoculated mice with a lethal dose of IAV followed by different doses of APL-16-5, administered orally on day 1 post-infection and then daily for 8 days. Remarkably, 100% of the mice treated with 100 mg/kg APL-16-5 and 67% of mice treated with a low dose of APL-16-5 (4 mg/kg) survived IAV infection, while none of the mice treated with PBS survived (Fig. 6a). APL-16-5 treatment increased the survival of mice, reaching 75% (Supplementary Table 2). Among the infected mice, no body weight loss was observed among those treated with 100 mg/kg of APL-16-5. The mice treated with lower doses of APL-16-5 (4 and 20 mg/kg) lost body weight, but to a much lesser degree compared with PBS-treated animals (Fig. 6b). Moreover, viral titers in the lungs were significantly reduced on days 4 and 14 post-infection in mice treated with APL-16-5, especially at doses of 20 and 100 mg/kg (Fig. 6c). Histopathological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that APL-16-5 treatment profoundly reduced the severity of pulmonary inflammation (Fig. 6d). Consequently, APL-16-5 significantly improved the lung index of IAV-infected mice, with 40–80% inhibition compared with that in the PBS-treated mice (Supplementary Table 3). Collectively, these results demonstrate strong protection of mice from lethal IAV infection by APL-16-5.Fig. 6: APL-16-5 protects mice from lethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection.Mice (six per group) were infected with IAV WSN/33 (5 × LD50, in 50 μL PBS), and then treated with either APL-16-5 (4, 20, or 100 mg/kg), ribavirin (100 mg/kg), or PBS daily from day 1 to 8 post-infection. a Survival rate (n = 6), b body weight (n = 6). In a separate animal study of the same designs, c viral titers (TCID50) in the lungs (n = 3) and d histopathology (one out of three shown, 200 X) were determined. Bar =mean. Error bars = ±SEM. For c viral titers at 4 and 14 DPI or until the death of mice in PBS-treated group (PBS-treated vs. Ribavirin, APL-16-5-100, 20, 4 mg/kg): (p = 0.0029, p = 0.0006, p = 0.0015 and p = 0.0015, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0016, and p = 0.0015, respectively), an unpaired two-tailed t-test was used. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageDiscussionThe results of this study demonstrate that APL-16-5 exerts potent anti-IAV activity in both cultured cells and mice. Specifically, APL-16-5 binds to both the E3 ligase TRIM25 and viral protein PA, and allows TRIM25 to ubiquitinate PA that then undergoes degradation in the proteasome. As a key subunit of the IAV RdRp complex, degradation of PA impairs viral RNA synthesis and consequently inhibits IAV replication. We could not exclude the possibility that APL-16-5 may exert its antiviral activity by more than one mechanisms, especially in light of the much lower concentration of APL-16-5 required to inhibit IAV infection than degrading PA in the transient transfection experiment. This discrepancy can be attributed to the lower PA level in IAV-infected cells than that from the transfected plasmid DNA. Despite this difference, the important contribution of reduced PA expression by APL-16-5 to its anti-IAV activity is strongly supported by our observation increasing the expression of the PA protein alleviated the inhibitory effect of APL-16-5 on IAV replication (Fig. 3a).To evaluate the selectivity of protein degradation by APL-16-5, we have characterized the protein profiles in cells treated with APL-16-5, using a multi-omics approach (Supplementary Tables 4–6). Only the level of FN1 protein was reduced by more than 2-fold in a TRIM25-dependent fashion at the post-transcriptional level. 12 more host proteins showed a moderate reduction (−0.5 > log2 > −1) (Supplementary Table 7). These data demonstrate that APL-16-5-mediated protein down regulation is high selective, not promiscuous.TRIM25 regulates the RIG-I-mediated IFN pathway18,19, leading to antiviral response to influenza and other RNA viruses. APL-16-5 does not appear to interfere with the cellular function of TRIM25, since APL-16-5 did not affect the IFN response in cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). In addition, it was well tolerated by mice, with no signs of toxicity up to 500 mg/kg, suggesting the low toxicity of APL-16-5 and its potential use in patients. A direct antiviral role of TRIM25 was recently reported in a study showing that TRIM25 inhibits IAV RNA synthesis by directly binding to viral ribonucleoproteins and blocking viral RNA elongation, and this antiviral function of TRIM25 is independent of its E3 ligase activity20. Since the anti-IAV action of APL-16-5 requires the ubiquitin ligase function of TRIM25, APL-16-5 should not act by enhancing the binding of TRIM25 to IAV ribonucleoproteins. We have thus engineered a strategy of using small molecules to endow TRIM25 with a new antiviral ability of degrading key viral enzymes by exploiting its E3 ligase function.Three asperphenalenone compounds APL-16-5, APL-16-2, and APL-16-1 tested herein are composed of a linear diterpene derivative linked to a phenalenone derivative via a C–C bond, which shares the identical phenalenone structural fragment with different diterpene structural fragment (especially the terminal part of the diterpene). The results of BLI showed that all three compounds bound to PA with similar fitted KD values, whereas APL-16-5 and APL-16-1, but not APL-16-2, interacted with TRIM25. This suggests that the phenalenone fragment, shared by all three compounds, mainly contributes to their interaction with PA, and the diterpene fragment determines the binding to TRIM25 (different structures with different binding ability), while the detailed mechanism awaits further investigation.The action of APL-16-5 conforms to the mechanism of a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC). PROTACs utilize the natural ubiquitin-proteasome system to chemically induce targeted protein degradation21,22. PROTACs recognize a target protein and then recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase to trigger its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation23,24. Examples include ARV-110 that targets the androgen receptor and ARV-471 that targets the estrogen receptor19,25. In vitro data support the feasibility of inhibiting hepatitis B and C viruses by PROTAC-mediated degradation of viral proteins26,27. Our data suggest that APL-16-5 may act as an antiviral PROTAC. More experiments such as solving the ternary structure of the TRIM25/APL-16-5/PA complex are expected to provide definitive evidence on this concept.Substantial progress has been made in the chemistry of heterobifunctional PROTAC. However, the in vivo activity of heterobifunctional PROTAC has not been extensively tested, and very few agents including ARV-110 have entered clinical studies28,29,30. The evidence provided in this study suggest that a microbial metabolite could act as a natural PROTAC to inhibit IAV replication. Given the structural diversity and biological activities of microbial metabolites, our findings opens us the possibility of using such a high source of compounds for the discovery of new PROTACs.MethodsCell lines and viral strainsHEK293T (ATCC, CRL-3216), A549 (ATCC, CRL-185), MDCK (ATCC, CRL-34), Huh7.5.1 cells (Dr. Rongtuan Lin, McGill University), Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81) and BHK21 (ATCC, CCL-10) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

Viral titers in supernatants were determined using MDCK cells by the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, using the method described by Reed and Muench13.Gluc activity assayBriefly, before assay, the coelenterazine-h (Promega, #S2011) was diluted to 16.7 μΜ with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell culture supernatants were added to white and opaque 96-well plates, followed by the automated injection of 60 μL coelenterazine-h per well, in. Photon counts were acquired for 0.5 s, using a Centro XS3 LB 960 microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies, BadWildbad, Germany). The data were collected using MikroWin 2010 software (version 5.17).Cytotoxicity analysisHEK293T, A549, and MDCK cells were cultured at 37 °C in 96-well plates for 24 h and then incubated with the test compounds at the indicated concentrations. Mock-treated cells served as control. A cell viability assay was performed after 48 h using Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime, #C0038).RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)Total RNA was extracted from the infected cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, #15596-018), and cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, #M1705) with oligo(dT) or specific primers.

Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h prior to incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in 1 × PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h with gentle shaking. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride). Fluorescence was visualized using a PerkinElmer Ultra View VoX confocal imaging system.In situ PLAA Duolink® PLA kit (Sigma Aldrich, #DUO92101,) was used for the in situ PLA assay. Briefly, samples fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were incubated with blocking solution to saturate nonspecific binding and then with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, the slides were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the Duolink® PLA probes. The ligation solution was then added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The ligation solution was removed with wash buffer A. The amplification solution was then added and samples were incubated for 100 min at 37 °C before being removed with wash buffer B. Finally, Duolink in situ mounting medium with DAPI was added to samples. Fluorescence was visualized using a PerkinElmer Ultra View VoX confocal imaging system.Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblottingFor IP, HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Scientific, #11668027) and treated with APL-16-5. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol (Thermo Scientific, #87787) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After 1 h on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 16,200×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Cellular extracts were incubated with antibodies for 4 h and then with protein A/G agarose (Beyotime, #P2055) overnight at 4 °C. The sepharose samples were washed five times with cell-lysis buffer, boiled with SDS loading buffer for 10 min, and subjected to western blot analysis. After separation by SDS–PAGE, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted with the indicated primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were incubated with the chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and protein signals were determined using a Gel Doc XR + molecular imager (Bio-Rad).Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) binding assayBinding affinity and kinetic profiles were measured using Octet RED (ForteBio). The purified PA or TRIM25 was biotinylated using EZ-Link NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, #21343). The biotinylated PA or TRIM25 (50 μg/mL) was then captured using super streptavidin (SSA) biosensors (120 s, at 30 °C, 100 g). A duplicate set of sensors was incubated in buffer (0.002% Tween-20, PBS, pH = 7.4) without protein to control for background binding. Both the ligand and reference biosensors were quenched with 5 μg/mL biotin for 1 min. To determine the KD, the binding of a diluted series of compounds was detected for 60 s association (kon, 1/Ms) followed by 60 s dissociation (kdis, 1/s) in parallel to the ligand and reference biosensors. In addition, blank binding cycles using only buffer were used to correct the baseline shift during the analysis. After measurements were obtained, a double reference subtraction method was used to subtract the effects of baseline drift and nonspecific binding. KD was acquired by fitting into a 1:1 binding model by global fitting of multiple kinetic traces and analyzed using Data Analysis software (version 9.0).In vitro ubiquitination assayRecombinant human C-myc/DDK TRIM25 protein (#TP303757), purified from HEK293T cells, was purchased from Origene Technologies, Inc. and recombinant C-His-PA was purified from HEK293T cells in our laboratory, both of whose purity was above 80% determined by SDS–PAGE gel and coomassie blue staining. TRIM25 constructs were incubated at 37 °C with recombinant human ubiquitination activating enzyme (E1, 100 nM), recombinant human UbcH5a/UBE2D1 (E2, 1 μM), and recombinant human HA-ubiquitin (40 μM) in 950 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5 mM ATP, and 10 mM MgCl2. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS–PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 20 min. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-HA (1:2000) and anti-PA (1:2000) antibodies.APL-16-5 molecular capture experimentsTo identify and quantify APL-16-5 target host proteins, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mass spectrometry (MS) experiments were performed. APL-16-5 was formulated with 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 100 mM. Continuous APL-16-5 was printed on a chip surface by auto-spotting three times using a BioDot™-1520 array printer (CA, USA). The chip surface was then printed with a 50 × 50 matrix of 18.75 µL (1.875 μmol) APL-16-5 sample in total, with 2.5 nL a projected point of the solution.Cell lysis dosage calibration: After lysing A549 cells, the protein concentration of the sample was calibrated using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific3), leading to a concentration of 411.77 μg/mL. The concentration of the samples was adjusted to 200 g/mL using 1× lysis buffer.Chip performance calibration: Each chip was fabricated by Lumera Co. Ltd. (Kaiserslautern, Germany). The difference in chip binding quantity between batches was <0.5%. The optimal resonance angle was automatically adjusted using a bScreen LB 991 biochip analyzer (Berthold Technologies, Germany).Target protein capture: In the SPR assay, APL-16-5 was immobilized on the surface of the chip, and A549 cell lysate was used as the liquid phase. The APL-A549 sample curve indicated target protein binding in the area spotted with APL-16-5. The background curve shows signals in the non-spotted area.Time procedures: Over 0–260 s, the system was pre-washed and the surface of the chip was soaked in running buffer. At this time, the resonance intensity was ~0 resonance units (RUs). During 260–520 s, APL-16-5 on the chip surface starts to capture the protein target in the lysate. Over 520–820 s, the chip was washed to remove non-specific adhesive proteins from the surface. Target protein-specific binding to APL-16-5 was retained on the surface of the chip. The resonance intensity decreased and plateaued (~607.50 RU). Non-specific binding of the non-point sample area was gradually cleaned, the resonance intensity of the background value gradually returned to the baseline level (~42.33 RU), and the chip background noise returned to normal levels.IAV infection of miceFour- to six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences Laboratory (China) and housed in a room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 10%) mouse facility with free access to food and water under a 12 h dark/light cycle. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Mice (six per group) were intranasally infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus (5 × LD50, in 50 μL PBS) or mock-infected, and then received either APL-16-5 (4, 20, or 100 mg/kg), ribavirin (100 mg/kg), or PBS daily on days 1–8 post-infection. Compound diluent was 0.5% Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose. Mice were monitored daily, and survival and weight loss were recorded up to day 14. In a separate animal study of the same designs, virus titers in the lungs were determined from mice (three mice from each group) sacrificed on day 4 and 14 post virus exposure or until animal died. Mouse lung was collected and homogenized. Each sample was assayed in triplicate for viral titers in MDCK cells with the TCID50 method. Samples for histopathology examination were collected on day 14 after virus inoculation or until animal died. The lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed sections of paraffin-embedded lungs were stained with H&E and imaged under a microscope (×200).ZIKV infectivity assayTiter of ZIKV stock was determined by infecting Vero cells, the results were calculated as the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). Vero cells were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 0.01. ZIKV infection was determined by quantifying viral RNA with qRT-PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted 48 h post-infection with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). cDNA was synthesized using Primescript RT Master Kit (Takara, Japan). Level of viral RNA was determined by qRT-PCR using SYBR premix Ex Taq II kit (Takara). ZIKV gene NS2A was amplified with primers 5′-CCACGCACTGATAACAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGTAGCAAGGCCTGCTCT-3′ (reverse). Cellular GAPDH RNA was amplified with primer pair 5′-atcatccctgcctctactgg-3′/ 5′-gtcaggtccaccactgacac-3, the results served as internal controls to normalize ZIKV RNA data. For quantification, the 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative ZIKV RNA levels against GAPDH.Quantitative proteomic analysis by LC–MS/MSThe tryptic peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile/in water), directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (25-cm length, 75/100 μm i.d.). Peptides were separated with a gradient from 6% to 24% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 70 min, 24–35% in 14 min and climbing to 80% in 3 min then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant flow rate of 450 nL/min on a nanoElute UHPLC system (Bruker Daltonics).The peptides were subjected to Capillary source followed by the timsTOF Pro (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometry. The electrospray voltage applied was 1.60 kV. Precursors and fragments were analyzed at the TOF detector, with a MS/MS scan range from 100 to 1700m/z. The timsTOF Pro was operated in parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode. Precursors with charge states 0–5 were selected for fragmentation, and 10 PASEF-MS/MS scans were acquired per cycle. The dynamic exclusion was set to 30.The resulting MS/MS data were processed using MaxQuant search engine (version1.6.15.0). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human SwissProt database (Home-sapiens-9606-SP-20201214.fasta, 20395 entries) concatenated with reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 40 ppm in First search and 40 ppm in Main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.04 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification, and acetylation on protein N-terminal and oxidation on Met, acetylation/succinylation/ubiquitylation/crotonylation/2-ohi-butyrylation/malonylation/… on Lys/phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, Tyr were specified as variable modifications. TMT-6plex quantification was performed. FDR was adjusted to <1%. The cut-off values for identification of potential hits was set at log2FoldChange < 0.5 and p value < 0.05.RNA sequenceTotal RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA purity and quantification were evaluated using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Then the libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transcriptome sequencing and analysis were conducted by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. About 5.64–6.49 G raw reads for each sample was generated. Raw data (raw reads) of fastq format were firstly processed using Trimmomatic and the low-quality reads were removed to obtain the clean reads. Then about 37.15 G clean reads for each sample were retained for subsequent analyses. The clean reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using HISAT2. FPKM of each gene was calculated using Cufflinks, and the read counts of each gene were obtained by HTSeq-count. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq (2012) R package. p value < 0.05 and fold change < 0.5 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expression.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments and evaluated using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test via Prism (version 8.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Differences between the two indicated settings were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05(*), p < 0.01(**), and p < 0.001(***). NS denotes non-significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Influenza-associated mortality and morbidity is especially high among the elderly, children, and patients with chronic diseases. While there are antivirals available against influenza, such as neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes, there is growing resistance against these drugs. Thus, there is a need for novel antivirals for resistant influenza strains. Host-directed therapies are a potential strategy for influenza as host processes are conserved and are less prone mutations as compared to virus-directed therapies. A literature search was performed for papers that performed viral–host interaction screens and the Reactome pathway database was used for the bioinformatics analysis. A total of 15 studies were curated and 1717 common interactors were uncovered among all these studies. KEGG analysis, Enrichr analysis, STRING interaction analysis was performed on these interactors. Therefore, we have identified novel host pathways that can be targeted for host-directed therapy against influenza in our review. Introduction Influenza viruses are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from the Orthomyxoviridae family that cause respiratory diseases (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2017). Of the 4 influenza virus types, A, B, C, and D, type A is the most prolific as it infects numerous hosts and is the main causative agent of the seasonal and pandemic influenza (Shen et al., 2015). Influenza viruses constantly evolve with antigenic shifts (reassortment of viral segments, resulting in dramatically different viruses) and drifts (small antigenic changes to increase immune evasion). Due to the viral adaptation and reassortment, highly virulent strains may appear and result in local epidemics or global pandemics, such as the 1918 H1N1 Spanish pandemic, 2005 H5N1 Bird flu, and the 2009 H1N1 Swine flu (Shen et al., 2015). Influenza’s genome, which is composed of eight segments of symmetrical helixes, encodes ten proteins. Those include the surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (M1), matrix ion channel (M2), Nucleoprotein (NP), PA (polymerase acid subunit), polymerase basic subunit 1 (PB1), and polymerase basic subunit 2 (PB2), which form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, NS1 (non-structural protein 1) and NS2, non-structural protein 2 or nuclear export protein (NEP; Noda, 2012). Segments of some influenza A virus strains may encode a second or third polypeptide in alternative reading frames (McCauley et al., 2012). These functional proteins (Jagger et al., 2012), such as PB1-F2 and PA-X, are known to modulate the host response to the virus (Klemm et al., 2018). The influenza A virus can be further classified based on its HA and NA glycoproteins into different subtypes. There are 18 haemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes known today (Tong et al., 2013). Only the H1, H2, H3, N1, and N2 subtypes have caused epidemics in humans (Bouvier and Palese, 2008). Current Prophylaxis and Treatment of Influenza Vaccination is available for influenza and is the main form of prevention against influenza. Vaccine efficacy is around 60% if matched to the current circulating strains of the virus, but effectiveness can be as low as 10–20% if there is a mismatch between the vaccine and current strains of the virus (Eisenstein, 2019). The current method of developing influenza vaccines is lengthy, with the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) characterizing around 2,000 influenza viruses. These viruses are monitored for drifts and shifts and compared to viruses included in the current influenza vaccine. This provides an indication of the vaccine’s ability to produce an immune response against current circulating strains of influenza (CDC, 2019). There are three main kinds of vaccines: egg-based vaccines, attenuated vaccines, and recombinant vaccines. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza, there are problems associated with vaccine mismatches (Paules et al., 2018) and poor immunogenicity of vaccines in the elderly (DiazGranados et al., 2014). Moreover, there is a lack of a universal influenza vaccine covering all strains and subtypes of influenza (Krammer et al., 2018). Hence, there is a need for antiviral therapy for breakthrough infections and for infection with influenza strains not covered by vaccines. M2 ion channel inhibitors (e.g., amantadine and rimantadine) and NA inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) are the original two drug classes approved for influenza treatment (Krammer et al., 2018). Resistant virus strains have emerged and have rendered M2 inhibitors ineffective for clinical use while there is also increasing NA inhibitor resistance, such as the H274Y mutation, found in the 2009 H1N1 strain which conferred oseltamivir resistance (Arias et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2015). Recently, baloxavir (cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor) was approved by the FDA in 2018 and worked by interfering influenza’s ability to multiply via inhibition of viral transcription (Hayden et al., 2018). There are a limited number of compounds under development or in trials (Davidson, 2018). Hence, there is an increasing focus to research and developing host-directed therapies given there is a lower drug resistance potential (Lou et al., 2014). We hypothesized that by combining various influenza interactome studies, there might be novel insights into viral–host interactors and processes that could be targeted for antiviral therapy. In this study, we identified novel host interactors of influenza via literature and database search. We further analyzed the data set by bioinformatics. This resulted in the identification of core cellular processes and druggable targets that could be further studied. This provides an overall landscape of conserved host processes targeted by various influenza strains for future drug development and better understanding the influenza life cycle. Materials and Methods Data Collection In order to identify host interactions that are ubiquitous across the various influenza A strains, data was extracted from the Reactome database (Fabregat et al., 2018; Jassal et al., 2020) and Host Pathogen Interaction Database (HPIDB; Ammari et al., 2016) while a PubMed and Scopus search of primary literature that performed interaction studies. Papers were chosen if they had found specific interactions between a host protein and influenza proteins. Host interactions with viral complexes and novel accessory viral proteins, such as PA-X and PB1-F2, were excluded. This is because not all influenza A strains express these accessory proteins. A total of 15 papers were retrieved, and their methodology, as well as virus strain (s) studied, are listed Supplementary Table S1. Reactome is a free, online, curated, open-source pathway database contains the influenza infection pathway (REACT_6167.3), specifically NS1 Mediated Effects on Host Pathways (Homo sapiens). This pathway was last reviewed on 1 May 2007, thus does not contain any information from the studies utilized in this project. Despite its age, it was still included as a point of reference for subsequent analysis. (Fabregat et al., 2018; Jassal et al., 2020). HPIDB was chosen as it contains a comprehensive set of host–virus interactions (Ammari et al., 2016). This includes experimentally derived HPI, predicted HPI via network analysis, and molecular interactions from other databases which include VirHostNet1 and UniProtKB (Consortium, 2012).2 Currently, in its third version, it has 69,787 unique protein interactions between 66 host and 668 pathogen species. In this project, all ten characterized influenza protein interactions (HA, NA, PA, PB1, PB2, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2) from various influenza A strains with human proteins were extracted from the various studies and databases, compiled, and matched to reveal which are key interactors of influenza. The compiled data can be found in Supplementary Table S1. Data Set Analysis Using the filtered gene data set, we performed the following analysis. Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al., 2016) was used for gene set enrichment analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)3 pathwayanalysis was conducted to identify genes at the biologically functional level (Kummer et al., 2014). For all enrichment analysis, a value of p cutoff of 0.05 was used as significant. Figure 1 shows the analysis workflow for the bioinformatics analysis. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Bioinformatics analysis of influenza and host interactors. HPIDB: Human Pathogen Interactions Database. Host interactors of influenza were separated into known and newly determined interactions. PubMed search of Viral–host interactome studies (IP-MS, Y2H, computer homology) was conducted. Papers were filtered if they were in English and full data set was available for analysis. Compiled data set of interactors was analyzed using STRING, Gene set enrichment analysis, and KEGG pathway. Results and Discussion Meta-Analysis of Influenza–Host Interactions In order to better understand the landscape of influenza–host interactions, we performed an analysis of influenza host interactors. We compiled virus–host protein–protein interaction data from HPIDB, Reactome, and published interactome studies. The published studies and their methodology are described in Supplementary Table S1. This data set covered various strains of influenza A, such as H3N2, H1N1, and H7N9. This data set contained protein interactions from different experimental methods—Affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), Yeast 2 hybrid (Y2H), RNA immunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics prediction of interactions. Given that single interactome studies may result in false positives, a host interactor was considered to be true if it appeared in at least 3 different studies and databases. Altogether, our review uncovered 1,717 host interactions among the ten viral proteins. Both KEGG and Enrichr functional analysis were performed for the interactors of each viral protein. Details of the specific host–viral interactions can be found from Supplementary Table S2. HA Interactors Are Mainly Involved in Protein Processing HA is a trimer of identical subunits, each containing two polypeptides that result from proteolytic cleavage of a singular precursor (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). This cleavage is essential to activate membrane fusion potential and hence infectivity (Garten and Klenk, 1999; Steinhauer, 1999). A newly synthesized 70 kDa HA is cleaved into HA1 and HA2, which are linked by disulfide bonds. HA1 contains the sialic acid binding site. After binding, the virus is internalized into endosomes. Endosomal acidification triggers a marked and irreversible change in HA, which results in the dissociation of HA1 from the endosomal membrane and HA1 moving away from HA2. There is a loop-to-helix transition in HA2 which enables the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA2 to attach to the endosomal membrane. This promotes the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes and this results in the vRNP release into the cytoplasm (Das et al., 2010). HA binding to sialic acid receptor determines the species-specific infectivity of the influenza virus (Rogers and Paulson, 1983). Avian and equine viruses prefer α-2,3-galactose-linked sialic acid, human viruses prefer α-2,6-linked sialic acid and swine viruses appear to bind to both linkages of sialic acid (Rogers and D’Souza, 1989; Gambaryan et al., 1997; Ito et al., 1998). Based on our meta-analysis, 36 common host interactors were found across the various studies. The top KEGG pathway identified for HA interactors was the proteasomal pathway (i.e., PSMD6 and PSMD7), protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (i.e., RPN1, CALR, and PDIA6), and adherens junction (i.e., ACTN1 and ACTN4; Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S1A). The functional analysis of the interactors revealed that they were mainly involved in the immune pathway (i.e., PSMD6, PSMD7, ACTN4, ARF1, and ANXA2), protein processing (i.e., PSMD6, PSMD7, CALR), and post-translational modification (i.e., PSMD6, PSMD7, CALU, and PDIA6; Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure S1B). Given that HA is being transcribed and translated in the infected cell during the viral life cycle, this would point to the importance of the protein processing being key in influenza replication. Any drug targeting this process would affect the formation of new virions. This is supported by a previous study which showed HA being synthesized by ER-bound biosynthetic machinery and interacting with ER chaperone proteins calnexin and calreticulin (Hebert et al., 1997). Any drug targeting this process would affect the formation of new virions. Moreover, HA requires glycosylation for binding to sialic receptors (de Vries et al., 2010), while palmitoylation of HA is essential for the virus to form infectious virions (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, this presents a key druggable target for a new therapy to target or prevent influenza infection. DAS181 has already been developed as a sialidase fusion protein to prevent the binding of haemagglutinin to sialic acid receptors. It has reached late-stage clinical trials (Koszalka et al., 2017). FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Summary of the main processes found to be represented for each viral protein. (A) Enriched KEGG pathway for interactors of each viral protein (B) GO analysis of interactors of each viral protein. Proteins were analyzed using Enrichr BP, MF, and CC represent Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component groups of gene ontology (GO). An interesting observation was that immune-related processes were highly enriched from the gene set analysis. A previous study had reported that HA subunit 1 drove the IFN receptor chain IFNAR1 degradation, thus suppressing IFN-triggered JAK/STAT. The reduced JAK/STAT activation would lead to lower type I interferon production, resulting in decreased immune response and thereby increasing viral replication (Xia et al., 2016). This would confirm that HA is involved in regulating the host immune response as part of the influenza life cycle. NA Interactors Are Involved in Vesicle Transport NA is a mushroom-shaped protein and is found as a tetramer of identical subunits, with the mushroom head suspended from the viral membrane on a thin, long stalk. Each subunit that forms the mushroom head is made up of a six-bladed propeller-like structure (Varghese et al., 1983). During viral replication, NA removes sialic acid from cellular glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well as from both viral glycoproteins. This prevents newly assembled viruses from rebinding to the infected cell surface and with self-aggregate through HA-sialic acid interactions. New virions are then released from the cell to infect new cells and further the infection spread (Gamblin and Skehel, 2010). It is also thought that NA aids viral infectivity by breaking down the mucins in the respiratory tract secretions to allow the penetration of the virus to the respiratory epithelium and may play a role in viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells (Matrosovich et al., 2004). A total of 36 NA interactors were found across the various studies. These proteins are involved in fatty acid metabolism (i.e., TECR and HACD3); focal adhesion tight and adherens junction (i.e., ACTN1 and ACTN4), and cell cycle (i.e., MCM7 and PRKDC) via KEGG analysis (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S2A). Functional analysis of NA interactors found that the most highly enriched processes were intra-Golgi vesicle transport and vesicle transport (i.e., COPB2, COPA, and COPG1; Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure S2B). Given that acetylation of α-tubulin occurs as part of the viral release (Husain and Harrod, 2011), this would suggest that NA is involved in this mechanism. NP, PB1, PB2, PA Interactors Are Involved in Spliceosome Activity NP is a structural protein with no enzymatic activity but is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells (Hu et al., 2017). It is an important part of the vRNP complex and its functions include RNA packing (Eisfeld et al., 2015), nuclear trafficking (Amorim et al., 2013; Chutiwitoonchai and Aida, 2016), and vRNA transcription and replication (Eisfeld et al., 2015). A NP monomer has a molecular weight of 56 kDa that is able to bind to 24 bases of RNA (Hu et al., 2017). It is crescent-shaped with head, body, RNA binding, and tail domains (Cianci et al., 2013). The residues in the basic loop (residues 73–91) were found to be required for RNA binding (Ng et al., 2008). NP oligomerization occurs via a flexible tail-loop (residues 402–428) that can insert into the body domain of a neighboring NP monomer (Ye et al., 2006). This tail insertion is facilitated by R419 and E339 which forms a critical salt bridge for stabilization (Cianci et al., 2013). NP also directly interacts with PB1 and PB2 subunits of the viral polymerase (Biswas et al., 1998; Fodor, 2013; Eisfeld et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2017). The C-terminus of NP (aa 340 to 498) contains a PB2 binding site and a sequence that regulates the NP-PB2 interaction. In addition to its role in the vRNP, NP has been found to induce apoptosis in host cells (Tripathi et al., 2013; Nailwal et al., 2015) and inhibit PKR activation via Hsp40 (Sharma et al., 2011). The vRNP polymerase complex is a heterotrimer formed together by PB1 with PB2 and PA in the viral polymerase (Eisfeld et al., 2015). PB1 itself has the polymerase activity and is enclosed by the PA linker on one side (Ma et al., 2017) and the N-terminal domain of PB2 at the other side (Stevaert and Naesens, 2016). PA contains the endonuclease domain while PB2 has the cap-binding domain (te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016). The LLFL motif in PB1 N-terminus (residue 7–10) interacts with the PA C-terminus hydrophobic core (F411, M595, L666, W706, F710, V636, and L640; Massari et al., 2016). Based on a crystal structure, the C-terminus of PB1 (residues 678–757) was found to complex with the N-terminus of PB2 (residues 1–37; Sugiyama et al., 2009). Among the three subunits of the vRNP polymerase complex, PB1 had the least interactome studies and the least number of interactors. The most identified interactor for PB1 was PP6R3. Among all the studies, PA had 316 interactors while NP had 51 interactors and PB2 had 45 interactors. The interactors of NP, PB2, and PA are mostly involved in spliceosome based on the KEGG pathway (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figures S3A–C). The common process for all the interactors of NP, PB2, and PB1 is the transportation of proteins into the nucleus (i.e., NCBP1, SRSF1, PHAX, U2AF1, SRRM1, BAG3, UBR5, and IPO5; Figure 2B; Supplementary Figures S3D–G). This is expected as the vRNP is required to enter the nucleus for viral replication. In addition, spliceosome pathway is a common process for the interactors of all the vRNP components (i.e., SF3B4, DDX5, SF3B2, SF3B3, SF3B6, SRSF1, U2AF1, CHERP, TRA2B, DHX15, SRSF3, SRSF6, SRSF7, SF3B1, RBMX, DDX5, FXR2, NCBP1, PCBP1, and SNRPA). These interactors are also involved in general RNA processing (Supplementary Figures S3D–G). This may explain the spliceosome being identified with these host interactors, since the spliceosome is part of the RNA processing pathway (Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010; Wilkinson et al., 2020). This is a unique observation as NS1 has traditionally been the viral protein associated with spliceosome inhibition due to its binding to CPSF4 (Twu et al., 2006; Ramos et al., 2013). It was previously reported that the vRNP complex is required to stabilize the NS1-CPSF30 complex, specifically NP and PA (Kuo and Krug, 2009). However, the role of the viral polymerase complex alone in spliceosome regulation has yet to be studied. The proteasome pathway was a specific pathway identified for PA interactors (i.e., PSMD6, PSMD7, PSMD4, PSMD2, PSMD3, and PSMD1). This would correlate to other studies which has found that treatment with proteasome inhibitors resulted in an antiviral state in cells (Dudek et al., 2010; Haasbach et al., 2011). It was also reported that treatment with the clinical approved proteasomal inhibitor PS-341 resulted in degradation of IκB and the activation of NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 pathway (Dudek et al., 2010). Hence, this suggests that the proteasomal pathway may be present a novel method of targeting influenza. An interesting finding was that Annexin A2 (ANXA2) was identified as an interactor of PA across 3 papers (Bradel-Tretheway et al., 2011; Watanabe et al., 2014; Heaton et al., 2016) and HPIDB. Previously, it was reported that ANXA2 binds to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza NS1 to enhance viral replication. Moreover, ANXA2 is incorporated into IAV particles to enhance viral replication, via the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (LeBouder et al., 2008). M2 Interactors Are Involved in Fatty Acid Metabolism The M gene encodes for both M1 and M2 proteins (Lamb et al., 1981). M1 protein consists of 252 amino acids, with 2 domains (N-terminal domain from amino acid 1 to 164 and the C-terminal domain from amino acid 165 to 252) linked by a protease-sensitive loop (Ito et al., 1991). It forms the matrix layer by oligomerizing directly below the lipid envelope and binds the viral ribonucleoproteins. It has the important function of stabilizing the whole envelope structure of a fully formed virion (Harris et al., 2001; Calder et al., 2010; Schaap et al., 2012; Adachi et al., 2017). M1 contacts with both viral RNA and NP, promoting the vRNP complex formation and cause the RNP dissociation from the nuclear matrix (Wakefield and Brownlee, 1989; Elster et al., 1994, 1997; Nasser et al., 1996; Chaimayo et al., 2017). M1 plays an important role in assembly by recruiting viral components to the assembly and an essential role in budding, such as viral particle formation (Gómez-Puertas et al., 2000; Latham and Galarza, 2001). M1 had the least interactome studies and only three common interactors were found: EZRI, HSP7C, and STAU1. Based on these three interactors, the interactors were found to be positive regulators of virus replication (Figure 2; Supplementary Figures S4A,B). The M2 protein comprises of 97 amino acids with three domains: extracellular (24 amino acids), transmembrane domain (19 amino acids), and cytoplasmic domain (54 amino acids). It is a membrane protein which is inserted into the viral envelope and projects from the surface of the virus as tetramers (Lamb et al., 1985; Holsinger and Alams, 1991). The M2 protein is a proton channel and is required in the acidification of the viral particle upon endocytosis (Lamb et al., 1985) and prior to membrane fusion to enable the release of vRNPs into the cytosol (Helenius, 1992). It is also required to prevent the Golgi lumen pH from becoming too acidic so that the nascent HA do not undergo premature conformational arrangement while being transported to the plasma membrane (Sugrue and Hay, 1991). Eighty-nine host proteins were found to interact with M2 across the various interactome studies. The most common interactors were 4F2, AFG32, ECHB, SPTC1, and TMX3. KEGG analysis revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in fatty acid metabolism (i.e., TECR and HACD3) and DNA replication (i.e., RFC3 and MCM7; Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S4C). Functional enrichment analysis showed that these proteins were involved in vesicle transport (i.e., COPB2, COPA, ZW10, GBF1, and COPG1; Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure S4D). Given that ubiquitination of M2 is required for viral packaging and release (Su et al., 2018), this would confirm the importance of the vesicle pathway for influenza via M2. An interesting observation was the involvement of M2 interactors in fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid oxidation was found to be reduced in influenza-infected mice (Ohno et al., 2020), while supplying palmitic acid increased influenza replication (Limsuwat et al., 2020). Influenza replication could be reduced by a fatty acid import inhibitor (Limsuwat et al., 2020). Hence, this would suggest that M2 may be involved in the fatty acid metabolism dysregulation caused by influenza infection. In addition, a recent study reported that M2 clustering which enables membrane scission is mediated by cholesterol (Elkins et al., 2017). Given that cholesterol is involved in viral membrane fusion, viral genome release, and viral budding, this may explain the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering drugs, gemfibrozil, and lovastatin in reducing the stability and infectivity of progeny virus (Bajimaya et al., 2017). It was also demonstrated that overexpression of Annexin A6 as well as the addition of U18666A, a hydrophobic polyamine, was able to reduce cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane and inhibit viral replication (Musiol et al., 2013). NS1 Interacting Partners Are Involved in Spliceosome and Autophagy NS1 is not part of the virion structural component, but it is expressed at high levels in infected cells (Hale et al., 2008). It is composed of 231–237 amino acids, depending on the strain, and has a molecular mass of around 26 kDa (Hale et al., 2008). It has two distinct functional domains: an N-terminal RNA binding domain (amino acids 1–73) and a C-terminal effector domain (amino acids 86-231/237), which mediates binding with host cell proteins (Wang et al., 2002; Kochs et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008; Das et al., 2010). NS1 was reported to have multiple functions that contribute to viral replication and virulence (Kochs et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008; Fournier et al., 2014). These include: (i) temporarily regulating viral RNA synthesis (Hale et al., 2008; Ayllon and García-Sastre, 2015); (ii) viral mRNA splicing control (Hale et al., 2008, Ayllon and García-Sastre, 2015); (iii) enhancing viral mRNA translation via PKR inhibition (Li et al., 2006); (iv) regulating the creation of the virus particle structure (Hale et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2017); (v) suppressing the host immune or apoptotic responses (Ehrhardt et al., 2007; Kochs et al., 2007; Iwai et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2010; Mata et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2012; Anastasina et al., 2016); (vi) activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Ehrhardt et al., 2007; Gaur et al., 2011; Ayllon and García-Sastre, 2015); and (vii) involvement in strain-dependent pathogenesis (Hale et al., 2008). NS1 exists as a homodimer. The RNA binding domain binds to RNA and the binding is dependent on R38 and other charged residues, such as R35 and K41 (Lalime and Pekosz, 2014; Ayllon and García-Sastre, 2015). In addition, the effector domain of NS1 has been found to bind to CPSF30, which results in reduced IFN-β mRNA production. The key amino acid residue for the CPSF30 interaction is W187 (Engel, 2013). Moreover, multiple mutations in NS1 have been found to increase virulence (Ozawa et al., 2011; DeDiego et al., 2016) and viral pathogenicity (Ehrhardt et al., 2007; Engel, 2013; Nogales et al., 2017). NS1 had the most interactome studies among all the viral proteins. A total of 252 interactors were found among the interactome studies. The most common interactor found was STAU1 found in nine studies, followed by PRKRA. Based on the KEGG pathway, these interactors are involved in spliceosome (i.e., SF3B2, SNW1, FUS, NCBP2, PCBP1, TRA2B, TRA2A, DHX15, SRSF3, SRSF6, SRSF7, and RBMX) and autophagy (i.e., IRS1, BAD, IRS4, RAF1, and TANK; Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S5A). Enrichr analysis also revealed that these interacting partners are involved in mRNA splicing (i.e., DDX17, PRDX6, QKI, FXR1, PTBP1, FXR2, SNW1, SON, TRA2B, TRA2A, SRSF3, SRSF6, SRSF7, and RBMX) and RNA processing (i.e., CPSF4, SF3B2, CHTOP, RBM14, CPSF1, FUS, NCBP2, CPSF2, PTBP1, SNW1, SON, PCBP1, TRA2B, TRA2A, DHX15, SRSF3, RALY, SRSF6, SRSF7, and RBMX; Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure S5B). NS1 is a well-known interactor of the spliceosome pathway, given its interactions with CPSF4 and NS1-BP (Wolff et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). It has been previously reported that NS1 interacts with hnRNP-F to modulate host mRNA processing (Lee et al., 2010). In addition, NS1 is required for unspliced M1 nuclear export (Pereira et al., 2017). NS1 is also a well-known inducer of autophagy (Zhirnov and Klenk, 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). It was previously reported that NS1 induced autophagy via its interaction with JNK (Zhang et al., 2019). NS2 Interactors Are Mainly Involved in Focal Adhesion and ECM–Receptor Interaction NEP or non-structural protein 2 (NS2) is a structural protein and is associated with M1 (Yasuda et al., 1993). NEP mediates vRNP nuclear export into the cytoplasm via an export signal (O’Neill et al., 1998) through XPO1 interaction (Neumann et al., 2000). NEP has also been found to interact with nucleoporins and is suggested to act as an adaptor between vRNPs and the nuclear pore complex (O’Neill et al., 1998). It has been proposed that NEP is involved in the transcription and replication of the influenza virus (Robb et al., 2009). Forty host proteins were found to be NS2 interactors across the different studies. These proteins are involved in focal adhesion and ECM–receptor interaction (i.e., LAMC3, ZYX, and LAMB1), and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (i.e., PIAS3 and SKP1) via KEGG analysis (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S6A). Functional enrichment analysis showed that these proteins are involved in microtubule reorganization (i.e., DCTN2, CENPH, and ZWINT) and ER-Golgi transport (i.e., COG8 and COG6; Figure 2; Supplementary Figure S6B). Influenza Interacting Partners Are Involved in the Spliceosome, Focal Adhesions, and Protein Processing in the ER A global analysis of the protein interactors revealed that most of these interactors are involved in the spliceosome, followed by focal adhesion and protein processing in the ER via KEGG analysis. Given the large proportion of NS1 interactome studies, this may have resulted in spliceosome being the top process. However, it was interesting to note that focal adhesion and protein processing in the ER was one of the top processes revealed for influenza interactors. A previous study revealed that actin reorganization is required for influenza assembly and budding via cofilin-1 phosphorylation (Liu et al., 2014). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (non-PTK) and part of focal adhesions that tether actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. It was previously shown that FAK is involved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activation and reorganization of cytoskeleton for endosomal trafficking during IAV entry (Elbahesh et al., 2014). In addition, FAK was found to positively regulate IAV replication and polymerase activity of different IAV strains (Elbahesh et al., 2016). FAK-dependent regulation of innate immune responses was observed during severe IAV infection in mice (Bergmann and Elbahesh, 2019). Given that HA, NA, and NS2 have interactors involved in focal adhesions or ECM, this may be a potential target for novel influenza therapy. In addition, a novel finding was the involvement of these interactors in protein processing in the ER. Figure 3 describes the interaction of the influenza proteins and host proteins involved in ER protein processing. It was previously reported that influenza modulates vesicle trafficking via disruption of the Golgi complex (Yadav et al., 2016). In addition, brefeldin A, an ER to Golgi transport inhibitor, was found to affect the intracellular distribution of HA (Russ et al., 1991; Ciampor et al., 1997) and induce apoptosis in influenza-infected cells (Saito et al., 1996). Monensin, a Golgi complex disruptor, was found to reduce viral budding and HA localization to the cell membrane (Edwardson, 1984). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. A network analysis of influenza proteins and host proteins involved in ER protein processing. Proteins classified as belonging to the ER protein processing pathway were analyzed by STRING database. The viral proteins are represented by orange triangles and host interactors are represented by green hexagons. Each interaction is represented by edges connecting the two nodes with the arrow reflecting a positive association between two proteins. Given the role of influenza proteins, NS1, NP, PA, and PB1 in spliceosome activity, targeting this pathway may be a potential target for influenza. Cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1) is a kinase that regulates alternative splicing of pre-mRNA (Bullock et al., 2009). CLK1 inhibition by TG003 or CLK1 knockdown was shown to decrease M2 mRNA generation and downstream M2 protein expression, thus reducing IAV propagation (Karlas et al., 2010). A total of 190 host proteins had more than 1 viral protein interaction. 4F2 was the most promiscuous host protein with 6 viral protein interactions. ADT3, ANXA2, PSD11, PSD12, PSD13, and TCPE had 5 viral protein interactions each. Given that these proteins have interactions with multiple viral proteins, this may indicate that these proteins are key for multiple aspects of viral replication and life cycle and, hence, should be further studied for novel host-directed therapy. Conclusions and Future work Identifying novel host interactors in influenza is key in understanding the viral life cycle as well as for the development of novel therapies against the virus. Our review of influenza interactors has comprehensively compiled influenza interactome studies together with host–virus interaction databases. While other studies have done interactome studies on influenza proteins, no study has done a comprehensive review on influenza interactors. Using interactome studies to derive our data set also enables a more direct virus–host interaction compared to RNAi studies and would include essential genes which may lead to cell death in RNAi studies, thus reducing false negatives (Watanabe et al., 2010). While Watanabe et al. (2010) and Tripathi et al. (2015) both did meta-analysis of RNAi studies, no other study has done a meta-analysis of interactome studies for influenza. Our study has revealed novel influenza interactors which can be potentially targeted for novel therapies against influenza. It also filters out possible false positives that may be derived from a single interactome study. Given that we used a benchmark of at least three separate studies to filter out true positive, this would reflect the sensitivity of our study to detect conserved host interactors of influenza. Moreover, given that our study included various strains of influenza A, this would increase the likelihood that these pathways are globally used by all influenza A strains for their life cycle. Hence, these pathways can be further studied as potential universal therapy against influenza. Based on our bioinformatics analysis of influenza proteins, we observed that protein transport to the ER is one of the top biological processes exploited by influenza (Figure 2). This supports the previous study by Heaton et al. (2016), where they identified Sec61 knockdown was found to reduce influenza replication. This suggests that the protein transport to the ER is one of the key processes that influenza exploits for its life cycle. In addition, ER transport is a key process in the innate immunity. A member of the COPII complex, Sec13, was previously identified in a CRIPSR knockout screen to reduce influenza replication (Li et al., 2020). This would support the important role of ER processing for influenza. Hence, more studies into how it can be targeted for influenza treatment should be undertaken. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and IFN-β, are secreted (Murray and Stow, 2014) via the ER-Golgi pathway. Influenza’s control over this pathway would enable it to replicate without detection from immune cells and this would reflect the importance of the protein transport system. Moreover, influenza’s ability to overstimulate the immune response via cytokine storm has been shown to be correlated to virus virulence (Kido, 2015; Li et al., 2018; Short et al., 2018). This correlates with other RNAi studies performed in influenza which reflect the importance of the ER to Golgi transport pathway in viral replication (Tripathi et al., 2015). Given the importance of post-translational modification of influenza proteins in viral replication and host response, as discussed by Hu et al. (2020), this would be a potential target for influenza treatment, especially in the context of severe influenza. This finding can be extrapolated to other viruses as discussed in the review (Ravindran et al., 2016). Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were described to hijack the ER for replication. HIV utilizes the ER to synthesize its envelope glycoprotein (Checkley et al., 2011). Antiviral therapeutics that impair ER-resident glycan trimming enzymes α-glucosidases I and II have been shown inhibit viral infection by DNA and RNA viruses (Chang et al., 2013). Moreover, an inhibitor against HSP70, a cytosolic chaperone that controls ER-associated degradation, has been shown to inhibit flavivirus infection (Taguwa et al., 2015). Future work would be to validate the targets identified in this review via in vitro and in vivo models. However, this review has reflected the key processes that can be potentially targeted for host-directed therapy against influenza. Given the key role these processes play in influenza as well as normal host cell maintenance, it would be important to find key differences between normal cellular maintenance and viral infection. This would enable specific targeting of influenza-driven pathways without killing the host. Another aspect that would need to be studied is how these processes contribute to severe influenza, which is still currently unknown. Therefore, a more detailed analysis of IAV–host interactions would provide clues for therapeutic targeting and molecular mechanisms of viral replication.

Funding for this project was provided by the S.C. General Assembly through the K-12 Technology Initiative. Open in new tab History in a nutshell.While many young men were off fighting the Great War, South Carolina, like many other states, was fighting a war of its own at home.This time, the fight was against Mother Nature.While mankind was busy innovating weapons for war, Mother Nature devised a deadly creation of her own.An influenza pandemic known as the Spanish Flu was spreading all over the world in 1918.Not to be confused with an epidemic, which is a widespread sickness localized to one country or region, a pandemic affects the whole world.It was popularly believed that this strain of influenza originated in Spain, but this is not the case.Since Spain was neutral during World War I, it was not affected by wartime censorship restrictions.Spain was the only country reporting about the pandemic in early 1918, hence why people thought the sickness originated there.With the outbreak of the Spanish Flu in January 1918, the flu would eventually spread from the war in Europe to the eastern United States including South Carolina.Influenza first arrived in South Carolina in Abbeville county in September 1918.The South Carolina State Board of Health concluded several reasons why the flu first appeared in the Piedmont area.First was the direct railroad connection between South Carolina and Kansas where the pandemic first appeared in the United States.The other was due to the upstate being more densely populated than any other part of the state.The flu spread rapidly in that region due to the increasing popularity of cotton mills drawing people in from the rural areas with work opportunities.The nature of the work in the cotton mills working in close quarters around many people made for a prime breeding ground for influenza and pneumonia.It would not be long before the flu would make its way throughout the state.The flu hit both rural and urban areas alike during World War I era South Carolina.Urban areas in South Carolina suffered much worse compared to their rural cousins.Counties such as Dillon, Greenville, Richland and Charleston were hit much harder than Beaufort, Cherokee, Fairfield, Colleton and Saluda just to name a few.Rural areas fared better against the flu compared to their urban counterparts.In rural areas people primarily gathered in churches and schools, where as in urban areas larger populations meant more people in many different places.Another reason Greenville, Richland and Charleston were among the worst was due to the military installations in place there.Camp Sevier in Greenville, Camp Jackson in Richland and the Navy Base in Charleston.Soldiers, Marines and Sailors alike regularly passed through these installations during the war.The close quarter environments and poor sanitation enabled the flu to spread like wildfire.News of the flu spread rapidly throughout South Carolina's communities.This caused mass panic and hysteria throughout the state and efforts need to be taken to quell both the flu and the panic.The state government rallied together community leaders to come up with solutions to combat the flu pandemic.A general quarantine was put into effect where patients along with the doctors and nurses treating them had to be isolated for a minimum of five days before returning to work, school or other functions.In addition, many wore gauze or cloth masks to prevent the spread of infection by coughing or sneezing.On October 7th, 1918, the state government directed local health officers and county sheriffs to perform a mandatory shut down of schools, churches and picture shows and to prevent other public gatherings.Local businesses throughout the state were encouraged to shut down as well, such as cotton mills, banks and general stores.High volume gatherings were discouraged for fear of spreading the pandemic.When conditions improved throughout South Carolina communities, local authorities could lift quarantines at their discretion.However, authorities could renew the quarantine should the flu return.The pandemic dealt a major blow to South Carolina's economy, which was mostly agrarian.With the outbreak of the flu many farm hands and textile workers were incapacitated and thus production of cotton textiles were significantly slowed.Companies lost money with many people at home sick.Little to no work could be done.The health care industry on the other hand, experienced a major boom.Patients flooded hospitals and doctors offices.The medical field was a male dominated industry at the time.And many of the doctors were off fighting World War I, serving as combat medics and field surgeons.Women now began to fill roles once held by men, allowing them opportunities for additional education and filling shortages in the medical field.Societal norms and laws from the period also contributed to the number of deaths in South Carolina.Jim Crow laws made conditions even worse for African American communities compared to white communities.When comparing the infection and death statistics throughout the state, in most cases more African Americans died from the pandemic compared to whites.Segregation hindered African American patients and health care professionals from accessing healthcare facilities.As a result, African American communities became responsible for their own health care in combating the flu.The pandemic in the United States lasted until about 1920, but the pandemic in South Carolina slowed down mid 1919.South Carolina whether the pandemic without any real forms of medicine, protection against influenza would finally appear in 1938 with the development of a vaccine by Jonas Salk and Thomas Francis.While it is not one hundred percent guaranteed protection, given influenza's mutative nature.Getting your flu shot every year and practicing good hygiene are encouraged, since they are our only protection against the flu.More History ShowsOur SitesPBS KIDSParentsFoodArtsDigital StudiosPBS.org Lite SitePBS LearningMediaBlack

However, little is known about the interactions of viral proteins with surface PRRs or, more importantly, the association of innate immune activation with viral pathogenesis. In this study, we showed that internal influenza virus proteins were released from infected cells. Among these proteins, nucleoprotein (NP) played a critical role in viral pathogenesis by stimulating neighboring cells through toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Through the activation of these PRRs, NP induced the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, which subsequently led to the induction of trypsin. Trypsin induced by NP increased the infectivity of influenza virus, leading to increases in viral replication and pathology upon subsequent viral infection. These results reveal the role of released NP in influenza pathogenesis and highlight the importance of the interactions of internal viral proteins with PRRs in the extracellular compartment during viral pathogenesis.

Although several vaccines and therapeutic agents are commercially available, frequent antigenic changes might render them less effective or inapplicable [1]. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis is required for the development of novel antiviral approaches.Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the first line of defense of the host innate immune system, which provides immediate protection against infectious pathogens. PRRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the activation of responses by the innate immune system, such as the production of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and subsequent infiltration of immune cells to the infection site [2]. These are critical events for viral clearance. For example, activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, retinoic-acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) by influenza virus RNA leads to the production of type I interferons (IFNs), which are critical factors for antiviral immunity during the initial stage of infection [3].PRR activation, however, often results in increased viral pathogenesis. Influenza virus proteins such as PB1-F2 and M2 increase viral pathogenesis through the activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [4, 5]. In addition, surface glycoproteins of dengue virus, Ebola virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus are known to directly interact with TLR4, leading to virus-induced inflammation [6,7,8]. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by TLR2 to induce inflammatory cytokine production [9]. Therefore, further investigation into the interactions between viral proteins and host PRRs is imperative for understanding the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic measures.In this study, we investigated the role of influenza virus proteins in viral pathogenesis mediated via PRR activation in a mouse model. The release of nucleoprotein (NP) from infected cells triggered innate immune activation via a direct interaction with TLR4 on monocytic cells. These results suggest a pathogenic role for NP in influenza virus pathogenesis and a new perspective on the interaction mode between internal viral proteins and PRRs on neighboring cells in the extracellular compartment.Materials and methodsMiceSeven- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from KOATECH (Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and maintained in a specific pathogen-free, biosafety level-2 facility at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB). TLR2 KO and TLR4 KO mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and TLR2/4 DKO mice were generated by breeding TLR2 KO and TLR4 KO mice. NLRP3 KO and caspase-1/11 KO mice were obtained from Prof. Gabriel Nuñez at the University of Michigan (USA). MyD88 KO and TRIF KO mice were obtained from Profs. Sin-Hyeog Im and Kwang Soon Kim at POSTECH (Korea). In this study, only female mice were used, and the mice were 8–12 weeks old. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the KRIBB and performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.Cell cultureTHP-1 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Corning, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA) and 1× antibiotics (Gibco, Massachusetts, USA). HEK Blue TLR (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), L929 (ATCC), MDCK (ATCC), and A549 (ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone) and 1× antibiotics (Gibco). BMDMs were generated from C57BL/6 N, TLR2 KO, TLR4 KO, TLR2/4 DKO, NLRP3 KO, caspase-1/11 DKO, MyD88 KO, and TRIF KO mice. For the preparation of BMDMs, bone marrow cells were harvested from the femur and tibia and differentiated in DMEM (Corning) containing 25% L929-conditioned medium, 10% FBS (HyClone), and 1× antibiotics (Gibco). L929 cells were grown until confluent in DMEM containing 10% FBS (HyClone) and 1× antibiotics (Gibco). The medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for 7 days, after which the supernatants were harvested and filtered. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2.VirusThe influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) virus was cultivated in the allantoic cavities of embryonated chicken eggs. Viruses were titrated by calculating the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) and stored at –80 °C until use.Plasmid DNA cloning for immunization and protein expressionRecombinant DNA was used for mouse immunization. For protein expression and purification, DNA fragments suitable for cloning of NP and the R416A mutant were cloned into pEXPR-IBA 103 vectors (IBA Lifesciences, Göttingen, Germany). Recombinant plasmid DNA expressing NP, M1, PA, PB1, PB2, NS1, NS2, and PB1-F2 was constructed in the DNA vector pGX-10. pGX-10 is a DNA vaccine vector composed of a CMV promoter, a tripartite leader sequence, a late poly A signal sequence of simian virus 40, a simian virus 40 enhancer, and a kanamycin resistance gene [10]. The NP, M1, PA, PB1, PB2, and NS1 genes were obtained from the PR8 virus, and the R416A mutant NP, NS2, and PB1-F2 genes were synthesized by CosmogenTech (Seoul, Korea).Protein purificationThe pEXPR-IBA 103-NP plasmid was obtained using a maxi prep kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). DNA was transfected into ExpiCHO cells using a transfection system (Gibco), and enhancers and feeds were added 20 h after transfection (Gibco). After 5 days of transfection, the cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed. A 1× strep wash buffer (IBA Lifesciences) was added to the cells, sonication (58%, 10 s on/10 s off, total time: 10 min) was performed, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. After filtering the supernatant using a 0.45-μm filter (Corning), it was bound to strep-tactin XT resin (IBA Lifesciences) using a gravity flow column. After washing with 5 bed volumes of 1X wash buffer (IBA Lifesciences), the bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (IBA Lifesciences) . The endotoxin level in the purified protein sample was determined using an endotoxin test kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Protein sample was stored at –80 °C until use.Serum harvest and antibody purificationMice were immunized intramuscularly with NP-, M1-, PA-, PB1-, PB2-, NS1-, NS2-, and PB1-F2-expressing plasmid DNA (10 μg) by electrophoresis. Mice were immunized twice, with a 3-week interval between the immunizations. Serum was obtained 2 weeks after the final vaccination. Anti-NP serum was purified from the serum of mock- or NP-vaccinated mice using an serum antibody purification kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Serum and purified antibodies were stored at −20 °C.Experimental scheduleMice were infected intranasally with the PR8 virus. The immune cell population in the lungs and the levels of viral proteins in the BALF were determined at each indicated time point. To investigate the functions of the influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle induced by NP, mice were infected with the PR8 virus (32 PFU) 3 days pre- and post-injection of PBS, NP, IL-1ß (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), or IL-6 (R&D Systems) or infected with virus treated with trypsin. For serum transfer, 200 μl of anti-NP serum or purified serum IgG (200 μg) was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity daily for 3 days. NK cells were depleted by intraperitoneal injection of an anti-mouse NK1.1 antibody (100 μg/mouse, PK136; BioLegend). Two days after NK-cell depletion, mice were infected with influenza virus. The body weight change and survival rate of mice were monitored for 14 days after infection with influenza virus.Lung and BALF samplingTotal lung samples were obtained at the indicated time points. Lungs were minced, and 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing collagenase D (150 unit/ml, Gibco), DNase I (50 μg/ml, Merck, Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA), 10% FBS, and 1× antibiotics was added and incubated for 90 min. Then, 3 μl of 0.5 M EDTA was added to the mixture and allowed to react for 20 min. Cells were separated from the lung tissue using a strainer (SPL). The lung cells were treated with RBC lysis buffer (BD Biosciences) for RBC lysis. For BALF sampling, after euthanasia, the trachea was catheterized, and the BALF was collected by flushing the lungs twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (Merck). Cells were removed via centrifugation (4000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), and the BALF was obtained and stored at –80 °C.Viral titrationMDCK cells were cultured in MEM containing 10% FBS and 1× antibiotics and seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 16 h, the medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS, and MEM containing 3.33 g/ml bovine serum albumin and 1× antibiotics was added. Influenza virus was treated with NP-treated BMDM culture supernatant with/without a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 37 °C for 1 h and then used to infect the cells for 1 h. After infection, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and cultured in MEM containing 10% FBS (HyClone) and 1× antibiotics (Gibco). Three days after infection, the viral titer was determined with a hemagglutinin test and calculated by the Reed and Muench method. The viral titer is expressed as log10 of the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per milliliter. For qRT–PCR, total RNA was extracted from influenza virus-infected MDCK cells using an RNA prep kit (Clontech, California, USA). cDNA synthesis and RT–PCR were performed using the qRT–PCR Kit [Green] (NANOHELIX, Daejeon, Korea). M gene RT–PCR was performed. The fold difference in mRNA expression between treatment groups was determined by the standard delta-delta Ct method. GAPDH was used as an internal control.Viral protein detection in the infected MDCK cell culture supernatantMDCK or THP-1 cells were infected with the PR8 virus (103 TCID50/ml), and A549 cells were infected with the PR8 virus (0.01 MOI) for 72 h. Subsequently, the cell culture supernatant was harvested by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cells from the culture supernatant. The cell culture supernatant was filtered using a 50-nm syringe filter. The influenza virus-infected MDCK cell culture supernatant was separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (sucrose 20–60%, 32000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C). Viral proteins were detected in unfiltered, filtered, and ultracentrifuged samples using ELISA.TLR reporter cell line assayA TLR reporter cell line system that monitored TLR activity using secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) induced by NF-κB and AP-1 activation was used. HEK-Blue™ Detection (InvivoGen) reacts with SEAP to turn the medium color purple/blue, and the color intensity can be measured with a spectrophotometer. The TLR reporter cell lines (InvivoGen) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1× antibiotics. When the cells reached 80% confluent, they were washed with PBS, and detection medium was added to harvest the cells using a scraper. Cells (5 × 104 cells/well; 180 μl) were seeded in a 96-well plate, and 20 μl of PBS, samples, PAM3 (Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), LPS (Invitrogen), poly I:C (Invitrogen), flagellin (Invitrogen), R848 (Invitrogen), or CpG-ODN (Invitrogen) was added to each well. Then, the cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% humidity for 20 h, and the absorbance at 630 nm was recorded.Flow cytometrySingle-lung-cell suspensions were blocked using anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (mouse BD Fc block, BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA) at room temperature for 15 min prior to staining. Surface antigens were stained with the indicated conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 15 min. The following antibodies were used: APC-conjugated anti-CD4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), PerCP-eFluor 710-conjugated anti-CD3e (Thermo Fisher Scientific), PE-Cyanine7-conjugated anti-CD45R (Thermo Fisher Scientific), APC/Cyanine7-conjugated anti-CD45 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PE-conjugated anti-Siglec-F (Thermo Fisher Scientific), PerCD-eFluor710-conjugated anti-Ly6G, Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated anti-MHC Class II (I-A/I-E) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), eFluor 450-conjugated anti-F4/80 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), APC-conjugated anti-CD11b (BioLegend), FITC-conjugated anti-NK1.1 (BD Biosciences), PE-conjugated anti-CD49b (BioLegend), and PerCP-e710-conjugated anti-CD3e (BD Biosciences). For all experiments, cells were analyzed using a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Panel setup and fluorescence compensation were performed using UltraCompeBeads™ Compensation Beads (Invitrogen). All analyses were performed using FlowJo software (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey, USA).ELISABMDMs, A549 cells, and THP-1 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well, and the THP-1 cells were treated with a TLR4 inhibitor (Merck) or an NLRP3 inhibitor (InvivoGen) for 1 h. The cells were treated with purified NP, PAM3 (InvivoGen), LPS (InvivoGen), and ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA). The BMDMs were treated with 50-nm-filtered infected cell culture supernatant and anti-NP serum. At 20 h after treatment, the supernatant was collected. BALF samples were obtained from mice at the indicated time points. Cytokines were measured in cell culture supernatants and BALF samples with IL-1β (R&D Systems), IL-6 (R&D Systems), CCL2 (R&D Systems), RANTES (R&D Systems), keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) (R&D Systems), and trypsin (MY BioSource, San Diego, USA) ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol.For the detection of interaction between NP and TLRs, TLR2 (LSBio) and TLR4 (LSBio) proteins were used to coat an ELISA plate (Corning) at a concentration of 2 μg/mL (50 μl/well). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, blocking was performed using 3% skim milk. NP was added at a concentration of 6.25–100 μg/ml (with/without purified serum anti-NP IgG) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, an anti-NP antibody (Abcam) was diluted at 1:200, and 50 μl/well was added for 1 h. Then, anti-mouse total IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) was diluted at 1:5000, and 50 μl/well was added for 1 h. Thereafter, a colorimetric reaction was performed by adding 50 μl/well TMB solution and then 25 μl/well 0.5 N H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was then recorded.Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (IP)MDCK cells were infected with the PR8 virus (101–103 TCID50/ml). BMDMs, THP-1 cells, and A549 cells were treated with PBS, NP, or LPS. The cells were lysed in CETilysis buffer (TransLab) for 10 min on ice. Samples were diluted in 1× Sample Buffer (TransLab) and boiled for 10 min. The samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck). The membranes were blocked with 3% BSA (Gibco) in TBS with 0.5% Tween (TBS-T) for 1 h, after which the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times with TBS-T for 5 min and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (all diluted in 3% BSA in TBS with 0.5% Tween). The bound antibodies were visualized using Immobilon Forte Western HRP substrate (Merck) and imaged using EZ capture II (ATTO). Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were coated with the indicated antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions.BMDMs were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. The BMDMs were treated with rNP (100 μg/ml) for 30 min. The cells were treated with CETi lysis buffer (TransLab) for 10 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing antibody-coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen). IP was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed by western blot analysis. The following antibodies were used: anti-TLR2 (Abcam), anti-TLR4 (Santa Cruz, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-influenza NP (Santa Cruz, Abcam), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-IkappaB (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-rabbit IkappaB-alpha (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-NF-kappaB p65 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-NLRP3 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-caspase-1 (Enzo Life sciences, Farmingdale, New York, USA), anti-Strep-tag II (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology), and HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology).ResultsInfluenza virus proteins are released from infected cells into the extracellular compartmentDuring the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, viral proteins as well as complete viral particles can be released into the extracellular space by lytic cell death because internal viral proteins are present in the cytoplasm or nucleus of the infected cells [11]. To investigate the functions of these extracellular viral proteins in viral replication and pathogenicity, first, the presence of viral proteins released from influenza virus-infected cells was analyzed in vitro.MDCK cells were infected with the PR8 virus (103 TCID50/ml), and the culture supernatant was filtered through a filter with a pore size of 50 nm to remove intact influenza virions, as the diameter of influenza virus ranges between 80 nm and 120 nm. Internal viral proteins of influenza virus were detected at similar levels in the unfiltered and filtered culture supernatants, but the level of the envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) was decreased in the filtered supernatant (Fig. 1a). To check whether the filtered supernatant contained influenza virus, reinfection with the filtered supernatant was performed, and the TCID50, M gene replication, and viral protein expression were not increased (Fig. 1b–d). Furthermore, the detection of NP among the internal viral proteins increased in an infectious dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1e). The release of internal viral proteins was further confirmed through classic viral purification. PR8 virus-infected MDCK cell culture supernatants were subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation for virus purification. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant and sucrose were obtained by dividing the gradient into 4 fractions (Supplementary Fig. 1a). When each fraction was subjected to a TCID50 assay, fraction 1 (supernatant fraction, referred to as #1) was observed to not contain the virus, while fraction 4 (sucrose fraction, referred to as #4) contained the virus (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Similar to the results obtained using a syringe filter, internal viral proteins were detected at similar levels in fractions #1 and #4 (Supplementary Fig. 1c and d), but the level of HA was significantly reduced in #1 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). These observations indicate that virion or cell-free internal proteins exist in the culture supernatant. Consistent with the in vitro data, viral proteins, including NP, M1, and NS1, were detected in the virion-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of PR8-infected mice (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1e). These data show that influenza virus proteins are released from infected cells and exist as virion-free entities in the extracellular compartment.Fig. 1: Release of influenza virus proteins from influenza virus-infected cellsMDCK cells were infected with the PR8 virus (103 TCID50/ml) for 3 days, followed by filtration using a 50-nm syringe filter. a Internal viral proteins in the culture supernatant were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). b The viral titer was measured as TCID50/ml. c The M gene was detected by qRT–PCR, and d the M1 and NP proteins were detected by western blotting. e The supernatants of MDCK cells treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or the PR8 virus (101–103 TCID50/ml) were obtained. After filtration through a 50-nm filter, the nucleoprotein (NP) levels were measured by ELISA. f Mice (n = 4) were infected with the PR8 virus (32 PFU), and then on Days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, NP in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was detected by ELISA. The data in a–c are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) from triplicate culture wells. The data in d are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). ***p < 0.001Full size imageExtracellular NP interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 to induce proinflammatory cytokine secretionInfluenza virus infection leads to the recruitment of various immune cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells, into the lungs [12]. Given that influenza virus proteins exist outside cells, we hypothesized that viral proteins can directly interact with infiltrated immune cells in the lungs. First, we confirmed the infiltration of various immune cells upon viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 2a). NP is one of the most abundant molecules in the influenza virion [13], and it has a highly conserved amino acid sequence observed in various influenza A viruses, including the seasonal influenza virus that infects humans [14]. Therefore, to investigate the effect of NP on the behavior of innate immune cells, we purified recombinant NP (rNP) from the expiCHO cell line at an endotoxin-free level (0.16 EU/mg; Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). We investigated the inflammatory pathway induced by NP in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) because macrophages are commonly used in the study of inflammation. When BMDMs were treated with rNP, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were activated from an early time point (15 min) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a, b). rNP induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1ß and IL-6, in BMDMs (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2: Oligomeric NP interacts with and activates TLR2 and TLR4a Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with recombinant NP (rNP; 100 μg/ml) for 0–120 min or b with rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml) for 30 min. After the incubation period, the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways was detected by western blotting. c BMDMs were treated with rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml) for 20 h, and the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the cell culture supernatant were measured by ELISA. d HEK293 cells expressing TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, or TLR9 were incubated with PBS, rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml), or the corresponding ligands (1 μg/ml PAM3, 1 μg/ml poly I:C, 100 ng/ml LPS, 1 μg/ml flagellin, 1 μg/ml R848, or 1 μg/ml CpG oligodeoxynucleotide) for 20 h. After the incubation period, the absorbance was recorded at 630 nm. e BMDMs were treated with rNP (0–30 min), followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, anti-TLR4, and anti-NP antibodies. TLR2, TLR4, and NP in the coprecipitate were detected by western blotting. f rNP (6.25–100 μg/ml) was added to each well coated with recombinant TLR (rTLR) 2 (2 μg/ml) and rTLR4 (2 μg/ml). After sequential incubation and washing, NP bound to rTLRs was detected by ELISA. g TLR2 KO, TLR4 KO, and TLR2/4 DKO BMDMs were treated with rNP (100 μg/ml) for 20 h. After the incubation period, the cytokine and chemokine levels in the cell culture supernatant were determined by ELISA. HEK293 cells expressing TLR4 were cultured with PBS, LPS, h 100-kDa size-fractionated rNP (3.125–25 μg/ml), i the rNP R416A mutant (12.5–100 μg/ml), j or 25 °C, 4 °C, and –80 °C-incubated rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml). After 20 h, the absorbance was recorded at 630 nm. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate culture wells. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05Full size imageSuch responses are well-known downstream events of TLR signaling in inflammatory monocytes or macrophages [15]. Therefore, we used TLR-expressing cell lines to evaluate whether rNP can stimulate TLRs. When TLR-expressing reporter cell lines were treated with rNP, the TLR2- and TLR4-expressing cell lines were activated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2d). To investigate the physical interactions between rNP and these two TLRs, BMDMs were treated with rNP, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4, or anti-NP antibodies. In each case, NP, TLR2, and TLR4 were detected in the precipitate, indicating that rNP directly interacted with TLR2 and TLR4 (Fig. 2e). rNP also bound to recombinant TLR2 and TLR4 proteins (Fig. 2f), confirming these interactions. Subsequently, the activation of TLR downstream molecules and the production of proinflammatory factors, except IL-1ß, were significantly reduced in TLR2 KO, TLR4 KO, and TLR2/4 double knockout BMDMs upon NP treatment in a dose-dependent manner, confirming that the immunostimulatory effect of rNP depends upon TLR2 and TLR4 (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c).NP exists in the form of trimers or larger oligomers in equilibrium with monomers [16, 17]. rNP was divided into fractions of less and greater than 100 kDa to assess which quaternary structure of NP predominates in TLR stimulation. We observed that TLR4 stimulation was significantly increased when rNP with a molecular weight of 100 kDa or greater was used (Fig. 2h), suggesting that oligomeric NP has a greater stimulatory effect than monomeric NP. To confirm this possibility, we prepared R416A-mutant NP, which does not form oligomers [16], and we observed that R416A-mutant NP could not stimulate TLR4 (Fig. 2i). Purified recombinant NP is known to form trimers after 30–60 min at room temperature [16, 17]. Therefore, we purified and incubated rNP at various temperatures to assess the TLR-stimulating activity and observed that incubation with rNP at 25 °C for 18 h showed the highest TLR-stimulating activity (Fig. 2j). These findings suggest that extracellular NP can stimulate TLR4 by forming a quaternary structure of oligomers rather than monomers.Extracellular NP activates the NLRP3 inflammasomeActivation of NF-κB increases the levels of pro-IL-1ß, but the production of active IL-1ß requires the activation of the inflammasome [18]. Based on the detection of active IL-1ß following rNP treatment in BMDMs (Fig. 2c), we sought to evaluate NLRP3 inflammasome activation by exogenous NP. When BMDMs were treated with rNP, they produced IL-1ß in an rNP dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). rNP also triggered the activation of caspase-1 and oligomerization of NLRP3 (Fig. 3b, c). Notably, all of these responses were independent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming, which indicates that NP is able to activate both TLR-dependent NK-κB pathways and NLRP3-dependent inflammasome pathways. Consistent with our observations, extracellular NP-triggered IL-1ß production was abolished in NLRP3 KO and caspase-1/11 double KO BMDMs (Fig. 3d), confirming that the induction of IL-1ß is NLRP3 inflammasome dependent.Fig. 3: NP induces activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomeBMDMs were pretreated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 3 h and then treated with NP (12.5–100 μg/ml) or ATP for 20 h. a The levels of IL-1β in the cell culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. b Caspase-1 activation in the cell culture supernatant was detected by western blotting. c NLRP3 oligomerization in the cell lysate was detected by native-PAGE western blotting. d NLRP3 KO and caspase-1/11 KO BMDMs were subjected to LPS priming 3 h before rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml) or ATP exposure; after 20 h, IL-1β in the cell culture supernatant was detected by ELISA. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate culture wells. ***p < 0.001, **p< 0.01, *p < 0.05Full size imageExtracellular NP induces proinflammatory cytokines through activation of TLR4 and the NLRP3 inflammasome in human cell lines We next investigated whether influenza virus infection induces internal viral protein release and TLR and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and whether extracellular NP can be applied to human cells. PR8 virus-infected THP-1 and A549 cells showed induction of internal viral proteins, including NP release, similar to that observed in the MDCK cell line (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). In addition, rNP induced the activation of the TLR signaling cascade and the production of IL-1ß and IL-6 in THP-1 and A549 cells, which represent human monocytes and lung epithelial cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5d–g). Furthermore, a TLR4 inhibitor decreased IL-6 production, and an NLRP3 inhibitor reduced IL-1ß production in NP-treated THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5h, i). These results indicate that the release of viral proteins upon viral infection and the function of extracellular NP are not limited to the mouse model studied.Extracellular NP increases the infectivity of influenza virus by upregulating trypsinProteolytic cleavage of HA precursor (HA0) into the HA1 and HA2 subunits is a critical event for membrane fusion and productive infection by influenza virus [19]. During this process, trypsin derived from host cells plays an indispensable role [20], and viral infection upregulates the expression of trypsin via proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ß and IL-6 (Supplementary Fig. 6a) [21, 22]. This series of reactions is known as the ‘influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle’. As we observed increases in these cytokines induced by NP stimulation (Figs. 2c and 3a, and Supplementary Fig. 4c), we next assessed whether NP upregulates trypsin in host cells. When BMDMs were treated with rNP, trypsin was significantly upregulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). Consistent with this, the effect of rNP was TLR2 and TLR4 dependent, while the level of trypsin following rNP treatment was significantly decreased in TLR2-deficient, TLR4-deficient, TLR2/4 double-deficient and downstream adaptor molecule (MyD88 and TRIF)-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 4b, c). Trypsin expression was also decreased in NLRP3- and caspase-1/11-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 4d). Finally, we evaluated whether NP-triggered trypsin cleaves HA0 into an active form and increases viral infectivity. When the virus was incubated in conditioned medium from rNP-treated BMDMs, cleaved HA subunits were detected (Fig. 4e). In addition, when MDCK cells were infected with the incubated virus, viral replication was significantly increased (Fig. 4f). To investigate whether trypsin upregulation induced by extracellular NP treatment increases viral replication, rNP-treated BMDM supernatants were incubated with the virus and a protease inhibitor for 1 h. Subsequently, upon infection with the incubated virus, viral replication was significantly reduced in the protease inhibitor-treated group (Fig. 4g). These data show that extracellular NP induces trypsin in host cells, thereby increasing viral infectivity by enhancing the proteolytic cleavage of HA.Fig. 4: NP increases influenza virus infectivity via trypsin upregulationa BMDMs were treated with rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml) or LPS (1 μg/ml) for 20 h. Then, the level of trypsin in the cell culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. BMDMs derived from each KO mouse strain were treated with rNP (100 μg/ml) for 20 h. b The trypsin levels in TLR2 KO, TLR4 KO, and TLR2/4 DKO BMDMs. c The trypsin levels in MyD88 KO and TRIF KO BMDMs. d The trypsin levels of NLRP3 KO and caspase-1/11 KO BMDMs in the cell culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. e Recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein or influenza virus was incubated with rNP-treated BMDM culture supernatant for 1 h. Then, hemagglutinin cleavage was detected by western blotting. f BMDMs were treated with rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml), and the culture supernatant was collected and used to treat the PR8 virus (103 TCID50/ml) for 1 h. Then, MDCK cells were infected with the treated virus. After a 72-h incubation, the M gene levels in the infected cells were measured by qRT–PCR. g rNP (12.5–100 μg/ml)-treated BMDM culture supernatants were incubated with the PR8 virus with (or without) a protease inhibitor for 1 h, and then, MDCK cells were infected with the incubated virus. After 72 h of infection, the viral titer was detected as TCID50/ml. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate culture wells. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05Full size imageExtracellular NP contributes to an increased viral titer and influenza pathogenicity in vivoGiven that NP increases viral infectivity through the ‘influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle’ in vitro, we next investigated whether NP affects the host immune response and influenza pathogenicity in vivo. When mice were cotreated with influenza virus and trypsin or pretreated with IL-1ß and IL-6 and then infected with influenza virus, increased weight loss and a decreased survival rate were observed, suggesting that the influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle also plays an important role in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 6b–e). When mice were intranasally treated with rNP, the levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, and trypsin were significantly increased in the BALF at 6 h (Fig. 5a). Nonetheless, NP-induced inflammatory cytokines per se did not have significant effects on lung epithelial cell integrity or lung lesions (Fig. 5b, c).Fig. 5: NP contributes to an increased viral titer and influenza pathogenicity in vivoa Mice (n = 5) were treated intranasally with rNP (2–32 μg/mouse). After 6 h, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and trypsin in the BALF were measured by ELISA. b Mice (n = 5) were treated intranasally with rNP (32 μg/mouse), and albumin was measured in the BALF daily for three days. c Mice were treated intranasally with rNP (32 μg/mouse), and the histology of lung tissue was assessed after hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. d Isolated total lung cells were incubated with Alexa 488-labeled rNP (100 μg/ml) for 15 min, and NP-bound cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. e Mice (n = 6) were treated intranasally with NP (2–32 μg/ml) and subsequently infected with the PR8 virus (32 PFU) on Day 3. The survival rate was monitored for two weeks. f–h At five days post-infection, the viral load and the level of albumin in the BALF were determined. Histological analysis of lung tissue was performed after H&E staining. i Mice (n = 16) were treated intranasally with NP (2–32 μg/ml) three days prior to PR8 viral infection (32 PFU). Upon infection, the survival rate was monitored for two weeks. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05Full size imageTo identify which cell population mainly interacts with NP, we isolated immune cells from lung tissue and incubated them with Alexa488-labeled rNP. The major populations of Alexa488-positive cells were neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages (Fig. 5d), indicating that these immune cells, which express TLR2 and TLR4 [23], were the primary cells interacting with NP.We next evaluated whether rNP increases viral replication and influenza pathogenicity in vivo. Mice were treated with rNP intranasally and, 3 days later, infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus. Pretreatment with rNP significantly and dose-dependently decreased the survival rate upon subsequent infection with influenza virus compared to PBS pretreatment (Fig. 5e). Consistently, the viral titer in the lungs increased with increasing rNP doses (Fig. 5f). In addition, the albumin levels in the BALF were increased 5 days after infection with rNP pretreatment, and histological findings also showed that rNP pretreatment increased viral pathogenicity (Fig. 5g, h). In addition, treatment with rNP at 3 days post-viral infection increased the mouse fatality rate (Fig. 5i). However, in TLR4 KO and NLRP3 KO mice, pretreatment with rNP did not increase the fatality rate (Supplementary Fig. 7c, d). Altogether, these data indicate that extracellular NP substantially influences the viral titer and pathogenicity of influenza virus, mainly via stimulation of TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in vivo.Anti-NP antibody reduces the viral titer and ameliorates influenza pathogenicity in vivoGiven that NP released from infected cells increases influenza pathogenesis by triggering IL-1β and IL-6 and then trypsin, we next investigated whether NP blockade decreases the levels of these soluble factors and reduces viral replication and influenza pathogenicity in vivo. We first assessed the inhibitory effect of anti-NP antibodies on viral infection and the interaction between NP and TLR4 in vitro. Although anti-NP serum isolated from NP-immunized mice was not able to neutralize influenza virus in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8a), it significantly reduced the binding of rNP to recombinant TLR4 (Fig. 6a). Moreover, BMDMs were treated with filtered PR8 virus-infected cell culture supernatant containing anti-NP serum. Anti-NP serum reduced proinflammatory cytokine production induced by the filtered supernatant, while naïve serum did not produce this effect (Fig. 6b, c).Fig. 6: Anti-NP antibody inhibits the NP-TLR4 interaction and reduces influenza virus pathogenicitya An anti-NP antibody was incubated with rNP for 1 h at 25 °C, and then the antibody-treated NP was added to an ELISA plate coated with rTLR4 (2 μg/ml). After sequential incubation and washing, NP bound to rTLR4 was detected by ELISA. b, c MDCK cells were infected with the PR8 virus (103 TCID50/ml) for 72 h, and the cell culture supernatant was filtered using a 50-nm syringe filter. The filtered supernatant was incubated with naïve serum (1:100 diluted) or anti-NP serum (1:100 diluted). Subsequently, BMDMs were treated with the filtered supernatant for 20 h, and the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Mice (n = 6) were infected with the PR8 virus (32 PFU) and then injected with anti-NP serum (200 μl/mouse) intraperitoneally daily for three days. d Body weight was monitored for two weeks. e The TCID50 was evaluated using BALF samples obtained on Days 5 and 7 post-infection. f, g The albumin level in the BALF was measured, and the histology of lung tissue was assessed by H&E staining at 5 days post-infection. h Proinflammatory cytokines and trypsin in the BALF were measured by ELISA at five days post-infection. The data in a are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate culture wells. The data in b–f are presented as the mean ± SEM. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05Full size imageTo investigate whether anti-NP serum reduces viral pathogenicity by dampening the influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle in vivo, influenza virus-infected mice were treated with anti-NP serum, and body weight loss and the BALF viral titer were significantly reduced (Fig. 6d, e, and Supplementary Fig. 8b). Weight loss and the fatality rate were also significantly decreased by injecting IgG purified from immune poly serum in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 8c). On Day 5 post-infection with anti-NP serum, the albumin level in the BALF was significantly decreased compared to that in the naïve serum-treated group, and anti-NP serum treatment also reduced pathogenicity, as indicated by histological findings (Fig. 6f, g). To further investigate the mechanism by which NP blockade alleviates influenza severity in vivo, we measured the levels of various soluble factors following viral infection and anti-NP serum treatment. The levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, and trypsin were significantly decreased in mice in the anti-NP serum-treated group on Day 5 (Fig. 6h).Anti-NP antibodies, which cannot neutralize influenza virus, have been shown to have anti-influenza effects in vivo, presumably via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [24]. To verify whether the anti-influenza effect of anti-NP serum is mediated by ADCC, we investigated the effect of anti-NP serum on influenza after depletion of NK cells. Intraperitoneally injecting 100 μg of anti-NK1.1 antibody on Day 2 depleted approximately 95% of NK cells in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Even after the depletion of NK cells, the survival rate of mice in the anti-NP serum-injected group was significantly increased compared to that of mice in the naïve serum-injected group (Supplementary Fig. 9b). This indicates that anti-NP antibodies can lower, at least partially, influenza pathogenicity in an ADCC-independent manner.Altogether, these results indicate that anti-NP serum or purified antibodies can inhibit the interaction between NP and TLR4, thereby leading to a decrease in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and trypsin and eventually a decrease in pathogenicity in vivo.DiscussionInfluenza virus is one of the major causes of infectious disease worldwide, and its pathogenic mechanism has been widely studied. The interaction between the virus and host innate immunity is thought to be essential for type I IFN-mediated antiviral defense and the induction of antigen-specific immune responses [25] but is often highly associated with viral pathogenicity [26]. In this study, we suggest a novel mechanism by which viral NP released from influenza virus-infected cells interacts with host cell PRRs to increase influenza pathogenicity. In particular, extracellular NP stimulates TLRs on the cell surface, suggesting that internal viral proteins may have different functions at different locations.Interactions between influenza virus proteins and host cell proteins affect the adaptive immune response, viral proliferation, and/or disease pathology. NP binds to ZBP-1 and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome to induce lung epithelial cell death [27], and M2 binds to the autophagy regulatory protein LC3 to inhibit autophagy and increase viral stability [28]. Furthermore, NS1 inhibits the type I IFN response through direct binding with RIG-1 and MAVS [29]. To date, these functions have been studied in the cytoplasm of infected cells. However, in this study, we demonstrated that influenza virus proteins, which are considered to exist only in the cytoplasm or inside the virion, can also have effects outside of host cells. NP was present in cell-free and virion-free forms outside infected cells and directly bound to TLR2 and TLR4 to induce innate immune responses. We also observed that various other influenza virus proteins, such as M1 and PA, existed outside infected cells. Therefore, the extracellular functions of other internal viral proteins need to be further investigated.It has been generally regarded that internal influenza virus proteins such as NP and matrix 1 (M1) function inside infected cells, whereas external proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) function outside cells [30]. In this study, however, we showed that internal viral proteins exist outside of cells and play an immunoregulatory role in the extracellular space. Although we did not show the exact mechanism by which NP is secreted or released from infected cells, there are several possible mechanisms: (1) Influenza virus induces lytic cell death, resulting in the release of cellular viral proteins into the extracellular space [31]. (2) During the replication of influenza virus, M1 interacts with both phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane on its apical side [32] and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex on its basal side [33]. As infected cells undergo apoptosis, PS in the inner leaflet flips to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and hence, the phosphatidylserine-associated M1 and NP in the RNP complex can be exposed to the extracellular space [34]. (3) NP might be secreted or released from infected cells in the form of a complex with the high-mobility-group box 1 protein [35, 36]. Further study is required to identify the underlying mechanism for the release of internal viral proteins.TLR2 and TLR4 exist in the cytoplasmic membrane and are known to recognize PAMPs that are mainly derived from bacteria [37]. In our study, we identified for the first time the direct interactions between influenza virus NP and TLR2 or TLR4. The interactions of different viral proteins and TLRs have been previously reported. Some of these proteins include the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus, glycoprotein of Ebola virus, and glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus [6, 8, 38]. Recently, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to activate TLR2 and trigger an inflammatory reaction [9]. However, these proteins are present outside of the virion and therefore can interact through simple physical proximity between the virus and immune cells. Here, we demonstrated that NP, which is present inside the virion, activates TLR2 and TLR4 through translocation and that this mechanism can increase viral infectivity and pathogenicity.HA proteolytic cleavage is an important step in influenza viral infectivity. In this process, serine proteases, such as trypsin, play an important role. Studies have shown that viral infection increases under conditions of high trypsin secretion and that treatment with trypsin inhibitors inhibits influenza virus [39]. Viral proteolytic cleavage by serine proteases is well known for herpesvirus glycoprotein B, coronavirus spike protein, dengue virus envelope proteins, and influenza virus HA, and this process is essential for viral infection [40,41,42]. In our study, NP did not directly induce lung inflammation or abnormal symptoms; however, it induced cytokines, including IL-1ß and IL-6, and increased trypsin expression. Moreover, NP-induced trypsin increased HA protein cleavage in vitro and viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. This is a new positive feedback mechanism by which viral proteins increase HA proteolytic cleavage through the cytokine–trypsin cycle to increase viral infectivity.Here, influenza virus NP was shown to directly bound to TLR2 and TLR4 and stimulate effective downstream signaling. As mentioned above, studies have shown that several viral surface proteins stimulate TLRs to increase pathogenicity [6, 8, 9, 43]; however, studies have not reported that the nucleocapsid or capsid proteins perform such functions. Studies have shown that treatment of cells with viral nuclear proteins in vitro stimulates innate immune activities, such as cytokine secretion. When the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was administered to the mouse nasal cavity, TNF-α and IFN-γ were found to be increased in the lungs [44]. Furthermore, the highly positively charged hepatitis B virus core antigen protein induced the secretion of cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, in human macrophage cell lines through an interaction with heparan sulfate [45]. In our study, we observed that NP multimers induced TLR4 activation, suggesting that the quaternary structure of NP plays an essential role in the NP-TLR4 interaction. The quaternary ring structure of influenza virus NP is similar to that of VSV and molluscum contagiosum virus NPs [46], and the structure of VSV is similar to that of various negative-strand RNA viruses, including paramyxoviridea [47, 48]. Additional structure-based studies are required to create a better understanding of the interactions between the common structures of viral nucleo- or nucleocapsid proteins and TLRs.In the present study, plasma or purified IgG fractions against NP inhibited NP-TLR4 binding in vitro and reduced inflammatory cytokine and trypsin levels and pathogenicity in vivo. Previous studies have demonstrated the in vivo antiviral effects of anti-NP antibodies [49, 50]. Anti-NP antibodies do not directly neutralize influenza virus; however, the data have been interpreted to indicate that these antibodies inhibit influenza virus through NK cell-dependent ADCC [24]. However, this mechanism has only been demonstrated in vitro, and the antiviral mechanism of anti-NP antibodies mediated through NK cells in vivo has not been reported. In our study, we found that anti-NP serum increased the survival rate of infected mice, including even NK cell-depleted mice, compared to control serum. This finding suggests that the antiviral effects of anti-NP antibodies may not be fully dependent on NK cells. Furthermore, studies have reported that anti-NP antibody treatment in FcR-deficient mice can provide protection against influenza virus infection [50]. These results suggest that anti-NP can inhibit influenza virus infection through mechanisms other than NK cell-dependent ADCC.In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel pathogenic role for NP in the pathogenesis of influenza virus. NP, which has been considered to exist inside infected cells or virions, is translocated to the extracellular compartment and then activates neighboring immune cells via TLR4 and NLRP3. Considering that many viruses causing acute respiratory infection induce lytic cell death, this finding highlights the potential pathogenic role of internal viral proteins mediated via interactions with PRRs present on uninfected neighboring immune cells.

Credit: Eileen Fabian. All Rights Reserved.ExpandApril 21, 2022UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Pennsylvania is the latest state to report a confirmed detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in a commercial poultry flock, leading state officials, industry leaders and Penn State poultry specialists to redouble efforts to contain the virus and educate producers, backyard flock owners and the public about the disease. On April 18, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture announced the detection of HPAI affecting about 1.4 million chickens in a commercial layer operation in Lancaster County, the first confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the state since an outbreak in 1983-84. As of April 15, HPAI had been confirmed in 27 states in the Midwest and on the East Coast, leading to the loss of at least 26 million U.S. chickens, turkeys and wild birds so far this spring. What does it mean for the state's poultry industry now that the virus has made its way into a commercial flock? What can poultry producers and small-flock owners do to reduce the risk of spread? And does HPAI pose a threat to food safety and human health? Poultry specialists with Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences and Penn State Extension provide some answers to these and other questions. — What causes avian influenza? According to USDA, avian influenza is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry — such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants and quail — and wild birds, especially waterfowl, gulls and shorebirds. Strains of avian flu virus vary in pathogenicity, or their ability to cause disease. Highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock to flock. On the other hand, low-pathogenicity, or "low-path," avian flu can infect domestic poultry, creating mild or no signs of disease. Both high- and low-path viruses can be carried by migratory birds, which often are asymptomatic to the infection. — What are the signs of illness in poultry infected with avian influenza? Birds infected with low-path avian flu may show signs of respiratory illness (coughing and sneezing), decreased egg production and other mild symptoms. But birds infected with highly pathogenic avian flu become severely and acutely ill, noted Gino Lorenzoni, assistant professor of poultry science and avian health. "You may see unexplained, sudden death among birds in your flock, and that may be the first and only sign you notice," Lorenzoni said. "Other possible symptoms are swelling of the head and facial tissues, purple discoloration of the comb and wattles, a sudden drop in feed and water consumption, diarrhea, and lethargy." — What's at risk from avian influenza? Pennsylvania's poultry industry, the commonwealth's second-largest agricultural sector, is valued at more than $7.1 billion annually, according to the state Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania is ranked fourth among states in egg production, and Lancaster County is among the top four counties nationally in sales of poultry and eggs. In addition, keeping small and backyard poultry flocks has risen in popularity in recent years. A major 2014-15 outbreak of HPAI affecting the Midwest and West Coast led to the death of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys — largely in the upper Midwest — which had an economic impact on the U.S. economy of about $3.3 billion. — Is this strain of avian flu a threat to human health? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Eurasian strain of H5N1 avian flu virus causing recent HPAI outbreaks in the United States presents a low risk to public health. No human cases of this virus have been detected in the U.S. — Can I get avian influenza from eating poultry or eggs? No. Poultry and eggs that are properly prepared and cooked — to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F — are safe to eat. Proper processing, handling and cooking of poultry will provide protection from viruses and bacteria, including avian influenza. — How can I protect my birds from getting avian flu? Follow common-sense biosecurity practices that isolate your flock from other birds, advises John Boney, assistant professor of poultry science and Penn State Extension Poultry Team leader. "In particular, keep your birds away from any possible contact with wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, and shorebirds such as gulls and terns, or their droppings," he said. "Also, keep poultry away from the water sources where these wild birds congregate." Other recommendations from the poultry team: Immediately clean up feed spills to avoid attracting wild birds on your premises. Limit visitors to only those essential for business. Make sure all visitors follow your biosecurity plan. Wear dedicated footwear and clothing while servicing your poultry to minimize the potential spread of the virus. Sanitize boots, hands and tools before entering your flock premises. Clean and disinfect equipment that comes into contact with birds. "Biosecurity is as much an attitude as it is a practice," added Gregory Martin, poultry extension educator based in Lancaster County. "You can't cut corners. You may know what the best practices are, but they may not be effective unless you follow them consistently, every time." — What happens when HPAI is detected in poultry? If HPAI is detected in a domestic poultry flock, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture will initiate a quarantine of the infected flock premises. Agriculture officials will oversee depopulation, disposal and clean-up activities on the premises. All birds in the flock that have not yet died from the virus infection can be inventoried for indemnification purposes and will be euthanized to prevent the spread of disease. Often, carcasses will be composted on site to kill pathogens before disposal, and the poultry house then will be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly. Authorities will test other flocks in a "control zone" within a few miles around the infected premises at intervals to detect any new infections. Once conditions are met to end the quarantine on a premises, including test results that indicate there is no viable avian flu virus in the environment, new birds can be brought in to start the next flock. — Should homeowners be concerned about birds congregating at backyard feeders? So far, Pennsylvania residents have not been advised to remove backyard bird feeders, unless they are in proximity to poultry flocks. "The birds that typically are attracted to feeders — songbirds and associated species — are not the species that have most often tested positive for HPAI virus to date," said Justin Brown, a wildlife veterinarian and assistant teaching professor in veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State. "Songbirds can be infected with these viruses but are much lower risk than other groups of birds, such as waterfowl, scavengers and so forth," he said. "Therefore, bird feeding would be unlikely to be a significant risk factor for this disease. Nevertheless, residents should know that this guidance could change quickly as the situation evolves." However, residents should refrain from feeding ducks, geese and other waterfowl at public parks, nature preserves and other areas where these birds congregate, according to Martin, the Penn State Extension poultry educator. "Feeding the ducks at your local park may discourage them from continuing on their migratory route," he said. "The longer they stick around, the more chances they will have to contract and spread avian flu." — How do I report a suspected case of avian flu? If you suspect HPAI in your flock, call the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture at 717-772-2852 (24 hours a day — select option 1 to reach the veterinarian on call) or the USDA Healthy Birds Hotline at 866-536-7593. — Where can I learn more? More information is available on the Penn State Extension avian flu website.

These new safety measures include covering some outdoor bird exhibits and bringing some birds indoors to reduce their potential for exposure. HPAI, also commonly referred to as bird flu, has impacted birds in the wild and in commercial industries throughout the country including here in Idaho. “Many of the zoo’s birds will still be visible to the public from behind glass and birds that can safely be housed indoors will remain on exhibit,” said Zoo Boise Director Gene Peacock. “Unfortunately, some of our birds will most likely have to move off-exhibit to ensure their safety. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make necessary changes to exhibits in the coming days.” According to experts, the spread of HPAI is mostly blamed on the droppings and nasal discharge of infected wild birds. Zoo Boise is working with state, federal, and other accredited zoological organizations to ensure steps being taken locally prevent Zoo Boise’s birds from coming into contact with the virus. Zoo Boise will continue to add additional sanitizing procedures and exhibit coverings to limit possible exposure to infected particles. Staff members appreciate your patience and understanding as some birds are taken off exhibit for their own protection. “Our zookeepers and staff provide exceptional care for all of the animals, and this situation is no exception,” said Boise Parks and Recreation Director Doug Holloway. “We will continue to consult with national, state and local health officials to make the best care decisions on behalf of all the birds who call Zoo Boise home.” Zoo Boise has turned the act of visiting the zoo into a conservation action. Since 2007, visits to Zoo Boise have generated more than $3 million towards the conservation of animals in the wild, redefining why we have a zoo. Zoo Boise is accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, a national organization that supports excellence in animal care, conservation, education, and science.

(Credit: Tara Smith) Farmers in Suffolk County have ramped up biosecurity protocols to protect birds following the recent discovery of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in owls on the North Fork. An adult great horned owl and two owlets found dead in Peconic earlier this month tested positive avian influenza, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. “We’re scared. We’re scared to death. But of the 20,000, 30,000 people on Long Island that have backyard flocks, we’ve only seen it in three or four flocks and it’s been around for months now,” said Wayne Meyer, owner of Long Island Poultry in Calverton. He said if one of his birds caught the flu, the farm would shut down. “This is our main business,” he said. “Everybody comes here for their birds. If we had one infected, that means the state would have to come in and cull our flock, and then the rumor would get out that we had avian flu on our property and nobody would come to buy birds. We’d be done, that’s it, our business would be over and we’d be looking for jobs.” Visitors at Long Island Poultry are now limited and everyone coming onto the property needs to wear protective booties. The disease is contagious enough that it can be spread via people’s shoes. Birds are also not running free range, to limit interaction with wild birds, and visitors have never been allowed to touch or handle birds before purchasing them, he said. “For the chicken owners, make sure you limit free-ranging your birds for now and make sure you don’t have people coming and going, touching your birds. Most if not all chicken owners have coops and pens; keep your birds in the pens for the next few months until they get this thing figured out,” Mr. Meyer said. Eric Wells of Wells Farm in Aquebogue — which sells livestock, including chickens — said the farm has similarly implemented biosecurity protocols such as preventing people from touching the animals and asking visitors to bleach the bottoms of their shoes. Mr. Wells said the farm would not be OK if hit with HPAI, but he isn’t too concerned about the virus appearing on the East End. “If everybody does what they’re supposed to do, everything will be OK,” he said. Tom Hart, owner of Deep Roots Farm in Southold, said as a mixed vegetable and livestock farm, they’ve always been “really cautious with a lot of things, in terms of contamination.” The farm is no longer allowing tour groups and visitors, and the only two people caring for the birds wear a separate set of shoes while interacting with them. They “tightened up feeders and waterers” to discourage wild birds, especially waterfowl, from settling on the farm as well. “A little bit earlier in the year, we did have some flocks of geese that would land in our field so we fired some warning shots to kind of not allow them to make themselves at home here,” he said, noting they haven’t had any since. Since the farm cultivates a diversified selection of crops and livestock, the bird flu would not wipe out his business. Around 20% of his farm consists of chickens for meat and eggs. “We’re definitely being careful,” he added. Paula DiDonato of Peconic discovered one of the owls that tested positive for HPAI. She’d been watching a nest in her neighborhood for about two weeks when she noticed a “large great horned owl” sitting in the tree during the day, which she thought was unusual. She said she later found the carcass of an owlet on the ground near the nest with no clear cause of death. An owl in Peconic. Two juveniles and one adult were recently found dead in the area. (Credit: Paula DiDonato) In February, the first case of HPAI in New York was found in Suffolk County in a domestic flock. There have been three cases total confirmed among domestic flocks in the county, leading to the closure of an 82-year-old gaming farm in Sag Harbor after thousands of birds were culled. The other two incidents were isolated to backyard flocks. Excluding the owls, there have been four cases confirmed among wild birds in Suffolk County. The DEC releases data on a county level only. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern, the DEC said. No human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. HPAI is highly transmissible among birds, though, to the point that it could be spread between flocks by someone handling different birds or stepping in contaminated soil. Rob Carpenter, administrative director for the Long Island Farm Bureau, has advised producers to implement a biosecurity plan for their flocks. Some preventative measures suggested by experts at workshops held by Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County have included changing shoes and clothing before and after interacting with birds; minimizing exposure of domestic flocks to wildlife; and frequent cleaning. “I think one of the biggest things that would be helpful is if folks can just limit to the best of their ability any interactions with their backyard birds and wild birds, whether that’s trying to enclose them in a run, moving food sources so you’re not attracting other wild birds to the area, trying to limit that exposure in that way, and then keeping in mind that it can spread pretty easily through contact,” said Nora Catlin, agriculture program director at CCE of Suffolk County. “If you wear shoes into your coop, or if you’re wearing shoes into an area where let’s say there are infected wild birds and if the droppings get on your boots and then you wear those boots around your chickens, you can bring the virus particles into your yard in that way,” she added. The DEC said the public should report dead ducks, geese, swans, waterbirds (including gulls), raptors, pheasants, turkey and grouse, or any group of five or more dead birds in one area to the regional DEC Wildlife office at [email protected]v or the DEC Wildlife Health Unit at 518-478-2203.

(April 6)APAmong the latest victims of the bird flu outbreak sweeping across the country: the national bird of the United States. Bald eagles in 14 states died after contracting bird flu, and eagles in another two states are suspected of falling ill with the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In total, 36 bald eagles have died since February. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources reported Thursday that three bald eagles in the state that died recently tested positive for the bird flu virus. Other dead bald eagles also will be tested. Officials said recent aerial surveys of eagle nests on the state's coast revealed several failed nests, including eaglets dead or missing when they normally wouldn't have left the nest yet. Bob Sargent, program manager with the department's wildlife conservation section, said nest success is down about 30% this year.On April 8, a bald eagle in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was found unable to fly. Wildlife rehabilitators with the Wisconsin Humane Society collected and cared for the bird in Milwaukee. It was euthanized the next day after its condition deteriorated.Initial test results on the eagle released Friday showed it was "presumed positive" for the virus.Here are where bald eagles testing positive for the bird flu virus have died, and how many died in each state, according to USDA data as of Thursday: More bird flu: Zoos are sequestering birds as highly contagious avian flu spreads across North AmericaWhat's everyone talking about?

Flu may have disappeared for a while, but there's a chance it could come back with a vengeance. (Getty Images: Ponomariova Maria)abc.net.auews/flu-season-covid-vaccines-winter-influenza-questions-answered/100989936Link copiedShareShare articleAs the mercury drops and days get shorter, sniffles, sore throat and other classic symptoms of flu typically start rearing their snotty, grotty heads.But this winter, we're looking down the barrel of an unusual flu season.Right now, we have the more contagious BA.2 COVID sub-variant sweeping across the nation, since reaching our shores in January.Over the past couple of years, COVID restrictions and border closures crushed influenza infections to historic lows.Last year, researchers thought one flu virus called the Yamagata virus might even be stamped out altogether (and, in the months since that article was published, there have been no further reported cases of Yamagata).Loading...But just because the flu's been noticeably absent over the past couple of years, doesn't mean it won't pose a real problem for us this year. For this reason, in March, the Australian government announced it would provide a $2.1 billion health package to tackle the problem of flu and COVID this winter.So why all the kerfuffle about influenza now, and what's changed since last winter when it comes to COVID, flu, and vaccination?Why are we especially vulnerable to flu this year?We're vulnerable simply because we've had so few flu infections in 2021 (and that's despite only about a third of people getting a flu shot last year).The reason for historic low flu levels is because the virus, in non-pandemic years, hitches a ride on incoming passengers from overseas.But with international borders closed for the best part of the past two years, and the trickle of arrivals spending two weeks in quarantine, any inbound flu viruses were essentially stopped before they could take hold in the wider population.With a fraction of the usual flu infections, there aren't too many people today who have immune protection generated from catching the virus.The flu vax protects against four virusesTwo influenza A:H1N1 was first detected in the Americas in 2009 and caused the 2009-10 swine flu pandemicH3N2 was behind the 1968 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 1 million people worldwideTwo influenza B:B/Victoria tends to infect younger peopleB/Yamagata may now be eradicatedNow, with borders open and quarantine rules relaxed, it's inevitable that flu will spread — and we're already beginning to see it, said Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute."We've gone from a non-season in 2021 to things starting to happen here in Australia."According to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, which keeps tabs on lab-confirmed influenza case numbers, Australia racked up 409 cases in March — most of which were in Victoria and NSW."And that was nearly the equivalent of the total for 2021, which was 598 cases," Professor Barr said."So things are picking up and there will be higher numbers in April. So we're already off to a bit of a flying start."What can we learn from the Northern Hemisphere flu season?The Northern Hemisphere has not long emerged from winter. So how did they fare when it came to flu?As you might expect, different regions experienced different flu seasons, likely due to different levels of restrictions like mask-wearing and border closures. "In Europe, some countries, like the UK, have had relatively quiet flu seasons, France has had more of an influenza season, and Scandinavia probably somewhere in between," Professor Barr said.In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the hospitalisation rate for the 2021/22 flu season is lower than the rate at this time of year for the four years preceding the pandemic.But what's unusual about this US flu season is it hasn't followed the typical pattern of a rise, peak, then fall in cases.Instead, it looks like the US season will have two peaks. After the first peak in 2021, another wave is picking up again now.The "bi-phasic" pattern of reported flu cases in the US this season. (Supplied: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The reason for this isn't entirely clear, but Professor Barr suspects US flu cases are rising and falling due to people changing behaviour during and between COVID outbreaks."If COVID goes up, people stay home more often, and there's less mixing. Some US states have more rigid rules on mask-wearing and school closures, so probably all those things come into account to stop influenza."Then it starts [rising] again when mixing starts to happen again."Relatively low overall flu numbers abroad are a reason for cautious optimism for Australia as the weather cools."It's a hard thing to predict, but I think it's likely we'll have a low-to-moderate season rather than a severe season," Professor Barr said."But once enough of these viruses get in, it could take off. "Who should get a flu shot?Vaccination is crucial if we're to keep a lid on flu numbers this year.The reason we need a flu shot every year is because influenza is a shape-shifter; it mutates readily, creating new viruses that we have no immune protection against.So the vaccine is tweaked to protect us against specific members of the flu-virus family, selected for inclusion, for instance, if they spread overseas.In Australia, anyone over the age of 6 months is recommended to have a yearly seasonal flu vaccine.Flu vaccines do not contain live virus, and cannot give you the disease. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)Certain groups are strongly recommended to be vaccinated.These are:infants and children aged 6 months to 5 yearsadults aged 65+Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 6 monthsanyone aged 6 months or over who has a medical condition, such as diabetes or cardiac disease, that means they are at higher risk of getting serious flu disease and complicationstravellersworkers in settings such as healthcare, aged care, and poultry and pork industriespeople who are homelesspeople who are pregnantEven without COVID circulating, anyone in these groups is at greater risk of complications and severe illness if they catch the flu.For instance, pregnant women at any stage of their pregnancy are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot, says Megan Rees, head of the Royal Melbourne Hospital's Sleep and Respiratory Unit."We saw terrible swine flu in 2009, and we had lots of pregnant women really severely unwell with influenza."When should I get my flu shot?It's around this time of year that flu shots are rolled out in Australia, and that's no accident.Antibodies generated by the flu shot tend to wane a little after about four months, but still provide "very solid protection for at least six months, probably a bit more than that", Dr Rees said.So when our flu season peaks, which is usually in August, we are already protected. And should the flu season come early, we're ready for that too.Flu 'worse than COVID' in childrenPhoto shows Woman in bed with a cold blowing her nose.Health authorities gear up for the first real flu season in three years, with experts particularly worried about the impact on young children.But this, as we know, isn't a normal flu season. So when will it peak? That's a difficult question at the best of times, Dr Rees said."We think this year, flu could come very early. We're a bit worried about that."So our recommendation would be to get your flu vaccine as soon as possible, and you will be well protected for August and September, even if you got your flu vaccine now."While the effectiveness of flu vaccines isn't as high as we've seen with the mRNA COVID vaccines, they do help stop the disease spread and, should you be infected by a flu virus, stop you from getting as sick.And, of course, a flu vaccine (plus COVID vaccines) will decrease your risk of being co-infected with COVID. And that's important because ...Is being infected with COVID and influenza particularly bad?We're yet to see widespread influenza and COVID-19 at the same time in Australia, and overseas data puts flu co-infection at less than 1 per cent of COVID infections (although estimates vary by region).What is 'flurona'?Photo shows A man in full PPE with Hebrew writing across the top of his face guardIsraeli health authorities have detected a case of what some are calling "flurona" — a double dose of COVID-19 and the flu. It comes as the country is experiencing a spike in influenza cases in recent weeks, sparking fears of a "twindemic".But patients with the flu/COVID combo — dubbed "flurona" — are likely to appear as rules and restrictions continue to relax, and this has Dr Rees worried."I certainly haven't looked after any patients yet who've had both at the same time, but there is quite a bit of overseas data that suggests that you get much sicker if you have both of them at the same time."Recently, a study of more than 200,000 people in the UK found patients with COVID and flu had twice the risk of dying than people infected with the COVID virus alone, echoing conclusions drawn by previous studies.For this reason, some hospitals, including the Royal Melbourne, already routinely test all patients with respiratory symptoms for both flu and COVID, Dr Rees said.A flu test is similar to a COVID test: a nose and throat swab, which is sent to a lab for analysis.Why can I now get a COVID vaccine and flu shot at the same time?Last year, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommended spacing out your COVID and flu vaccines by two weeks.They've since done away with that advice, and people are now encouraged to get both at the same time.So what changed?That 14-day break between COVID and flu shots was mostly a precaution in case people had a reaction to either vaccine, Professor Barr said.Spacing them out meant it was easier to attribute any side effects to one vaccine or the other."Now we know only a small proportion of people have significant side effects from the COVID vaccine, and we know that [vaccine] co-administration is safe," Professor Barr said."There's very little risk [of side effects] with standard vaccinations, COVID or otherwise, with influenza vaccine."There's another benefit to having both shots in the same sitting, Dr Rees said."You get it done. If you have to come back on separate occasions, sometimes people don't get the second one."Loading...Posted Tue 19 Apr 2022 at 6:30pmTuesday 19 Apr 2022 at 6:30pmTue 19 Apr 2022 at 6:30pm, updated Tue 19 Apr 2022 at 10:18pmTuesday 19 Apr 2022 at 10:18pmTue 19 Apr 2022 at 10:18pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter) News in LanguageListen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and KriolListenTop StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

Pet owners should also disinfect or change their shoes and clothing if they have been worn off the property.Other steps people can take to protect their birds include:Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.Disinfecting boots and other gear when moving between coops.Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.Using well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds.If avian influenza is suspected, contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after-hours).Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOWPBNWPBNWTOMWTOMWGTQWGTQWGTUWGTUPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Avian Flu in Maine - Maine Audubon Take Action Join/Give Shop Events News Take Action Join/Give Shop Events News Search Search Close this search box.

UPDATED: 19 April 2022 In mid February, the USDA and APHIS announced the presence of “highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)” in a (non-commercial) backyard flock of chickens in Knox County. Since then, cases of avian flu have continued to pop up in domestic birds, with a dozen documented cases across six counties (as of 19 April; see all domestic bird cases here). There have also been nine cases of avian flu in wild birds, including two Bald Eagles (see all wild bird cases here). The increase in cases is unfortunate, though it is not unexpected given the nature of this disease. Across the country, this strain of avian flu is spreading faster than the last major outbreak in 2015, now in 27 states and ~1.3% of all US chickens. While avian flu poses a serious risk to domestic fowl (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl), it is not known to affect songbirds or other ‘feeder birds’ so there is no risk to those groups at this time. Specifically, there is not a need to take down bird feeders or to stop feeding wild birds, unless you also take care of poultry. Anyone raising birds, be it a commercial operation or a backyard flock, is encouraged to keep their birds inside to minimize risk of exposure. To report sick birds or usual bird deaths, contact the state veterinarian’s office at 207-287-7615 or the USDA at 1-866-536-7593. The recent cases of avian flu being detected in two Bald Eagles is also not unexpected, since raptors are likely to prey on waterfowl that is carrying avian flu, especially if the prey is sick and easy to catch. Other scavengers, like American Crows, are likely to have confirmed cases soon. During the 2015 outbreak, cases peaked in the fourth and fifth month following the first case, so we are (as of 19 April) likely to see things get worse before they get better. Aside from protecting your owned birds, there is not much we can do to keep birds safe. This is a good reminder to keep your bird feeders, and the ground below your feeders, clean. The avian influenza virus is transmitted via saliva, mucous, and feces, so there is very little risk of human infection, though it is good to take extra precautions (wear gloves, a mask, and perhaps eye protection) if you have species like wild ducks that also visit your feeders. Along with the increase in avian flu cases, we are also seeing an increase in the number of avian conjunctivitis (aka�Mycoplasma gallisepticum�or “finch eye disease”) around the state. This is disease is easily spread between feeder birds, especially at tube feeders. Avian conjunctivitis is most common in House Finches, though we’ve been seeing more cases in goldfinches and Evening Grosbeaks lately. If you have a bird at you feeders with swollen or crusty/pink eyes, you should take your feeders down. Discard the seed that was in the feeders and clean the feeder thoroughly. You should also stop feeding for a week or two – you don’t want sick birds coming right back to that feeder. Read more about eye disease here. ????

Other wild birds affected in the state include the lesser scaup, gadwall and the American wigeon.The latest strain, H5N1, has also been detected in bald eagles in other states including Florida, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin.According to the USDA, wild birds can be infected with bird flu and display no signs of illness. The birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating and can expose domestic poultry to the virus.USDA experts anticipate “new additional avian influenza detections will occur in additional states as wild bird surveillance continues in the spring”.The threat of the bird flu to humans remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.However, the sweeping bird flu has been taking a toll on the poultry industry. Since 3 April, the outbreak has resulted in the culling of more than 23 million poultry, including chickens and turkeys.When they come into contact with the feces of wild birds, they can contract the flu and begin to display symptoms and succumb at a high rate.Poultry and egg prices have been rising across the country, according to the USDA.Explore more on these topicsBird fluHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Recently, saliva has been shown to exert both antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Thus, saliva may be a biological factor that contributes to the prevention of influenza infection. However, the actual salivary anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity in individuals and its determinant factors are unknown. By assessing individual variations in salivary anti-IAV activity in 92 people using an established new high-throughput system in this study, we found that the anti-IAV activity varied widely between individuals and showed a significant positive correlation with protein-bound sialic acid (BSA) level (ρ = 0.473; p < 0.001). Furthermore, the anti-IAV activity of saliva with enzymatically reduced BSA content was significantly lower. These results indicate that BSA is a direct regulator of salivary anti-IAV activity and is a determinant of individual differences. Additionally, after comparing the anti-IAV activity across the groups by age, anti-IAV activity in young people (aged 5–19 years) were lower than in adults aged 20–59 years and elderly people aged 60–79 years. Our study suggests that BSA levels in saliva may be important in preventing influenza infection.

Seasonal influenza viruses (types A and B) cause epidemics worldwide, with the World Health Organization estimating hundreds of million infections and approximately 250,000–500,000 deaths per year1,2, leading to substantial social and economic burdens worldwide3. Several preventive and curative strategies exist against influenza, including vaccination and therapeutic agents, such as neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes4. However, influenza viruses evolve rapidly, which enables them to escape immunity induced by prior infections or vaccination; moreover, those viruses are transmitted efficiently from human to human via respiratory droplets. Recently, there has been substantial concern about the possibility of a pandemic of a novel influenza strain 5, with reports of an increasing resistance of influenza A viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes6. Thus, new approaches are needed to effectively prevent and treat influenza infections.The oral cavity is one of the entry sites for respiratory viruses. Saliva plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of human health. It provides lubrication and protection and buffering action and clearance in the oral cavity, maintains tooth integrity, and aids taste and digestion7. A previous study indicated that hyposalivation may be a risk factor for acute respiratory infection8, suggesting that saliva may contribute to the role of innate immunity in the early stages of infection. Saliva induces both antimicrobial and antiviral activities9. Additionally, multiple soluble factors in saliva have potent inhibitory activity against influenza A viruses (IAVs), including sialic acid-containing mucin 5 B (MUC5B), salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein-340 (gp-340), alpha-2-microglobulin (A2M), and lectins (surfactant protein D [SP-D])10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Two main mechanisms for the anti-IAV activity of these factors have been proposed. MUC5B, gp-340, and A2M acts as classic γ inhibitors, mediating the inhibition of IAV by presenting a sialic acid ligand that binds to the viral hemagglutinin (HA), thereby preventing HA attachment to target cells12,13,14,15. In contrast, SP-D acts as a classic β inhibitor by binding the lectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) to specific oligosaccharides on the head of the viral HA16,17,18. It has been shown that salivary anti-IAV activity is primarily due to sialic-acid-containing proteins rather than lectin13,19. As the first line of defense, salivary antiviral factors are likely to play an important role in protection against respiratory infections. However, since previous studies on salivary anti-IAV activity mentioned above have only been conducted using purifying salivary proteins and small size analyses, the actual salivary anti-IAV activity of each individual, and its determinant factors are unknown. To solve this problem, high-throughput evaluation systems are required to evaluate multiple samples simultaneously. In this study, we constructed a new high-throughput system to evaluate salivary anti-IAV activity using neuraminidase activity derived from influenza virus as an index, and we investigated individual variations in salivary anti-IAV activity and its determinant factors.Materials and methodsParticipantsIn Study 1 of the individual differences in salivary anti-IAV activity, 92 healthy voluntary participants aged 20–59 years (67 men and 25 women; mean age ± S.D., 36.9 ± 9.9 years) were recruited using snowball sampling. This trial was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (ID: R000028439 UMIN000024720, URL: https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_his_list.cgi?recptno=R000028439). In Study 2 of age-related changes in saliva, 240 participants aged 5–79 years (60 young people, 30 boys and 30 girls aged 5–19 years; 120 adults, 60 men and 60 women aged 20–59 years; and 60 elderly people, 30 men and 30 women aged 60–79 years), who registered using a monitor at a contractor (Research and Development, Inc.) were recruited. Participants in Study 2 did not overlap with those in Study 1. In these studies, the exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with serious disease; (2) those going to a hospital regularly and under regular pharmaceutical treatment; (3) those who were pregnant or expecting pregnancy; (4) those who were physically unable to complete the study-related questionnaires; (5) those with scratches in the oral cavity; and (6) those considered unsuitable to participate in the study by the study physician. After receiving a full explanation of the study, all participants and their legal guardians provided written informed consent.Sample collection and treatmentSaliva samples were collected in a quiet room during the morning, between 09:00 and 10:00, and at least 60 min after eating. Subjects were asked to accumulate saliva in their mouths and spit into a sterile plastic dish at the desired time or indicated time, and saliva samples were collected for 5 min in Study 1 or 10 min in Study 2. The saliva secretion rate (mL/min) was calculated by dividing the amount of saliva collected at the time of collection. Whole saliva samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at − 80 °C until use. Frozen saliva samples were thawed and vigorously mixed by vortexing prior to the assay.Cells and virusMadin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and 50 µg/mL gentamicin at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Influenza A virus strains [A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)] and [A/Memphis/1/1971 (H3N2)] were propagated at 37 °C using MDCK cells in serum-free medium (SFM; Thermo Fisher Scientific Japan K.K., Kanagawa, Japan) supplemented with 2 µg/mL acetylated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and 50 µg/mL gentamicin.Anti-IAV activity assays of saliva sampleMDCK cells (4 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in a 96-well plate at 37 °C for 24 h. The saliva samples were diluted eight-fold in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fifty microliters of each saliva sample was mixed with 50 µL of the virus dilutions at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 in PBS and 100 µL of 2 × SFM at room temperature, and the 180 µL mixture was immediately applied to the MDCK cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the MDCK cells were washed with PBS to remove the saliva sample and the virus that was not adsorbed on the cells, and incubated in 100 μL of SFM at 37 °C for 16–18 h for virus multiplication. Thirty microliters of the MDCK cell supernatant was mixed with 20 µL of 0.25 mM 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-Neu5Ac; Funakoshi) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The enzyme reaction for 4MU-Neu5Ac was stopped by adding 200 µL of 100 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 10.7). Fluorescence from the sialidase reaction of virus NA was quantified using a microplate reader (Infinite 200 multi-mode Reader, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 nm and 460 nm, respectively, for 4-metylumbelliferone (4MU). The relative sialidase activity in each sample was calculated by setting the sialidase activity to 100% when PBS was used instead of saliva. Finally, anti-IAV activity was defined by deducting the relative sialidase activity from 100%.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assayHemagglutinin (HA), which is present on the membrane surface of influenza viruses, binds to erythrocytes and causes erythrocyte aggregation. We evaluated the inhibitory activity of saliva on the binding of HA to erythrocytes. To remove the nonspecific inhibitory activity of saliva-induced hemagglutination, 100 µL saliva samples were mixed with 200 µL of guinea pig erythrocytes and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 2,000g for 10 min, and the supernatant (pretreated saliva sample) was used for the HI assay. The PR8 IAV strain was adjusted to 4 hemagglutinin units (HAU) per 25 µL PBS using a pre-hemagglutinin assay. In 96-well plates, a two-fold serial dilution of the pretreated saliva sample was mixed with 25 µL of 4-HAU PR8 IAV strain, followed by the addition of 50 µL of 0.7% guinea pig red blood cells and left at 4 °C for 2 h. The HI titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that produced complete hemagglutination inhibition.Sialic acid assayThe concentrations of total sialic acid (TSA) and free sialic acid (FSA) in saliva were measured using a sialic acid assay kit (Bioassay Systems). The concentration of protein-bound sialic acid (BSA) was then calculated by subtracting the concentration of FSA from the concentration of TSA.Salivary proteome analysisFor ultrafiltration, 300 µL of saliva sample was mixed with 200 µL of 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.5; Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) in an Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit (3 kDa; Merck Millipore Ltd), and the mixture was spun down at 14,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The trapped saliva on the filter was filtered three times using 400 µL of Tris–HCl buffer. Finally, the filter on a new tube was spun down at 1,000g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the sample for proteome analysis was collected. The total protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and the saliva sample was prepared with equal concentrations of proteins from each individual sample. The saliva sample containing 100 µg protein in Tris–HCl buffer (90 µL in total) was mixed with 5 µL of 100 mM dl-dithiothreitol (MP Biomedicals, LLC) for the reduction solution and heated at 56 °C for 45 min. The mixture was added to 5 µL of 111 mg/mL iodoacetamide (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in shade for alkylation. The mixture was then mixed with 50 µL of 0.1 µg/µL trypsin solution (Promega Corporation) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction solution was added to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v) of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) to stop the reaction, and then subjected to LC–MS/MS analysis. All reagents were diluted with Tris–HCl buffer.Five microliters of the purified peptides were injected into a high-performance liquid chromatography system (ACQUITY UPLC: Waters) connected to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Vantage; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an ion source of electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Cadenza CD-C18 column (150 × 1 mm, 3 µm; Imtakt) by binary gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min. Eluent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, while acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid was used as eluent B. Ion source (ESI) parameters were optimized as follows: spray voltage, 400 V; vaporizer temperature, 100 °C; sheath gas pressure, 40 Arb; auxiliary gas pressure, 5 Arb; and capillary temperature, 250 °C. The peak areas for each target peptide were calculated using Xcalibur (Quan Browser) software (Thermo Scientific).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The concentrations of secretory IgA (sIgA), defensin alpha 1, neutrophil (DEFa1), and LL-37 in saliva were measured using competitive ELISA kits (sIgA; Immundiagnostik GmbH, DEFa1; CLOUD-CLONE CORP., LL-37; Hycult Biotech Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.Statistical analysisResults from multiple experiments are expressed as means ± standard deviation (S.D.) and all data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24 (IBM Japan, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Relationships between the two sets of data were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. The statistical significance of differences between groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's (Fig. 3) or Kruskal–Wallis (Fig. 4) multiple comparisons test. Results with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Ethical considerationAll study protocols were approved by the institutional review board of the Kao Corporation (Study 1, 799-20160927, approved on 19 Oct 2016; Study 2, T208-190315, approved on 25 Apr 2019). These studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.ResultsConstruction of high-throughput evaluation system for salivary anti-IAV activityTo simultaneously evaluate the anti-IAV activity in many saliva samples, we constructed a new high-throughput evaluation system using neuraminidase (NA) derived from IAV as an index. Figure 1A shows the schematic of the measurement flow of salivary anti-IAV activity. The measurement consisted of the following steps: (1) mixing the virus and saliva, (2) infection of MDCK cells using the IAV solution and saliva mixture, (3) collecting the supernatant of the cells after 16–18 h of infection, and (4) measurement of sialidase activities of the supernatant for multiplicated virus quantification. The NA activity value when PBS was used instead of saliva was set to 100%, and the relative value was calculated from the NA activity value of saliva samples. The value obtained by subtracting the relative NA activity value from 100 was defined as the anti-IAV activity. A high correlation (ρ = 0.916; p < 0.001) was confirmed between the NA activity value in the supernatant of infected cells and the number of infected cells stained for NP protein when MDCK cells were infected with IAV mixed with various saliva samples (Fig. 1B).Figure 1Construction of high-throughput assay of salivary anti-IAV activities.

Anti-IAV activity varied widely between individuals, ranging from 2 to 97% (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, salivary anti-IAV activity against the Memphis IAV strain (H3N2) was significantly positively correlated with anti-IAV activity against the PR8 IAV strain (ρ = 0.638; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). We then performed a correlation analysis of salivary anti-IAV activity against the PR8 IAV strain and the amount of various salivary components measured using proteomic analysis and some kits to explore factors associated with individual differences in salivary anti-IAV activity (Fig. 2C). The results showed the highest positive correlation between salivary anti-IAV activity and BSA levels (ρ = 0.473; p < 0.001). In addition, the concentration of several proteins, such as AGTN/gp-340, ZG16B, SGP28, and C6orf58, significantly positively correlated with anti-IAV activity.Figure 2Individual differences of salivary anti-IAV activities.

The amount of BSA in the saliva was significantly reduced by α(2-3,6)-sialidase treatment and was not altered by heat treatment (Fig. 3A). While the anti-IAV activity of untreated saliva samples averaged about 50%, the anti-IAV activity of heat-treated saliva samples decreased to an average of 25% (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the anti-IAV activity of sialidase-treated saliva samples decreased to less than 10% on average (Fig. 3B). To further elucidate the contribution of BSA to salivary anti-IAV activity, a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed. Similar to the anti-IAV activity, large individual differences were observed in HI titers in some saliva samples (Fig. 3C). In addition, individual HI titers highly positively correlated with anti-IAV activity (Fig. 3D). Although no effect of heat treatment on HI titer was observed, sialidase treatment significantly decreased the HI titer (Fig. 3E).Figure 3Contribution of protein-bound sialic acid to salivary anti-IAV activity.

As a result of comparing the gender differences within each group, no difference was observed in the mean value of saliva secretion rate, anti-IAV activity, and BSA level (data not shown). Therefore, subsequent analyses did not distinguish between gender. The mean value of saliva secretion rate decreased with increasing age and was lowest in elderly people (Fig. 4A). Moderate correlation was observed for between age and salivary anti-IAV activity in individuals (rs = 0.29, p < 0.001). The mean value of salivary anti-IAV activity was similar in middle adults and elderly people, and was significantly lower in young people (Fig. 4B). The mean value of BSA concentration in saliva was significantly lower in elderly people than middle adults (Fig. 4C). In each age group, the salivary anti-IAV activity significantly positively correlated with salivary BSA level (young; ρ = 0.366, p < 0.05, middle adults; ρ = 0.589, p-value < 0.001, elderly; ρ = 608, p-value < 0.001, total; ρ = 0.511, p-value < 0.001) (Fig. 4D).Figure 4Age-related differences in salivary anti-IAV activity.

Data are presented as mean ± SD of each group. Average plateau values were compared using one-way analysis of variance and the Kruskal–Wallis test. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we constructed a high-throughput system to evaluate salivary anti-IAV activity. Using this system, we found that there are large individual differences in salivary anti-IAV activity, and that the amount of BSA in saliva is important for these individual differences.In general, the main method of measuring the viral infection titer is to count the number of infected cells by staining with antibodies against the virus and clumps of cellular degeneration associated with viral infection. While these methods are suitable for measuring the virus titer, it is difficult to evaluate multiple samples because this approach requires a great deal of time and labor because of the need for operations, such as multi-step dilutions and infected cells or colony counting. In our constructed system, the neuraminidase activity derived from the propagated influenza virus in the culture medium was measured using a multi-plate reader, which eliminates the operations described above and is suitable for the analysis of multiple samples. A significant positive correlation was observed between salivary anti-IAV activity against the PR8 (H1N1) and Memphis (H3N2) strains (Fig. 2B), indicating that individual differences in salivary anti-IAV activity are similar across influenza virus strains. It is expected that this method can be used in the evaluation of many influenza virus strains in the future.Using the constructed system, it was clarified that the individual variations in salivary anti-IAV activity most positively correlated with the amount of BSA (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the HI titers of saliva were significantly reduced by treatment with α(2-3,6)-sialidase (Fig. 3B). Some studies have reported that saliva contains soluble factors that can exert anti-influenza activity, such as sialic acid binding protein and lectins. Although glycolipids and glycopolysaccharides are also present in saliva, their concentrations are much lower than those of proteins20,21. Thus, their contribution as a source of sialic acid is considered to be low. It has been reported previously that several purified salivary proteins, such as AGTN/gp-340 and A2M, can inhibit the hemagglutination of erythrocytes by presenting a sialic acid ligand for the viral HA12,13,14,15. In addition, Qin et al. reported that saliva containing more α2-3/6-linked sialic acid residues has high binding properties to IAV22. These reports are consistent with our results, and indicate that the total amount of sialic acid possessed by these proteins determines the anti-IAV activity of saliva. In other words, the amount of BSA in the saliva is expected to be an indicator of frontline oral defenses against influenza viruses.MUC5B has potent inhibitory activity against IAV. However, our data showed that salivary MUC5B levels weakly correlated with the anti-IAV activity of saliva. White et al. reported that the sialic acid of MUC5B is more easily cleaved than that of gp-340, the levels of which highly correlated with anti-IAV activity. Our results suggest that the sialic acid of MUC5B is cleaved by sialidase in the oral cavity23,24,25, and the anti-IAV activity of MUC5B in saliva may be reduced. In considering individual variations in the anti-IAV activity of saliva, it is necessary to consider oral sialidase activity. In this study, SGP28, C6orf58, and PIP also strongly correlated with the anti-IAV activity of saliva. To date, the biological functions of SGP28 and C6orf58 have not been clarified. PIP, on the other hand, is known as a water-soluble antimicrobial protein26. It binds to and agglutinates bacteria, the detailed mechanism of its antimicrobial properties is not fully understood. These molecules are known to have sugar chains27,28,29. Although the presence of sialic acid of these molecules is not clear, they may also contribute to the anti-IAV activity of saliva via sialic acid, which is less susceptible to cleavage by sialidase. It is known that sialic acids are structurally diverse and that O-acetylated sialic acids are resistant to bacterial sialidase30. In the future, it will be necessary to clarify the presence or absence of sialic acid in these molecules, including their structural features.Interestingly, the anti-IAV activity of saliva was reduced following excessive sialidase treatment, but was not completely lost (Fig. 3A, B). Moreover, salivary anti-IAV activity also decreased following heating, which did not affect the concentration of sialic acid. Therefore, it is possible that sialic acid-independent factors are also involved in anti-IAV activity. One of the possible factors is the action of lectin-like proteins, such as ZG16B, which have shown a high correlation with anti-IAV activity31,32. Lectin (carbohydrate-binding proteins), including conglutinin, SP-D, MBL, and SAP, bind selectively to specific carbohydrate structures (mannose- over galactose-type sugars) located at the head of the influenza HA of susceptible strains, thereby blocking the ability of HA to bind to sialylated cell-surface receptors16,17. Furthermore, lectin-like proteins may also inhibit the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell by binding to sialic acid on the surface of the host cell18. In our evaluation system, since host cells were exposed to a mixture of saliva and virus for 30 min, the action of lectin-like proteins in saliva that inhibit the contact between host cells and virus would also contribute to the anti-IAV activity of saliva. On the other hand, in our evaluation system, the activity of molecules that inhibit the later mechanisms of virus propagation, such as replication and release, is not reflected in the anti-IAV activity. For this reason, defensin and lactoferrin, which are known to inhibit replication of IAV12,33,34,35,36,37, showed only a weak correlation with anti-IAV activity in our study.The current thinking regarding influenza infection morbidity is that the risk factors are related to age, higher rates of infection in school-aged children relative to adults, and lower rates in the elderly. Children spend a great deal of time in communities where daily contact with other people is extensive; for example, in schools, playgroups, and daycare centers, and it is assumed that close contact favors infection38,39. The results of evaluating differences in salivary properties by age (Fig. 4) showed that salivary volume, which has been reported as a predictive risk factor for influenza transmission8, was higher in the younger age group. On the other hand, the mean value of anti-IAV activity of saliva in the young group was significantly lower than that in the middle and elderly groups. These results suggest that low salivary anti-IAV activity may also be associated with a high rate of IAV transmission in school-aged children. In the present study, although the mean value of BSA concentration in saliva of young group was not significantly different from that of the middle and elderly groups, salivary anti-IAV activity was highly correlated with sialic acid in all age group, indicating that the determinants of anti-IAV activity were not as sensitive to age. Previous studies have shown that glycoproteins capable of binding IAV are lower in the saliva of children than in adults and the elderly, supporting our results22. Thus, qualitative control of saliva in young people may be effective in preventing IAV infection.There are two major limitations to this study as follow: First, we have not been able to define the contribution of proteins such as SGP28, C6orf58, and PIP that are significantly correlated with anti-IAV activity. It is important to prepare these purified proteins from saliva and conduct experiments to determine the relationship between glycosylation levels of these proteins and anti-IAV activity. Second, we have not been able to examine the effect of salivary anti-IAV activity on respiratory illnesses. Retrospective study the relationship between salivary anti-IAV activity and history of respiratory disease and recent antibody prevalence against influenza viruses, or prospective intervention trials with techniques that provide control of salivary anti-IAV are needed to gain insight into the contribution of salivary anti-IAV activity.Our study revealed that there are large individual differences in the anti-IAV activity of saliva, which mainly depends on the amount of BSA. BSA directly contributes to salivary anti-IAV, which may contribute to influenza morbidity in young people. In conclusion, the understanding of individual differences in salivary anti-IAV activity may provide new insights into creating effective methods to prevent influenza infection. ReferencesStöhr, K.

Exhibitions are an increased risk of HPAI because animals from multiple sources are concentrated in one area during the event.”“Flock owners are eligible to receive indemnity on their birds from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),” the news release continues. “The Montana Department of Livestock is conducting an epidemiological investigation and will be identifying other poultry producers in the area to conduct disease surveillance and to provide educational resources.”On April 12 a third backyard flock consisting of 21 birds tested positive for the H5 strain of HPAI in Fallon County. That was followed last Monday by reports that the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus had been detected in a snow goose from Canyon Ferry and a Canada goose from near Belgrade. Several other birds from across Montana are currently undergoing testing for the virus.Montana is now the 25th state to report cases of HPAI in domestic poultry this year. A similar outbreak of HPAI swept across the Midwest and Pacific Northwest in the Spring of 2015. The outbreak led to the depopulation of more than 50.5 million commercial chickens, turkeys and other poultry to limit the spread of the disease.“High path avian influenza strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to chickens, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock,” a report from the American Farm Bureau Federation states. “To prevent suffering in the affected flocks and help curb the spread of the virus to other flocks, when HPAI is detected the entire flock is depopulated. This is a heart-wrenching event for the grower, regardless of the size of the grower’s flock.”The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates about 12 percent of the U.S. table-egg laying chicken population and 8 percent of the turkeys grown in the U.S. for meat were lost due to the 2015 outbreak. A report from the Congressional Research Service estimated the value of turkey and laying hen losses due to the 2014-2015 HPAI outbreak at nearly $1.6 billion.“More than 80 percent of bird losses, totaling 39 million, were recorded between April 17 and May 19, 2015,” The American Farm Bureau Federation reports. “Layers accounted for a large majority of the lost birds … and were compounded by extensive losses of layer pullets, birds that mature into replacement layers. Additionally, almost 600,000 breeding turkeys were lost.”Montana’s exposure during the 2015 HPAI outbreak was limited to a single domestic flock of chickens in Judith Basin County. The disease was also detected and in a captive falcon in Columbia Falls. The Judith Basin County flock consisted of less than 100 birds, which were euthanized, and their bodies burned or buried to prevent the further spread of HPAI.However, there is now growing concern across the U.S. that the current outbreak of HPAI has the potential to equal the devastating losses of 2015.The first detections of HPAI were announced in December 2021 in flocks of domesticated birds in Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada. Confirmation of the disease among wild birds in South Carolina on January 13 of this year. Since then, the disease has spread to all four bird migration flyways, including the Central and Pacific flyways which include parts of Montana.Thus far in 2022, more than 18.7 million chickens and 3.2 million turkeys have been depopulated as a result of HPAI, the American Farm Bureau Federation reports. A handful of states have borne the brunt of the current outbreak, including Iowa which as of April 12 has been forced to depopulate more than 12.75 million layers, a quarter of all laying hens in the state. Wisconsin, Maryland, Minnesota, and South Dakota have also been particularly hard hit.Wildlife biologists are also concerned.Among the latest victims of the HPAI outbreak are bald eagles. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture at least 36 bald eagles in 14 states have died since February after contracting HPAI. Eagles in two additional states are suspected of falling ill due to the disease. There have been no confirmed cases of HPAI among eagles in Montana.“Migratory waterfowl are the primary source for avian influenza,” says the Montana Department of Livestock. “Wild birds can be infected and appear healthy but shed virus in the feces, saliva, and respiratory secretions. Domestic poultry become infected through direct contact with infected wild birds, or through contact with contaminated objects, equipment, or the environment. A contaminated environment can include straw and animal bedding, equipment, clothes and shoes.“Sick birds can exhibit numerous signs such as swollen eyes, discolored comb and legs, significant drop in egg production or water and feed consumption, or sudden death. The Montana Department of Livestock encourages all poultry producers to immediately report sudden onset of illness or high death loss in domestic poultry to their veterinarian or the department at (444-2976).”In addition to canceling shows and exhibitions, poultry producers are also encouraged to implement the following biosecurity:Prevent contact between wild or migratory birds and domestic poultry, including access by wild birds to feed and water sources.House birds indoors to the extent possible to limit exposure to wild or migratory birds.Limit visitor access to areas where birds are housed.Use dedicated clothing and protective footwear when caring for domestic poultry.Immediately isolate sick animals and contact your veterinarian or MDOL.“There is no increased risk to consumption of poultry or poultry products,” said Montana State Veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluski.The Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers the risk to people from these HPAI infections in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry, to be low. No human infections with the virus have been detected at this time. However, it is recommended that people follow proper sanitary precautions when handling birds. Wear latex or rubber gloves when cleaning birds, washing hands with soapy water after cleaning, clean and disinfect equipment and surfaces that came in contact with the bird, and cook thoroughly before eating the meat. As a reminder, the US Department of Agriculture recommends cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

(Pexels)Washtenaw County, Mich. – Several domestic parrots in Washtenaw County have succumbed to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories has confirmed.Samples were sent to the lab following an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development after cases were confirmed in wild birds in the area.Recommended VideosMDARD is currently working with the owners of the parrots to come up with a flock plan to curb the spread of the disease.It is rare for pet birds to contract HPAI since they are unlikely to come into contact with wild birds. For those birds housed inside a residence, the only way they could catch the disease is by coming into contact with contaminated materials like an owner’s clothing that’s been exposed, cage furniture or food.Read: Avian influenza confirmed in birds living in Washtenaw CountyAccording to officials, residents with pet birds should store food and water bowls away from where wild birds roost or fly. Additionally, bird owners should change or disinfect any shoes and clothing that have been worn off the premises. “It’s important to recognize it’s very difficult for pet birds to catch avian influenza if the proper precautions are taken to stop the virus,” state veterinarian Nora Wineland said in a release. “For example, put in safeguards to not introduce any material, food, or clothing that wild birds may have contaminated. “No matter what bird species or how many birds one owns—now is the time to protect them. Bird owners need to take every strategy to protect their flocks and reduce the spread of HPAI within our state. MDARD continues to act swiftly to reduce the spread and respond to the ongoing presence of HPAI in Michigan.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said no cases of the avian influenza viruses have been detected in humans and do not present a public health concern at this time. Additionally, HPAI-infected birds or bird products will enter the food chain.Read: With bird flu cases growing, Michigan suggests limiting bird feeders this yearAccording to a release, state officials recommend taking the following precautions to protect domestic birds:Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.Disinfecting boots and other gear when moving between coops.Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.Using well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.All About Ann ArborStay up to date with the latest local stories.

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY Michigan DNR suggests bird feeders come down as precaution against avian fluElissa Welle | Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption Zoos hiding birds inside as avian flu spreadsZoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza. (April 6)APWith more cases of bird flu detected in wild and domestic birds across Michigan, the Department of Natural Resources suggests Michiganders take down their bird feeders and birdbaths out of an abundance of caution. Birds flock to Michigan in April and May as they migrate through the Great Lakes region after wintering in Central and South America. Migrating species, such as the colorful yellow-rumped warbler or the soaring broad-winged hawk, may seek out food sources in backyard bird feeders, causing some Michigan birders to worry about spreading the avian influenza, also known as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), HPAI was first detected in the state in a backyard, nonpoultry flock of birds in Kalamazoo County in late February. Birds at the Detroit Zoo were moved indoors in response to protect from bird flu exposure. More recent cases of HPAI have cropped up across the state, including in household parrots in Washtenaw County on April 18. More: Bird owners urged to protect flocks after avian influenza detected in wild, domestic birdsMore: DNR confirms avian flu in wild birds in Macomb, 2 other countiesMore: Detroit Zoo moving birds indoors after avian virus was detected in MichiganMegan Moriarty, DNR state wildlife veterinarian, said in a statement that bird species vary in how likely they are to die from HPAI infection. While all birds are potentially susceptible to bird flu, domestic birds — such as chickens, cockatoos or doves — are more vulnerable to fatal infection. In addition, some wild bird populations, like waterfowl, raptors and scavengers, are "highly susceptible and have been particularly affected by this disease," Moriarty said in the statement. Songbirds appear less prone to bird flu, although Moriarty noted that testing of songbirds is limited and much is still unknown. “If you’re concerned about this virus and want to act from a place of abundant caution, removing your bird feeders for now makes sense, but it isn’t yet a critical step,” Moriarty said. “With warmer springtime weather on the way, too, birds will have more natural food sources readily available to them.”Bird feeder removal could be wise for those who see blue jays, crows or ravens in their backyard because those species are deemed high-risk to HPAI. Birdbaths are also places for birds to come in contact and spread HPAI, and the DNR suggests temporarily removing baths until the HPAI spread in wild and domestic birds decreases, which may be months or longer. For those who wish to keep their bird feeders in place, Moriarty suggested a number of steps to reduce the spread of bird flu. Clean bird feeders with a diluted bleach solution (and rinse well) once per week. Regularly cleaning helps protect birds against other infections, including salmonella.Clean up birdseed that has fallen below the feeders to discourage large numbers of birds and other wildlife from congregating in a concentrated area.Don’t feed wild birds, especially waterfowl, near domestic flocks.The DNR also stated that the HPAI detections "do not present an immediate public health concern." "No human cases of this strain of HPAI virus have been detected in the United States. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the food chain.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that avian influenza has been detected in La Plata County. La Plata County is now the third county in Colorado, after Pitkin and Montrose counties, with an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza virus. The easily transmissible disease can decimate entire flocks of poultry. (Jerry McBride/Durango Herald file) The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that avian influenza has been detected in La Plata County. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza virus in a mixed species backyard poultry operation Wednesday after tests at Colorado State University. “It’s definitely something we’ve expected to see in Colorado,” said Olga Robak, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Agriculture. “It’s divided between the Continental Divide. East of the Divide, we’ve had only confirmed cases in wild birds. West of the Divide, we have had confirmed cases in domestic birds.” La Plata County becomes the third county in Colorado after Pitkin and Montrose counties, to have an outbreak in poultry. The owner of the backyard operation informed the Colorado State Veterinarian’s Office of an outbreak in the flock on April 14, according to a Colorado Department of Agriculture news release. A Durango veterinarian took samples of two sick birds and submitted them to CSU’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the diagnosis on April 20, three days after the flock’s 40 birds were euthanized, according to USDA data. The Colorado Department of Agriculture does not share more specific information, Robak said. HPAI is a highly transmissible and deadly virus transmitted between birds. Wild birds typically spread the disease to poultry, but domesticated flocks can also spread the disease between each other. Rachel Huber, owner of Grace Gardens, gathers eggs from her chickens at Heartwood Cohousing near Bayfield in 2015. Avian flu has a 90% to 100% mortality rate within 24 to 48 hours, forcing farmers to euthanize entire flocks. So far, avian flu has affected more than 31 million domesticated birds across the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

So far, avian flu has affected more than 31 million domesticated birds across the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (Jerry McBride/Durango Herald file) “This is a natural virus for (wild birds). They can carry it and can have no signs of illness,” Robak said. “When those wild birds come in contact with domestic birds, that’s when the virus can really cause a lot of destruction in domestic poultry because poultry does not have the built resistance to this virus.” HPAI has a 90% to 100% mortality rate within 24 to 48 hours, so farmers euthanize their entire flock once birds test positive, said Amy Reid, owner of Jakes Farm, a poultry, pork and produce farm, in Hesperus. There is no cure and no vaccine. “Thank God, it wasn’t us, but I feel bad for whoever it was,” she said. “We’ve been dreading this day.” As of Thursday, nearly 31 million birds have been affected this year by the virus, either dying from the virus or being euthanized, according to the USDA. Nationally, 29 states and 221 producers have experienced outbreaks. The USDA first reported a case of HPAI in a wild American wigeon in South Carolina on Jan. 14. It marked the first time since 2016 that a wild bird had been confirmed positive for the disease in the U.S. Since then, avian influenza has spread across the country. It was first detected in a commercial flock in an Indiana turkey farm on Feb. 9, moving to Kentucky, New York and Maine next. The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced the first cases of HPAI in Colorado in Pitkin County on April 9. Of the 36 animals in the flock, 35 died of the virus. The flock had been exposed to sick waterfowl in previous days. Tests confirmed avian influenza on April 8. More than 60,000 birds at a commercial facility were euthanized after positive cases in Montrose County a little more than a week later. Reid, who has anywhere from 1,000 to 1,200 birds on her farm at any one time, has been watching HPAI move steadily across the country and preparing for the possible arrival of the disease in La Plata County. “We knew it was coming. We just kept seeing it go state to state,” she said. “When I saw that it hit Texas, I was like, ‘Oh, no,’ because those birds are migrating up. It was just a matter of time.” In recent years, Reid has been transitioning her flock to free-range grazing. However, that exposes them to wild birds where they are at risk of catching avian flu. The disease can be transmitted to domesticated birds through direct contact or through fecal matter. It can be as simple as a wild bird and poultry eating the same feed. But it can also be tracked and spread through equipment, vehicles and even shoes and clothes. To prepare, Reid has moved feed inside and had to find a balance between outdoor exposure where her poultry can come into contact with wild birds and indoor spaces where disease can spread rapidly. Jakes Farm already employs a closed water system so birds don’t come into contact with standing water. “We’re using as much of the resources that we have to keep everybody covered without having to enclose them in barns,” she said. “We’re trying to work in the middle as best we can.” Canada geese and other wild birds can spread avian flu to poultry through shared food and water as well as fecal matter. Humans can also spread the disease to domesticated flocks, so the Colorado Department of Agriculture and Amy Reid, the owner of Jakes Farm, a poultry, pork and produce farm, in Hesperus are asking people to take precautions.

(Jerry McBride/Durango Herald file) While avian flu is not a food safety risk (poultry and eggs can be safely eaten when cooked properly) and no cases have been detected in people in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, humans can serve as an important vector for the disease. There are several steps producers and the public can take to limit the spread of avian disease, including moving food and water indoors and suspending farm tours and visits, Reid said. But arguably the most important precaution is changing shoes. Reid has been in touch with the Durango Farmers Market to ask that any vendors not wear their farm boots to the market and any customers who have potentially been exposed to wild birds not wear those shoes to avoid spreading avian flu. “The shoes is the easiest thing that we can ask people to do at this point, just pay attention to not tracking stuff with your shoes,” Reid said. For farmers who lose their flocks to HPAI, the USDA offers financial assistance. Robak said Colorado Crisis Services and the Colorado Agricultural Addiction and Mental Health Program can also help bird owners who are struggling with mental health because of HPAI. “This is really hard for people, especially when they have backyard flocks. Those animals become part of the family, and we know that this is really taxing on people emotionally,” Robak said. “There are definitely resources available for people who are struggling with anxiety or stress around HPAI.” Community awareness is critical to prevent the spread of disease and limit the impacts on farmers, Reid said. “I think a lot of people don’t realize what’s going on,” she said. “I’ve talked to a lot of farmers, who are like, ‘Oh, we don’t have poultry, so it’s not a concern.’ But you could still track it. We need the community to try to practice safety and the biosecurity for us. It’s a big deal.” ahannon@durangoherald.com Copy article link Related Stories You might also like What do Tuesday’s election results say about voters in La Plata County?

Is it safe to feed the brightly colored tiny visitors using their own feeders?According to Dr. Victoria Hall of the University of Minnesota Raptor Center, hummingbird feeders are not without risk when it comes to spreading disease. They do, however, pose a lower risk than general feeders as there are limited groups of birds visiting them. Despite this, Hall recommending people consider pausing their use in areas with high transmission of HPAI.“Or if you continue to use them, clean them on a daily basis to further reduce risk,” Hall said.READ MORE:Why experts say you should immediately stop filling birdfeedersWhile waterfowl can carry and shed the HPAI virus without symptoms, birds like domestic chickens and raptors get severe illness and rapidly die. HPAI is spread in the feces and respiratory secretions of infected birds and can be easily transmitted on objects contaminated with virus particles. The virus is tough and can survive cold and freezing temperatures, as well as survive in aquatic environments.Hall said there are “lots of gaps in knowledge” about the role of songbirds in HPAI outbreak making it hard to measure the risk of transmission. It is because of this uncertainty experts are recommending people take measures to limit exposure for wildlife.RECOMMENDED•al.comMan who killed eagles on a Native American reservation gets nearly 4 years in prisonNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Poachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.“Because the science is unclear on the role of songbirds in this current H5N1 outbreak, one consideration is to not encourage birds to gather together at places such as bird feeders or bird baths.

Joseph Leahy, The Texas Newsroom | Posted on April 22, 2022, 5:20 PM Share Facebook Twitter/X LinkedIn Email Charlie Neibergall / Associated PressFILE – In this Oct. 21, 2015, Some farmers are wondering if it’s OK that eggs sold as free-range come from chickens being kept inside. It’s a question that arises lately as farmers try to be open about their product while also protecting chickens from a highly infectious bird flu that has killed roughly 28 million poultry across the country. Texas agriculture experts are warning commercial poultry producers and residents with backyard flocks to be on guard now that a virulent strain of avian influenza has reached Texas. The virus has already devastated domesticated bird populations in other parts of North America. Earlier this month, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) and U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed Texas' first case of the H5N1 strain of a virus, which originated in Europe in fall 2020. “Luckily, it was not in our commercial broiler or commercial egg-laying facilities here across the state. It was a much smaller operation that produces pheasants and game birds,” said Tracy Tomascik, Texas Farm Bureau Commodity and Regulatory Activities Associate Director, in an interview with The Texas Newsroom. Texas' first positive tests showed up April 2 in pheasants raised for hunting at a game-bird ranch in Erath County, about 70 miles southwest of Fort Worth. The outbreak forced the operator to euthanize its entire mixed-bird flock of pheasants, quail and ducks due to exposure. According to the U.S Center for Disease Control and Prevention "the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low, however some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection." The highly pathogenic variant has been confirmed among wild bird populations in more than 30 states and Canada. Outbreaks so far have forced commercial poultry operations, primarily in the Midwest, to euthanize roughly 22 million mostly egg-laying chickens. The commercial losses to egg and poultry markets have contributed to rising prices in the U.S., but Texas has been less impacted than other regions. “Our consumers aren’t being hit very hard and we hope it stays that way. Our farmers are doing their very best to prevent something like that from occurring,” Tomascik said, explaining the state's commercial poultry producers, located primarily in East Texas, have enhanced bio security measures since the U.S.'s last major outbreak of bird flu in 2015. According to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service Associate Professor and poultry specialist Gregory Archer, the virus is believed to have spread across the globe through migratory birds that are less vulnerable to getting sick and dying. "They come over through Russia and China, across into Alaska and then into Canada. And then they migrate down south through the flyaways," Archer told The Texas Newsroom. "That's basically where we've seen [the outbreaks] start: in the flyaways on the east coast and it's made its way west as the birds start to migrate more in that direction." What to do if you have backyard chickens The chances for bird-born viruses to spread has grown over the past decade with what Archer called the "exponential increase" in keeping backyard chickens, a trend that accelerated during the pandemic. For that reason, he urged Texans tending their own flocks to take extra precautions during the current bird migration season. "Don’t encourage wild birds to come on to your property where your chickens are by putting bird feeders out and things like that,” said Archer. If you have a pond on your property or farm, “Don’t let your birds go down...to interact with wild ducks." Archer said humans can also expose their at-home flocks to the virus by tracking it in from elsewhere. "Especially this time of year when we've got migratory birds [traveling across the state], try to limit your exposure to those birds," he said. "Limit exposure of even your vehicles and clothing that go to other places where there are those birds so you may not bring it back with you." In response to the spread of avian influenza, zoos across Texas — including in Austin, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio — have also closed public exhibits and moved susceptible birds indoors to limit their exposure to wild populations.

(Charlie Neibergall / AP Photo) A poultry farm in Lancaster County’s East Donegal Township is ground zero in Pennsylvania for the highly contagious bird flu that has swept across the U.S., killing wild birds and poultry alike and leaving farmers with no choice but to euthanize their own flocks to keep it from spreading further. Samples tested by the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory as well as another lab in Iowa identified the first known cases of bird flu among commercial poultry in Pennsylvania since 1984, according to the Agriculture Department. About 1.4 million birds on the Lancaster County farm were “euthanized as quickly, safely, and humanely as possible,” the department said. More than 160 commercial and private poultry farms within a 10-kilometer radius are under quarantine. Bird flu rarely spreads to people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said “there is no risk to the public, and poultry and eggs are safe to eat if cooked properly.” WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor However, the flu called “highly pathogenic avian influenza” is often fatal for chickens, ducks, geese, and other domestic birds. In March the state Game Commission identified the first Pennsylvania avian influenza case since the virus was detected in North America in 2021 — a bald eagle found dead in Chester County. Hooded mergansers, a type of small duck, found in Clarion and Venango counties were also soon identified to have died from the virus. Related Content NPRHealth Avian flu is infecting U.S. poultry flocks. It could affect the price of chicken, too Whether the outbreak will affect the price of eggs and poultry depends on how widespread it becomes, an expert says. 3 years ago Bodily waste from wild birds on their migratory routes is the main way that the virus spreads to commercially raised poultry, Redding said. That can make it difficult to stop. The state has ordered a ban on “the exhibition of poultry and eggs at county and local fairs” for the next two months. At stake is the commonwealth’s $7.1 billion poultry industry, which employs 26,000 people, Redding said. The flu, which has spread to 29 states, has led farmers to cull millions of birds, adding to price and supply chain woes. “There’s only so many chickens,” Redding said. “There’s only so many eggs. There’s only so much poultry. So we have to be aware that there could be implications to supply if we don’t contain this.” Those who have birds should look for sudden death, lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of the head and other areas, coughing, sneezing, lack of coordination, and diarrhea.

Tim Walz, U.S. senators visit Kandiyohi County to meet with those responding to avian flu State and federal lawmakers, as well as the state's agriculture commissioner and director of the state Board of Animal Health, came to Kandiyohi County on Tuesday to speak to area poultry producers and industry officials about how the avian flu has impacted them. Discussion was also had on how the state has been responding to the latest outbreak. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks to members of the news media Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at the Kandiyohi County Health and Human Services building following a roundtable discussion regarding H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in Minnesota.Macy Moore / West Central Tribune By Shelby Lindrud April 19, 2022 at 5:25 PM Share Share this article WILLMAR — Minnesota is proud of its agricultural heritage, including being the No. 1 producer of turkeys in the nation. Unfortunately, that also means the state is being hit hard by this year's outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.Since late March, nearly 1.4 million turkeys and chickens in Minnesota have been impacted and culled at 40 different sites — most of them commercial poultry producers and six of them in Kandiyohi County alone. ADVERTISEMENT "We knew this was coming. We saw it show up months ago on the East Coast," said Gov. Tim Walz at a news conference in Willmar on Tuesday, held after a roundtable meeting among local and state officials to discuss the state's response to the avian flu. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., speaks about avian flu in Minnesota pm Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at the Kandiyohi County Health and Human Services building in Willmar.Macy Moore / West Central Tribune Walz, along with U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, traveled to Willmar to speak with those directly impacted by the outbreak — including poultry producers and industry folks along with staff from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state Board of Animal Health, who are working nearly nonstop to help slow the spread of the disease. The governor and senators were joined by Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen and Minnesota Board of Animal Health Executive Director Dr. Beth Thompson. Minnesota started ramping up its response once the disease started showing up in other states, so when the first cases was identified in Meeker and Mower counties on March 25, everything was ready, including emergency operations centers and case managers to work with each individual farm. Lessons learned from the 2015 outbreak have also assisted in reacting to this year's surge."What we do know (is) we are in a much better space" this time around, Klobuchar, D-Minn., said. U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., answers questions about cases of avian flu in Minnesota during a news conference conducted Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at the Kandiyohi County Health and Human Services building in Willmar.Macy Moore / West Central Tribune Based on the data being collected from infected barns, it seems that the vast majority of the spread this year is coming from wild migrating waterfowl, such as geese and ducks, that are infecting single farms. That is a change from 2015, when a lot of the transmission was caused by humans spreading disease particles."The industry since 2015 in Minnesota, and the backyard flocks, have really stepped up that biosecurity," Thompson said, "meaning that our farmers and our backyard flock owners aren't tracking the virus from farm to farm to farm. What we are seeing are individual introductions."There is a low risk of the avian flu impacting human health and so far there have been no reported human cases in the United States. There is also no concern regarding food safety, Walz said. ADVERTISEMENT What isn't known at this time is whether the disease can be spread by songbirds, though the disease is having an impact on the state's raptor population including bald eagles and owls.Thompson said residents should use common sense on whether to continue filling their backyard bird feeders. If a home is near a water source where waterfowl congregate, it might not be a bad idea to cut back on feeding. Thompson said organizations such as the University of Minnesota are studying the question of how songbirds and other backyard birds fit into the avian flu equation."They are looking at (it). There are questions about all different types of birds," Thompson said. Gov. Tim Walz, left, speaks to members of the press following a roundtable discussion regarding H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in Minnesota on Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at the Kandiyohi County Health and Human Services building in Willmar. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is at right.Macy Moore / West Central Tribune Because of this more "popcorn" like spread of the virus, where one farm might be impacted but not another in the same area, each individual farm needs to look closely at how wild waterfowl could spread the disease into barns. "It is site-specific. It all depends on that certain site, that certain farmer and their workers," Thompson said. "The ultimate goal is to keep the virus out, but it is not one size fits all."State leaders are also keeping a close eye on the toll the outbreak is having on the producers and their families. Whether it is the financial loss or the emotional anguish of having to kill their entire flock at one time, it is a difficult time for the farmers and their families. ADVERTISEMENT The state Department of Agriculture has invested in having mental health support for farmers, including hiring two counselors on staff and implementing the Minnesota Farm and Rural Helpline , which is staffed 24/7. Those needing to talk can call, email and even text."Everybody needs help," Smith said. "Asking for help is a sign of strength, not of weakness."On the financial side, both state and federal lawmakers are looking at ways to support producers who have lost their entire flocks, as well as making sure funding remains available to continue responding to the outbreak. Walz signed a $1 million emergency avian flu response bill early this month, and other economic relief could be coming to producers."We are trying to get people at least back to zero, so they can repopulate and get going," Walz said. Minnesota Board of Animal Health Executive Director Dr. Beth Thompson fields questions from the press following a roundtable discussion on the avian flu outbreak in Minnesota. She was among officials gathered Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at the Kandiyohi County Health and Human Services building in Willmar.Macy Moore / West Central Tribune Like probably everyone in Minnesota, those impacted by and responding to the outbreak are keeping an eye on the weather forecast and hoping for warmer temperatures. The wet and cold is a contributing factor to the continued spread of the avian flu, and there is a concern that the state might still have several weeks of case growth due to weather as waterfowl continue their travels."The environment needs to warm up, we need to heat up and we need to dry out," Thompson said. "Getting the wild waterfowl out of here — we can't do anything about that, but they will finish their migratory patterns that they go through." ADVERTISEMENT Despite the challenges the outbreak is causing, those speaking at the news conference were all impressed by the state's response so far. They commended, again and again, the different partners who have been working together to react quickly to outbreaks while also being there for the producers impacted."Our state excels in working together and not having turf wars and getting things done," Klobuchar said.

The virus is also causing the death of millions of commercial chickens and turkeys. Pixabay A highly contagious bird flu that’s sickening commercial chickens and turkeys is also now spreading among bald eagles. At least 36 bald eagles have died since February, according to data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has killed bald eagles—the United States’ national bird—in Florida, Nebraska, Ohio, Georgia, Kansas, South Carolina and several other states, according to the data. Eagles suffering from the virus may have seizures and be unable to stand up, reports Jennifer Calfas for the Wall Street Journal. The deaths are particularly concerning because bald eagles are also now grappling with lead poisoning that stems from ingesting ammunition while eating animals shot by hunters, reported Douglas Main for National Geographic in February. A study of 1,210 eagles in 38 states published in the journal Science earlier this year found that more than half of the birds had chronic lead poisoning. Lead toxicity can impair eagles’ ability to move, prevent them from digesting food and, if they ingest enough of the metal, it can kill them, per National Geographic. “We are seeing significant mortality,” Victoria Hall, executive director of the University of Minnesota’s Raptor Center, tells the Wall Street Journal. “The better data we can collect about what is happening in these populations, the better we can figure out how we can best support them.” Bald eagles were abundant in 1782, when the Founding Fathers incorporated the raptor into the new nation’s official seal. Based on anecdotal reporting at the time, upwards of 100,000 bald eagles lived in America, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). As the number of waterfowl, shorebirds and other prey declined in the 1800s, so too did the bald eagle population; people also incorrectly perceived bald eagles as a threat to livestock and shot them. Bald eagles are grappling with lead poisoning and the H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). USFWS Pacific Southwest Region via Flickr under CC BY-SA 2.0 To help the population rebound, Congress passed the Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act in 1940, which banned the killing, selling or possessing of the birds. Then, in the late 1940s, the new pesticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) began to proliferate, poisoning bald eagles in the process. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs remained, per the USFWS. In light of mounting evidence about the dangers of DDT, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of the pesticide in 1972. Bald eagle numbers slowly began to rebound and, by 2018 and 2019, there were more than 70,000 breed pairs in the lower 48 states, according to the USFWS. The U.S. Department of the Interior removed the raptor from the endangered species list in 2007. Eagles and other wild birds aside, the virus is also sickening millions of commercial birds raised for their eggs and meat across the country—and driving up the price of eggs and poultry in the process. In Iowa, the country’s leading egg-producing state, producers have killed more than 13 million chickens and turkeys affected by the virus. All told, farmers across the country have slaughtered nearly 27 million commercial chickens and turkeys to help stop the spread of the virus, which has been reported in 27 states. This is the deadliest bird flu outbreak since 2014-15, when 50 million chickens and turkeys died either from the virus or in efforts to prevent its spread. Producers across the country have slaughtered nearly 27 million commercial chickens and turkeys to help stop the spread of the virus, which has been reported in 27 states. Pixabay Though animal health experts can’t predict the long-term effects of the virus, many are concerned about the potential impact to the supply chain, food costs and wild bird populations, which are already declining. Though the virus is harming birds, it’s unlikely to spread among humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency notes, however, that humans can become infected if they spend a lot of time around infected birds without wearing proper respiratory or eye protection gear and enough of the virus gets into their nose, mouth, eyes or lungs. Human cases of bird flu are rare but can cause eye infections, upper respiratory symptoms, pneumonia and even death. The virus is not easily spread from person to person, according to the CDC.

Photo: Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images By Aaron Tremper Editorial Intern, Audubon Magazine Published April 21, 2022 An outbreak of avian flu that has been spreading across the United States and Canada over the past six months only seems to be getting worse. First appearing in Canada last fall, the flu has ravaged industrial flocks and has now been detected in a wide variety of North American wild birds, raising alarms among ecologists. A particularly virulent strain known as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1), or HPAI, the flu has already killed millions of domestic North American fowl, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). To date, more than 28 million domestic poultry in 29 states have died either through infection or preventative culling. In Canada, seven provinces have detected the virus in commercial and backyard poultry. The flu has also appeared in wild flocks in unprecedented numbers, with more than 700 positive birds collected from 31 states and nine Canadian provinces—numbers that indicate a much larger outbreak as they only account for sick or dead birds that have been tested. All together, more than 40 species have been confirmed infected with the virus, a list that includes everything from Mallards and Black-billed Magpies to Bald Eagles and Great Blue Herons. Wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, and raptors, which prey on these species, make up the majority of cases. In Florida, more than 1,000 Lesser Scaups died as part of an ongoing mortality event. And last week at Baker’s Lake Nature Preserve in Chicago, 200 wild birds believed to be infected were found dead. This particular strain of HPAI appears to be more infectious and deadly to wild birds than previous versions, but gauging the pathogen's true impact on wild populations is more difficult than with domestic poultry, whose numbers are regularly recorded, says Andy Ramey, director of the Molecular Ecology Laboratory at the United State Geological Survey’s (USGS) Alaska Science Center. “There might be numerous birds affected, but only a small subset of the carcasses are actually collected and sent in for diagnostics.” So far, the strain is a low public health threat with no cases of human infection having occurred in the United States, according to the CDC. The virus, which can cause severe neurological and respiratory issues in avians, was likely transmitted by wild birds contaminated from last year’s Eurasian HPAI outbreak, says Julianna Lenoch, a veterinary epidemiologist with APHIS whose team followed the strain’s year-and-a-half spread throughout Europe and Asia. Lenoch believes migratory birds may have carried the strain from Western Europe through Iceland and Greenland before arriving in Eastern Canada. Once the flu made landfall in North America, the National Wildlife Disease Program at APHIS sequenced positive samples collected along the Atlantic Flyway. “Those sequences match very, very closely with what was circulating in Europe in the spring of 2021,” she says. A milder version of the avian flu, called low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI,) is present year-round in North American wild birds, usually leading to mild infections at most. Many wild birds infected with LPAI may show no symptoms at all. But when LPAI spreads to domestic poultry, it can mutate into the much more aggressive HPAI strain, which can then be transmitted back to wild populations. The last case of HPAI in North American wild birds occurred in 2015. That outbreak resulted in the deaths of more than 50 million domestic birds in 15 states and accounted for 98 detections in infected wild birds—a number that pales in comparison to this year’s confirmed cases. “In previous outbreaks, we’ve appreciated that wild birds carry the virus, but they don’t actually get sick from it,” says Lenoch. “They’re kind of silent carriers.” Experts believe the strain’s spread is largely being fueled by migrating waterfowl this spring. Experts believe the strain’s spread is largely being fueled by migrating waterfowl this spring. The first confirmed cases in Canada and the United States occurred late last year from a Great Black-backed Gull in Newfoundland and a Blue-winged Teal and an American Wigeon found in South Carolina this January. In February, the outbreak started making its way up the Mississippi Flyway, a telltale sign that waterfowl are active vectors for the current strain, says Bryan Richards, a wildlife biologist and emerging disease coordinator for the USGS National Wildlife Health Center. “It was really interesting to watch the early cases following the Missouri River Basin,” Richards says. “You can plot them going straight up the Missouri River all the way up into South Dakota. The movers and shakers of this are migratory waterfowl, no doubt, no doubt whatsoever.” The most common hosts for avian flu, waterfowl often show no symptoms and can quickly spread the virus as they congregate along thousands of miles of waterways. Raptors usually become infected by eating contaminated birds, while domestic poultry contract the virus primarily through feces left by waterfowl passing over or sharing grazing spaces. Domestic birds can also become indirectly exposed through contaminants tracked into enclosures. This risk of infection from migrating flocks has prompted zoos around the country to start bringing their birds indoors and take preventative measures such as installing netting around enclosures and washing or changing clothes and gear before entering exhibit areas. Tammy O’Neil, wildlife manager of the Lake Metroparks Wildlife Care in Ohio, says her facility decided to stop accepting wild birds after confirmed cases started popping up in the state. She says the lack of symptoms seen in waterfowl and the virus’s ability to survive for long periods outside of its host make the outbreak difficult to monitor. “[The virus] can also live on different types of surfaces, like your clothes, your boots, any equipment you might be using—countertops, cages, things like that,” says O’Neil, whose facility houses animal ambassadors for education programs. “So we didn’t want to risk bringing it into our facility and potentially, you know, wiping out our whole bird collection that we use for programs.” ​__________ Birds that do show symptoms often act disoriented or uncoordinated and exhibit strange head movements. _________ Birds that do show symptoms often act disoriented or uncoordinated and exhibit strange head movements, O’Neil says. Respiratory symptoms such as sneezing and nasal discharge are also often present. According to the CDC, anyone who sees birds exhibiting strange symptoms should call their state health or wildlife agency for guidance, a move which can also help track the progression of the outbreak. Historically, avian influenza has posed little risk to common songbirds, but recent infections in Canada and the United States of corvids such as Blue Jays, American Crows, and Common Ravens concern researchers about the possibilty of an even larger outbreak. And a confirmed case of an infected Black-billed Magpie in Wyoming has Audubon Rockies Community Science Coordinator Zach Hutchinson worried about the possible spread of avian flu through bird feeders. “In the West, Magpies are a common feeder bird for many folks,” says Hutchinson. He points out that corvids, like raptors, are scavengers that could possibly pick up the virus from infected carcasses. At this point, guidance on whether the public should take down bird feeders has been mixed. While some groups such as the The University of Minnesota’s Raptor Center and Cornell Cooperative Extension are advising people to do so, others say cleaning bird feeders, gear, and baths regularly should suffice. The National Audubon Society currently recommends its members to follow the guidelines provided by local and state agencies. As spring migration ramps up, Hutchinson also urges birders visiting parks with waterfowl to disinfect their shoes afterward, which can help prevent transmitting the virus to unaffected areas. Lenoch, for her part, says the USDA will continue to work with other government agencies to track the flu’s spread and keep concerned citizens informed. She also notes that the public can help limit the spread of this outbreak by reporting suspected cases and exercising the utmost caution if they may have been exposed. “This is a virus to take seriously,” Lenoch says. “We just don’t want to have any further introductions if we can help it.” Visit Birds Tell Us to Act on Climate page Birds Tell Us to Act on Climate Pledge to stand with Audubon to call on elected officials to listen to science and work towards climate solutions.

Chickens at two more farms in Lancaster County have tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. That brings the tally to three farms in Pennsylvania — two in East Donegal Township, as well as one more nearby, said Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. Redding declined to name the farms, saying that the department wants to keep people out of the so-called “control zone,” a 10 kilometer area where state and federal scientists and other experts are working to stop further virus spread. LNP reported that Kreider Farms is the source of one outbreak. Redding noted that while the virus poses no risk to consumers, it devastates poultry flocks — leaving farmers in the region on edge. “They want to know, as an example, if the trucks and service and supply for their particular operations coming out of the control zone, that those feed companies and supply companies have taken the appropriate protocols,” Redding said. An avian flu outbreak has Pennsylvania on alert Lancaster County alone has 1,677 poultry operations, including 162 within the control zone, Redding said. Statewide, poultry farming is a $7.1 billion industry that employs about 26,000 people. Penn State assistant animal science professor Gino Lorenzoni has been working with farmers in the control zone. He said he’s helping educate people on how to prevent them from spreading the virus. “It’s a very problematic virus,” Lorenzoni said. “It spreads very easily from flock to flock, so people can potentially bring the virus from one farm to the others.” Another part of the problem is that migratory birds spread the virus through their feces. Unlike chickens and other poultry, those birds sometimes don’t get ill, so they can transmit the influenza for hundreds of miles. The risk for humans is “minimal,” Lorenzoni said. People handling eggs and chicken from a grocery store face no risk of contracting the virus. There have been no cases of human infection in North America, Lorenzoni added, though historically there have been some cases in other parts of the world among people who were closely handling poultry. Those working on farms in the control zone wear protective equipment to limit their exposure. In addition to education, Lorenzoni has helped euthanize 3.4 million birds at those farms. “Even if there is one confirmed positive case within a farm of many thousand birds, the flock has to be depopulated — the entire flock.” Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Avian FluBrett SholtisBrett Sholtis is a reporter for PA Post.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 18, 2022 Close Photo: USDA Laboratory tests confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in three additional states, Pennsylvania, Idaho, and Utah, with losses in domestic flocks nearing 27.4 million birds, said the Agriculture Department. The first outbreak in Pennsylvania, at an egg farm in Lancaster County, was announced two days after the state banned poultry shows at county and local fairs for 60 days. "High path" bird flu has been found in 29 states, from Maine to North Carolina and westward into the Rockies, since outbreaks began in early February. Idaho and Utah are the farthest west that HPAI has been found so far — in two backyard flocks in southern Idaho and in a backyard flock in Utah County, Utah, 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. This year's outbreaks are the first appearance of HPAI in two years and the worst since the 2014-15 epidemic that killed more than 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens and turkeys. The viral disease can wipe out a flock quickly, so agricultural officials are ruthless in culling infected flocks in hopes of preventing the spread of the disease. Wild birds can spread HPAI through their droppings and it can be carried by contaminated vehicles, equipment, and clothing. "Anyone visiting a farm should be aware that your vehicles and shoes may carry the virus from other places you have walked," said Pennsylvania state agriculture secretary Russell Redding. "Clean them thoroughly and stay away from poultry barns unless you have to be there. Please be vigilant and do your part to protect our farms." Pennsylvania has a bird flu fund of $2 million, said Redding, "in addition to equipment, supplies, laboratories, and highly trained experts who have been on high alert and are supporting our poultry farmers." The outbreak on the egg farm in southeastern Pennsylvania is the 11th among egg-laying chickens this year. Egg farms have lost 18.7 million hens, the bulk of HPAI losses. Outbreaks on 89 turkey farms have killed 3.8 million birds. HPAI also was found among 63 backyard flocks. Most involved small numbers of birds, but the largest was 22,000 "backyard mixed species (poultry)," in Cascade County, Montana, on April 7. Bird flu has been found among backyard flocks, but not commercial flocks, in 13 of the 29 states with outbreaks; Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.

Handwashing? Staying healthy while learning to live with COVID-19April 22, 2022Written By Sarah RichardsTopicsCOVID-19COVID-19Health and WellnessPrevention and ScreeningEmily Landon MDCall Us At 1-888-824-0200Although COVID-19 cases are declining, the coronavirus that causes it is unlikely to disappear. Infectious disease expert Emily Landon, MD, says learning to live with COVID-19 means learning to accept our vulnerability to infectious diseases — and taking the right steps going forward to protect our health and the health of others. As the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, what worries you? As we switch to a COVID-19 prevention model where individuals are responsible for taking care of themselves, I'm not 100% convinced we've gotten all of the information out. People don't necessarily realize they're at high risk for getting a bad case of COVID-19. Those at obvious high-risk — older individuals, the immunocompromised, the unvaccinated — know. But as protection from our vaccines weaken, there are a lot of people who are at high risk for COVID-19 and other conditions because they have illnesses like heart disease, high blood pressure or diabetes. These may be well-controlled in your day-to-day life, but they still make you more vulnerable for severe COVID-19. Can I quit wearing a mask? Until coronavirus transmission is much lower, we need to keep masks on in places like trains, planes and buses. Japan uses the three C’s to remind people where risk of COVID-19 is highest: closed spaces (places with limited ventilation); crowds; and close contact settings. These are the places where masks offer the best benefit and individuals should decide whether or not to use a mask based on their risk and the current amount of COVID-19 in the community. Immunocompromised folks may want to keep wearing masks in most of these settings until COVID-19 rates are very low, whereas healthy, vaccinated people may want to forgo a mask. In a setting where masks aren’t required anymore, it’s important to choose a really protective mask (like a close-fitting KN95, KF94 or N95 mask) to provide the best protection. When cases are really high in an area, indoor mask mandates provide the best protection and can help save lives. On the other hand, when we get to a point where there's almost no COVID-19 circulating, there's no reason to be wearing masks unless you’re at very high risk. What mask should I use in the future? Choose the mask based on the situation and your risk factors. For instance, if you're a low-risk individual going to an event where everybody's wearing masks, people don't need to all be in N95s. Even a well-fitting fabric mask will offer some protection; a poorly fitting surgical mask probably isn’t any better. That said, a tight-fitting mask, like a well-fitted surgical mask with adjusted straps, such as KN95s and KF94s, would be a real step up. A fitted N95 mask is best. How often should I be washing or sanitizing my hands? For colds that are spread on surfaces, washing your hands is critical; for other colds, you're only going to pick them up from coughs and sneezes in the air. But you're not going to know what type of cold someone has when you're around them. Any time I switch settings or change buildings, I like to wash my hands. For example, when I go from work to home, I’m touching a lot of stuff along the way, so I wash my hands when I get home. Also make sure to wash your hands before preparing food, eating and after using the washroom. During the pandemic, the flu all but disappeared. Should I bother with a flu vaccine? I didn't think that if we asked everybody to wear a mask, it would completely end influenza. But in a normal year, tens of thousands of Americans die of influenza. We tend to underappreciate influenza and other respiratory viruses, because when we're young and healthy, they just seem like bad, nuisance colds. But they can be life-threatening for some people, including kids and even some healthy adults. The flu vaccine is helpful in preventing bad outcomes like hospitalization, pneumonia and even death. Still, you shouldn’t rely on the vaccine to be your only layer of protection. You also need to wash your hands and stay home when you're sick. And if you’re high-risk, make sure you have access to medications like Tamiflu. How should people who are older and/or immunocompromised navigate the next few months? High-risk individuals may need to take more precautions because others are no longer wearing masks to help shield them. For instance, in closed spaces with other people, the highest-risk individuals may need to wear both an N95 and face shield to protect their eyes from large COVID-19 droplets. Highest-risk people probably also need to avoid crowds altogether, even outside, if they can’t keep 6 feet of distance from the unmasked. Because vaccines aren’t as effective for this group, make sure to keep up with vaccination recommendations and pay attention to the COVID-19 situation. Your physician should be able to say whether new recommendations apply to you. At this point, why bother getting vaccinated against COVID-19? Everyone needs to be vaccinated for COVID-19 and it’s wise to keep up with boosters as well. Individuals who are unvaccinated are 10 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than the vaccinated. The current recommendations that it’s safe to be unmasked and "get back to normal" is meant for vaccinated people. Even healthy unvaccinated people are at high risk of a bad outcome after having COVID-19. More doses of these vaccines have been given than almost any other vaccine and vaccinated people are doing beautifully. We are not seeing people die or have medical problems related to the vaccine. Unvaccinated COVID-19 infection, on the other hand, has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and caused millions of cases of long COVID, strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure, heart failure, lung damage, blood clots… the list goes on and on. Why should I get my kids vaccinated when the Pfizer vaccine was found to be less effective for 5- to 11-year-olds? Just because it's less effective doesn't mean it's not effective. Your child may get a breakthrough infection, but it's still extremely protective in keeping them well and out of the hospital. Multiorgan inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can be devastating for a child even if they survive, and kids can get long COVID, leading to difficulties in school. Furthermore, the risk of developing diabetes is much higher in kids who were unvaccinated and had COVID-19. As a parent, I worry a lot about my child’s physical health, education and social development. I've done a lot of things to ensure my child’s success. COVID-19 vaccination is just another step I can take to help my child be as successful as possible.

As of Monday, the agency confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, subtype H5N1, at five locations in Mountain View County (MVC), representing a regional increase of two over the long weekend. The first three — two in MVC and another in Ponoka County — were identified on April 6. Another was found two days later on April 8 in Kneehill County. The following day, on April 9, an outbreak was discovered in Paintearth County. Three more were identified on April 10, 11 and 12, in Wetaskiwin County, Camrose County, and MVC, respectively. Then, on April 14, three more locations were added to the list — two in MVC and one in Warner County. The latest information available prior to press deadline that was posted on the agency’s website also reported that one more location in Cardston County was identified on April 15. The animals involved in the locations listed above were from commercial poultry flocks in all but one of the instances in MVC, which was attributed to a small flock. The agency says it has established Primary Control Zones (PCZ) in the areas where the disease has been identified. “The PCZs are in place to control the risk of further spread of the virus,” reads a portion of an emailed statement from CFIA. “Each infected premises is under quarantine and will be going through a similar process which involves: destruction and disposal; compensation; cleaning and disinfection; removal of quarantine.” Although the Albertan was unable to confirm approximately how many birds have been culled to date in the region, the agency said late last week that the infected premises in three of the zones in the region “have been depopulated and the disposal process is underway.” The transportation of poultry as well as poultry-related products within or through the zones requires permits issued through the agency. “Low risk movements can happen with a self-serve permit that producers and transporters can download from the CFIA website,” it says. “Higher risk movements such as live birds, carcasses, manure and hatching eggs require a specific permit.” Pertaining to commercial poultry operations, the agency said it is working with producer marketing boards to vet and triage permits to minimize the impact on producers in the affected zones without compromising the disease control measures. One of the zones in the region includes portions of the towns of Olds and Didsbury. “But the general public will not normally be affected,” the agency said in response to a question about what the measures might mean for movement in the area. “Groceries purchased at retail in either town can be brought to homes outside of the PCZ. Also, retail groceries purchased outside of the PCZ can be brought to residences inside the PCZ.” Meanwhile, across the country, the number of animals culled had as of earlier this week nearly reached three-quarters of a million. “Nationally, the affected premises to date have involved approximately 700,000 birds,” a spokesperson wrote by email on April 18 in response to questions, adding that a provincial level breakdown of the bird count was expected to be available on the agency's website later this week. How long quarantines on affected properties might be expected to last depends largely on the individual situation, but can be expected to be in place for more than a month at least. “Completion of all the steps leading to the removal of a quarantine is affected by a number of premises-specific factors,” the spokesperson said. “But the overall process typically takes about 45 days.” Additionally, related zone and associated movement controls are not immediately lifted when an infected premise is released from quarantine, they said. “The CFIA first completes post-outbreak surveillance to confirm that the avian influenza has been stamped out in the PCZ.” Despite the rapid spread that has swept through avian populations, the risk of transmission to humans remains low. “Human infections with the avian influenza virus is rare and symptoms in human cases are often limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease,” said the spokesperson. “There is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of cooked poultry or eggs could transmit the avian flu to humans. All the evidence to date indicates that thorough cooking will kill the virus.” Even so, the agency advises people to stay away from wild birds. “To help prevent the spread of avian flu in bird populations and human exposure, people should avoid contact with wild birds, refrain from feeding or touching wild birds, including access to ponds or bodies of water known to be used by wild birds.” RELATED: Avian influenza biosecurity a must, says Minister Horner RELATED: Avian influenza detected in Mountain View County RELATED: Food industry adjusting to large outbreak of avian flu in Canada, around the world See a typo/mistake?

She offers tips to keep poultry safe.Veterinarian offers tips to protect poultry CBC News · Posted: Apr 20, 2022 4:56 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 20, 2022Recent avian flu outbreaks in B.C. and Alberta chickens are putting Yukon flocks at risk, according to experts. The flu is spread by migratory birds. A government veterinarian offers tips to keep poultry safe. (Kathryn Marlow/CBC )Social SharingRecent avian flu outbreaks on poultry farms in B.C. and Alberta are causing concern in the Yukon."A lot of Yukoners get their chicks delivered from those two areas," said Sonny Gray, a farmer and consultant who is past president of the Yukon Agricultural Association.He said there are only three or four farmers that have more than 1,000 birds but there are many Yukoners who also have coops in their yards."Everybody needs to take precautions," he said.While no case of avian flu has been reported in the territory yet, the acting program veterinarian with the government of Yukon's animal health unit said it's possible the avian flu will spread there as spring migration takes place."Avian influenza is carried primarily and spread primarily by wild birds," said Kristenn Magnusson.PrecautionsLast week, the Tr'ondek Hwech'in Farm in Dawson City issued a notice to its customers that it was no longer going to allow them inside its chicken coops.The farm had just brought in a new flock of healthy chickens from B.C. and said it was taking the measure to keep the birds safe.It also asked its customers who raise poultry to wear clean footwear and clothing when they come to the farm.Those are two of several measures farms and people can take to keep their poultry safe, said Magnusson."[Keep] birds in secure enclosures, ideally with a roof where wild birds would not be able to enter the domestic poultry containment, and try to minimize any contact that could be shared between domestic and wild birds," said Magnusson.She added the avian flu can also be spread by a bird touching a contaminated surface, such as a food dish, equipment, clothing or boots."It's advised that folks, you know, wash their hands, change their boots and clothes before they enter into their chicken coop or their commercial poultry operation to minimize the chance that they're actually bringing in the virus," she said.The outbreaks in B.C. and Alberta have also had an impact on the availability of eggs for certain breeds of chicken, according to Megan Bradley, purchaser at the Feed Store in Whitehorse.She said the store, which typically sells about 3,000 to 5,000 chicks a year between early May and mid-June, is extending the selling season until the end of June.SymptomsMagnusson said avian flu symptoms present differently in wild and domestic birds.She said wild birds may have difficulty moving and flying, as well as breathing, sometimes coughing and sneezing. In domestic birds, it's a different story."We might be able to notice things like a drop in food consumption, a drop in egg production, diarrhea, excessive thirst and fairly high mortality in poultry, including fairly rapid onset of sudden death," she said.She said the Yukon has many avid bird watchers and advises them that if they see an injured or dead bird, they should leave the birds alone and call the government's tip line at 1-800-661-0525. She also said that because of the outbreak, the government is suggesting people not feed wild birds because that can increase the probability of transmitting the flu among wild birds and then to domestic ones.If people have a bird feeder in their backyard, she recommends cleaning it — but if they have domestic poultry in their backyard too, they should remove the feeder.Self-sufficientGray said the outbreaks highlight the fact that the Yukon needs to focus more on breeding and hatching its own birds rather than importing them from the south."I'll be hatching my own eggs here locally so it'll eliminate any potential chance of the disease being imported from down south," he said.Sonny Gray, a farmer and agricultural consultant, said the recent outbreaks in B.C. and Alberta highlight the fact that the Yukon needs to focus more on breeding and hatching its own birds rather than importing them from the south. (Wayne Vallevand/CBC)He added that every time the Yukon imports some agricultural products from the south, it runs the risk of introducing diseases that aren't in the territory.He said anybody can hatch their own eggs but it does get more complicated in bigger operations. "But if you had enough egg farmers here in the territory and they were to work together to create a facility for hatching, I think it's absolutely feasible in the next couple of years," he said.With files from Elyn Jones and Claudiane Samson CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Alberta conservation organizations concerned about how wild birds will cope with avian flu Backyard chicken owners have a role to play in preventing spread of avian flu, expert says Food industry adjusting to large outbreak of avian flu in Canada, around the world Avian flu poses 'significant risk' to Canadian poultry farms as cases reported in multiple provincesFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 14 & 15 are also shown. Actual increase in the number of ILI cases is seen in CNMI and RMI. The increase seen in Kiribati may be due to the increased number of sites reported for the week. A reduction of ILI cases were seen in Fiji and FSM for the week. The decrease seen in New Caledonia may be due to the decreased number of sites reported for the week. No changes were seen to the number of ILI cases in Solomon Islands for the week.

A commercial flock, in the rural municipality of Loreburn, south of Saskatoon, detected it on Saturday."You kind of suspected that it was going to happen," said Graham Snell, executive director of Chicken Farmers of Saskatchewan, which represents 72 broiler poultry farms in the province.Food industry adjusting to large outbreak of avian flu in Canada, around the worldBackyard chicken owners have a role to play in preventing spread of avian flu, expert saysHe said people are likely to beef up security to better protect their chickens, although that security is already strict.Saskatchewan imposed an animal health control order to limit the co-mingling of poultry and cut the risk of exposure.It prohibits birds from entering shows, auctions or other events where they would be brought to multiple locations and is in place until May 14. Saskatchewan said this strain of avian flu does not pose a food safety risk, but regular food safety precautions should be followed when preparing wild game.Poultry farmers try to prevent avian flu spread3 years agoDuration 1:47Canadian poultry farmers are trying to prevent the further spread of avian flu, which has already caused the loss of half a million birds this year, something that could further increase the price of chicken and turkey.Highly contagious avian fluThe flu now affecting birds in Saskatchewan is a severe strain of influenza that has mingled genes from Eurasia and North America, according to Dr. Trent Bollinger, a professor at Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) and a pathologist.Bollinger said that the severity of the disease, which he says is the H5N1 strain, depends on the species. The professor said smaller poultry farms are more vulnerable to the virus because of less strict security measures. However, larger farms can still contract the virus. In 2007, the last time avian flu appeared in commercial poultry or wild birds the province, all 50,000 birds at the Pedigree Poultry farm in Regina Beach were gassed with carbon dioxide when a strain of the influenza was discovered.The Canada Food Inspection Agency said Monday that avian flu had been detected at 41 premises across the country, with a combined 700,000 birds affected, since December 2021."All provinces are experiencing the same influx of birds to diagnostic labs and investigating die-offs similar to what we're seeing in Saskatchewan," Bollinger said."We don't yet know how many have been infected and have survived but this is an unusual level of mortality for avian influenza virus strains in North America. Typically, they are less virulent than this."A bird is autopsied at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon, presumed to have avian flu. The province detected its first case of avian flu in wild birds in more than a decade on April 8. (Submitted by Trent Bollinger)Bollinger said the WCVM lab that performs autopsies on the birds has examined more than 50 so far, with more coming soon. Influenza appears to be the most common culprit.He advised people to submit the carcasses of dead birds to the lab because, while birds may be dying from influenza, it could also be other issues like avian cholera.There's no evidence that humans are susceptible to the virus, but he said anyone submitting carcasses should minimize direct contact with the birds and wear gloves and a mask.Hundreds of dead birds foundOn April 8, the same day avian flu was detected in Saskatchewan, Paule Hjertaas stumbled across an area between Kronau and Richardson, southeast of Regina, layered with dead birds."At first we thought, 'perhaps they got poisoned,' and as we kept looking we found more in the fields and in various other places," she said. "I was a bit taken aback ... it looked terrible."The province said in a press release that avian flu strains don't typically show signs of disease in wild birds, but this strain has killed some, including snow geese, Canada geese and some raptor-type birds, like ravens or crows.She came back days later to get a better look with some others, she said. Her husband counted about 180 dead birds and more than a dozen that appeared to be dying.Bollinger thinks it's likely the birds died of the flu.Concerns about bird feedersIga Stasiak, the provincial wildlife health specialist, said bird feeders are also a concern."This is a virus that can be spread, and accelerated, by animals congregating around feeding sites," she said.Bird feeders are OK but keep wild birds from backyard chickens as avian flu spreads in Ontario: expertsWhile noting that bird feeders can be a concern, Stasiak also said there aren't many reports of songbirds being infected. It's primarily waterfowl catching the flu, she said, but "this is a very new strain of this virus and we're still learning quite a lot and we're not quite sure of the breadth or the extent of the species that might be impacted."She recommended cleaning the feeders, disinfecting them with a bleach and water solution (one part bleach, nine parts water) and cleaning the feeder to prevent transmission.CorrectionsA previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Hjertaas said there doesn't seem to be a risk to feeder birds. In fact, she said she hadn't personally seen it in feeder birds, but that doesn't mean there is no risk to them.

The avian flu is also deadly to chickens, forcing egg prices to skyrocket. Area poultry producers, however, are taking precautions to keep their flocks healthy. Russell Kleinschmidt is surrounded by roosting chickens Wednesday, April 20, 2022, at Kleinschmidt Farms in Staples.Contributed / Russell Kleinschmidt By Frank Lee April 24, 2022 at 7:00 AM Share Share this article BRAINERD — Area poultry producers of turkeys and chickens are ruffled by the fowl disease avian flu, which can be deadly.There are about 2.3 million birds impacted by avian flu in Minnesota as of Friday, April 22. Cases were first confirmed in the state in late March. ADVERTISEMENT “If that gets in and infects my whole flock and I lose all my flock, I'm out of business,” said Pat Ebnet, co-owner of Wild Acres Processing Inc. in Pequot Lakes. Outbreaks of bird flu in the United States and France have disrupted global supply chains and increased the purchase costs for the food staple for consumers.Closer to home, flocks in Stearns and Morrison counties were confirmed on March 31 to be infected, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.“We went through this in 2015 and we dodged that bullet,” said Derek Gold of Gold Turkey Farms in Motley. Talking turkey Gold is the fourth generation in his family to be involved with the poultry industry.“We've been in business since the early ‘60s and we do egg production. We produce fertile turkey eggs for hatching purposes,” Gold said of Gold Turkey Farms.The majority of infection sites in the state have been in commercial meat turkey operations. Two commercial chicken operations in Morrison County — a broiler flock and an egg layer flock — and four backyard producers, however, were recently confirmed by the state to be infected. ADVERTISEMENT The closer the avian flu gets, the more precautions area producers are taking. Derek Gold of Gold Turkey Farms stands next to a sign for the Motley-based company on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, warning people that it is a restricted area to prevent the spread of avian flu.Contributed / Derek Gold “Literally nobody other than employees is allowed on the farm at this point — lots of extra disinfecting vehicles, people — stuff like that,” Gold said of precautions Gold Turkey Farms is taking. “Other than that, just a lot of prayer.”The extremely contagious pathogen is fatal to domestic poultry, according to Abby Schuft, an Extension educator with the University of Minnesota.“Our (poultry) products are still safe to eat and consume, and none of these affected birds are entering our food chain,” Schuft told Forum News Service.Schuft is involved in the development of biosecurity outreach tools like the web-based Poultry Disease Planning Tool. She is based in Willmar but works with poultry farmers across the state.“Like any other food product, they're highly tested before they even enter the food system, so the poultry products that you like to enjoy and consume on a regular basis are still going to be safe to eat,” Schuft stated. Poultry destruction The new avian influenza strain that has forced the destruction of tens of millions of domestic poultry nationwide is also spreading rapidly among wild bird populations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas. ADVERTISEMENT Gold said Gold Turkey Farms sells eggs to Select Genetics in Willmar, which hatches them and supplies them worldwide.“They've had to murder three flocks along with the replacements for that, so they're talking five, six, maybe seven months until they can even get birds in those barns again, which means probably 10 months of missed income plus all the loss on top of it,” Gold said. Stock image from Flickr user flythebirdpath The virus has not caused human illness, however, and according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recent bird flu Infections in U.S. wild birds and poultry pose a low risk to the public.Minnesota is the No. 1 producer of turkeys in the nation and is home to 600 turkey farms, according to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association website. The industry, according to the association, provides the state with over $1 billion in economic activity and more than 26,000 jobs.“I'm a small business and less government is always better,” Gold said of state involvement in the bird flu situation. “I would love it if they kept out of it completely, to be honest.”Wild Acres Processing Inc. began in 1978 and has been specializing in outdoor-raised domestic poultry and wild game birds ever since, according to the company’s website. It is now operated by second-generation owner Pat Ebnet and his wife Kelli.Ebnet said the family-owned business is taking the same precautions it did in 2015 when the United States had its worst-ever outbreak of bird flu. ADVERTISEMENT “Nobody comes onto our farm except for employees or suppliers that need to be,” he said. “We are decontaminating everything about a quarter-mile from our farm. We've moved our employee parking lot back to that quarter-mile … so everything’s decontaminated before it comes in.”Spring weather can make these procedures difficult because of mud, rain, wind and other shifting weather conditions, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.“We've never had any case of avian influenza,” Ebnet said. “We keep our farm very secluded. We also are on the end of a dead-end street, so we don't have a lot of traffic driving right by and where we raise our birds is a half-mile from the road.” Fowl problem According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the highly pathogenic avian influenza has caused the death of snow geese by the dozens in North and South Dakota, Iowa and Missouri, and of snowy owls, hawks, swans, crows, vultures, cormorants, pelicans and other waterfowl.“Our biggest concern that we have is the migratory wildlife that is coming through — the Canada geese, the mallards, all of that stuff, the ducks that are migrating — because they're the ones that are carrying it and transporting it and spreading this disease, this virus,” Ebnet said. Young chickens feed Wednesday, April 20, at Wild Acres Processing Inc. in Pequot Lakes.Contributed / Joel Ebnet One of the most common ways highly pathogenic avian influenza moves around is through the movement of dead birds and garbage off the farm, according to the state Board of Animal Health.“We have a Department of Agriculture inspector on hand every time we process,” Ebnet said. “A lot of these smaller hobby farms or individuals that just want to raise some birds in the back … they don't know exactly how to take care of them correctly.” ADVERTISEMENT Russell Kleinschmidt owns Kleinschmidt Farms in Staples. He provides chickens and turkey broilers, and eggs.“We’re a small, local, family farm that tries to manage based on holistic, regenerative and sustainable types of methods,” Kleinschmidt said. “We're not certified organic or anything … but we’re using natural, organic-type methods.”Eggs from Kleinschmidt Farms are pastured, cage-free, free-range non-genetically modified organisms, according to the farm’s Facebook page.

I also looked at a couple local grocery stores and they were also low, had a limit on eggs or for large corporate conventional farms large eggs I saw a price for $4.19 a dozen!” according to a March 29 post from Kleinschmidt Farms.Wholesale prices for large eggs in the Midwest topped $3 per dozen in March and reached the second-highest level ever, up nearly 200% from a year earlier on the spot market, according to data firm Urner Barry.Consumers who depend on eggs as a low-cost source of protein and substitute for more expensive meat are definitely feeling the pinch of increased prices for eggs. ADVERTISEMENT According to Reuters calculations of federal and state government data, avian flu has decimated more than 19 million egg-laying chickens on commercial U.S. farms this year in the worst outbreak since 2015, eliminating about 6% of the country's flock.“We're maybe at less risk just because we try to keep our birds as healthy as possible … try to keep them outside on pasture, things like that,” Kleinschmidt said. “Where the risk comes in is, because they're outside, they could be in contact with wild birds or more easily get a disease. … “If they would get the disease, it may not spread as fast because they're not contained there in a small area or a building so that might help us there.” Chickens, eggs Influenza is not uncommon and it has been around for centuries, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, and influenza in poultry “is not a food safety issue.”The first indication of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry is sudden death, often without signs of illness, according to the state Board of Animal Health. Signs above the refridgerated section for eggs at Cub Foods in Brainerd on Saturday, April 16, 2022, inform shoppers of increased egg prices.Frank Lee / Brainerd Dispatch The impact could be devastating on larger operations, Kleinschmidt said.“If we would get it, you know, I've got a small flock that would impact the food system less so versus a big barn or something like that … that can be tens of thousands of birds that would have to be put down,” Kleinschmidt said.U.S. table egg production totaled 96.9 billion in 2020, down 2% from 2019, according to United Egg Producers, a cooperative of American farmers, and the U.S. had 325 million commercial laying hens at the end of 2020, down 5% from 2019.“I’ve been watching my birds. They are maintaining egg production,” Kleinschmidt said. “They're healthy, they're moving around. They're just as active and boisterous as they always are, so they're healthy right now and I hope to keep it that way.”FRANK LEE may be reached at 218-855-5863 or at frank.lee@brainerddispatch.com .

Home About Clinical Authors Most read this year GP Opinion Videos & Podcasts Professional Comments policy RACGP poll Menu Search for: Advertising newsGP > Clinical Dr Anna Samecki 21 Apr 2022 News Is it time for the post-vaccine wait to go? Anna Samecki 21/04/2022 4:21:50 PM The 15-minute observation window has already been scrapped in the UK, and now one GP is asking whether it is time for Australia to do the same. ATAGI still recommends patients wait around for 15 minutes post-COVID vaccination. For GP Dr Gerard Ingham, the standard practice of monitoring patients for 15-minutes post-vaccination may no longer be in their best interest. Despite acknowledging the small – but real – risk of adverse reactions like anaphylaxis, he believes the current pandemic environment poses a much greater danger, particularly for patients who are vulnerable to COVID. By following the normal procedure, Dr Ingham has already had patients inadvertently exposed to COVID-positive people in his waiting room post-immunisation. And with vaccination – and potentially community transmission – set to ramp up as we head into autumn and winter, he is questioning whether a change should be made in a new pre-print article co-authored with Monash University’s Associate Professor Rebecca Kippen. ‘During a pandemic, the risk of catching COVID in the waiting room and dying from it may often be higher than the risk of dying from anaphylaxis if leaving immediately [after vaccination],’ Dr Ingham told newsGP. ‘Both risks are tiny, but we found the risk of staying can be several hundred times higher for some people.’ In their paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, Dr Ingham and Associate Professor Kippen modelled the risk of contracting and dying from COVID for an average over-70s patient attending a typical general practice for their annual influenza vaccine this autumn. The modelling found the risk of anaphylaxis post-influenza vaccination is less than the risk of death from COVID acquired via aerosol transmission during the standard 15-minute wait, with the risk being greatest for the unimmunised and when masks were not worn. They also found it only became safer for those aged 70 or older to remain in the waiting room once the level of active COVID in the community was as low as one in 4000 people, which according to Associate Professor Kippen, ‘isn’t expected to happen any time soon’. But despite the results, Dr Ingham says he has experienced significant ‘pushback’ from journals for questioning standard practice. ‘I have never before experienced the difficulties I have confronted with my latest work,’ he said. ‘The paper has been rejected by a couple of journals already. ‘But there is no evidence for current practice [in the pandemic context] – only expert opinion.’ Current advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) is for the same 15-minute observation period to be applied to COVID-19 vaccinations as for other vaccines. Meanwhile in the UK, expert opinion is what led to the 15-minute wait being temporarily scrapped. ‘In the UK, they have abandoned the 15-minute wait post-COVID booster so immunisation clinics can be more efficient,’ Dr Ingham said. ‘Their chief medical officers concluded that if there are fewer people in the waiting room, then greater throughput can be achieved thus achieving a greater good.’ Back on home soil, Australian GPs have been, and continue to be, an integral part of the national COVID-19 vaccination rollout with more than 35 million doses being administered in primary care settings to date. But many clinics have also had to make physical and logistical changes to adhere to ATAGI’s advice of a 15-minute observation period post vaccination. As we head into an uncertain winter, Dr Ingham hopes his pre-print will spark debate around best practice while he awaits formal publication. ‘The pandemic has normalised the practice of releasing pre-prints of papers about COVID-19,’ he said. ‘If I await the normal academic process, the findings of our research looking into immunising during this autumn will be out of date by the time of publication.’ He also believes that advice given after vaccination should be individualised for each patient. ‘If the level of COVID is high in the community and the patient doesn’t have a history of severe allergic reactions, our findings suggest they are often safer to go,’ he said. ‘I also suspect many GPs and pharmacists are not following ATAGI advice currently.’ ATAGI was contacted for comment but did not respond prior to publication.

As regards actual practice, my wife and I actually had our 2nd boosters in a pharmacy (our general practice vaccination staff had gone down with COVID) and there was no suggestion of any post-vaccination observation (nor any suitable waiting area). We just walked straight out. I suspect that would be the case in many pharmacy settings. Dr Nicholas Francis Carr 22/04/2022 3:07:19 PM Agreed, I admire sensible suggestions that buck the status quo. To mitigate the Covid risk, we hold our vaccine clinics in the car park, where people can wait physically distanced and in the open air. We have yet to quantify the risks from heat stroke (summer) and hypothermia (yesterday), but I fancy these might still outweigh the anaphylaxis risk.

Robert Thomas, MJ Independent Apr 20, 2022 12:00 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message A burrowing owl outdoors in 2021MJ Independent With the Province confirming highly contagious and deadly avian influenza (H5N1) detected at two chicken farms the caretakers of the 10 endangered burrowing owls and one short eared owl at the Saskatchewan Burrowing Owl Centre are taking extra precautions to protect the flock. Like all birds - including pet birds - the burrowing owls are at risk of contracting the virus if they are exposed to it. But fortunately this year a so far cool spring has kept the owls indoors isolating them from birds which may carry the virus. “We have to be very concerned. As long as the owls maintain in the centre where they don’t have any interaction with wild birds we’re OK and we haven’t put any birds outside yet,” George Fowler general manager with the Moose Jaw Exhibition told MJ Independent. H5N1 affects wild, farm as well as pet bird populations and it is listed as a high pathogenicity virus in birds which in rare cases may transmit to humans. Transference from birds to humans usually occurs where there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments. “They are all still in their winter enclosure so we feel good and be advised by the vet clinic at the U of S (University of Saskatchewan) to not take the birds out to do any tours at this point due to the risk of possibly coming into contact with the avian flu,” Fowler said. On April 14th Saskatchewan’s chief veterinary officer issued an order to limit the co-mingling of poultry to reduce the risk of spreading the deadly virus. The order, in place until May 14, 2022, prohibits the movement to and participation of birds in shows, auctions and agricultural fairs, as well as any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations, a release from the Province stated. Avian Flu prevention poster. Canada Food Inspection Agency This year’s cooler April has the birds still indoors but depending on the weather owls have been put outside by April. The decision to transfer the owls from their indoor winter home to their outdoor summer enclosures varies from year to year. “We knew a few weeks ago there were problems so we weren’t in a hurry to get outside and it was just yesterday they (U of S veterinary clinic) suggested we shouldn’t even take them out to go on a tour anywhere.” The veterinary clinic’s suggesting tours be suspended as long as the threat of avian flu is present has so far forced the cancellation of four owl tours to other locations over the next two weeks. Fowler said the centre has stepped up its bio-security at the Burrowing Owl Centre. “Shoe cleanliness is crucial. Hand cleanliness is crucial. Clothing cleanliness is crucial. Transmission using feet (is crucial). If you are not coming in direct contact with the actual (infected) bird what you carry around on your feet is very transmissible,” he said. The threat to the burrowing owls is taken seriously. “What we are doing is making sure we don’t take (outside) footwear inside. So we are making sure we change footwear at the door. And then wash up.” Agriculture Canada is making many recommendations to help prevent the spread of avian flu which includes bio-security measures that includes cleanliness plus limiting access to wild birds, other animals and visitors to protect flocks and pet birds. At the present time the Burrowing Owl Centre is closed to outside visitors as part of their regular annual shutdown from September to the May long weekend. Restricting visitors is one of the recommendations to keep flocks and pet birds safe from contracting the deadly virus. Asked what would happen if the avian flu was contracted by one of the owls Fowler said the impact would likely be catastrophic for the Centre. “The risk is that a bird could die from it and they could spread it to the rest of the flock…they might be forced to (euthanize the entire flock to prevent further spread),” Fowler said. Asked if there was any treatment available that might be given to the burrowing owls - despite the cost - because they are an endangered species Fowler indicated it was unlikely. “I am not aware of any treatment for it other than make sure they do not get it.” Although avian flu has been present in the past the last last major breakout in Saskatchewan was 2007 where 50,000 birds in one flock was euthanized with carbon dioxide gas. The present outbreak has so far been detected in 41 premises and impacting 700,000 birds countrywide since December 2021. Fowler said the threat of avian flu could see the owls indoors and away from visitors for some time depending on how long the outbreak lasts. “Until we sort of get word from the U of S (veterinary clinic) that is probably safe to put them outside or take them on tour they’ll have to remain indoors.” Asked if the Centre would be negatively financially impacted by the owls having to remain inside until the threat has passed Fowler said it should see no impact. “Care and welfare is probably the same as if they were outside and inside.” At the present time the Burrowing Owl Centre is planning to host a major event to kickoff the opening to visitors but the event could potentially be cancelled if the threat of bird flu continues. An additional concern is mating and egg laying would have to be indoors if the owls cannot be placed outside. www.mjindependent.com This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Get your daily Moose Jaw news briefing Email Sign Up More Local News WINMAR Warriors close in on Circle K Classic berth after weekend sweep of Warman Nov 10, 2024 5:18 PM Moose Jaw senior girls volleyball league teams win regionals, advance to provincials Nov 10, 2024 3:52 PM MJVotes24: Jeff Goodnough is running for Moose Jaw city council Nov 10, 2024 3:00 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show This story was important to me or our community: view results > Not Very Slightly Fairly Very Extremely See a typo/mistake?

Manager Colin Weir said they are being cautious because he believes the deaths could be from avian influenza.“It’s a respiratory ailment,” he said. “It’s spread that way and it can also apparently be spread on the bird droppings as well.”Avian flu cases have already been confirmed in Alberta and Weir suspects two birds in particular may be bringing the illness to the Coaldale area.READ MORE: Risk to human health ‘extremely low’ after avian flu detected: Alberta agriculture minister Get weekly health news Receive the latest medical news and health information delivered to you every Sunday.

But a lot of that will depend on the risk level.Weir said they are taking measures to ensure avian flu does not enter the facility.

Source: Getty Images/Westend61Experts say Australia could see a rapid return of the flu cases and a jump in hospitalisations during winter as states further relax travel restrictions and health safety measures.The Australian government says the flu can affect anyone, but it is especially serious for babies and older people. Diagnosis The Australian government and experts believe testing is the best way of diagnosing the disease given the identical signs and symptoms of COVID-19, flu and the common cold.Residents are urged to take an RT-PCR test or rapid antigen test if they have a runny nose, cough or sore throat, fever, headache, body aches, vomiting and diarrhoea.Close contacts of COVID-19 cases and residents otherwise advised by health professionals should also do a RAT or RT-PCR test. COVID-19 positive cases are currently required to isolate for seven days.Other symptoms of COVID-19 include: Shortness of breath and congestion Fatigue Muscle painTemporary loss of smell or altered sense of tasteNausea or loss of appetite What if you still have symptoms and your RAT/PCR test is negative?A spokesperson at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance said it is likely that person has another respiratory illness like the flu or common cold. "You should still stay home and rest until your symptoms resolve to avoid spreading this to others. Mild flu and the common cold generally get better on their own without any treatment," the spokesperson told SBS in a written response. "You can relieve the symptoms by resting, drinking fluids (particularly water), taking paracetamol to reduce pain and fever and using decongestant medicines," the spokesperson added.The Australian government said residents should contact their general practitioners (GPs), who can diagnose the flu by checking symptoms or swabbing the patient nose. A blood test can also detect the flu.Flu symptoms and severity A person infected with the flu can experience chills other than the common signs and symptoms listed above.
