Winter season in the Western Pacific Region could see both influenza and COVID-19 circulating, potentially leading to higher cases of seasonal influenza due to decreased immunity and increased mixing and travel. The flu and COVID-19 have similar symptoms and are spread through respiratory droplets. Quick testing and treatment may be necessary for those in high-risk groups. It's important to differentiate between the flu, COVID-19, the common cold, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to ensure appropriate treatment. Both the flu and COVID-19 can be fatal, with seasonal influenza causing up to 650,000 deaths globally per year before the pandemic.
