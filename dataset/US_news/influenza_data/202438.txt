If you are pregnant and experience flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people who are pregnant and who have flu infection or suspected flu infection. Flu and Pregnancy Flu also may be harmful for a pregnant person's developing baby. (A common flu symptom is fever, which has been associated in some studies with neural tube defects and other adverse outcomes for a developing baby.) Getting the flu shot during pregnancy can protect the pregnant person from flu and flu related hospitalizations. Flu vaccination during pregnancy also can protect babies for several months after birth against flu and flu-related hospitalizations because the pregnant parent passes antibodies on to the developing baby during pregnancy. People who get a flu shot while pregnant or breastfeeding also develop antibodies against flu that they can share with their infants through their breast milk. Pre-Existing Conditions There is no recommendation that pregnant people or people with pre-existing medical conditions need to get special permission or written consent from their doctor or health care professional for flu vaccination if they get vaccinated at a worksite clinic, pharmacy or other location outside of their physician's office. Pregnant people should not get nasal spray flu vaccine. Keep Reading: Misconceptions About Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines Best timing for vaccination For most adults, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated each year. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months, because this can help protect their infants from flu for several months after birth (when they are too young to be vaccinated). Vaccination is the best protection against flu Getting a flu vaccine is the first and most important action a person can take to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications. Pregnant people should get a flu shot and not the nasal spray flu vaccine. A 2013 study showed that during the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 flu seasons vaccination reduced the risk of flu in pregnant people by up to one-half. These results are consistent with the general range of estimated flu vaccine effectiveness among adults 18-64 years. A 2018 study showed that getting a flu vaccine reduced a pregnant person's risk of being hospitalized with flu by an average of 40%. Pregnant people who get a flu shot also are helping to protect their babies from flu illness and flu related hospitalizations for the first several months after their birth, when they are too young to get vaccinated. Flu Vaccine Safety and Pregnancy Flu shots have been given to millions of pregnant people over more than 50 years with an excellent safety record. There is substantial evidence that flu shots are safe during pregnancy for mom and baby. CDC and ACIP recommend that pregnant people get vaccinated during any trimester of their pregnancy. Other Preventive Actions In addition to getting a flu shot, pregnant people should take preventive actions including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease in people (known as flu season) almost every winter in the United States. Influenza virus basics Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause flu pandemics (i.e., global epidemics of flu disease). A pandemic can occur when a new and different influenza A virus emerges that infects people, has the ability to spread efficiently among people, and against which people have little or no immunity. Influenza C virus infections generally cause mild illness and are not thought to cause human epidemics. Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle with spillover to other animals but are not known to infect people to cause illness. View Larger This is a picture of an influenza (flu) A virus. Influenza A viruses are classified by subtypes based on the properties of their hemagglutinin (H or HA) and neuraminidase (N or NA) surface proteins. There are 18 different HA subtypes and 11 different NA subtypes. Subtypes are named by combining the H and N numbers – e.g., A(H1N1), A(H3N2). Click on the image to enlarge the picture.Show More Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (H1 through H18 and N1 through N11, respectively). While more than 130 influenza A subtype combinations have been identified in nature, primarily from wild birds, there are potentially many more influenza A subtype combinations given the propensity for virus “reassortment.” Reassortment is a process by which influenza viruses swap gene segments. Reassortment can occur when two influenza viruses infect a host at the same time and swap genetic information. Current subtypes of influenza A viruses that routinely circulate in people include A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). Influenza A virus subtypes and Influenza B virus lineages can be further broken down into different HA genetic “clades” and “sub-clades.” See the “Influenza Viruses” graphic below for a visual depiction of these classifications. View Larger Influenza Viruses Types Cause Flu Season Influenza A (Influenza virus types responsible for most human illness and the flu season) Influenza B Influenza C (Not significant for public health) Influenza D (Mainly infect cows) Subtypes A(H1N1) A(H3N2) Lineages B(Victoria) B(Yamagata) Clades (Groups) [Select Examples] 6B.1 3C.2a, 3C3a V1A Y1, Y2, Y3 Sub-Clades (Sub-Groups) [Select Examples] 6B.1 3C.2a1; 3C.2a2: 3c.2a3: 3C.2a4 V1A.1; V1A.2; V1A.3 NoneShow More Clades and sub-clades Clades and sub-clades can be alternatively called "groups" and "sub-groups," respectively. An influenza clade or group is a further subdivision of influenza viruses (beyond subtypes or lineages) based on the similarity of their HA gene sequences. Other gene segments can also be broken into clades and sub-clades. (See the Genome Sequencing and Genetic Characterization page for more information). Clades and subclades are shown on phylogenetic trees as groups of viruses that usually have similar genetic changes (i.e., nucleotide or amino acid changes) and have a single common ancestor represented as a node in the tree (see Figure 1). Dividing viruses into clades and subclades helps flu experts track the proportion of viruses from different clades in circulation. Figure 1 – This is a picture of a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees show how closely related individual viruses are to one another. Phylogenetic trees of influenza viruses will usually display how similar the viruses’ hemagglutinin (H or HA) or neuraminidase (N or NA) genes are to one another. Each sequence from a specific influenza virus has its own branch on the tree. The degree of genetic difference between viruses is represented by the length of the horizontal lines (branches) in the phylogenetic tree. The further apart viruses are on the horizontal axis of a phylogenetic tree, the more genetically different the viruses are to one another. Influenza viruses whose HA genes share the same genetic changes and who also share a common ancestor (node) are grouped into specific clades and sub clades.Show More Note that clades and sub-clades that are genetically different from others are not necessarily antigenically different. This is best understood by first introducing the concepts of "antigens" and "antigenic properties". As previously described, influenza viruses have hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. These proteins act as antigens. Antigens are molecular structures/proteins on the surface of viruses that are recognized by the immune system and can trigger an immune response (such as antibody production). The antigenic properties are a reflection of the antibody or immune response triggered by the antigens on a particular virus. When two influenza viruses are antigenically different, this means that a host's immune response (antibodies) elicited by infection or vaccination with one of the viruses will not as easily recognize and neutralize the other virus. Therefore, for antigenically different viruses, immunity developed against one of the viruses will not necessarily protect against the other virus as well. Conversely, when two influenza viruses are antigenically similar, a host's immune response (antibodies) elicited by infection or vaccination with one of the viruses will recognize and neutralize the other virus, thereby protecting against the other virus. Influenza A(H1N1) viruses Currently circulating influenza A(H1N1) viruses are related to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus that emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused a flu pandemic (CDC 2009 H1N1 Flu website). These viruses, scientifically called the "A(H1N1)pdm09 virus," and more generally called "2009 H1N1," have continued to circulate seasonally since then and have undergone genetic changes and changes to their antigenic properties (i.e., the properties of the virus that affect immunity). Influenza A(H3N2) viruses also change both genetically and antigenically. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have formed many separate, genetically different clades in recent years that continue to co-circulate. Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but instead are further classified into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria. Similar to influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses can then be further classified into specific clades and sub-clades. Influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in terms of their genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A viruses, especially influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza surveillance data from recent years shows co-circulation of influenza B viruses from both lineages in the United States and around the world. However, the proportion of influenza B viruses from each lineage that circulate can vary by geographic location and by season. B/Yamagata viruses have not been detected after March 2020. Naming influenza viruses CDC follows an internationally accepted naming convention for influenza viruses. This convention was accepted by WHO in 1979 and published in February 1980 in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 58(4):585-591 (1980) (see A revision of the system of nomenclature for influenza viruses: a WHO Memorandum). The approach uses the following components: The antigenic type (i.e., A, B, C, D) The host of origin (e.g., swine, equine, chicken, etc.). For human-origin viruses, no host of origin designation is given. Note the following examples: (Duck example): avian influenza A(H1N1), A/duck/Alberta/35/76 (Human example): seasonal influenza A(H3N2), A/Perth/16/2019 Geographical origin (e.g., Denver, Taiwan, etc.) Strain number (e.g., 7, 15, etc.) Year of collection (e.g., 57, 2009, etc.) For influenza A viruses, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigen description are provided in parentheses (e.g., influenza A(H1N1) virus, influenza A(H5N1) virus) The 2009 pandemic virus was assigned a distinct name: A(H1N1)pdm09 to distinguish it from the seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses that circulated prior to the pandemic. When humans are infected with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine (pigs), these viruses are call variant viruses and are designated with the letter "v" (e.g., an A(H3N2)v virus). Figure 2 – This image shows how influenza viruses are named. The name starts with the virus type, followed by the place the virus was isolated, followed by the virus strain number (often a sample identifier), the year isolated, and finally, the virus subtype.Show More Influenza vaccine viruses Seasonal flu vaccines are formulated to protect against influenza viruses known to cause epidemics, including: one influenza A(H1N1) virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, and one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus. Getting a flu vaccine can protect against these viruses as well as additional influenza viruses that are antigenically similar to the viruses used to make the vaccine. Information about this season's vaccine can be found at Preventing Seasonal Flu with Vaccination. Seasonal flu vaccines do not protect against influenza C or D viruses or against zoonotic (animal-origin) influenza viruses that can cause human infections, such as variant or avian (bird) influenza viruses. In addition, flu vaccines will NOT protect against infection and illness caused by other viruses that also can cause influenza-like symptoms. There are many other viruses besides influenza that can result in influenza-like illness (ILI) that spread during flu season.

Given the constant changes in the viral glycoproteins owing to antigenic drift, seasonal influenza vaccines need to be updated periodically and effectiveness often drops due to mismatches between vaccine and circulating strains. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccines are not protective against antigenically shifted influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Here, we have developed a highly immunogenic vaccination regimen based on live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) comprised of an attenuated virus backbone lacking non-structural protein 1 (ΔNS1), the primary host interferon antagonist of influenza viruses, with chimeric hemagglutinins (cHA) composed of exotic avian head domains with a highly conserved stalk domain, to redirect the humoral response towards the HA stalk. In this study, we showed that cHA-LAIV vaccines induce robust serum and mucosal responses against group 1 stalk and confer antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity activity. Mice that intranasally received cH8/1-ΔNS1 followed by a cH11/1-ΔNS1 heterologous booster had robust humoral responses for influenza A virus group 1 HAs and were protected from seasonal H1N1 influenza virus and heterologous highly pathogenic avian H5N1 lethal challenges. When compared with mice immunized with the standard of care or cold-adapted cHA-LAIV, cHA-ΔNS1 immunized mice had robust antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses which also correlated with markedly reduced lung pathology post-challenge. These observations support the development of a trivalent universal influenza vaccine for the protection against group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses.

Given that vaccines are the best form of control measure against influenza virus infections, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the use of seasonal influenza vaccines for individuals aged 6 months and older2. Although seasonal influenza vaccines can mitigate the disease burden, variable effectiveness is observed annually, especially when vaccine strains mismatch circulating strains. In addition, despite the availability of seasonal vaccines, influenza A (IAV) and influenza B (IBV) viruses continue to circulate in humans on a global scale3. The latter issue is due to the constant antigen drift of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) which is the primary target for seasonal vaccines4. Furthermore, occasional antigenic shift due to zoonotic outbreaks of IAV strains containing “novel” HA genes derived from non-human IAV can result in human influenza pandemics4,5,6,7. In the past, influenza pandemics were observed in 1918 (‘Spanish Flu’; >50 million deaths), 1957 (‘Asian Flu’; 1–2 million deaths), 1968 (H3N2; >700,000 deaths) and the most recent pandemic which took place in 2009 (‘swine flu’; >300,000 deaths)8.Currently, licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines are formulated as inactivated influenza virus vaccines (IIV), live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV) based on cold-adapted influenza viruses with limited replication in the lower respiratory tract, or HA-based vaccines based on recombinant protein technology9. IIVs and recombinant HA-protein-based vaccines have been shown to induce a suboptimal immune response in adults against antigenically mismatched viruses (especially in the absence of adjuvants), and these categories of vaccines are known not to induce a mucosal immune response which might better protect from respiratory infection by influenza viruses10. Conversely, LAIVs which are recommended for the use of individuals aged between 2 - 49 years, can induce robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses given that they mimic a natural infection by intranasal administration11. Studies have indicated that some of the key protective immunological factors are IgA responses in the upper respiratory tract, IgG-dominant serum responses that readily transude, and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T-cells that confer heterosubtypic protection in subsequent exposures. In addition, the longevity and potency of the immune responses induced by LAIVs are greatly dependent on the activation of T-follicular helper cells (Tfh)12,13. However, these have not been identified as correlates of protection by regulatory agencies11,14,15,16,17. Moreover, the vaccine loses efficacy in older adults due to decreased vaccine virus replication and low immune responses in this segment of the human population, which includes a major risk group for influenza virus-mediated severe disease.The diverse antigenic HA groups (19) and NA groups (11) circulating in animal reservoirs along with the time frame (~6 months) to develop all the required doses of an influenza vaccine once a pandemic outbreak is detected highlight the need for a vaccine that would protect against all influenza viruses regardless of the antigenic make-up, while inducing long-lasting immunity18,19,20. These features will also eliminate the need for annual reformulations of influenza vaccines. Accordingly, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) initiated a directive to develop a “universal influenza vaccine” (UIV) that would protect against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza viruses while also curbing symptomatic seasonal influenza infections21. Scientists around the world have focused on conserved epitopes such as the HA stalk, viral nucleoprotein (NP), matrix 1 (M1), and the ectodomain of the M2 ion channel (M2e) as target antigens for the basis of UIVs22,23,24. HA stalk-directed antibodies have been demonstrated to possess neutralizing capacity at specific stages of the virus life cycle, such as inhibition of fusion, uncoating, and viral budding. In addition, these broadly cross-reactive antibodies are known to induce Fc-Fcγ receptor-mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-mediated lysis, which also contribute to in vivo protection from influenza disease24.In this study, we have developed a prime-boost vaccination regimen using an in vivo replication incompetent IAV (ΔNS1) containing chimeric HAs (cHA) for the induction of HA stalk antibodies able to confer robust protection against group 1 IAV. Prime-boost approaches using cHA immunogens previously have been shown to induce protective levels of HA stalk antibodies against influenza A and B viruses in several animal models, as well as in human clinical trials25,26,27,28,29. In a ferret model, we have previously shown that a prime-boost regimen using cold-adapted temperature-sensitive cHA-LAIVs induced broadly cross-reactive humoral responses that protected the animals from an IAV with pandemic potential30. In a follow-up study, the durability of the generated immune response in a ferret model was assessed indicating that sequential immunization of cHA-LAIV-cHA-LAIV and cHA-LAIV-cHA-IIV induced long-lived HA-stalk specific and broadly reactive humoral, and cross-reactive T-cell mediated responses. When compared to other immunization schemes, the cHA-LAIV-cHA-LAIV vaccination provided superior protection against an infection by a 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) IAV31. Nevertheless, in a human clinical trial, the cold-adapted LAIV was poorly immunogenic. This prompted us to evaluate a different live attenuation approach known to be safe and immunogenic32,33. Specifically, we used a modified virus backbone that is devoid of the main viral interferon antagonist, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1)34. NS1 has been shown to inhibit the host interferon (IFN) response by sequestering viral factors such as dsRNA which trigger pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS)35. Conversely, NS1 is known to directly interact with host factors involved in innate immunity such protein kinase R (PKR), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), resulting in inhibition of the host-induced antiviral innate response36,37,38. In a previous report, we showed that influenza viruses lacking NS1 (ΔNS1) are highly immunogenic in vivo, while conferring a broad interferon-mediated antiviral state that results in both short-lived but immediate innate protection, followed by long-lasting adaptive immune protection39,40. In fact, ΔNS1 IAV are inherently more immunogenic than wild-type IAV. Several clinical trials have shown that ΔNS1-LAIVs are immunogenic and well tolerated in humans, leading to robust humoral and cellular immune responses.In the present study, we have generated ΔNS1 viruses expressing cHAs corresponding to the head of H8 and the stalk of H1 (cH8/1) and to the head of H11 and the stalk of H1 (cH11/1). We then show that mice that were immunized with a cH8/1-N1-ΔNS1 prime followed by cH11/1-N1-ΔNS1 boost had robust levels of humoral immunity across a multitude of group 1 IAV HAs, including stalk-specific responses. Consequently, effector functions conferred by the stalk antibodies induced by this immunization regimen were superior compared to other immunization regimens assessed in the present study. Furthermore, mucosal IgA HA stalk responses for this group were superior to their cold-adapted temperature-sensitive cHA-LAIV counterparts. The cHA-ΔNS1 vaccine regimen also induced high levels of tissue-resident antigen-specific memory CD8+ T-cells and splenic antigen-specific IFN-γ+-CD8+ responses. Challenges with heterologous highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus further demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccine-induced immunity indicating the suitability of this vaccine platform for a universal influenza vaccine candidate. Additionally, given the in vivo replication-deficient nature of ΔNS1 based backbones, a strategy as such could further increase the safety and immunogenicity of an LAIV universal vaccine.ResultsComparative In vitro characterization of cHA-LAIV vaccine strainsThe cHA-ΔNS1-LAIVs viruses were rescued using reverse genetics and were passaged ten times at 33 °C for 72 h. The resulting viruses were plaque purified and were assessed for growth with plaque purified cell culture grown cHA-caLEN viruses. Figure 1a indicates that cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV strains replicate in a multi-cycle growth curve in an IFN-incompetent Vero cell line during 72 h at 33 °C. The cHA-caLEN viruses showed growth competence but had relatively slower kinetics than their counterparts. One way ANOVA tests indicated that the cH8/1-ΔNS1-LAIV grew to a significantly higher level in comparison to the other viruses at both 24 h and 48 h timepoints. By 72 h, cH8/1-ΔNS1-LAIV grew significantly more than the cH11/1-ΔNS1-LAIV, while the other assessed viruses caught up with the titers of cH8/1-ΔNS1-LAIV. Thus, the data indicated that cH11/1-ΔNS1-LAIV demonstrated slower replication kinetics. Given that ΔNS1-LAIV viruses were passaged over ten times to ensure genetic stability, we were interested in assessing any antigenic changes in the HA stalk. Amino-acid changes observed in the HA stalk of the ΔNS1-LAIVs are indicated in Fig. 1d and might be related to selection for good compatibility with the new HA heads. To assess whether these changes impact antigenicity of the H1 stalk, we used flow cytometric analysis with a broadly neutralizing HA stalk antibody (Fig. 1b) and observed a high level of reactivity with infected Vero cells, although cHA-ΔNS1-LAIVs displayed more heterogenicity than cHA-caLAIV with respect to levels of HA staining of infected cells.Fig. 1: Characterization of cHA-LAIV vaccine strains in vitro.a The final purified viral stocks were used to assess the comparative replication competence in Vero-CCL81 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI – 0.001) in triplicate and all viral supernatants were assessed by plaque assay. b Vero cells were infected at an MOI – 5 for 16 h for a single replication cycle and cells were stained using the broadly neutralizing antibody CR9114 for flow cytometric analysis. Infection percentages are shown for each virus. c cHA-LAIVs were plaqued in MDCK and MDCK-NS1 (only for ΔNS1 viruses) at 33 or 37 °C for 48 h. Plaques were immunostained using HT103 mAb (anti-NP) to assess temperature sensitive and attenuated phenotypes. d Amino acid changes noted in the HAs of cHA-ΔNS1 after passaging 10 times after virus rescue. Statistics were done using one way-ANOVA conducting multiple comparison against cH8/1-ΔNS1. **P < 0.083, ***P < 0.0009 and ****P < 0.0001. Data are shown as mean ± SE.Full size imageWe next investigated the ability of all these viruses to plaque in IFN-competent MDCK cells at 33 °C or 37 °C for 48 h. In addition, we also used MDCK cell constitutively expressing NS1 (MDCK-NS1) to plaque ΔNS1 viruses. As expected, a temperature-sensitive phenotype was observed for cHA-caLEN viruses as indicated by the lack of plaque formation at 37 °C. ΔNS1-LAIV viruses were able to infect at both temperatures in MDCK-NS1 cells indicating reduced sensitivity to higher temperature. However, the attenuated nature of these viruses was evident by their inability to form plaques in wild-type MDCK cell monolayers at either temperature (Fig. 1c).cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV prime-boost vaccination regimen induces robust serum and mucosal HA stalk responses and confers ADCC reporter assay activityWe next immunized groups of mice according to the scheme in Fig. 2a. Mice immunized with cHA viruses were primed with an influenza B virus expressing a cH9/1 HA to simulate a low level of pre-existing immunity against the group 1 HA stalk present in the human population. As indicated in Fig. 2b, mice were bled between and after immunization regimens to assess the serum-derived humoral responses. LAIVs are known inducers of a mucosal response11,41. Therefore, we assessed the mucosal IgA response against the HA stalk derived from clarified nasal washes to compare the differences between QIV as well as the different regimens of LAIVs used in this study. The area under the curve values (AUCs) derived from endpoint titers for nasal washes indicated that ΔNS1-LAIV vaccinated mice had a higher mucosal IgA response in comparison to responses to cold-adapted counterparts (caLEN-LAIV). As expected, the intramuscularly administered standard of care failed to induce mucosal HA stalk responses (Fig. 3a). As expected, all groups (except group 6) showed increased group1 HA stalk titers as a function of time with boosting (Fig. 3b). All cHA-LAIVs had higher responses compared to the HA-stalk prime only (group 5) and nonadjuvanted standard of care (QIV) (Fig. 3c). When considering individual responses at the end of the immunization regimen, ΔNS1-LAIV vaccinated groups showed comparatively higher responses than the caLEN-LAIV groups. Interestingly, mice that received a cH8/1-LAIV first had better responses than groups that received cH11/1-LAIV first. When compared to the standard of care, groups 1-4 had statistically significant higher responses of HA stalk titers while group 1 had the highest titers from groups 1-4. Given that HA stalk antibodies are known to induce ADCC activity, we used a modified reporter assay using an in-house generated MDCK-HA cell-line harboring a cH6/1 (same HA as the cH6/1 protein) to test this hypothesis. While groups that received cHA-LAIVs had higher ADCC activity in sera compared to other vaccination regimens, group 1 had the highest ADCC reporter activity (Fig. 3d). As anticipated, the standard of care failed to mount ADCC activity likely due to its bias towards an IgG1 serological phenotype (Fig. 3d, group 7).Fig. 2: cHA-LAIV study design and sample collection.a Animals were randomly assigned into seven groups (n = 35). Groups 1-5 were intranasally infected with a sub-lethal dose of purified cH9/1-IBV (2 × 105 PFU). Mice were immunized in 4-week intervals. Group 1 received cH8/1-N1-ΔNS1 and then cH11/1-N1-ΔNS1, group 2 received the vaccine doses in reverse order (105 PFU per dose). Groups 3 and 4 followed the regimens of groups 1 and 2 except that the strains had a cold-adapted temperature-sensitive LAIV backbone (with a full length, functional NS1). Group 5 and 6 were mock immunized with identical volumes of sterile 1x PBS. Group 7 was intramuscularly given 50 µl of non-adjuvanted QIV per dose (~1.5 µg per dose). We used Group 7 as a “standard-of-care” vaccine comparator. Although this group does not include a cH9/1-IBV, previous experiments demonstrated that even in the presence of priming, QIV vaccination did not confer good protection against heterologous challenges26. Animals were intranasally challenged 4 weeks post final-boost either with IVR-180 (BSL-2; 100x LD50) or influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus (BSL-3 + ; 20x LD50) or 13 weeks post final-boost for a separate BSL-3+ challenge (1000x LD50). b Animals were bled (submandibular), and nasal washes were taken at D0 (naïve) and D98 animals. Mice were bled between immunization doses at approximately 28-day intervals up until D98 since the first dose. c Sample collection for BSL2 100 LD50 challenge included submandibular bleeds at D1, D5 and D10 (n = 5) for pooled circulating tetramer specific CD8+ T-cell analysis. Lungs (left lobes) and nasal turbinates were harvested on D3 and D5 for viral titration. Right lobes of lungs on D3 were used for analysis of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T-cell analysis and on D5 for histopathology. Spleens were harvested on D5 for enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) and intracellular staining assays. For BSL-3+ studies, whole-lung and nasal turbinates were harvested on D3 and D5 for viral titration. Image was created using BioRender.Full size imageFig. 3: cHA-LAIV vaccines induce robust serum and mucosal responses against group 1 stalk and confer ADCC reporter assay activity.Longitudinal area-under-the-curve values (AUCs) were calculated using endpoint titers from serumasal washes derived from mice before, between and after immunization. a Mucosal total IgA titers depicted as AUC values for group 1 HA stalk derived from endpoint titers of (n = 3) from animal nasal washes (undiluted starting dilution) on D98. b Longitudinal group 1 HA stalk total IgG titers from pooled sera. c Individual values of group 1 HA stalk total IgG titers from serum on D98. d ADCC reporter assay activity from serially diluted serum samples (1:20 starting dilutions) in which endpoint titers were used to calculate area under the curve values (AUCs) plotted from 3 sets of pooled animal serum from each respective group.

Data indicated here suggests that ΔNS1-LAIV vaccination regimens induced comparatively higher responses for group 1 stalk, H18, and H2 antigens when compared to the cHA-caLEN vaccination regimen (Fig. 4). In general, all LAIV groups had significantly higher serological readouts (except for ADCC) as compared to baseline HA-stalk primed mice. In all cases, ΔNS1-LAIV groups had statistically significant higher titers when compared to the QIV group by D98 as measured by a multiple-comparison one-way ANOVA test for all used antigens (Fig. 4a–c bottom panels). Animals from group 5 induced an HA-specific immune response conferred by the cH9/1-IBV (Influenza B virus) sublethal infection to induce pre-existing immunity while group 6 failed to develop titers as expected, given that these animals were mock immunized. In summary group 1 of the ΔNS1-LAIV had the highest HA stalk humoral response (although not significant between LAIV groups).Fig. 4: cHA-LAIV vaccines induce broad group specific HA and NA total IgG serum responses.Longitudinal area under the curve values (AUCs) were calculated using endpoint titers from serum derived from mice before, between and after immunization (A-C top panels).

Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Limits of detection (LOD) is shown in dotted lines. Upper dotted line indicates HA-Stalk Prime only (Group 5) mean.Full size imagecHA-ΔNS1-LAIV prime-boost vaccination regimen induces robust humoral responses against diverse group 1 specific HAs and N1 NA antigensGiven the importance of a broad humoral response in developing a universal influenza vaccine, we focused on the breadth of serum IgG responses by testing against a panel of diverse group specific HAs, a group 2 HA and N1 NA. All cHA-LAIV vaccination platforms showed immune responses towards the group specific HAs (H2, H9, and H18) in a longitudinal manner (Fig. 4a–c, top panels). QIV immunized mice demonstrated a similar trend longitudinally, albeit to a lesser extent.When considering individual values for each of these group specific HAs on D98, all cHA-LAIV vaccination regimens had significantly higher titers for H2 and H18 when compared with mice that received the standard of care. Furthermore, all groups except group 6 had significantly higher responses against the full length H9 coinciding with the initial intranasal administration of cH9/1-IBV virus. For all group 1 specific HAs tested here, the data from D98 derived serum indicated that mice from group 1 had the highest responses, all of which were statistically significant when compared to QIV (Fig. 4a–c, bottom panels). Like the HA stalk responses observed in Fig. 3, mice immunized first with cH8/1-LAIVs tend to demonstrate higher responses when compared to mice that received first a cH11/1-LAIV for H2 and H18 HA antigens. The group 1 specific responses towards the HA were observed by the inability of the cHA-LAIV immunized mice to confer a boosting effect towards a group 2 HA antigen (H3) tested here. In contrast, mice that received QIV vaccinations were able to boost H3-specific HA responses by the end of the immunization regime (Fig. 4d), consistent with the presence of H3-inactivated viruses in QIV. NA as an immunogen has been also shown to induce protection from influenza virus infections42. Therefore, we assessed N1-NA serum total IgG responses via ELISA and the data suggested that immunized mice from group 1 had higher NA responses compared to caLEN-LAIVs (Fig. 4e, left panel). By the end of the immunization regimen group 1 mice had significantly higher titers compared to mice that received QIV, and mice immunized first with cH8/1 had higher responses within their respective groups (Fig. 4e, right panel).cHA-LAIV vaccination protects mice from a lethal challenge with seasonal-like influenza virusTo test whether the immune responses conferred by cHA-LAIV regimens protected against high-dose lethal challenge from a seasonal influenza virus, mice were challenged with a 100x LD50 of the QIV-matched IVR-180 (H1N1) strain.Weight loss induced by the seasonal influenza virus challenge was minimal between the immunized groups (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, all the vaccinated animals had 100% survival and animals that had pre-existing HA stalk immunity due to prior infection with the influenza B virus expressing a cHA9/1 had 25% survival in this lethal challenge (Fig. 6b) while mock immunized animals succumbed to death.Fig. 5: cHA-LAIV vaccination protects mice from a lethal high-dose seasonal influenza challenge and confers superior upper respiratory tract protection.Four weeks post-final-boost, mice were challenged with a QIV-matched IVR-180 H1N1 virus using a lethal dose of 100x LD50. a Morbidity was assessed by monitoring weight loss. b Survival of challenged animals. c Viral titers in lungs assessed by plaque assays on day 3 and day 5 post-infection. d Viral titers in nasal turbinates on day 3 and 5 post-infection.

The following markers were utilized for the gating strategy; CD3e – T cell marker, CD8a – CD8 T cell marker. b Amino-acid sequence of the NP tetramer used in this study corresponds to all the NPs of the viruses used in this study. c Longitudinal assessment of IAV-NP+CD8+ circulating T-cells expressed as a percentage of total CD8+ T-cells (left) and percentage of total lymphocytes (right).Full size imageViral replication in lungs was highest in groups 5 and 6 (IBV cH9/1 infection only and mock immunized) on both days. Group 1 that received the cH8/1-ΔNS1 and cH11/1-ΔNS1 boost had lower levels of viral titers on D3 as compared to the other groups and had complete clearance by 5 days post-infection. The strain-matched QIV group had a similar trend where virus clearance was apparent by day 5, although the titers were comparatively higher on D3 (Fig. 5c). As indicated in Fig. 5d, group 1 immunized mice had no detectable levels of virus in nasal turbinates on any of the sampled days. In general, all the LAIV groups (except group 3) had lower viral titers in nasal turbinates as compared to controls. Group 7 also showed clearance by 5 days post-infection (Fig. 5d).cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccination induces potent circulating antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses during the virus challengeBy using NP-tetramers specific for the highly conserved TYQRTRALV epitope (Fig. 6b) we used flow cytometry to assess the level of IAV-specific circulating cytotoxic T-cell (CTL; CD8+) responses after IAV challenge of immunized mice (Fig. 6a includes the gating scheme). We used the well-characterized immunodominant (conserved) T-cell epitope (TYQRTRALV) expressed from NP as a model antigen to gauge T-cell responses.In general, cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccinated mice (groups 1 and 2) had a high starting baseline (pre-challenge) for IAV-NP specific CTL responses (Fig. 6c). When considering this population of immune cells as a percentage of all lymphocytes, a dramatic expansion was observed by day 5 for the cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV immunized group 1, which then started to plateau by day 10 (Fig. 6c; right panel). The effect was similar when the data were assessed as a percentage of total CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6c; left panel).In contrast, mice that were immunized with the unadjuvanted-QIV prime-boost regimen, failed to mount a robust CTL response. Conversely, cHA-caLEN immunized mice demonstrated high amounts of CTL activation, although the starting baseline for these groups was lower in comparison to mice that received LAIVs lacking a full-length NS1. When comparing the increase of trends with time, cHA-caLEN immunized mice demonstrated a slower rate of CTL expansion in comparison to their cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV counterpart from group 1. Interestingly group 2 (cHA-ΔNS1 group that received cH11/1 first) did not show expansion after challenge despite a high baseline, while group 1 or the cHA-caLEN groups did (Fig. 6c left and right panels).Activation and expansion of tissue-resident memory (TRM) IAV-NP+CD8+ T cells of mice that were intranasally immunized with cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccinesInfluenza virus antigen-specific T cells that reside in the lungs (tissue-resident memory T cells, TRM) have been shown to be reactivated upon homologous and heterologous virus challenge. These T cells can reduce disease burden and associated pathology to confer improved survival43. Universal influenza vaccine candidates are characterized by their ability to induce heterologous and heterosubtypic immunity. Given that these T-cells target epitopes in conserved viral proteins such as NP, we used NP tetramers to assess antigen-specific TRM CD8+ CTLs derived from immunized mice after challenge with 100x LD50 of IVR-180 (3 days post-infection). We utilized flow cytometry for the processed lung tissues and assessed the absolute values of CD8+ TRMs as shown in Fig. 7a.Fig. 7: cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccination activates tissue-resident memory (TRM) IAV-NP+CD8+ T-cells on day 3 post-infection.Four weeks post-final-boost, mice were challenged with a QIV matched IVR-180 using a lethal dose of 100 LD50. a A representative image of the gating strategy used to probe lung resident NP-tetramer+ CD8+ T-cell responses of animals on day 3 post-infection.

Each dot is one animal and data are shown as mean ± SEM Statistical significance was compared to QIV standard of care group (Group 7) using one-way ANOVA using Dunnett’s correction. **** P- <0.0001.Full size imageThe data indicated the rapid expansion of IAV-specific CD8+ TRM (CD3ε+ CD8+ CD44+ CD69+ CD103+ IAV-NP+) in group 1 that received cH8/1-ΔNS1 prime followed by cH11/1-ΔNS1 boost, suggesting efficient priming by our intranasal vaccine regimen. Even though the rest of the LAIV-immunized animals showed the presence of IAV-specific TRMs, they did not have comparable amounts to those in group 1. In comparison to mice that received QIV, the TRM levels of group 1 were statistically significantly higher as compared to the HA-stalk prime only mice (Fig. 7b).Mice intranasally immunized with cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccines induce robust splenic IFN-γ+-CD8+ T-cell responses upon subsequent infectionGiven that IFN-γ is a cytokine that is readily produced by both CD4+ and CD8+ in order to exert the biological function of activating other immune cells such as NK cells, macrophages and other CD8+T-cells43,44, we used an established IFN-γ ELISpot assay to readily detect CD8 restricted peptide stimulated T-cells of splenic origin. Cells stimulated with HA stalk peptides (IYSTVASSL) indicated groups 2, 4 and 7 to be the highest responders for this assay (Fig. 8a). Interestingly groups 1 and 3 which received the same immunization sequence with different backbones showed reduced amounts in comparison to all the other immunized groups, although this was not statistically significant due to high variability. When considering the absolute numbers with Fig. 8b, it is apparent that HA stalk-based T-cell responses are less pronounced as compared to those induced by NP peptide stimulation. NP peptide stimulated splenic T-cells showed the highest responses to groups 1 and 2, with group 1 being the most pronounced, mirroring results seen in Figs. 6 and 7. This indicates that immune dominance of NP over HA stalk T cell responses was not changed due to the vaccination protocol. As expected QIV immunized mice mounted suboptimal T-cell responses against NP. In parallel, Respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein RSV-F was used as a negative control and yielded no response in any group (Fig. 8c).Fig. 8: ELISpot assays for IFNγ+CD8+ T-cells from splenocytes indicate robust T-cell responses against viral NP and HA stalk, induced by cHA-LAIV vaccinations.Four weeks post-final-boost, mice were challenged with a QIV-matched IVR-180 using a lethal dose of 100x LD50.

Limits of detection (LOD) are shown in dotted lines.Full size imageIntranasal immunization of mice with cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccines minimizes challenge virus-induced interstitial damage and prevents airway epithelial injuryImmune protective parameters induced by vaccination can reduce lung pathology in vivo and therefore, we examined the pathological features of mice that received the different vaccination regimens45,46. Lung tissues were taken from mice 5 days post-infection with a lethal dose of 100x LD50 seasonal influenza virus. We used IHC targeting NP as an antigen to assess the effect of the challenge infection in the lung on day 5. The data indicated that groups 1 and 7 (matched) had the lowest amounts of viral antigen present in the lungs. For group 1 mice, failure to detect viral antigens by day 5 coincided with a lack of viral titers (Figs. 9a, b, and 5c). Although titers were not detected for group 7, IHC indicated the presence of low levels of NP antigen (Figs. 9a, b, and 5c). In contrast, groups that received cH11/1-LAIVs as the prime tended to have higher IHC scores, indicating similar patterns in agreement with the other data sets shown.Fig. 9: cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccination protects mice from severe bronchointerstitial histopathology after seasonal virus challenge.Four weeks post-final-boost, mice were challenged with a QIV-matched IVR-180 using a lethal dose of 100 LD50. On day 5 post infection left lung lobes were fixed in formalin and were processed for H&E staining and IHC. Lungs were scored by a blinded independent veterinary pathologist to assess pathology features. a Representative images from an animal derived from each group are shown as H&E staining (top panels) and NP IHC immunostaining (bottom panels). Peribronchiolar (black hashed outlines) and perivascular inflammation were observed to variable degrees in all influenza virus-inoculated animals regardless of vaccination group. Normal naïve lungs are represented for comparison. Scale bar = 100 microns. All images acquired at 200x total magnification. b Scoring for IHC (α-NP), c scoring for interstitial pathology, d. scoring for airway epithelial integrity and e. cumulative scores based on the assessed parameters. Scoring for individual parameters range from 0–5: 0 no pathology and 5 being severe pathology. Each dot is derived from a single animal and data is shown as mean ± SEM.Full size imageMock immunized animals and IBV HA-stalk only primed animals had the highest IHC scores, with some variability in group 6.Influenza-mediated pulmonary damage initially occurs in the airways and then subsequently disseminates to the respiratory zones of the alveoli as disease progresses. Tissue necrosis derived from the viral infection results in lung pathology and can be readily detected47. Scoring indicated no airway epithelial damage in group 1 whereas all the other groups had measurable amounts of tissue damage, coinciding with the IHC data (Fig. 9a, b and d). Group 2 had the second lowest pathology scoring of all the vaccinated groups together with the standard of care, although groups 2-4 had similar trends in viral titers (Fig. 5c). Group 7 had no detectable virus by day 5 but had similar pathological scoring for the airway epithelia (Figs. 5c and 9b).Given the vital role in air diffusion mediated by the interstitium, thickening of the interstitium due to influenza virus-induced damage and affiliated immune cell infiltrates contributes to clinicopathological outcomes of viral pneumonia46. To assess this parameter, histopathological analysis of challenged mice was conducted (Fig. 9c). Pathological scoring indicated a general trend of mild-to-moderate interstitial pathology across all animals. Group 1 however, showed comparatively low pathological scores as compared with most of the other groups. However, interstitial pathology scores at day 5 were too low in all groups to make any comparative conclusions.Taken together, the cumulative scores indicate an overview of pathology induced by the virus challenge. Group 1 showed the lowest cumulative pathology scores of all the vaccinated mice. Interestingly group 2 and the standard of care had similar levels of overall pathology, while the cHA-caLEN LAIV vaccinated groups had moderate levels of pathology (Fig. 9d). The effects of pathology were not completely mirrored by weight loss (Fig. 5a).Mice intranasally immunized with cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccines are protected from a heterologous challenge with a highly pathogenic avian (HPAI) H5N1 influenza virusUniversal influenza vaccines should protect from any influenza virus regardless of the antigenic make-up. The present study evaluates IAV group 1-specific vaccine candidates that should confer protection against heterologous viruses derived from the same group23. To assess the level of protection, we conducted two BSL-3+ level studies with wild-type H5N1 as challenge virus, that would stringently assess the protective capacity of the proposed immunization regimen. In the first study, we challenged mice with a low lethal dose (20 LD50) 4 weeks post-final boost.All LAIV immunized groups showed minimal weight loss except group 2 for which weight loss initiated on day 8. By day ten 100% survival was observed for all cHA-LAIV groups while the standard of care group 7 (QIV immunized mice) and group 5 (mice pre-existing HA-stalk based immunity) had 20% survival (Fig. 10a left and right panels). Interestingly, by the end of the study, group 2 had 80% survival. Viral titers in lungs indicated that group 1 was able to reduce replication from day 3 to day 5, showing the lowest amounts of virus in comparison to other vaccinated groups with significance observed at 5 DPI. While cHA-LAIV immunized animals had lower lung viral titers, QIV immunized mice lung viral titers were higher and were almost as high as those for mock immunized animals and HA-stalk primed mice (Fig. 10b). Viral titers in nasal turbinates indicated that cHA-ΔNS1 immunized mice had the lowest amount of virus, particularly in group1 with no viral titers detectable (limit of detection 66.67 PFUml-1; Fig. 10e left panel). cHA-caLEN immunized mice showed intermediate levels of reduction, while the standard-of-care group had only slight reductions on both days in comparison to the naïve control group.Fig. 10: cHA-LAIV vaccination protects mice from a high dose heterologous highly pathogenic avian influenza challenge and confers superior upper respiratory tract protection.Foue weeks post final-boost, mice were challenged with an A/VN/1203/04/H5N1 virus using a lethal dose of 20x LD50.Thirteen weeks post final-boost the mice were challenged with high lethal dose 1000x LD50 challenge. a Morbidity (left) and mortality (right) were assessed by monitoring weight loss (20x LD50). b Viral titers in lungs (left) and nasal turbinates (right) on day 3 and 5 post-infection of challenged animals (20x LD50). c Morbidity (left) and mortality (right) were assessed by monitoring weight loss (1000x LD50). d Viral titers in lungs (left) and nasal turbinates (right) on day 3 and 5 post-infection of challenged animals (1000x LD50).

Only group 1 had 50% survival and the rest of the mice succumbed to death by day 9 (Fig. 10c left and right panels). Viral titers in this lethal challenge indicated similar levels of viral replication in lungs, although group 1 had slightly lower titers at both sampled days (Fig. 10d). Group 1 did not have any detectable amounts of virus in nasal turbinates on either day (detection limit 666.67 PFUml-1; Fig. 10e right panel).DiscussionDespite the availability of seasonal vaccines, influenza viruses continue to circulate globally. To mitigate the need for annual vaccine formulations, a universal influenza vaccine that would protect against any influenza virus is currently being pursued worldwide. Many scientists focus on viral proteins containing conserved epitopes that would induce broadly protective immune responses. Such epitopes include the HA stalk, NA, M2e, M1 and NP48.In the present study we compared two different universal influenza vaccine platforms that use the format of an intranasally administered LAIV. A growing body of evidence shows that natural infections are able to provide appropriate mucosal responses that are driven by secretory IgA in the upper respiratory tract as well as cell-mediated immune responses within the respiratory tract43,49,50. These features of an LAIV would be highly beneficial in a universal influenza virus vaccine.Another characteristic of an effective universal influenza virus vaccine is the ability to induce protective immune responses which are long-lasting. A balanced mix of humoral and cell-mediated immunity against influenza virus has been shown to reduce symptomatic disease, transmission, tissue pathology, and overall influenza virus infection-induced disease burden5,10. Needle-free administration is another benefit that LAIVs offer, which may also increase vaccine accessibility. The LAIVs in this study were produced in cell culture, which omits the need for an egg-based vaccine pipeline.To achieve universal protection, we focused on the HA stalk which has been demonstrated to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies that can confer neutralizing and effector function-mediated protection at different stages of the viral life cycle51. Data suggest that the HA stalk antigenically drifts at a much slower rate in comparison to the globular HA head, and therefore is less likely to allow immune escape52,53. To induce HA stalk-specific immune responses, we devised – based on LAIV constructs - a prime-boost immunization regimen composed of two different chimeric HAs (cHA) that harbor exotic avian heads to which humans are naïve, while maintaining the same group-specific HA stalk, with the expectation of boosting antibodies against the stalk. This principle has been tested in various animal models and data suggest that cHA-LAIV vaccination platforms provide superior levels of protection against diverse influenza viruses54. However, a recent clinical trial using the cold-adapted LenLAIV bearing chimeric HAs found that this LAIV vaccine platform did not increase antibodies against the HA stalk in healthy adult individuals, while an adjuvanted IIV vaccine did. To potentially improve an LAIV vaccine approach, we focused on removing the main interferon antagonist NS1 to increase the immunogenicity of the LAIV platform. Our group reported the self-adjuvanting capacity of ΔNS1-LAIV viruses by creating a broad antiviral state in IFN-competent hosts39. ΔNS1-LAIVs are replication-deficient when compared to their WT counterparts due to the induction of local IFN responses. However, it has been shown mice intranasally inoculated with ΔNS1 viruses induced IAV-NP reactive spleen cells while inactivated viruses failed to confer a similar phenotype. This suggests that ΔNS1 viruses go through “abortive replication” resulting in induction of B and T cell responses55. Furthermore, ΔNS1-LAIVs have been shown to be highly immunogenic when given as a seasonal vaccine and have been tested in clinical trials (NCT00724997, NCT03745274)32,41.In the present study, we combined a cHA regimen with a ΔNS1-LAIV backbone to assess whether a prime-boost immunization strategy would confer robust humoral, and cell-mediated responses, and we compared this to the cold-adapted Len-LAIV backbone. We showed that the cHA-ΔNS1-LAIVs were able to grow in IFN-incompetent cells while maintaining antigenicity. Nevertheless, these viruses were unable to replicate in IFN-competent cells in vitro further indicating their replication-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1). We then showed that a prime-boost regimen of cHA-ΔNS1-LAIVs in mice conferred superior levels of serum-based IgG titers against group specific diverse HAs, N1 NA, as well as high titers of HA stalk antibodies, which conventional seasonal vaccines are unable to induce robustly (Fig. 3). While HA stalk antibodies can neutralize viruses during viral fusion and budding, they also can induce effector functions such as ADCC, antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement mediated lysis (CML) by interacting with other innate immune cells such as NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and the complement system56,57. Using an in-house developed MDCK-cH6/1 cell line, we showed that the serum IgG induced by the ΔNS1-LAIVs were readily able to induce ADCC in vitro (Fig. 3d), in agreement with our previous cHA vaccine studies54,58. We noticed a considerably high levels of HA-stalk serological readouts (IgG and ADCC) in the HA-prime only group, although by itself was not protective.Given the importance of mucosal secretory IgA, we were interested in seeing whether our vaccines can induce robust IgA responses49. Although the inductions were low, cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccination induced higher levels compared to vaccination with the Leningrad-based backbones, further supporting the idea that vaccine constructs lacking a functional full-length NS1 increase immunogenicity. (Fig. 3a). To test whether our cHA vaccine preparations can protect from a seasonal influenza lethal dose infection, we challenged mice with 100 LD50 using the QIV matched IVR-180 strain. Although none of the vaccinated mice showed signs of morbidity by weight loss and death, differences in viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates were observed. Group 1 mice that received cH8/1-ΔNS1 followed by cH11/1-ΔNS1 had no detectable virus titers in the upper respiratory tract (URT) in agreement with the IgA responses we measured by ELISAs (Figs. 3a and 5). During the challenge, we followed a group of animals to assess their circulating CTL responses towards ongoing influenza infection. We selected NP as an antigen given its wide use for in vivo studies as well its known contributions for T-cell mediated immunity in both humans and preclinical animal models59. While both cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV vaccine regimens had high baseline levels of NP-specific CTLs, only group 1 mice were able to readily expand these cells by day 5 post-infection, and this level was superior to those induced by the caLEN immunized groups (Fig. 6). The higher starting baseline is due to the cellular immunity induced by vaccination. Tissue-resident memory (TRM) CTLs are known to be induced by natural infections as well as intranasal vaccines10. The importance of these is exemplified by the fact that these cells can readily expand locally upon subsequent infections. Furthermore, these cells are known to confer heterologous immunity. Using tetramer-staining and flow cytometry, we demonstrated the presence of NP-specific TRM-CTLs in ΔNS1-LAIV immunized groups but not in QIV immunized mice. Group 1 mice showed the most robust response indicative of a trend across several immunogenic and protective assays we have performed.ELISpot assays were performed targeting splenic IFN-γ + CD8 T-cells against HA stalk and NP. We found that the level of HA stalk-specific T-cell responses to be low across all groups, albeit highly variable. This is arguably due to the poor immunogenicity of the antigen in the context of T-cell immunity. In contrast, NP specific IFN-γ + CD8 T-cells had a higher response in agreement with its T-cell-specific immunogenicity. Once again, group 1 mice that received cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV prime-boost vaccination had the best response, consistent with the other NP based T-cell data we presented here (Figs. 6, 7 and 8). We believe that a synergistic effect of strong serological responses at serum and mucosal levels together with circulating and tissue-resident T-cell responses are at play in the observed protective effect. When already present in the tissue (tissue-resident memory T cells, TRM), these effector-type lymphoid cells can respond very fast and contribute to the first line of defense during the early phases of infection by elimination of infected cells60. Inactivated virus-based vaccines such as the currently licensed QIV or recombinant protein vaccines typically are poor inducers of T cell responses in the periphery, and do not particularly contribute to mucosal T cell induction. Live attenuated virus vaccines like the one tested here, on the contrary, are potent inducers of T cell responses at mucosal sites, and therefore can be considered a more optimal way to activate cellular vaccine responses61. T cell responses also allow to target highly conserved epitopes in vaccine antigens, which allows to further broaden the protective effect of vaccination to protect against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza viruses. Influenza virus infections can be characterized by their ability to confer respiratory tissue damage inducing necrosis in airway epithelial cells as well as interstitial pneumonia46,47. We showed that group 1 mice had the best outcome based on pathology scoring; this is in line with the serum and mucosal responses which control virus replication. The CTL response may have also contributed to controlling of viral replication by clearing infected cells. Moreover, group 1 mice had no detectable pathology in the alveolar epithelia, coinciding with the lack of infectious virus in lungs at day 5 (Figs. 5 and 9). Overall, cHA-ΔNS1-LAIV (specifically group 1) mice immunized with cH8/1-ΔNS1 followed by cH11/1-ΔNS1 were able to control virus induced tissue damage, likely owing to the superior humoral and T-cell responses. The reason why this order of immunization is more efficacious than a regimen of cH11/1-ΔNS1 virus followed by the cH8/1-ΔNS1 is not clear.Finally, we challenged groups of mice with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in a BSL-3+ setting, to test whether our vaccine preparation would protect mice from a heterosubtypic lethal challenge. We observed 100% survival in a 20x LD50 low lethal dose challenge 4 weeks post challenge for group 1 mice; the standard of care group had 20% survival. However, we did notice onset of sudden weight loss and subsequent death in group 2 on day 9, probably due to the neurotropic nature of the virus (viral titers in URT and lower respiratory tract (LRT) were modest). Another group of mice was challenged 13-weeks post final boost with a high lethal dose (1000x LD50) to better understand the potency of the immune response induced by the vaccinations. Group 1 was the only group that had survivors (50%) while all the other groups succumbed to death. The survival likely can be attributed to the robust TRM as well as mucosal responses. Upon assessing viral replication by plaque assays, we found that the same group had no detectable levels of viral replication in URT (Fig. 10d). While the vaccine-induced immune response may have certainly assisted in this observation, we acknowledge the possibility that the levels were below the limit of detection which was relatively high in this assay (666.67 PFUml-1). Furthermore, avian viruses such as the one used in this study have been shown to preferentially replicate in cell types expressing α-2,3 sialic acid moieties that are highly expressed in lungs compared to the URT62. The breadth and the strength of the immune responses to LAIVs have been shown to be dependent on the induction of robust Tfh CD4+ T-cell responses. It has been shown that LAIV-induced CXCR5 dependent Tfh cells aid cognate B cells in producing antibodies with high affinity and contributing to long-lasting memory12,13. In the current study we were unable to look at these immune parameters and future studies will be performed to decipher the immunology in the context of cHA-ΔNS1-LAIVs.In summary, we demonstrated the potential of a cHA-ΔNS1-based LAIV vaccination platform to provide robust humoral and cellular immune responses. The vaccine regimen given in a specific order provided optimal protective immune responses. However, when the order was reversed, we observed that the immune responses and protection outcomes were reduced (group 2). Although the mechanism behind this discrepancy is not known, it highlights the importance of the immunization sequence in a prime boost vaccination regime. This also indicates the need for further studies to assess the impact of vector immunity in the context of repeated dosing. Future work will focus on understanding the effect of pre-existing immunity by modeling the vaccination strategy in pre-immune ferrets. Taken together, the results of this study emphasize the importance of antigen selection and vaccine delivery platforms to develop a universal influenza vaccine and their impacts on a multidose-live attenuated influenza vaccination strategy.MethodsEthics statementThe present animal study was conducted upon approval of an animal protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Icahn School of Medicine (ISMMS). All mice were housed in a BSL-2 barrier facility which was temperature and humidity controlled and all procedures were conducted by trained personnel and were designed to minimize animal suffering. Challenge studies with select agents were done by trained personnel with approved protocols performed within a certified ABSL3+ facility at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.Cells, viruses, and recombinant proteinsMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC® CCL-34), an in-house generated MDCK cell line stably expressing NS1 (MDCK-NS1) from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) and Vero-CCL81 (ATCC® CRL-81™) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated-FBS and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plaque assays in BSL-2 were done as previously described39. Virus titrations were done using standard plaque assays to obtain the plaque forming unit (PFU) titer. For plaque assays within the BSL3+, an overlay composed of 2.1% Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose) was used63. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining using an α-Nucleoprotein NP HT103 mAb64 at a dilution of 1:1000. The cH6/1 (containing H6 head domain from A/mallard/Sweden/81/02 combined with an H1 stalk domain of A/California/04/09 (Cal/09)), H2 (A/mallard/Netherlands/5/99), and H18 (A/flat-facedbat/Peru/33/10) recombinant proteins were expressed using a baculovirus expression system as described previously65. For the BSL-2 challenge, A/Singapore/GP1908/15 H1N1 (IVR-180) (matched H1N1 component for the quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV)) was obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC). For the BSL-3+ challenge, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus was rescued using reverse genetics within BSL-3+ setting as previously described66.cHA-universal vaccine preparations and standard-of-care vaccine preparationscHA-ΔNS1-LAIV were generated as described previously32. The external glycoproteins of these viruses are cH8/1 or cH11/1 with N1 of the 09-pandemic origin virus (A/California/7/09 (H1N1)). The viruses were passaged 10 times and were sequenced to confirm the genetic stability. The cold-adapted temperature sensitive Leningrad backbone-based viruses (caLEN) had identical HAs and NAs to the ΔNS1 vaccine strains and have been described previously30. These viruses were sequenced, and all vaccine strains were assessed for infectivity using multi-cycle growth curves and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorting using mAb CR911467 and Galios FACS sorter. An influenza B virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 backbone) harboring a cH9/1 HA was generated as previously described25. As a standard of care, a QIV, Flucelvax Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (2018-2019 season), was obtained from BEI Resources (NR-51698). All vaccine viruses were propagated in cell culture (MDCK-WT or MDCK-NS1 cells) and were purified through a 30% sucrose cushion using ultra centrifugation (2 rounds in SW28 Beckman rotor at 25,000 RPM for 2 h at 4 °C). Viral pellets were suspended in sterile 1X PBS (pH 7.0).Mouse immunizations, sample collection and virus challengesFemale, 6–8-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences. Animals were randomly assigned to groups and study layout is shown in Fig. 2a. Anesthetized animals (ketamine and xylazine diluted in PBS administered via intraperitoneal injection; 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine IP) were intranasally infected using 30 µl of appropriately diluted viruses or PBS. Intramuscular vaccinations were administered using 50 µl undiluted, unadjuvanted QIV (standard of care). Sample collection setup is shown in Fig. 2b, c.Mice were subjected to submandibular bleeds and nasal washes (terminal procedure) pre-prime and were also bled between immunizations (approximately at 28-day intervals) as indicated in Fig. 2b. A total of 5 animals from each group were bled D1, D5, and D10 for circulating CD8+ T-cell analysis and the same animals were followed for this experimental procedure. The terminal procedure for tissue harvesting was facilitated by humanly sacrificing animals via an IP injection of pentobarbital (250 mg/kg). Left lung lobes and nasal turbinates were harvested for viral titration via plaque assays for D3 and D5 post-challenge. Right lobes were used for flow cytometric analysis of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T-cells on D3 and left lung lobes were used for histology on D5 post-infection. Spleens were harvested on D5 for peptide-stimulated IFN-γ+-CD8+ T-cells ELISpot assays. Median lethal doses (LD50) were calculated as described before using groups of mice (n = 5 per group) which were infected with ten-fold serially diluted virus (of known titer)68. IVR-180 had an LD50 of 180 PFU while the HPAI-H5N1 had an LD50 of ~2 PFU.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)ELISA for serum IgG (Rabbit α-mouse IgG-HRP; Sigma A9044) and nasal wash IgA (goat α-mouse IgA-HRP; Bethyl Laboratories A90-103P) were established. Serum ELISAs were done with heat-inactivated serum at a starting dilution of 1:30 and nasal washes were studied using clarified undiluted washes. The format for ELISA was described previously25. In brief, high-binding 96-well ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 2 µg/ml of in the indicated recombinant proteins in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times using PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20) and were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with blocking buffer composed of PBS-T with 3% goat serum (Life Technologies) and 0.5% milk powder. Plates were then incubated with serially diluted (three-fold) serumasal wash samples. Plates were then washed again three times and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:3000 for IgG and 1:2000 for IgA) for an hour. Plates were then washed four times with PBS-T and were developed by using SigmaFast OPD (o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) substrate followed by 3 M HCL, and plates were read at 490 nm using a Biotek Synergy H1 reader. The mean + 3X standard deviations (SD) of blank wells were calculated as a cut-off endpoint value.Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assaysADCC reporter assays were done using a modified protocol as described previously58. Briefly, MDCK-HA (cH6/1) cells were seeded (2.5 ×104 cells per well) in white polystyrene 96-well assay plates (Costar Corning) and were incubated overnight. Heat-inactivated serum samples with a starting dilution of 1:20 (25 µl) were three-fold serially diluted in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) and were incubated for 7 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with modified Jurkat cells expressing the murine FcγRIV receptor which activates the luciferase under the control of NFAT promotor (7.5 × 104 cells per well; Promega). The cross-linking of Fcγ receptors by immune complexes results in luciferase activity. This activity was assessed by using Bio-Glo luciferase substrate and the plates were read after 15 minutes using a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek). Background luminescence (average + 3 x SD) of wells without Ab was subtracted, and the area under the curve was calculated.Circulating NP-specific T cells in the bloodBlood was collected from the submandibular vein on 1 day before, 5 days after, and 10 days after challenge (n = 5 per group) into tubes containing 20 μl of 0.5 M EDTA to prevent coagulation and pooled per group. Whole blood was stained with H-2K(d) TYQRTALV tetramer in PE (1:75 dilution, Cat. No. 44053, NIH Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA, USA) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark, then the following antibodies were spiked in: purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 Fc Block (1:100 dilution, Clone 2.4G2, Cat. No. 553142, BD), CD3 Alexa Fluor 700 (1:100 dilution, Clone 17A2, Cat. No. 100216, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), CD8a PerCP (1:100 dilution, Clone 53-6.7, Cat. No. 553036, BD), and MHC Class II eFluor 450 (1:200 dilution, Clone M5/114.15.2, Cat. No. 48-5321-82, ThermoFisher). Samples were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 400g for 5 min at room temperature and supernatants were discarded. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of eBioscience Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer (Cat. No. 00-5523-00, ThermoFisher), diluted as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After fixation, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of staining buffer. After the second wash, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of staining buffer. Samples and compensation controls were acquired and analyzed as described above.Tissue-resident CD8+ T cells in the lungTo assess elicitation and activation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, lungs were collected at 3 days post-challenge (n = 3 mice per group) into supplemented RPMI-1640 (5% FBS, 1X Pen-Strep). Lungs were minced into small pieces, roughly 4 mm3 in size, then digested with collagenase D (Cat. No. 11088866001, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) diluted to a working concentration of 2 mg/ml in supplemented RPMI-1640 for 15 min at 37 °C, shaking. Digested lung pieces were then forced through a 70 μm cell strainer (Cat. No. 352350, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) with the plunger of a 1 ml syringe (Cat. No. 309628, BD) to generate single-cell suspensions. After cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C, media was aspirated from the pellet and cells were resuspended in 5 ml of ammonium chloride red blood cell lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C supernatant was aspirated and cells were resuspended in 50 μl of staining buffer containing Fc Block (Clone 2.4G2, Cat. No. 553142, BD) diluted 1:100. Cells were incubated with diluted Fc Block for 5 minutes at room temperature, before 50 μl of surface stain cocktail was added on top. The surface stain cocktail consisted of the following: CD3ε FITC (1:100 dilution, Clone 145-2C11, Cat. No. 553061, BD), CD44 PE-CF594 (1:100 dilution, Clone IM7, Cat. No. 562464, BD), CD8a PerCP (1:100 dilution, Clone 53-6.7, Cat. No. 553036, BD), CD69 PE-Cy7 (1:100 dilution, Clone H1.2F3, Cat. No. 561930, BD), MHC Class II (I-A/I-E) eFluor 450 (1:200 dilution, Clone M5/114.15.2, Cat. No. 48-5321-82, ThermoFisher), Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 450 (1:100 dilution, Cat. No. 65-0863-14, ThermoFisher), and H-2K(d) TYQRTALV tetramer in PE (1:75 dilution, Cat. No. 44053, NIH Tetramer Core Facility) diluted in staining buffer. Cells were surface stained for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed by adding 1 ml fresh staining buffer on top and centrifuged at 400g for 5 min at room temperature, then the supernatant was decanted before proceeding to the next step. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of BD Cytofix (Cat. No. 554714, BD) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1 ml staining buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of staining buffer. Five μl of CountBright Absolute Counting Beads (Cat. No. C36950, ThermoFisher) were added to each tube. Samples and compensation controls were acquired and analyzed as described above.Flow cytometryAfter samples were processed and stained as described below, samples were measured using a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with Kaluza for Gallios Version 1.0 software. For all compensation controls, 1 μl of antibody was added to 1 drop of Invitrogen UltraComp eBeads Plus Compensation Beads (Cat. No. 01-3333-42, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) then vortexed. 150 μl of staining buffer (2% bovine serum albumin and 200 mM EDTA in 1X PBS) was added to the compensation controls after incubating at room temperature for 15 minutes. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo Version 10.8 (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Data was compensated using the AutoSpill algorithm in FlowJo. Exported cell counts and population frequencies were visualized using GraphPad Prism Version 9.2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).ELISpot assaysELISpot assays were done using murine IFN-γ ELISpot kit (R&D systems EL485) using processed splenocytes as mentioned above. Briefly, 105 processed splenocytes were stimulated with HA peptide (IYSTVASSL, Cat. No. RP20284, Genescript), NP peptide (TYQRTALV, Cat. No. RP20260 Genescript), or RSV-F glycoprotein (KYKNAVTEL; MBL international) peptides diluted according to manufacturer’s instructions and were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The plates were then washed with wash buffer and incubated in detection antibody for 2 h a room temperature and developed with BCIP/NBT substrates, as per manufacturer recommendations. The plates were then washed with deionized water and were dried before imaging using an ELISpot imaging device (Cellular Technology 2018). The images were then manually counted. A total of three animals in duplicate for each group were assessed.HistopathologyLeft lung lobes were inflated with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and fixed for a week. These were embedded in paraffin blocks and 5μm sections were cut on a microtome (Microm, Thermo Scientific). Sections were subjected to staining by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by the Biorepository and Pathology Core (N.A.C., Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). Sections were mounted (Histomount Solution; Life Technologies) and analyzed by a veterinary pathologist blinded to the treatment groups. Lung H&E slides were evaluated using a pathological scoring system to assess three parameters: percentage of lung parenchyma immunoreactive to influenza A virus NP, severity of epithelial degenerationecrosis of bronchioles, and alveolar interstitial inflammation. A cumulative score of all three parameters was also utilized to evaluate differences in severity amongst experimental cohorts. For the area affected, a scale of 0–5 was used where 0 = not affected, 1 = 5–10% 2 = 10–25%, 3 = 25–50%, 4 = 50–75%, and 5 = 75–100% of lung affected. For histopathological parameters a score of 0–5 was used: 0 = not affected, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked and 5 = severe.Brightfield immunohistochemistryA Ventana Discovery Ultra (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) tissue autostainer was used for brightfield chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC). Lungs from uninfected (negative control) and infected mice with mock vaccinated (group 6) (positive control) were used as internal controls for assay optimization. Antigen retrieval was conducted using a Tris-based buffer-Cell Conditioning 1 (CC1)-Catalog # 950-124(Roche) and retrieval was done at 94 °C for 32 minutes. An influenza A nucleoprotein antibody (Catalog #PA5-32242 Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) was used at a dilution of 1:2000 diluted in casein buffer and incubations were done for 64 minutes at 37 °C. The anti-influenza A primary antibody was of rabbit origin, and thus was developed with a pre-diluted (1:5000) secondary goat anti-rabbit HRP-polymer antibody-Catalog #MP-7451-50 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A ChromoMap DAB (3,3′-Diaminobenzidine) Kit-Catalog #760-159 (Roche) was applied to slides to form a brown precipitate at the site of primary antibody complexes containing HRP with hematoxylin nuclear counterstain. IHC scores ranged from 0 to 4 and represented the following: 0-no antigen detected; 1-minimal antigen detected, 2-mild to regionally moderate antigen detected, 3-moderate to regionally marked antigen detected, 4-marked to severe antigen detected.

Here, we reported a novel vaccine design utilizing circular RNA (circRNA) as a delivery platform for multi-subtype neuraminidases (NA) (influenza A N1, N2, and influenza B Victoria lineage NA) immunogens. Individual NA circRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNP) elicited robust NA-specific antibody responses with neuraminidase inhibition activity (NAI), preventing the virus from egressing and infecting neighboring cells. Additionally, the administration of circRNA LNP induced cellular immunity in mice. To achieve a universal influenza vaccine, we combined all three subtypes of NA circRNA-LNPs to generate a trivalent circRNA vaccine. The trivalent vaccine elicited a balanced antibody response against all three NA subtypes and a Th1-biased immune response in mice. Moreover, it protected mice against the lethal challenge of matched and mismatched H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses, encompassing circulating and ancestral influenza virus strains. This study highlights the potential of delivering multiple NA antigens through circRNA-LNPs as a promising strategy for effectively developing a universal influenza vaccine against diverse influenza viruses.

NA is the second most abundant glycoprotein on the influenza virus envelope and promotes virus release during the influenza replication cycle1,2. The current effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is primarily demonstrated by its ability to induce hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses. However, seasonal influenza viruses often exhibit significant immune evasion against such immune responses. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the crucial role of NA-specific immunity in conferring cross-protection1,2,3. NA has a slower mutation rate than HA proteins, which are prone to rapid antigenic drift4. Our previous work revealed that natural influenza virus infection induces a significant proportion of NA-reactive B cells and broadly neutralizing NA antibodies in humans5. These NA-reactive antibodies demonstrated robust NA inhibitory activity in vitro, protecting mice from lethal challenge. Additionally, recent studies have identified a large number of conserved neutralizing epitopes on NA6,7,8,9,10. Studies in guinea pigs and humans have shown that anti-NA immunity can hinder viral transmission11,12,13. Thus, NA could be a potential target for broad-spectrum influenza vaccine development.However, licensed influenza vaccines have not sufficiently induced a robust NA-specific antibody response5. This may be attributed to the absence of sufficient NA components in the vaccines or their degradation during production. Attempts to address this challenge include incorporating recombinant NA protein into seasonal vaccines14,15,16, manipulating viral packaging signals to increase NA content17, and extending NA stalk length on the virus particles to enhance NA immunogenicity18. Notably, mRNA technology offers a unique advantage by delivering membrane-bound NA in their native conformation, which has shown promising results in inducing potent anti-NA immunity in mice19,20. Vaccination with an NA mRNA vaccine can induce NA-reactive antibodies, including NA inhibition (NAI), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies, and cellular immune response20,21,22.Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of covalently closed ring RNA molecules generated by RNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. CircRNA lacks exposed 3’ and 5’ ends, making it resistant to degradation by most nucleases. This stability provides an advantage over linear RNA, such as mRNA. Incorporating internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allows circRNA to facilitate long-lasting protein expression23. CircRNA vaccines encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) have demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta and Omicron) in mice and rhesus monkeys24. In addition to stability, circRNA possesses potent adjuvant properties. They can effectively activate intracellular sensors like RIG-I and MDA5, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and triggering robust immune responses25. Studies have shown a rapid increase in proinflammatory factors and chemokines following circRNA injection, leading to significant recruitment of immune cells (DCs, monocytes, and macrophages) to the injection site. Long-lasting and robust T cell responses were observed in mice immunized with circRNA encoding OVA25. T cells targeting conserved epitopes can provide an additional layer of protection when the virus escapes antibodies26,27,28. These combined attributes position circRNA as a promising platform for developing next-generation, broadspectrum influenza vaccines.Here, we designed circRNA vaccines containing N1, N2, and influenza B virus NA antigens to elicit broad-spectrum NA immunity against heterologous influenza. This trivalent circRNA vaccine successfully induced robust NA-specific humoral and cellular immunity in mice. Moreover, it protected mice against lethal challenges with homologous and heterologous strains of H1N1, H3N2, and Victoria lineage influenza B viruses. These findings provide compelling evidence that the NA-targeting circRNA vaccine holds considerable promise for achieving broad-spectrum protection against influenza in mice and can be considered a novel strategy for potential universal influenza vaccine development.ResultsPreparation and characterization of circRNA-NA VaccinesNA from three circulating seasonal influenza vaccine strains were selected: A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), and B/Florida/12/2017 (Victoria) (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1). These strains were selected because they predominated in recent seasons. The vaccine did not include the Yamagata lineage virus NA as it has been rarely detected since 202029. CircRNAs encoding the selected NAs were synthesized using the permuted intron-exon (PIE) splicing strategy and subsequently encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) via an iNanoE microfluidic system. Sanger sequencing confirmed accurate ligation of the circRNAs (Fig. 1b). Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that circRNA can resist the hydrolysis by RNase R. (Fig. 1c). All prepared LNPs exhibited consistent characteristics, with ~80 nm particle size and polydispersity indices (PDI) < 0.2. The encapsulation efficiency of these LNPs exceeded 93% (Fig. 1e).Fig. 1: Design and characterization of circRNA-LNP encoding NA.a Schematic diagram of circRNA vaccine production.

The expression of NA antigens was confirmed by flow cytometry using a broad-spectrum NA antibody 1G0110, an N2-specific antibody 229-2C065, or an influenza B virus NA-specific antibody CC61 (isolated and identified by Prof. Chen’s laboratory). Analysis indicated stable NA expression in approximately 98% of transfected cells, indicating efficient protein translation from circRNAs (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, to verify whether the NA antigens produced by circRNA were functional, the cells transfected with circRNA-LNP were tested for NA activity using a 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) substrate. Positive enzyme activity confirmed the native conformation of NA antigens produced by circRNAs (Fig. 1d)30.CircRNA-NA vaccines elicited robust immunity in miceTo evaluate the immunogenicity of circRNA vaccines in mice, groups of mice (n = 5) were administered two doses (10 μg or 2 μg for each dose, respectively) of each circRNA-NA, with a four-week interval between doses (Fig. 2a). Antibody titers were assessed after primary and booster vaccinations, revealing all three vaccines elicited significant increases in NA-specific antibody levels compared to the control group in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2b–d). For all the groups, serum titers significantly increased after booster immunization, with most animals exceeding 104 (Fig. 2b–d). The binding breadth of immune sera indicated that monovalent vaccines could induce specific antibodies against heterologous NAs within the same NA subtype (Fig. 2e–g). Given the potential link correlation between NAI antibody titers and protection13,31,32, NAI antibodies against homologous NA were evaluated. Boosting circRNA-NA administration significantly increased NAI titers (over 1000 or near 1000, except 2 μg dose in the N2 group, Fig. 2h–j). Suggesting that booster vaccination may be necessary to stimulate the maturation of NA-specific B cells and the production of functional antibodies. Therefore, a two-dose immunization regimen was adopted for subsequent studies.Fig. 2: Monovalent circRNA vaccine induces antibody response in mice.a Five mice per group were immunized with two doses of monovalent circRNA vaccine (N1, N2, IBV) at a four-week interval. Sera were collected 3 weeks after both the prime and boost immunization. A blank LNP group was used as a control. The figure was created by the author using Adobe Illustrator 2020. Binding antibodies against Mich15 (b), SL32 (c), and BCOL17 (d) NA recombinant proteins were detected by ELISA. ELISA was performed to assess the binding ability of N1 monovalent (e), N2 monovalent (f), IBV monovalent (g) circRNA immune sera to heterologous N1, N2, IBV NA recombinant protein. The radar diagram shows the geometric mean titer (GMT) of each group (n = 5). The abbreviation of the virus strain was the same as in Fig. S1. NAI antibodies against Mich15 (h), SL32 (i), and BCOL17 (j) were detected by ELLA. Using recombinant protein as antigen. Neutralization titers of boost immune sera against CA09 (k), SL32 (l), and BCOL17 (m) virus were detected by microneutralization assay. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 5), and each symbol represents one animal. The dashed lines correspond to the lowest initial dilution. Statistical significance was performed by One-way ANOVA; Unpaired Student’s t tests were used to compare antibody titers between prime and boost sera within the same dosage group of mice; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant.Full size imageTo further assess vaccine efficacy, a microneutralization assay (MN assay) was conducted to evaluate the sera’ capacity to inhibit virus replication in vitro. MN assay results confirmed that post-boost sera from all groups exhibited significant virus neutralization activity (Fig. 2k–m). Notably, the N2 groups demonstrated particularly strong neutralizing activity against the homologous A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 virus (MN titer ~1000, Fig. 2h). Since NA antibodies do not directly neutralize viral infection, it is plausible that the immune serum used in the MN experiments suppressed the virus by inhibiting viral release and subsequent infection of neighboring cells. Overall, the above data confirmed that circRNA vaccines containing NA antigens presented strong immunogenicity, inducing NAI and neutralizing antibodies in mice.CircRNA-NA vaccine induced NA-specific T cell response in miceIn addition to eliciting robust humoral responses, cellular immunity was also instrumental in enhancing the protective efficacy of vaccines. Previous studies on nucleic acid vaccines, such as mRNA, have successfully induced antigen-specific T cell responses33,34,35. NA-specific T cell responses were evaluated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. Results indicated that all three circRNA vaccines significantly increased the number of IFN-γ and IL-4 producing cells compared with the control group (Fig. 3a–e). These findings were further corroborated by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays (Fig. 3f–h and Fig. S2).Fig. 3: CircRNA vaccination induced NA-specific cellular responses.a–c Mice were vaccinated with 10 μg of circRNA-LNP encoding N1, N2, or IBV NA, following a prime-boost vaccination scheme. Ten days post boost vaccination, the spleen was harvested and spot-counting for IFN-γ/IL-4 -secreting cells by ELISpot assay after stimulating with N1 (a), N2 (b) or IBV NA (c) recombinant protein. Representative walls of IFN-γ (d) or IL-4 (e) ELISpot. The proportion of IFN-γ (f), TNF-α (g), or IL-2 (h) secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was assessed by FASC. Splenocytes from the blank LNP group were used as a control. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 5), and each symbol represents one animal. Statistical significance was performed by unpaired t test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant.Full size imageUpon stimulation with recombinant N1, N2, or influenza B virus (IBV) NA proteins, CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 were detected in mice that received the circRNA vaccine (Fig. 3f–h). IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells were detected in mice immunized with circRNA-N1 and circRNA-IBV-NA (Fig. 3f, h). The proportion of IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells was also observed in the group immunized with circRNA-N2, although there was no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.078) (Fig. 3g). Overall, these data demonstrate that the circRNA-NA vaccine can induce NA-specific T cell responses in mice, encompassing both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets.Trivalent circRNA vaccine induced broad-spectrum immunityDrawing from previous successes in delivering multivalent HA antigens via mRNA LNPs without encountering antigenic competition36, we developed a trivalent circRNA vaccine. This vaccine combines three distinct circRNA LNPs encoding N1, N2, and IBV antigens. This strategy aims to utilize multivalent antigen delivery to broaden the range of vaccine protection while mitigating antigenic interference. Mice were vaccinated with a combination of N1, N2, and IBV NA circRNA LNPs using two doses: 30 μg (10 μg each NA) and 6 μg (2 μg each NA), with a 4-week boost interval (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: Trivalent circRNA vaccine induced a balanced immune response against N1, N2, and influenza B NA.a Trivalent circRNA vaccine immunization and challenge regimen. Mice received a prime-boost immunization program with 4 weeks intervals, 4 weeks after boost vaccination mice were challenged with 5 × LD50 or 1 × LD50 influenza virus. Body weight and survival rate were monitored for 14 days. Some mice were euthanized, and lungs were collected at 4 dpi. A blank LNP group was used as a control. The figure was created by the author using Adobe Illustrator 2020. ELISA was used to measure the binding antibody titers against Mich15 (b), SL32 (c), and BCOL17 (d) in the serum samples from the trivalent vaccine group. e The binding breadth of trivalent vaccine immune sera after boost vaccination. The radar diagram shows each group’s geometric mean titer (GMT) (n = 5). The abbreviation of the virus strain was the same as in Fig. S1. NAI titer of trivalent immune sera.

Microneutralization titers against CA09 (i), SL32 (j), and BCOL17 (k) virus were detected by microneutralization assay.

Statistical significance was performed by One-way ANOVA; Unpaired Student’s t tests were used to compare antibody titers between prime and boost sera within the same dosage group of mice; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. ns, not significant.Full size imageSera antibody titers demonstrated that the trivalent circRNA vaccine induced a balanced and robust antibody response against all three NA components, comparable to monovalent vaccines (Fig. 4b–d). Importantly, there was no significant difference in sera titers between the two dose groups of the trivalent vaccine, possibly due to the saturation of circRNA doses in mice. Notably, trivalent vaccination elicited broader antibody recognition, encompassing all heterologous N1, N2, and IBV strains, exceeding the monovalent response, especially in the high-dose groups (Figs. 2e–g, 4e). Additionally, trivalent sera demonstrated functional neutralization against all three NA subtypes and their respective viruses in vitro (Fig. 4f–k).Trivalent circRNA vaccine provided broad-spectrum protection in vivoTo assess in vivo protection, mice vaccinated with the trivalent circRNA vaccine were challenged with lethal doses of various influenza strains 28 days after the boost. Against the 5 × LD50 of homologous H1N1 strain A/California/04/2009 (CA09), both doses of the trivalent vaccine completely protected all mice, with minimal (~5%) weight loss (Fig. 5a). Even against a more distant H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934; PR8; 81.8% identity), both doses provided significant protection, although with moderate (~15%) weight loss (Fig. 5b). Similar results were observed for H3N2 strains, with complete protection against the closer A/Gui Zhou/54/1989 (GZ89; 90.4% identity) and the more distant A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (HK68; 85% identity) strains (Fig. 5c, d). The vaccine’s role in dampening viral load was further evaluated. At 4 days post-infection (4 dpi), viral load in the lungs of vaccinated mice was significantly lower compared to control groups under the sublethal challenge with CA09 and HK68 strains (Fig. S3a, b).Fig. 5: Trivalent circRNA vaccine protects mice from heterologous virus challenge.a–e Mice (n = 5) were immunized with 6 μg or 30 μg trivalent CircRNA vaccine in two doses at 28-day intervals. Blank LNP was used as a control. Twenty-eight days post boost vaccination, mice were challenged 5 × LD50 of A/California/04/2009(H1N1) (a), A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (b), A/Gui Zhou/54/89 (H3N2) (c), A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (H3N2) (d), B/Colorado/06/2017(Victoria) (e). Body weight and survival rate were monitored for 14 days. Body weight was shown as the mean of five mice ± SD.Full size imageSimilarly, the protective efficacy of the trivalent circRNA vaccine against influenza B virus was also evaluated. Upon the lethal challenge with B/Colorado/06/2017 (BCOL17; homologous to vaccine antigen), mice vaccinated with the trivalent circRNA vaccine were protected from morbidity (Fig. 5e). Lung virus titers were also analyzed at 4 dpi following sublethal challenge with 1 × LD50 of B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (BMA04; 96.6% identity) virus. Virus load in the lungs of all mice vaccinated with the trivalent circRNA vaccines was cleared below the detection limit, whereas virus load in the control group reached up to 105 PFU (Fig. S3d). The vaccine’s protective efficacy against the Yamagata lineage virus B/Florida/4/2006 was evaluated. At 4 dpi, viruses were effectively cleared in mice vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine, particularly in the high-dose group, while viral loads in lung homogenates of control mice exceeded 2 × 105 TCID50/ml (Fig. S3c). These findings indicate that the trivalent circRNA vaccine effectively protects mice against diverse strains of H1N1 and H3N2, as well as both Victoria and Yamagata influenza B viruses. These findings highlight the potential value of this platform for developing broad-spectrum influenza vaccines.One dose of trivalent circRNA vaccines could protect miceThe protective efficacy of the trivalent circRNA vaccine was evaluated in a single-dose vaccination regimen (Fig. 6a). Mice that received a single dose of the trivalent circRNA vaccine at 30 μg and 6 μg doses survived the lethal challenge with B/Colorado/06/2017 (Fig. 6e). These results confirm that trivalent circRNA vaccines effectively protect mice with a single shot.Fig. 6: Protective efficacy of a single dose of circRNA vaccine.a Immunization schedule for the challenge experiment in the prime-only group. The figure was created by the author using Adobe Illustrator 2020. b–d Antibody titers against the NA recombinant proteins from Mich15 (c), SL32 (d), and BCOL17 (e) were measured using ELISA. The data present results from five mice per group. Dashed lines indicate the lowest initial dilution. Statistical significance was determined using One-way ANOVA; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns denotes not significant. e Mice (n = 5) in the prime-only group were challenged with 5 × LD50 of B/Colorado/06/2017 (Victoria) virus. Body weight and survival rate were monitored for 14 days. Body weight was shown as the mean of five mice ± SD.Full size imageDiscussionDeveloping a broad-spectrum influenza vaccine remains a major challenge. Current vaccines primarily target the highly variable HA protein, leading to reduced effectiveness against drifted influenza virus strains. In this study, we designed a circRNA vaccine based on the NA antigen. While NA exhibits less antigenic variation than HA, it is naturally an immune-subdominant antigen. On the surface of the influenza virus, HA is present in greater abundance than NA37. This means the immune system often prioritizes HA responses, potentially neglecting conserved NA epitopes. Previous studies successfully induced anti-NA antibodies using enhanced immunization strategies but struggled to target conformational epitopes crucial for neutralization38. Since most of the conserved B cell epitopes of NA depend on natural conformation, inducing antibodies towards these conformational epitopes remained a significant challenge.To address this challenge, we utilized circRNA technology to deliver membrane-bound NA as the immunogen. Antigens encoded by circRNA mimic the natural conformation in the natural infection, thereby preserving key epitopes. Considering the safety of the vaccine, we chose a clinically validated LNP formulation. In our study, SM102-based LNPs were effective in delivering circRNA, and the safety profile is crucial for facilitating future clinical translation of the vaccine. A similar strategy has proven successful in mRNA vaccines, incorporating components such as HA stalk, NA, matrix-2 ion channel, and nucleoprotein in multivalent mRNA vaccines that induced protective effects against multi-strain influenza viruses20. Compared to mRNA, circRNA offer increased cellular stability due to their closed-loop structure24. This extended antigen presence could enhance B cell maturation and production of high affinity antibodies. These results confirm robust NA-specific antibody responses in mice receiving monovalent and trivalent circRNA vaccines (Figs. 2, 4).Following booster immunization in this study, the vaccine induced a robust NA-reactive antibody response, as evidenced by high NAI antibody titers exceeding 1000 (Fig. 4f–h). These results suggest that boost immunization may be necessary to generate sufficient antibodies against enzyme-active sites. Unlike mice with a naive immune background, the population has preexisting low levels of NA-reactive antibodies39. This suggests the potential of utilizing this immune memory to enhance a robust immune response through an appropriate vaccination strategy. Future experiments should systematically evaluate how circRNA vaccines induce immune responses in mice previously exposed to influenza. A single dose of circRNA vaccine has the potential to reactivate NA-specific immune memory, but further experimental validation of this hypothesis is crucial.CircRNA vaccine induced NAI antibodies against BCOL17, which is genetically closely related to the vaccine strain (Fig. S1) and can inhibit virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Although cross-reactive antibodies within the same subtype were induced, no cross-reactive between subtypes was observed, consistent with previous findings on NA-specific responses40. This highlights the ongoing challenge of eliciting broad-spectrum immunity against heterologous NA strains. Future strategies may involve incorporating more NA subtypes or designing immunogens focused on highly conserved enzyme active sites.NA vaccines can still confer protection even when neutralization is limited20. Beyond humoral immunity, this study also revealed a robust T cell response induced by the circRNA vaccines. However, the CD8+ T cell response to SL32 N2 was less robust than that of N1 and BV (Fig. 3f). IFN-γ levels were higher than IL-4, indicating a Th1-biased immune response (Fig. 3a–e). This is further supported by the increased IgG2a: IgG1 ratio in vaccinated mice (Fig. S4). Th1-biased response with higher IgG2a level was known to be beneficial for clearing virus infections and reducing the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)41,42,43,44. While the role of NA-specific T cells has been relatively underexplored in previous studies, recent research on mRNA vaccines has highlighted their potential importance20. Similar cross-protection against heterologous strains such as GZ89, PR8, and HK68 was observed in this study. Although the trivalent circRNA vaccine sera did not neutralize these strains (Fig. S5), vaccinated mice exhibited complete survival upon challenge. Furthermore, Fc-mediated effector responses, such as ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), may also contribute to vaccine protection45,46. The limitation of this study was the need to characterize these effects further. NA, as a membrane protein, simultaneously stimulates T cell response, NAI antibodies, and Fc-mediated effector functions such as ADCC, CDC, and ADCP are likely to play a more comprehensive protective role, offering broad protection against a wide range of strains.The trivalent vaccines provided protection to mice with a single dose (Fig. 6). Given that a multi-dose immunization process may decrease public acceptance, this suggests that a prime-only approach can serve as an alternative vaccination regimen. Furthermore, the vaccine exhibited protection against Yamagata lineage viruses even in the absence of specific Yamagata lineage antigens (Fig. S3c). Sequence analyses between the vaccine’s N2 antigen and prevalent N2 strains suggest that the trivalent circRNA vaccine could be effective against contemporary H3N2 strains due to their closer antigenic resemblance compared to the GZ89 and HK68 strains (Fig. S6). These findings highlight the potential of this vaccine as a promising candidate for the seasonal influenza vaccines.In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering combined NA immunogens through circRNA technology to achieve broad-spectrum protection. The trivalent circRNA vaccine effectively protected mice against diverse H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses. This protection likely involves a combination of NAI, Fc-mediated effector functions, and NA-specific T cell responses. These findings reinforce the potential of circRNA as a promising platform for influenza vaccines and highlight the importance of NA in developing universal vaccines. By building upon this work, circRNA can demonstrate its potential as a platform for broad-spectrum vaccines.MethodsCellsThe human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells, and Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The HEK293T and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco, U.S.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, U.S.) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, U.S.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The Sf9 cells were cultured in SF-SFM medium (Suzhou world-medium Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, U.S.), at 27 °C in the dark, using a cell shaker setting at 110 rpm.Virus and recombinant NA proteinAll influenza viruses were grown in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. Influenza A virus was cultured at 37 °C for 48 h, while influenza B virus was cultured at 33 °C for 72 h. Then the eggs were chilled at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the allantoic fluid was harvested, filtered, and centrifuged at the speed of 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Finally, the virus was stored at −80 °C. Virus titer was determined by TCID50 assay. To prepare the virus for the challenge experiment, the collected allantoic fluid was ultracentrifuged on an Optima XPN-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman, U.S.) at the speed of 130,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h to precipitate the virus. The virus pellet was resuspended in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further purified by passing through a 30% sucrose cushion. The purified virus was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.All recombinant NAs were expressed in the Sf9 cells, as described in the previous study47. Recombinant NAs were purified by Ni+ Sepharose high-performance chromatography.CircRNA design and synthesisCircRNA was generated using the PIE splicing strategy23. Linear precursor RNAs were transcribed from linearized plasmid templates using T7 RNA polymerase (Thermo, U.S.). After treatment with DNase I (New England Biolabs, USA), RNAs were purified using an RNA purification kit (Magen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China). For the RNA cyclization reaction, purified RNA was first heated to 70 °C for 5 min and immediately placed on ice. The reaction solution was added, containing a final concentration of 2 mM Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. The RNA cyclization reaction was performed at 55 °C for 8 min, then RNase R (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to the reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to remove uncirculated RNA. CircRNA was finally column purified using the RNA purification kit (Magen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China) and stored at −80 °C. According to the previous study23, the quality and integrity of circRNAs were assessed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis at 160 V for 30 min.LNP encapsulated circRNALNPs were generated by rapidly mixing the organic and aqueous phases (1:3, v/v) through the iNanoE microfluidic system (Micro & Nano (Shanghai) Biologics Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) at a total flow rate of 12 mL/min. The organic phase was formed by mixing SM102, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and DMG-PEG2000 (AVT (Shanghai) Pharmaceutical Tech Co., Ltd) in ethanol with a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5. The circRNA was dissolved in 50 mM citric acid buffer (pH = 4). The N/P ratio of ionizable lipids and circRNA was 4:1. The formed LNPs were diluted 40-fold in PBS and concentrated using a 100 kDa ultrafiltration tube (Millipore, U.S.). The encapsulation efficiency of LNP was determined following the method described previously48. To characterize particle size and PDI, LNPs were added to the cuvette after 40-fold dilution by PBS, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed using Zetasizer Pro (Malvern Panalytical, England), with three replicates of measurements for each sample, and PBS as a negative sample control.CircRNA-LNP transfection and flow cytometric analysesBefore transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 6 × 105. The following day, 500 ng of each LNP encapsulated circRNA was diluted in DMEM and added to cells. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and washed with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Fraction V in 1 × PBS. Then cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL anti-NA antibodies: 1G01, 229-2C06, or CC61 for 20 min on ice. After that, cells were washed twice with 1% BSA PBS and incubated with 1: 2000 dilution of rabbit anti-human IgG(H + L) FITC (Southern Biotech, U.S.) for 20 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed twice and resuspended. Flow cytometric data were acquired on CytoFLEX S flow cytometer (Beckman, U.S.). Approximately 50,000 events were collected per sample.MUNANA assayLNP transfected cells were diluted at the density 1 × 106 in MUNANA buffer (33.3 mM MES, 4 mM CaCl2, pH 6.5). The cells were two-fold serially diluted using MUNANA buffer in a black 96-well plate to make a 50 μL final volume. Then, 50 μL of 300 μΜ of MUNANA substrate was added. After incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, 100 μL of stop solution (138.6 mM NaOH in absolute ethanol) was added. The plate was read using a SYNERGY H1 (BioTek, US) multimode microplate reader with 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission.Vaccination and virus challenge6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were intramuscularly injected with 100 μL circRNA vaccine diluted in PBS. Trivalent circRNA vaccines were formulated with equal amounts of three NA circRNA vaccines. Boost vaccination was performed 28 days after prime vaccination. Twenty-eight days after boost vaccination, mice were anesthetized with avertin (250 mg/kg) and intranasally infected with 5 × LD50 influenza virus in 30 μL PBS. The body weight was monitored for 14 days after infections, and mice that lost over 25% of their initial weight were humanely euthanized. The weighing order was randomly assigned each day, and each group of mice was weighed in a different order each day. The animals were grouped and manipulated by different individuals. The experimental operators were unaware of the specific grouping. All mice were kept in a SPF environment, and all virus challenge experiments were performed in an animal biosafety level 2 laboratory.For the euthanasia of mice, animals were initially anesthetized with Avertin (250 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Subsequently, euthanasia was carried out by cervical dislocation after confirming their lack of responsiveness to pain and stimuli (deep anesthesia). Euthanasia was carried out following the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines.ELISAThe 96-well ELISA plates were coated with recombinant NA proteins (50 μL, 200 ng/well) or trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV, Southern hemisphere, 2022-2023) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The following day, the plates were blocked with 150 μL 3% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. The sera were serially diluted 3-fold, starting with a 1:300 dilution (or 1:100 in the prime group for Fig. 6), and then added to the plates. The plates were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following washing with PBST (PBS added with 0.05% TWEEN 20), 75 μL of 1: 4000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG/IgG1/IgG2a secondary antibody (Southern Biotech, U.S.) was added to plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The readout was developed using 2,2’-Azino-bis (3-Ethylbenzthiazoline-6-Sulfonic Acid, ABTS) ELISA substrate (sigma, U.S.). After 20 min of incubation, absorbance was measured at 405 nm on a Spectramax ABS Plus (Molecular Devices, U.S.) microplate reader. Endpoint titers were defined as the dilution fold with OD value exceeding 2 × background (without sera, but the secondary antibody was added). Monoclonal antibody 1G0110 was used as positive control.Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA)The 96-well ELISA plates were pre-coated with 100 μL of fetuin (Sigma, U.S.) at 25 μg/mL in PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h, then the plates were washed three times with PBST. Heat-inactivated sera were 2-fold serially diluted starting with a 1:50 dilution (in some groups were 1:100) in DPBS-T-BSA buffer (Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.133 g/L CaCl2 and 0.1 g/L MgCl2 with 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA) and mixed with an equal volume of virus or NA recombinant proteins. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then transferred to the fetuin-coated plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h and washed six times with PBST subsequently. Then 100 μL/well of HRP-conjugated peanut agglutinin lectin (Sigma, U.S.) in PBS was added to the plates and left in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. After adding the ABTS ELISA substrate and 15 min of incubation, the absorbance of the samples was read at 405 nm on a Spectramax ABS Plus (Molecular Devices, U.S.) microplate reader. The samples that did not reach 50% inhibition at the initial sera dilution were considered negative.Microneutralization assayFor the microneutralization assay, sera were treated with the receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and then inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Sera were then diluted 2-fold serially starting at 1:10 dilutions in infection media (DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acid, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution). Next, 60 μL of diluted sera were mixed with 60 μL of 100 × TCID50 virus and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then the virus-sera mixtures were transferred to the PBS-washed MDCK cells and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. After washing with PBS twice, 100 μL of infection medium with the same sera dilution was added to the cells. Following incubation at 37 °C for 48 h (for influenza A virus) or 33 °C for 72 h (for influenza B virus). Virus replication was detected using a hemagglutination assay. Briefly, 50 μL of cell supernatant was transferred into a 96-well V-bottom plate, followed by the addition of 25 μL of 1% chicken red blood cells (RBCs). After incubating at room temperature for 15 mins, the presence of virus was determined by observing hemagglutination of the RBCs. The neutralization titer of sera was determined as the highest dilution at which no virus was detected.ELISPOT assayThe day before assay, 1:100 anti-mouse IFN-γ or IL-4 antibody (U-Cytech, Netherland) was added to ELISpot plate (Millipore, U.S.) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The Next day, plates were blocked with 10% FBS in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 1 h. Next 4 × 105 Splenocytes were added to the ELISPOT plate and stimulated by 10 μg/mL recombinant NA protein at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 40 h. The plates were washed with PBST 6 times and incubated with 1:100 biotinylated antibody for 2 h at RT. After washing, the plates were incubated with 1:500 Streptavidin-HRP for 1 h at RT. Finally, the plates were incubated with 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-phosphateitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT, Beyotime, China) substrate solution for 5 min, and scanned using Mabtech IRIS FluoroSpot/ELISpot reader (Mabtech, Sweden).Intracellular cytokine staining assayThe splenocytes were isolated and plated at a density of 4 × 106 per well in a round-bottom 96-well plate and stimulated with 10 μg/mL recombinant NA protein at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 6 h. Brefeldin A was then added to each sample and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and stained with LIVE/DEAD cell staining solution (Biolegend, U.S.) for 30 min in the dark. After washing with FASC buffer (PBS added 2% FBS), cells were then incubated with Fc Blocker (Biolegend, #101319, U.S.) for 5 min in dark and then surface-stained with the following antibodies: anti-CD3-Pacific Blue™ (Biolegend, #100214, U.S.); anti-CD4-FITC (Biolegend, #100509, U.S.); anti-CD8α-Brilliant Violet 605 (Biolegend, #100744, U.S.). After fixation with a fixation/permeabilization solution (Beyotime, China), cells were intracellularly stained with the following antibodies: anti-IFN-γ-APC (Biolegend, #505810, U.S.); anti-TNF-α-Brilliant Violet 785™ (Biolegend, #506341, U.S.); anti-IL-2-PE-Cyanine7 (Biolegend, #503832, U.S.) for 30 min in dark. Finally, cells were washed twice using permeabilization buffer and suspended in FASC buffer. Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting were performed on CytoFLEX S Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, U.S.). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software V_10.Virus plaque assay and TCID50 assayMice were sacrificed and lungs were homogenized in 10% (w/v) DMEM at 4 dpi. The lung homogenate was diluted in a 1:10 series and inoculated into a 6-well plate containing a single layer of MDCK cells. After 1 h of incubation, the plates were washed twice with PBS and 2 mL overlay (2 × DMEM, 1 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acid, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 0.8% low melting agar) was added. After 72 h of culture, the agar overlays were removed, and the cells were fixed and stained with a crystal violet solution.To determine the TCID50, the lung homogenate was 3-fold serially diluted in DMEM starting at 1:10. MDCK monolayers in 96-well plates were washed twice with PBS before adding 100 μL of the diluted lung homogenate. After incubating at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h, cells were washed with PBS, followed by adding 100 μL of infection media. Influenza A virus-infected cells were further cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h, while influenza B virus-infected cells were incubated at 33 °C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. Hemagglutination assay was performed as described in 10. TCID50 was calculated using the Reed-Muench method.Phylogenetic tree analysisAll NA sequences involved in this study were downloaded from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). NA phylogenetic tree was generated by MAGAX using the Maximum Likelihood method.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using the Prism 9.0 software (GraphPad, U.S.). All errors are expressed as means with standard derivation (±SD). In Figs. 2 and 4, one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison tests was employed to compare antibody titers among different groups within the prime or boost immunization phases. Unpaired Student’s t tests were used to compare antibody titers between prime and boost sera within the same dosage group of mice. Unpaired Student’s t test analysis was performed to determine p values in T cell responses. Group data were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05, and*, **, ***, ****, and ns in results represent p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.0001, and not significant, respectively.

Everyone 6 months and older in the United States, with rare exception, should get a flu vaccine every season. Flu vaccination has been shown to have many benefits including reducing the risk of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and even the risk of flu-related death. All flu vaccines in the United States will be trivalent (three component) vaccines beginning with the 2024-2025 season. For people 65 years and older, there are three flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended. Why people should be vaccinated Influenza (flu) is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Every flu season is different, and flu can affect people differently, but during typical flu seasons, millions of people get flu, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized and thousands to tens of thousands of people die from flu-related causes. Flu can mean a few days of feeling bad and missing work, school, or family events, or it can result in more serious illness. Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. An annual seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to help reduce the risk of getting flu and any of its potentially serious complications. Vaccination has been shown to have many benefits including reducing the risk of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and even the risk of flu-related death. While some people who get a flu vaccine may still get sick with influenza, flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness. How flu vaccines work Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against flu illness. Seasonal flu vaccines are designed to protect against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. Beginning again in 2024-2025, all flu vaccines in the United States will be "trivalent" vaccines, which means they protect against three different influenza viruses: an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus, and an influenza B/Victoria virus. Flu vaccine options All flu vaccines for the 2024-2025 season will be trivalent vaccines, designed to protect against three different influenza viruses, including two influenza A viruses and an influenza B/Victoria virus. Different vaccines are licensed for use in different age groups, and some vaccines are not recommended for some groups of people. For people younger than 65 years For people younger than 65 years, CDC does not preferentially recommend any licensed, age-appropriate influenza (flu) vaccine over another. Options for this age group include inactivated influenza vaccines [IIVs], recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV], or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), with no preference for any flu vaccine over another. Everyone should get an age-appropriate vaccine (that is, one that is approved for their age), with the exception that people 18 through 64 years old who have had a solid organ transplant and are taking immunosuppressive medications may receive high-dose (HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted inactivated (aIIV3) influenza vaccines as acceptable options (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s and RIV3). For people 65 years and older For people 65 years and older, there are three flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended over standard-dose, unadjuvanted flu vaccines. These are Fluzone High-Dose flu vaccine, Flublok Recombinant flu vaccine and Fluad Adjuvanted flu vaccine. More information is available at Flu & People 65 Years and Older. This recommendation was based on a review of available studies which suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There is no preferential recommendation for people younger than 65 years. If none of the three influenza vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group should get any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine instead. Available influenza vaccines include: Standard-dose influenza shots that are manufactured using virus grown in eggs. Several different brands of standard dose influenza shots are available, including Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, and Fluzone. These vaccines are approved for use in children as young as 6 months. Most influenza shots are given in the arm (muscle) with a needle. hots are given in the arm or thigh (muscle) with a needle. Afluria can be given either with a needle (for people 6 months and older) or with a jet injector (for people 18 through 64 years only). A cell-based influenza shot (Flucelvax) containing virus grown in cell culture, which is approved for people 6 months and older. This vaccine is completely egg-free. A recombinant influenza shot (Flublok) which is a completely egg-free influenza shot that is made using recombinant technology and is approved for use in people 18 years and older. This shot is made without influenza viruses and contains three times the antigen (the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against influenza viruses) than other standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines, to help create a stronger immune response. An egg-based high dose influenza shot (Fluzone High-Dose), which is approved for use in people 65 years and older. This vaccine contains four times the antigen (the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against influenza viruses) than other standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines, to help create a stronger immune response. An egg-based adjuvanted influenza shot (Fluad), which is approved for people 65 years and older. This vaccine is made with an adjuvant (an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response). An egg-based live attenuated influenza nasal spray vaccine (FluMist made with attenuated (weakened) live influenza viruses, which is approved for use in people 2 years through 49 years. This vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnant people, immunocompromised people, or people with certain medical conditions. Who should be vaccinated Everyone 6 months and older in the United States, with rare exception, should get a flu vaccine every season. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has made this "universal" recommendation since the 2010-2011 influenza season. Vaccination to prevent influenza and its potentially serious complications is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious influenza complications. A full list of age and health factors that are associated with increased risk is available at People at Higher Risk of Developing Flu-Related Complications. Keep Reading: Who Needs a Flu VaccineWho should not be vaccinated Different influenza vaccines are approved for use in people in different age groups. In addition, some vaccines are not recommended for certain groups of people. Factors that can determine a person's suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person's age, health (current and past) and any allergies to influenza vaccine or its components. Keep Reading: Who Needs a Flu VaccineWhen people should get vaccinated For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups of people include: Most adults, especially those 65 years and older, and pregnant people in the first or second trimester should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time. However, early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated. Some children need two doses of influenza vaccine. For those children it is recommended to get the first dose as soon as vaccine is available, because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months, because this can help protect their infants for the first few months after birth (when they are too young to be vaccinated). Where to get a flu vaccine Flu vaccines are offered in many doctor's offices and clinics. Even if you don't have a regular doctor or nurse, you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, college health center, and even in some schools and workplaces. Why you need flu vaccine every year A flu vaccine is needed every year for two reasons. First, a person's immune protection from vaccination declines over time, so an annual flu vaccine is needed for optimal protection. Second, because influenza viruses are constantly changing, the composition of flu vaccines is reviewed annually, and vaccines are updated to protect against the viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming flu season. For the best protection, everyone 6 months and older should get vaccinated annually. Protection after vaccination It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against influenza virus infection. That's why it's best to get vaccinated before influenza viruses start to spread in your community. Keep Reading: 2024-2025 Flu Vaccine Supply Vaccine effectiveness Influenza (flu) vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary. The protection provided by a flu vaccine varies from season to season and depends in part on the age and health status of the person getting the vaccine and the similarity or "match" between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation. During years when the flu vaccine match is good, it is possible to measure substantial benefits from flu vaccination in terms of preventing flu illness and complications. However, the benefits of flu vaccination will still vary, depending on characteristics of the person being vaccinated (for example, their health and age), what influenza viruses are circulating that season and, potentially, which type of flu vaccine was used. If you got vaccinated and still get sick It's possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated (although you won't know for sure unless you get a flu test). This is possible for the following reasons: You may be exposed to an influenza virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated. This exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you. (Antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination.) You may be exposed to an influenza virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine. There are many different influenza viruses that circulate every year. A flu vaccine is made to protect against the three influenza viruses that research suggests will be most common. Unfortunately, some people can become infected with an influenza virus that the vaccine is designed to protect against, despite getting vaccinated. Protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely, based in part on the age and health of the person getting vaccinated. In general, flu vaccines work best among healthy younger adults and older children. Some older people and some people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination. Flu vaccination is not a perfect tool, but it is the best way to protect against flu virus infection. A flu vaccine can still provide protection even if you do get sick Some people who get vaccinated may still get sick with flu. However, flu vaccination has been shown in studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. A 2021 study showed that among adults, flu vaccination was associated with a 26% lower risk of ICU admission and a 31% lower risk of death from flu compared with those who were unvaccinated. A 2017 study showed that flu vaccination reduced deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and overall duration of hospitalization among hospitalized adults with flu Vaccine Benefits‎ There are many reasons to get an influenza (flu) vaccine each year. Benefits of the Flu Vaccine Vaccine match When there is a "good match" between viruses in the vaccine and circulating influenza viruses A "good match" is said to occur when the flu vaccine viruses used to produce flu vaccine and the viruses circulating among people during a given flu season are "like" one another such that the antibodies induced by vaccination protect against infection caused by circulating viruses. About seasons when there is a less than optimal match Influenza viruses are constantly changing (called "antigenic drift") – they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season. Experts must pick which viruses to include in the vaccine many months in advance in order for vaccine to be produced and delivered on time. (More information is available: Selecting the Viruses in the Influenza (Flu) Vaccine.) Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating viruses and the viruses used to produce vaccine. The production process for some seasonal vaccines also may impact how well vaccine works against certain viruses, especially influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Growth in eggs is part of the production process for many seasonal flu vaccines. While all influenza viruses undergo changes when they are grown in eggs, changes in influenza A(H3N2) viruses are more likely to result in antigenic changes compared with changes in other influenza viruses. These so-called "egg-adapted changes" are present in most of the vaccine viruses recommended for use in egg-based vaccine production and may reduce their effectiveness against circulating influenza viruses. Advances in vaccine production technologies (for example, cell-based and recombinant technology) and advanced molecular techniques are being explored as ways to improve flu vaccine effectiveness. Learn more by visiting, Advancements in Influenza Vaccines. When circulating influenza viruses are different from viruses used in the flu vaccine During seasons when one or more of the circulating viruses are different or "drifted" from the vaccine viruses, vaccine effectiveness can be reduced. It's important to remember that flu vaccine protects against three different influenza viruses and multiple different viruses usually circulate during any one season. Even if the effectiveness of the vaccine is reduced against one virus, vaccination can still be effective at preventing flu illness caused by the other circulating viruses. For these reasons, CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older even if vaccine effectiveness against one or more viruses is reduced. This season's vaccine "match" It's not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be like circulating influenza viruses because flu viruses are constantly changing. A flu vaccine is made to protect against the influenza viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the upcoming season. Over the course of the flu season, CDC studies samples of circulating influenza viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating influenza viruses. More information about the 2024-2025 flu season and recommended vaccines is available. Vaccine side effects (what to expect) A flu vaccine cannot cause flu Flu vaccines that are given with a needle (flu shots) are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) influenza vaccine viruses that have been killed (inactivated) and are therefore not infectious, or b) with proteins from an influenza virus (which is the case for recombinant influenza vaccine). Nasal spray vaccine is made with weakened (attenuated) live influenza viruses and also cannot cause flu illness. The weakened viruses are cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only reproduce at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot reproduce in the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist. Side effects after getting a flu vaccine While a flu vaccine cannot give you flu illness, there are different side effects that may be associated with getting a flu shot or a nasal spray flu vaccine. These side effects are usually mild and short-lasting, especially when compared to symptoms of flu. A flu shot: The viruses in a flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that may occur are: Soreness, redness, and/or swelling where the shot was given Headache Fever Muscle aches Nausea Fatigue The nasal spray: The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause flu illness. In children, side effects from the nasal spray may include: Runny nose Wheezing Headache Vomiting Muscle aches Fever (low grade) In adults, side effects from the nasal spray vaccine may include: Runny nose Headache Sore throat Cough If these problems occur, they begin soon after vaccination and usually are mild and short-lived. A flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting. Serious Side Effects There may be a small increased risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), which is a rare neurological disorder after a flu vaccine. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. People who think that they have been injured by a flu vaccine should contact their healthcare provider and seek medical care; they can also file a report with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Travelers in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be exposed to flu during months that fall outside of those listed above, especially when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include people from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating. Overview In the Northern Hemisphere, the influenza (flu) season can begin as early as October and can last as late as April or May. In the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, flu activity typically occurs during April – September. In the tropics, flu activity occurs throughout the year. Travelers in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be exposed to flu when traveling in areas where flu activity is occurring. CDC Recommends...‎ Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine yearly, preferably in the fall before the U.S. flu season begins. People who have not gotten a flu vaccine People who have not gotten a flu vaccine for the current season and are traveling to parts of the world where flu activity is ongoing should get a flu vaccine to protect themselves during their trip. This is particularly important for people at higher risk of flu-related complications. The flu vaccine used in the Northern Hemisphere can be different from the one used in the Southern Hemisphere. But the Northern Hemisphere vaccine can provide some protection against the main viruses that are circulating in other parts of the world. Keep Reading: People at Increased Risk for Flu Complications People should get vaccinated People should get vaccinated at least 2 weeks before travel because it takes time about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body that provide protection against flu illness. No information is available about the benefits of getting revaccinated before summer travel for those people who already were vaccinated during the preceding fall, so revaccination is not recommended. Keep in mind that flu vaccine manufactured for the upcoming or current season usually expires the following June. After June, flu vaccines are usually not available in the United States until flu vaccine for the next season is produced and made available in the late summer and fall. Also, even if you receive the previous season's vaccine before travel during the summer months, you should still receive a new flu vaccine that coming fall or winter. More Information for Travelers If you are sick with flu-like symptoms, do not travel. Stay home and away from others. You can go back to your normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, both are true: Your symptoms are getting better overall, and You have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication).* After these two criteria are met, there are some additional precautions that can be taken to protect others from respiratory illness.

CDC Yellow Book 2024 During and After Your Trip During your trip, follow local guidelines and practice healthy habits. Avoid close contact with sick people. Wash your hands often with soap and running water, especially after coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and put the used tissue in the trash. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands. Sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands. Wearing a mask is an additional prevention strategy that you can choose to further protect yourself and others. What to do if you feel sick Most people with flu will recover without needing medical care. However, if you have severe illness or are at increased risk of getting serious flu complications, seek medical care.

Overview Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people who are allergic to eggs beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of allergic reactions are available. Most flu shots and the nasal spray flu vaccine are manufactured using egg-based technology. Because of this, they contain a small amount of egg proteins, such as ovalbumin. However, studies that have examined the use of both the nasal spray vaccine and flu shots in egg-allergic and non-egg-allergic patients indicate that severe allergic reactions in people with egg allergies are unlikely. Although people who are allergic to eggs should receive flu vaccine, people with some other allergies should not. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to other components that are in a flu vaccine should not receive vaccines that contain that component. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past should generally not receive flu vaccine again, but might be able to get certain flu vaccines, depending on which one caused the allergic reaction. It is important to discuss allergies that you have with your health care provider. Common effects Severe allergic reactions (such as anaphylaxis) to vaccines are rare. In a Vaccine Safety Datalink study of more than 25.1 million doses of various vaccines given to children and adults, the rate of anaphylaxis was 1.31 per 1 million doses for all vaccines, and 1.35 per million doses for seasonal flu vaccines. Although severe allergic reactions to vaccines are rare, they sometimes occur in people who don't have any known allergies. For this reason, it is recommended that all vaccines are given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and managed quickly. Get the facts Most flu vaccines today are produced using an egg-based manufacturing process and thus contain a small amount of egg protein called ovalbumin. Recommendations Everyone 6 months and older with egg allergy should receive an annual flu vaccine. Any flu vaccine (egg based or non-egg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient's age and health status can be used. Egg allergy does not indicate additional safety measures for flu vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. Severe and life-threatening reactions to vaccines are rare but can occur with any vaccine and in any vaccine recipient, regardless of allergy history. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available.

CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each year. If your child is younger than 5 years old and has the flu or suspected flu symptoms, call your doctor right away. They may prescribe flu antiviral drugs. Overview Children younger than 5 years old, and especially those younger than 2 years, are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications. CDC estimates that from the 2010-2011 season to the 2022-2023 season (excluding 2020-2021), flu-related hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old each flu season have ranged from 6,000 to 25,000 annually in the United States. Many more sick children have to go to a doctor, an urgent care center, or the emergency room because of flu. Complications from flu among children can include the following: Pneumonia (an illness where the lungs get infected and inflamed), Dehydration (when a child's body loses too much water and salts, often because fluid losses are greater than fluid intake), Worsening of long-term medical problems like heart disease or asthma, Brain dysfunction, Sinus problems, and Ear infections. In rare cases, flu complications can lead to death. Flu vaccination can be life-saving in children‎ To reduce the risk of flu and its potentially serious complications, CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine. Getting a seasonal flu vaccine is especially important for young children because they are at increased risk of getting severe illness from flu. Children 6 months to younger than 9 years old who have not previously received at least 2 doses of flu vaccine need 2 doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart.Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization and even death in children. A 2017 CDC study was the first of its kind to show that flu vaccination significantly reduced a child's risk of dying from flu. Benefits of the Flu Vaccine Children younger than 6 months old are at highest risk of hospitalization Children younger than 6 months old have the highest risk for being hospitalized from flu compared to children of other ages but are too young to get a flu vaccine. Because flu vaccines are not approved for use in children younger than 6 months old, protecting them from flu is especially important. Advice on how to fight flu for caregivers of children younger than 5 years old 1. Take time to get a vaccine A yearly flu vaccine is the first and best way to protect against flu. Flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death in children. If the child you care for is 6 months or older, they should get a flu vaccine each year. If your child is 6 months to younger than 9 years old and has not previously received at least 2 doses of flu vaccine, your child needs 2 doses of flu vaccine given at least 4 weeks apart. Your child then needs only one dose of flu vaccine each year after. As a caregiver to a young child, you should get a flu vaccine each year, and make sure that other caregivers and all household members aged 6 months and older also get vaccinated each year. By getting vaccinated, you will be less likely to get flu and therefore less likely to spread flu to the child. 2. Take everyday preventive actions Keep yourself and the child in your care away from people who are sick as much as you can. If you get flu symptoms, avoid contact with other people when possible, including the child in your care. Consider arranging for another caregiver to care for the child if possible, so that you don't make them sick.

Take antiviral drugs to treat flu illness if your doctor prescribes them Antiviral drugs are available to treat flu in children and adults. CDC recommends that people at higher risk of serious flu complications, including young children, should be treated with flu antiviral drugs as soon as possible if they get sick with flu. Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk for complications from flu, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months old.

Sept. 16, 2022 Advice if you are sick with flu and care for children younger than 5 years old Flu may cause fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Young children also may have vomiting or diarrhea with flu symptoms. It's important to note that some people with flu may not have a fever. If you live with or care for a young child and you get flu symptoms, follow the precautions below to help prevent the spread of illness to the child or children in your care. 1. Remember how flu spreads Flu viruses are thought to spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. People with flu can spread it to others nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching his or her own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. Keep Reading: How Flu Spreads2. Follow these steps Call your health care professional if you develop flu symptoms; they may order flu testing and/or prescribe antiviral treatment for flu, depending on factors including your age and overall health and the age and overall health of your young child or children. Try to minimize contact with the child in your care as much as possible when you have flu symptoms, especially if the child in your care is younger than 2 years old or is an older child with a chronic medical condition. They are very vulnerable to flu. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing, and put your used tissue in a wastebasket, and wash your hands. The use of a face mask is an additional strategy that can be used to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Before engaging in any activity near the child in your care (including feeding, changing, rocking, reading to your child) thoroughly wash and dry your hands. Read more information about preventing the spread of seasonal flu. Cleaning frequently touched surfaces—such as countertops, handrails, and doorknobs—regularly can help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. You can improve air quality by increasing airflow, cleaning the air, or opting to gather outdoors. This can help reduce the amount of virus you are exposed to. Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of Flu3. Be watchful to see if your child gets sick too Observe the child or children in your care closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness. If your child develops a feverA (or feels feverish with chills), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headache, fatigue, or vomiting and/or diarrhea, contact your child's health care provider. Your child's health care provider may want to evaluate your child and may order flu testing. Flu antiviral drugs can be used to treat flu and are approved for use in children. These drugs are most beneficial when antiviral treatment is started as soon as possible after the illness starts, so it's important to contact your child's health care provider as soon as they have flu symptoms. If your child shows any Emergency Warning Signs of flu, seek medical care immediately.

Due to this risk, it is especially important that PWH get a flu shot each year. If you have HIV and get sick with flu symptoms, call your doctor right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with HIV who have flu or suspected flu. Populations at increased risk People living with HIV (PWH) are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, especially those who have a very low CD4 cell count (very suppressed immune system) or who are not taking medicine to treat HIV (called antiretroviral therapy, or ART). Of all PWH in the United States from 2018–19, 81% were prescribed ART, leaving nearly 20% potentially at increased risk for flu complications. Studies have indicated that flu symptoms might be prolonged and the risk of flu-related complications and prolonged influenza virus shedding is higher for certain people living with HIV. Because they are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications, it is especially important that PWH get a flu shot annually. PWH who are not receiving ART might not have as strong an immune response to vaccination as those who are receiving ART. PWH who get flu symptoms, especially those with low CD4 cell counts not receiving ART, should be treated with influenza antiviral drugs right away. About HIV‎ Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV attacks cells in the body's immune system called CD4 cells. If untreated, it gradually destroys the body's ability to fight infection and certain cancers. CDC estimates that nearly 1.2 million people in the United States 13 years and older were living with HIV at the end of 2019, the most recent year of available data. Prevention A flu shot is the best protection against flu If you have HIV, you are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, in addition to taking ART, the best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu shot. Several randomized studies in adults living with HIV have shown that flu vaccination can reduce the risk of flu illness. Studies in the United States have shown that flu vaccination prevents illness and reduces the need for doctor's visits among PWH and other conditions resulting in immune suppression. People living with HIV should get a flu shot (not the nasal spray flu vaccine) every year. Injectable flu vaccines (or flu shots) are recommended for use in PWH and other health conditions. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV] (nasal spray) vaccine should not be used in people with HIV and AIDS. LAIV (FluMist®) contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and is not recommended for use in people with weakened immune systems (immunosuppression). Note: While PWH may still mount an immune response to flu vaccination, people with advanced HIV disease may not respond as well. Doctors may consider using influenza antiviral drugs for prevention in some cases. Make a statement this flu season. Pneumococcal vaccination is also important Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. PWH should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. You can get either Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (but not both) when you get a flu vaccine. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Keep Reading: Pneumococcal VaccinationOther preventive actions for people with living with HIV In addition to getting a flu shot every year, people living with HIV should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends of everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses.

These guidance updates can be found at: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Animals: Interim Recommendations for Prevention, Monitoring, and Public Health Investigations. Updates to this page are forthcoming. September 18, 2024 EspaÃ±ol Clinician Brief: Evaluating and Managing Patients Exposed to Animals or Persons Infected with Novel Influenza A Viruses of Public Health Concern What to know This document briefly summarizes important clinical information related to novel influenza A viruses of public health concern and CDC’s recommendations for patient evaluation, treatment, and testing. Background For complete guidance, go to: Interim Guidance for Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings When Caring for Confirmed Cases, Probable Cases, and Cases Under Investigation for Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease Interim Guidance on Specimen Collection and Testing for Patients with Suspected Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease or with the Potential to Cause Severe Disease in Humans Interim Guidance on the Use of Antiviral Medications for Treatment of Human Infections with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Human Disease Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus: Interim Recommendations for Prevention, Monitoring, and Public Health Investigations This page outlines CDC’s recommendations for preventing exposure to avian influenza viruses. Nov. 8, 2024 Novel influenza A viruses are influenza A viruses that have infected people but are antigenically and genetically different from seasonal influenza A viruses currently circulating among humans. Novel influenza A viruses are predominantly of swine or avian origin. Swine influenza A viruses circulate among pigs worldwide. Avian influenza A viruses circulate among wild birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds to cause disease referred to as avian influenza. Avian influenza A viruses may also infect other animals such as mammals, including dairy cattle, to cause a wide range of disease. Some novel influenza A viruses cause high morbidity and mortality in infected poultry, while others cause no illness or only mild disease in poultry. Some novel influenza A viruses have caused sporadic infections in humans resulting in mild to severe illness. These novel influenza A viruses are of public health concern because of their pandemic potential if a virus acquires the ability to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. People with exposure to poultry or wild birds or other animals infected with novel influenza A viruses or associated contaminated environments or materials may become infected with these viruses. Summary Recommendations Recommended actions for patients considered to have recent exposure to avian influenza A viruses or other novel influenza A viruses. If signs/symptoms compatible with novel influenza A virus infection and a history of exposures to animals or to a symptomatic confirmed or probable human case of novel influenza A virus infection are present: Isolate the patient and follow the infection control recommendations below. Initiate empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible. Notify the state or local health department. Using personal protective equipment, collect respiratory specimens from the patient to test for novel influenza A viruses at a public health laboratory (e.g., state health department virology laboratory). Consider testing for other potential causes of acute respiratory illness based upon the local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. If signs/symptoms and a history of exposures to animals or to a symptomatic confirmed or probable human case of novel influenza A virus infection compatible with novel influenza A virus infection are not present: Follow standard health care facility infection control practices/protocols. Investigate other potential causes of the patient's signs and symptoms. Contact state/local health department with any questions or concerns. Signs/symptoms of novel influenza A virus infection in humans may include: Uncomplicated upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms with or without fever, including influenza-like illness (ILI) [fever ≥100°F plus cough or sore throat] Fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater) or feeling feverish Cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue Eye redness (or conjunctivitis) Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. It is important to note that infection with influenza viruses, including novel influenza A viruses, does not always cause fever. Fever may not occur in infected persons of any age, particularly in persons aged 65 years and older or people with immunosuppression. The absence of fever should not supersede clinical judgment when evaluating a patient for illness compatible with novel influenza A virus infection. Infection prevention and control recommendations: Standard, contact and airborne precautions, including the use of eye protection, are recommended when evaluating patients for infection with novel influenza A viruses. If an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) is not available, isolate the patient in a private room. Health care personnel should wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when providing patient care. For more information on recommended infection prevention and control measures, please visit Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings for Patients with Novel Influenza A Viruses. Laboratory testing recommendations: If signs or symptoms consistent with infection with novel influenza A virus are present in a patient with recent exposure to infected birds or other animals, contaminated environments, or contaminated materials, or to a symptomatic person confirmed with novel influenza A virus infection, respiratory specimens should be collected for molecular testing (RT-PCR) for influenza A viruses, including novel influenza A viruses. For outpatients, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal swab and a nasal swab combined with an oropharyngeal swab (e.g., two swabs combined into one viral transport media vial) should be collected. The nasopharyngeal swab and the combined nasal-throat swabs should be tested separately. If the person has conjunctivitis (with or without respiratory symptoms), both a conjunctival swab and nasopharyngeal swab should be collected. Patients who are severely ill should have both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens (e.g., an endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in intubated patients or induced sputum) collected for influenza testing. For information on specimen collection, infection prevention and control recommendations when collecting specimens, and influenza diagnostic testing, please visit Specimen Collection and Testing for Patients with Novel Influenza A Viruses with Potential to Cause Severe Disease in Humans. Testing for novel influenza A viruses must be performed at public health laboratories (e.g., state health department virology laboratories) and CDC. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are not a reliable indicator of novel influenza A virus infection, and the results should not be used to guide infection control or antiviral treatment decisions. Both commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests and most available influenza molecular assays do not distinguish between infection with seasonal influenza A viruses and novel influenza A viruses. Testing for other potential causes of acute respiratory illness (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) should also be considered depending upon the local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses. Treatment recommendations: Initiation of antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir (twice daily x 5 days) is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with confirmed, probable, or suspected infection with a novel influenza A virus. Treatment should be initiated even if more than 48 hours have elapsed since illness onset and regardless of illness severity (outpatients or hospitalized patients). Antiviral treatment should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory test results. If molecular testing is negative for novel influenza A virus infection and other influenza viruses, but influenza virus infection is still suspected in a patient who is severely ill, antiviral treatment should be continued and additional respiratory specimens should be collected for repeat influenza testing.

Flu also may be harmful for the developing baby. Pregnant people should get a flu shot and not the nasal spray flu vaccine. Flu shots given during pregnancy help protect both the pregnant person and the baby from flu. Influenza vaccine can be given during any trimester of pregnancy. Early flu vaccination (i.e., during July and August) can be considered for persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available because this can provide protection for the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated. Pregnant people should get a flu shot Influenza is more likely to cause illness that results in hospitalization in pregnant people than in people of reproductive age who are not pregnant. Influenza also may be harmful for the developing baby. A common influenza sign, fever, has been associated in some studies with neural tube defects and other adverse outcomes for a developing baby. Getting vaccinated while pregnant also can help protect a baby from influenza after birth (because antibodies are passed to a developing baby during pregnancy). People who get an influenza vaccine while pregnant or breastfeeding also develop antibodies against influenza that they can share with their infants through their breast milk. A Flu Vaccine is the Best Protection Against Flu Getting an influenza (flu) vaccine is the first and most important step to protect against flu. Pregnant people should get a flu shot and not the nasal spray flu vaccine. Flu shots given during pregnancy help protect both the pregnant parent and the baby from flu. A 2013 study showed that during the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 flu seasons vaccination reduced the risk of flu-associated acute respiratory infection in pregnant people by up to one-half. These results are consistent with the general range of estimated flu vaccine effectiveness among adults 18-64 years. A 2018 study showed that getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant person's risk of being hospitalized with flu by an average of 40%. Pregnant people who get a flu vaccine also are helping to protect their babies from flu illness and flu related hospitalizations for the first several months after their birth, when they are too young to get vaccinated. Keep Reading: Benefits of flu vaccinationInfluenza vaccine can be given during any trimester of pregnancy. September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated each year. Earlier vaccination (e.g., in July or August) can be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months. Safety for pregnant people Flu shots have been given to millions of people over many years with an excellent safety record. There is a large body of scientific studies that supports the safety of flu vaccine in pregnant people and their babies, and CDC continues to gather data on this topic. Note‎ There is no recommendation that pregnant people or people with pre-existing medical conditions need to get special permission or written consent from their doctor or health care professional for influenza (flu) vaccination if they get vaccinated at a worksite clinic, pharmacy or other location outside of their physician's office. Pregnant people should not get nasal spray flu vaccine. Miscarriage Multiple studies have shown that people who have received flu shots during pregnancy have not had a higher risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). One of these studies was conducted using CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). The study covered three flu seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15) looking for any increased risk for miscarriage among pregnant people who had received a flu vaccine during their pregnancy. The study found no increased risk for miscarriage after flu vaccination during pregnancy. This study was conducted as a follow-up to a previous smaller study. The prior study examined data from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 flu seasons and identified an association between flu vaccination early in pregnancy and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), particularly among people who had received flu vaccine during the previous flu season. However, the smaller study had several limitations, including small sample size, which could have led to imprecise results. This study was the only analysis to show that association; no other studies had found an increased risk of miscarriage following flu vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and CDC recommend that pregnant people get a flu vaccine during any trimester of their pregnancy because flu poses a danger to pregnant people and a flu vaccine can prevent serious illness, including hospitalization, during pregnancy. Keep Reading: Addressing Concerns Pregnant People Might Have about Influenza Vaccine Safety Side Effects The most common side effects experienced by pregnant people are the same as those experienced by other people. They are generally mild and include: Soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot Headache Fever Muscle aches Nausea Fatigue If side effects occur, they usually begin soon after the shot is given and generally last for 1-2 days. A flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting. Rarely, flu shots can cause serious problems like severe allergic reactions. Anyone with a severe, life-threatening allergy to any of the vaccine ingredients should not get the shot. Who should not get a flu shot Anyone with a severe, life-threatening allergy to any of the ingredients or components of a particular vaccine (other than egg protein) should not get that vaccine. People who have had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine should generally not be vaccinated, depending upon what kind of influenza vaccine caused the allergic reaction. It is important to discuss allergies that you have (such as allergies to medications or vaccines and other allergies) with your health care provider. Keep Reading: Who Needs a Flu Vaccine Pregnant people with egg allergies Pregnant people with egg allergies of any severity may get any flu shot (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. The nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) should not be used during pregnancy. Previously, it was recommended that people with severe allergy to egg (those who have had any symptom other than hives with egg exposure) be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly. Keep Reading: Vaccines and People with Egg Allergies Monitoring safety of flu vaccines in pregnant people CDC and FDA conduct ongoing safety monitoring of vaccines licensed for use in the United States. CDC and FDA monitor flu vaccine safety during pregnancy during each flu season using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA monitor for health concerns (also termed "adverse events") following vaccination. Anyone can report adverse events after vaccination to VAERS. Generally, information from VAERS reports cannot determine if an adverse event after vaccination was caused by a vaccine, but these reports can help indicate if further investigations are needed. In addition, CDC conducts research studies in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): A collaboration between CDC and 13 health care organizations which monitors the safety of vaccines and conducts vaccine safety studies. CDC studies conducted on flu vaccine during pregnancy Several studies conducted by CDC and partners support the safety of the flu vaccine for pregnant people and their babies. Review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS)12 found no evidence to suggest a link between pregnancy complications or adverse fetal outcomes among pregnant women and flu shots. A large study using VSD data from three flu seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15) found no increased risk for spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) after flu vaccination during pregnancy. A similar study using VSD data 3from the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons also found no increased risk of miscarriage among pregnant people who received flu vaccines. One study of the 2010-2012 flu seasons, however, found that people in early pregnancy who received two consecutive annual flu vaccines had an increased risk of miscarriage in the 28 days after receiving the second vaccine. A limitation of this study was its small sample size which could have led to imprecise results. In response to the findings from the 2010-2012 flu season study, CDC provided funding for the larger follow-up VSD study conducted during the 2012-2015 flu seasons that included about three times as many people and found no association between flu vaccination and miscarriage. More information on this topic is available at Addressing Concerns Pregnant People Might Have about Influenza Vaccine Safety. A large study using VSD data4 found no increased risk for adverse pregnancy events (like chorioamnionitis, pre-eclampsia, or gestational hypertension) for pregnant people who received the flu vaccine from 2002 to 2009 when compared to pregnant people who were not vaccinated. A VSD study5compared pregnant people who received the flu shot with an equal number of pregnant people who did not receive the flu shot during the 2004-05 and 2008-09 flu seasons. The study found no differences between the two groups in the rates of premature delivery or small for gestational age infants. A large August 2017 study using VSD data found that the babies of people who received the flu shot during their first trimester had no increased risk of having children with major birth defects. A VSD study6 examined stillbirth rates in pregnant persons aged 14-49 years between 2007 and 2015 and did not find a significant association between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and stillbirth.

GBS can cause symptoms that usually last for a few weeks. Most people recover fully from GBS, but some people have long-term nerve damage. In some cases, people have died of GBS, usually from difficulty breathing. GBS occurs in about 1 to 2 out of every 100,000 people in the United States each year. Most cases are not associated with vaccines. Causes The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but about two-thirds of people who develop GBS experience symptoms several days or weeks after they have been sick with diarrhea or a respiratory illness. Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People also can develop GBS after having flu or other illnesses (such as infections with cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus). On very rare occasions, they may develop GBS in the days or weeks after getting certain vaccinations, such as Shingrix, Janssen COVID-19, and influenza in some seasons. There are associations being assessed or re-assessed for other vaccines. Keep Reading: Campylobacter jejuni Risk for developing GBS Anyone can develop GBS; however, it is more common among older adults. The incidence of GBS increases with age, and people older than 50 years are at greatest risk for developing GBS. Risk of GBS following flu vaccination The data on the association between GBS and seasonal flu vaccination are varied and inconsistent across flu seasons. If there is an increased risk of GBS following flu vaccination, it is small, on the order of one to two additional GBS cases per million doses of flu vaccine administered. Safety monitoring for GBS after flu vaccination CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely monitor the safety of vaccines approved for use in the United States. CDC uses two primary systems to monitor the safety of flu vaccines: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA monitor problems following vaccination. Anyone can report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS. Reports are welcome from all concerned individuals: for example, patients, parents, health care providers, pharmacists and vaccine manufacturers. Generally, VAERS cannot determine if an adverse event was caused by a vaccine, but these reports can help determine if further investigations are needed.

Wastewater surveillance can detect influenza A virus and the H5 subtype, although current testing does not distinguish between human and animal sources. What is added by this report? During May 12–July 13, 2024, high influenza A virus levels were detected in wastewater in four states, including three states with seasonal human influenza virus activity noted during this time. The H5 subtype was detected in wastewater in nine states; follow-up investigations in many of these states revealed likely animal-related sources, including those related to milk processing. What are the implications for public health practice? Early work to interpret influenza A virus and H5 subtype detections in wastewater can help with public health preparedness and response for the upcoming respiratory illness season. Article Metrics Altmetric: FigureTableRelated MaterialsChallenges and Opportunities for Wastewater Monitoring of Influenza Viruses During the Multistate Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Dairy Cattle and PoultryArticle PDFFull Issue PDF Abstract As part of the response to the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus outbreak in U.S. cattle and poultry and the associated human cases, CDC and partners are monitoring influenza A virus levels and detection of the H5 subtype in wastewater. Among 48 states and the District of Columbia that performed influenza A testing of wastewater during May 12–July 13, 2024, a weekly average of 309 sites in 38 states had sufficient data for analysis, and 11 sites in four states reported high levels of influenza A virus. H5 subtype testing was conducted at 203 sites in 41 states, with H5 detections at 24 sites in nine states. For each detection or high level, CDC and state and local health departments evaluated data from other influenza surveillance systems and partnered with wastewater utilities and agriculture departments to investigate potential sources. Among the four states with high influenza A virus levels detected in wastewater, three states had corresponding evidence of human influenza activity from other influenza surveillance systems. Among the 24 sites with H5 detections, 15 identified animal sources within the sewershed or adjacent county, including eight milk-processing inputs. Data from these early investigations can help health officials optimize the use of wastewater surveillance during the upcoming respiratory illness season. Top Introduction Wastewater surveillance is used to monitor human shedding of pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, at a community level and is independent of symptoms, testing access, and care-seeking behavior (1). Some sites have conducted wastewater influenza virus surveillance for several years, and findings have correlated with traditional influenza surveillance measures (2–6). The zoonotic outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in the United States has resulted in 13 confirmed human cases during January–August 2024.* As part of the response to this outbreak, CDC and state and local health departments are using wastewater surveillance to monitor influenza A virus and the H5 subtype; however, current testing techniques cannot distinguish between human and animal sources. This report summarizes data from the first 9 weeks of monitoring influenza A virus and the H5 subtype in wastewater across the United States, including findings from collaborations with state and local health departments to investigate potential sources during the ongoing H5N1 public health response. Top Methods Influenza A Virus Testing Wastewater samples collected from approximately 750 sites in 48 states and the District of Columbia during May 12–July 13, 2024, were tested for influenza A virus by state and local health departments, a CDC contractor, or an academic partner program (WastewaterSCAN [https://www.wastewaterscan.org/en]); and results were submitted to CDC’s Data Collation and Integration for Public Health Event Response (DECIPHER) pipeline.† Although not specific to the H5N1 subtype, the influenza A virus testing performed routinely by partners across the United States frequently detects any influenza A virus, including seasonal and H5 subtypes. For this analysis, concentrations of influenza A virus in wastewater were measured using digital polymerase chain reaction testing with various primer and probe oligonucleotides and assay conditions that were optimized by each laboratory (7). For each site, the percentile of the most recent week’s normalized concentration was calculated compared with the normalized concentrations reported during October 1, 2023–March 2, 2024, corresponding to the portion of the influenza season before the reported HPAI A(H5N1) outbreak in dairy cattle. Influenza A virus levels at each site were categorized as high, above average, moderate, low, or minimal.§ Influenza A(H5) Virus Subtype Testing In April 2024, a digital polymerase chain reaction assay for the H5 hemagglutinin gene of the influenza A virus was developed and evaluated by WastewaterSCAN for testing wastewater and detected H5 viral RNA in wastewater samples from multiple locations experiencing cattle outbreaks (7). In May 2024, routine H5 testing was implemented at 193 sites (reduced to 152 sites by July 1, 2024) across 41 states, and results were displayed on a public dashboard¶; H5 testing was also implemented at 10 additional sites in one state, for a total of 203 sites with any H5 testing. CDC’s wastewater DECIPHER data pipeline was updated to receive influenza A virus subtyping results, and submission of H5 virus data commenced in July 2024. Collaboration To Evaluate Wastewater Signals CDC notified jurisdictions of high influenza A virus levels on a weekly basis; notification of new H5 detections were provided daily. CDC provided jurisdictions with a checklist** for follow-up, which included reviewing human influenza surveillance systems and characterizing sewershed inputs (substances that flow into sewer pipes) in partnership with wastewater utilities, departments of agriculture, and others. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† Top Results Detection of High Influenza A Virus Levels Among an average of 309 wastewater sites with sufficient data for analysis for ≥1 week during May 12–July 13 (Figure), 11 sites in four states (California, Illinois, Kansas, and Oregon) had high influenza A levels detected at least once (Table). In three of these states, six wastewater sites with high influenza A virus levels were in communities with evidence of human influenza activity, based on other surveillance. The influenza A virus wastewater data are not specific to H5, and none of these four states reported H5 human influenza cases, nor did they report any confirmed cases in livestock herds or poultry within their sewersheds or counties during this time.§§ Most of these sites reported open or combined sewersheds, and some sites identified specific potential sources of animal input.¶¶ H5 Subtype Detections Among 41 states with influenza A H5 testing in wastewater, nine states (California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas) reported one or more H5 detections during May 12–July 13, and 32 states did not have H5 detections during this period. The nine states with H5 detections in wastewater included seven states with an HPAI A(H5N1)–infected herd reported during this period and one additional state with an infected herd reported before this period. Two of these nine states (Colorado and Michigan) reported confirmed human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection during this time.*** Among the 32 states with H5 testing in wastewater and no H5 detections in wastewater during the analysis period, 30 (94%) had no herds with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections reported during this time, and two had infected herds reported only before this period. In determining inputs to specific wastewater sites, 15 of 24 sites (63%) with H5 detections identified some animal inputs within the sewershed or county. Eight of 24 sites (33%) identified milk-processing inputs within the sewershed catchment area. Additional inputs noted were meat processing, dairy operations within the sewershed or adjacent county, other sources of livestock waste (e.g., truck wash), wild bird inputs, and domestic poultry farms within the sewershed or county.††† Top Discussion During May 12–July 13, most U.S. wastewater sites tested did not have high influenza A virus levels or any detections of the H5 subtype. Among the sites that did have high influenza A virus levels, the most frequent finding was corresponding evidence of human influenza A virus activity in the community. Among sites that reported H5 detections in wastewater, all but one were in a state with reported infected dairy herds during or before the surveillance period, and animal-related inputs such as effluent from milk-processing plants and suspected contributions from wild birds were frequently reported. These differences highlight the importance of influenza A virus subtyping to provide data specific to HPAI outbreaks. The findings in this report underscore the importance of using a One Health approach that leverages multisectoral collaboration to understand the complexity of inputs from animal and human sources.§§§ The current zoonotic outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) virus highlights the importance of coordination across health, agriculture, wildlife, food safety, and other partners. Investigations into wastewater signals also require coordination among public health, academic, municipal water treatment, and community partners. Influenza A(H5N1) virus has been found at very high concentrations in milk from infected cows (8); investigations of influenza A and H5 virus signals in wastewater suggest that milk effluent from milk-processing facilities can be a major contributor to H5 viral particles in wastewater (7,9). Monitoring influenza A viruses and specific influenza A virus subtypes in wastewater might serve as One Health surveillance indicators of the presence of influenza viruses in a community. Further, existing human clinical influenza surveillance systems are essential for quickly identifying H5 virus infections in humans and monitoring seasonal influenza virus activity. Public health agencies that conduct wastewater monitoring to complement influenza surveillance systems should be prepared to add influenza A virus subtype testing when needed to improve understanding of influenza A virus detections in the context of the current HPAI A(H5N1) outbreak. CDC-funded National Wastewater Surveillance System’s Centers of Excellence are expanding influenza A virus testing and subtyping, which can contribute to source investigations and be deployed at strategic times and places.¶¶¶ Although this report focused on comparing influenza A virus levels with those from the previous season and identifying H5 detections, subtyping for seasonal influenza A(H1) and A(H3) viruses in wastewater samples and using state and national viral activity levels to monitor influenza A across sites can help with interpretation of wastewater surveillance data during the upcoming influenza season.**** A critical need for clear communication about the meaning of detection of influenza A virus and subtypes exists. Data dashboards can provide regular wastewater surveillance updates to the public, the media, and health care providers; however, these data need to be accompanied by clear public health interpretations focusing on potential human risk and public health actions, which could include alerts to health care providers or increasing availability of testing or vaccines as has been done for SARS-CoV-2 and mpox. Activities to monitor influenza A virus and subtypes using wastewater data are likely to evolve as the methodologies and interpretation are further evaluated and refined. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, although influenza viruses can be detected in wastewater, current techniques cannot distinguish between human and animal sources, and the current approach for H5 testing in wastewater is not specific to HPAI A(H5N1) viruses; H5 detections in wastewater might reflect animal rather than human infections and might be detection of low pathogenic avian influenza rather than HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Second, limited data are available regarding the proportion of persons infected with influenza viruses who shed virus in urine or feces, and how the concentration of viral shedding varies by subtype and across the course of illness (10). Third, population wastewater surveillance coverage varies substantially by state; therefore, data are most informative when used in conjunction with clinical human influenza surveillance data. Fourth, states reported information on the investigations of sewershed inputs for sites with high influenza A virus levels or H5 detections, but comparison information for sites without these signals was not collected; therefore, epidemiologic measures for these possible associations could not be generated. Finally, the comprehensiveness of data collection after a signal in wastewater varied widely. Public health investigations into potential sources of H5 viruses in wastewater can be complex (e.g., milk-processing inputs can include milk from other states) and might support or refute likely sources of H5 without providing definitive conclusions. Implications for Public Health Practice Lessons learned during early follow-up investigations of wastewater signals can help health officials implement an improved measure of influenza A virus levels in wastewater and optimize the use of wastewater surveillance during the upcoming respiratory illness season. The findings in this report, and data from wastewater surveillance in general, can complement traditional influenza surveillance systems. A One Health approach with multisectoral collaboration and data-informed guidance on when and how to use influenza virus subtyping of wastewater might enhance the public health response to the current outbreak.

Flu can be more dangerous than the common cold for children. Each year, flu places a large burden on the health and well-being of children and their families. Annual flu vaccination offers the best protection against flu and its potentially serious complications in children. Parents can help children fight flu by getting themselves and their children vaccinated against flu each year. Overview Children younger than 5 years old—especially those younger than 2—and children of any age with certain chronic health conditions, like asthma and diabetes, are at higher risk of developing potentially serious flu complications. Because these groups of children are at higher risk, it is especially important that they get a seasonal flu vaccine to help prevent flu, and to reduce their risk of being hospitalized or dying from flu if they do get sick. Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of FluWhile not at higher risk, healthy children 5 years and older can also get very sick from flu, in addition to spreading flu to vulnerable family members like infants younger than 6 months and adults who are 65 years and older or people of any age who have certain chronic health conditions. It's important to vaccinate everyone 6 months and older against flu each year to help protect those most at risk.

CDC, in collaboration with STLT public health agencies, is employing a multi-faceted influenza surveillance strategy for the 2024-2025 season that will be modified as new information is learned or the situation changes in a way that warrants a revised approach. Overview The activities described below are aimed at identifying possible spread of HPAI A(H5) to and among people while monitoring seasonal influenza activity. These surveillance strategies encompass a range of activities beginning with symptom monitoring among those exposed to infected/potentially infected animals (specifically swine, cattle, poultry and other avian species) and extending outward to monitoring surveillance data from the general population. These activities are described at a high level, and where available, links to more detailed information are provided. 1. Identify human infections via symptom monitoring among workers and others with recent exposures to HPAI A(H5) infected animals on farms or other locations. Partners: State and local public health; State Departments of Agriculture and Wildlife, CDC and USDA support as requested. Activities 1. Consider conducting proactive outreach to poultry and livestock workers and farm owners in advance of a known exposure, in coordination with agriculture departments and other partners, to provide information about risk reduction and set expectations for symptom monitoring. 2. If possible, active symptom monitoring should involve daily contact between health department staff and exposed persons using a list of names and contact information provided by the farm. This daily contact can be made through various methods based on jurisdiction resources and preferences of the persons under monitoring (i.e., text based, phone, etc.). Ensure communication materials and methods are linguistically and culturally appropriate, such as documents available here. 3. If active monitoring is not possible (e.g., farms do not provide the names and contact information of exposed workers to public health), the health department could (1) provide information directly to the workers or the farm owners about self-monitoring and who to contact if symptoms occur so that any necessary testing can be arranged, or (2) work through an intermediary such as Department of Agriculture personnel, a facility veterinarian or a professional association to provide self-monitoring and symptom reporting information to farm workers. 4. Ensure the prompt availability of and access to testing for influenza and other respiratory viruses among exposed workers who present with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms or conjunctivitis and who have had recent direct or close contact with animals potentially infected or confirmed to be infected with HPAI A(H5). It is anticipated that with increased circulation of seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses, the number of workers with signs and symptoms consistent with ARI will increase and specimen collection and testing will be critical in determining the cause of symptoms. 2. Conduct outreach and education to people who work with, exhibit and/or are exposed to animals and related animal by-products (e.g., unpasteurized milk, cheese) Partners: State and local public health and departments of agriculture; CDC and USDA support as requested. Other potential partners include agricultural extension, trusted farmworker healthcare providers and veterinarians. Activities 1. Develop or identify educational materials and methods specific to the target audience (e.g., linguistically and culturally appropriate documents, infographics and videos). 2. Disseminate information regarding risks, worker safety, infection prevention, resources available, symptoms to be aware of and whom to contact if symptoms develop.

Conduct outreach to providers to request influenza testing for hospitalized/ICU patients presenting with compatible illness (irrespective of exposure history) and to relay the importance of determining the influenza A subtype for all influenza A positive specimens. 2. Develop timely methods for identifying hospitalized patients who are influenza A positive. If possible, determine if the influenza A positive patient was in the ICU. 3. Recommend facilities have a process for subtyping of influenza A positive specimens from all severely ill persons, particularly those with relevant exposure history, either in the clinical laboratory or by shipping the specimen to the public health laboratory (PHL). 4. Conduct surveillance for novel influenza A virus infections in the community. Partners: State and local public health; CDC support when possible and when requested Activities 1. Jurisdictions should plan to meet the 1 in 700 novel event detection goal as described in the Influenza Right Size Roadmap through increasing the number of influenza positive specimens tested in PHLs. The number of influenza positive specimens tested each week using the CDC subtyping assay to meet this goal increases compared to goals during the summer, and ranges from 8 to 251 depending on the jurisdiction's population (see Influenza Right Size Roadmap, Appendix A). During the remainder of the season, jurisdictions should meet the 1 in 200 novel event detection goal. i. Ask providers and clinical laboratories that have submitted specimens to the PHL during previous seasons to continue doing so this season. ii. Identify any additional providers or clinical laboratories that would be willing to submit specimens this season. iii. CDC recommends that commercial laboratories continue submission of influenza A positive specimens to PHLs for additional subtyping (Appendix 1). iv. Explore with HRSA what role rural health clinics might play in submitting specimens to PHLs. 2. PHLs should attempt to subtype at least 95 % of influenza A positive specimens and submit influenza specimens for additional characterization to their designated National Influenza Reference Center (NIRC). For all PHLs, submit influenza positive specimens that meet the submission criteria outlined in Appendix 2: CDC-WHO Collaborating Center Guidance for Influenza Virus Surveillance for the 2024-2025 Influenza Season. 3. Conduct whole genome sequencing of additional influenza specimens. i. For states with a designated Influenza Sequencing Center (ISC) or NIRC, sequence up to 85 additional influenza specimens per month from their state that are not submitted to the NIRC. ii. All influenza positive specimens submitted by states to a NIRC will undergo whole genome sequencing. 4. Unexplained clusters of respiratory illness should be investigated, including collection of specimens for testing, to determine the pathogen(s) causing illness and identify likely routes of transmission. 5. Monitor influenza surveillance data for any unexpected patterns. Partners: State and local public health, CDC Activities 1. State and local public health partners monitor data within their jurisdictions which may include systems listed in ii plus additional data/systems specific to a jurisdiction. 2. CDC analyzes the following data that are reported to CDC: i. Virologic data from 250 clinical laboratories (65,000-150 000 specimens tested weekly) and 90 PHLs (1,500-5 000 specimens tested weekly). ii. Outpatient respiratory illness data reported to ILINet from more than 4 000 outpatient providers/EDs (approximately 2.5 million patient visits weekly). iii. Emergency department visits with influenza as a discharge diagnosis reported to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP)/ESSENCE. iv. Hospitalization data from FluSurvNet sites which are operating year-round. v. The National Healthcare Safety Network's Hospitalization Surveillance that will include mandatory reporting from all hospitals beginning November 1, 2024. vi. Mortality data from the National Vital Statistics Surveillance System that covers more than 99 % of deaths occurring in the United States. vii. Influenza concentrations identified in wastewater data. 3. Local data anomaly detection and investigation. i. Monitor data for anomalies in emergency department visits with influenza, influenza-like illness, or conjunctivitis as a discharge diagnosis and follow-up to identify the cause. If anomalies are identified at CDC, other influenza data sources (e.g., laboratory, hospitalization, etc.) are reviewed for the area identified and results are shared with state/local public health partners who may have access to additional data in the affected area. State/local public health partners often run their own anomaly detection algorithms and, when anomalies are identified, will review their influenza data and other relevant information (e.g., farms with HPAI A(H5) infected animals, milk producers, etc.) for the area identified. 4. Monitor for A(H5) detections in wastewater and review additional information to understand the source. i. CDC notifies state/local public health partners of the A(H5) detection if the testing occurs outside the justification's PHL. ii. PHLs testing for A(H5) in wastewater will report the results to CDC. iii. When an A(H5) detection occurs: CDC reviews other data reported to CDC (e.g., influenza laboratory, emergency department hospitalization, etc.) for the area identified and shares results with state/local public health partners. State/local public health partners review their influenza data and other relevant information (e.g., farms with HPAI A(H5) infected animals, milk producers, etc.) for the area identified. Appendix 1. Recommendations to commercial laboratories to increase submission of influenza A positive specimens to state and local PHLs for additional subtyping (including A(H5) CDC, in coordination with STLT public health agencies, requests that commercial laboratories continue submissions of clinical specimens for additional influenza A subtyping testing to their jurisdictional PHL. Commercial laboratories are encouraged to communicate with the PHL of the patient's state of residence prior to submitting specimens to obtain the appropriate specimen submission form and any additional submission instructions. Specimens will be tested for surveillance purposes and patient specific reports might not be returned to the submitter. CDC requests commercial laboratories continue to send the following specimens to PHLs as soon as possible for further testing and characterization. Influenza A positive specimens that are unable to be subtyped tests designed to provide an influenza subtyping result (e.g., Biofire) and confirmed upon retest. Influenza A positive specimens that are subtype influenza A(H1) and not influenza A(H1)pdm09 on tests designed to provide an influenza subtyping result and confirmed upon retest. For Awareness: Performance characteristics for the CDC in vitro diagnostic reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) subtyping assays have been determined with the following human upper respiratory specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture: nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS] nasal swabs [NS] throat swabs [TS] nasal aspirates [NA] nasal washes [NW] dual nasopharyngealhroat swabs [NPS/TS] Performance characteristics for the CDC in vitro diagnostic reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) subtyping assays have been determined with the following human lower respiratory tract specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection: bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] bronchial wash [BW] tracheal aspirate [TA] sputum and lung tissue Additional Surveillance Activities: Submissions of additional influenza A specimens that have not undergone influenza subtyping testing are greatly appreciated to ensure rapid detection of any human infections of A(H5). CDC, in collaboration with APHL, can help to determine an appropriate and feasible number of specimens each month in order to prioritize available laboratory resources. Please consider submission of specimens that meet the established assay cutoff of your testing method to identify positive specimens. CDC will continue to work with commercial laboratories and APHL to determine a process by which specimens will be submitted to state and local public health for additional subtype testing. Appendix 2. CDC-WHO Collaborating Center Guidance for Influenza Virus Surveillance for the 2024-2025 Influenza Season In this appendix, you will find guidance and instructions for surveillance and specimen submissions as follows: National Influenza Virologic Surveillance Submissions (Routine Surveillance) For National Influenza Virologic Surveillance Submissions to CDC and NIRCs, please fill in the electronic Influenza Specimen Submission Form in its entirety to provide important metadata. Please email the electronic version of the Influenza Specimen Submission Form to the appropriate receiving laboratory and include a printed shipping manifest from the Influenza Specimen Submission Form (preset in excel template) in the shipping container. Please contact Dr. Rebecca Kondor (rkondor@cdc.gov) and flusupport@cdc.gov if your laboratory observes a noticeable increase in specimen volume or positivity rate. If there are any questions, please contact the CDC Influenza Division staff as listed below: Rebecca Kondor, PhD, Lead, Genomic Analysis Team, VSDB/Influenza Division/NCIRD/CDC Phone: 404-639-1371, Email: rkondor@cdc.gov John Steel, PhD Lead, Epidemic Virology and Vaccines, VSDB/Influenza Division/NCIRD/CDC Phone: 404-718-7843, Email: jsteel@cdc.gov Submission Guidance National Influenza Virologic Surveillance Submission Guidance: During the 2024-2025 Influenza Season Please use the following virus surveillance specimen submission guidelines below: 1. Please send influenza virus positive specimens every two weeks to your designated NIRC (Table 1). Please do not ship surveillance specimens directly to CDC. We ask that all specimens sent to the NIRCs or CDC are SARS-CoV-2 negative using an FDA authorized or CLIA compliant real-time RT-PCR assay. This is an important safety consideration as samples submitted to NIRCs and/or CDC are subject to many tests (e.g., virus propagation). Furthermore, specimens that have mixed infections which are positive for influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 should not be submitted. 2. Specimen selection criteria for submission: a. Original clinical specimens positive for influenza and negative for SARS-CoV-2, which have been identified during the prior two weeks. Only specimens stored in either saline, VTM or UTM should be sent to your designated NIRC and not MTM since it inactivates the virus. Saliva is not a suitable specimen for influenza virus characterization. Ideally, specimens will be from the prior 7 days, but no older than 14 days. b. Specimens should have CT values of 28 or lower based on InfA or InfB tests using the CDC Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay or the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel. c. Representative subtype/lineages (please see Table 2 for minimum weekly subtyping numbers): 6 influenza A(H3N2) positive specimens 4 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive specimens 4 influenza B/Victoria lineage* positive specimens *All B/Yamagata lineage positive specimens should be submitted following the guidance for diagnostic specimens. If B genotyping is not performed, please submit only 4 influenza B positive specimens. d. Ideally send 0.5 mL of original clinical specimen; if 0.5 mL is not available, submit no less than 0.3 mL. e. Additional considerations for selecting specimens to send to the NIRC: when possible, send specimens from patients of varying ages, disease severity and location within the jurisdiction. When choosing among specimens that meet the above criteria, prioritize those for which level of care (inpatient/outpatient) is known or that were systematically collected as part of the surveillance enhancement. 3. Please follow instructions to complete the electronic Influenza Specimen Submission Form and provide important metadata. a. Email the electronic version of the Influenza Specimen Submission Form to the address for your designated NIRC (Table 1). b. Print a shipping manifest from the Influenza Specimen Submission Form (preset in Excel template) and include it in the shipping container. Timely submission of original clinical specimens every two weeks is critical. Do not wait to ship specimens even if you only have a few specimens available that meet the requirements detailed above. In order to meet specific needs (e.g., obtain egg isolates) or to achieve our virus surveillance goals, we may send a special request that deviates from this guidance. Additionally, it will be helpful to coordinate with any clinical laboratory partners to ensure they are submitting influenza positive specimens to you for surveillance purposes. It is especially important to obtain specimens early in the influenza season when fewer viruses are circulating because they are very important for development of future vaccines. Table 1.

While we recommend laboratories to strive to meet the ELC goals for influenza A subtyping (95 % of specimens), to meet this goal, specimens must be tested at your PHL using the CDC Influenza PCR subtyping/lineage assays as they are the only tests we fully understand the performance characteristic of and trust to identify an inconclusive or potentially novel influenza virus. Please continue to use the CDC Influenza A subtyping (Ver 2, FluIVD03-06), or its replacement product (Ver 3, FluIVD03-10), and Influenza B Lineage Genotyping (Ver 1.1, FluIVD03-7) kits that are available through IRR to determine the subtype and lineage. Additionally, the data from the CDC Flu A Subtyping and Flu B Lineage kits can be considered diagnostic if run under CLIA compliant conditions for reporting an influenza diagnostic result or as RUO to meet surveillance goals if using an extraction process which has not been CLIA validated for reporting influenza subtyping as a diagnostic result. Therefore, subtyping/lineage determination can be conducted using nucleic acid extracted from approved platforms for either influenza diagnostic assays or SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. However, we don't recommend using specimens stored in MTM which inactivates viruses. For the 2024-2025 influenza season, CDC recommends continuing to perform influenza B lineage determination using the IVD kit, FluIVD03-7. However, when a given laboratory's current B lineage determination IVD kit is depleted, CDC recommends that laboratories begin using RUO kits for influenza B lineage determination available in IRR. Because of changing epidemiology and exclusion of influenza B/Yamagata in seasonal vaccines used in the USA, use of RUO kits will meet surveillance reporting requirements. RUO results are considered for surveillance purposes and should be reported to CDC; however, they cannot be reported as diagnostic results to physicians or healthcare. Table 2.

We understand that these goals may not be achievable when there is very limited influenza virus circulation, but please make efforts to subtype weekly or biweekly. You may wish to subtype/lineage test more viruses than this to provide the information you need to understand influenza activity in your state. Appendix 3. In this appendix, you will find detailed guidance and instructions for influenza antiviral resistance surveillance and specimen submissions as follows: Influenza In-State Antiviral Resistance Surveillance [Reference 1] CDC no longer performs diagnostic testing for influenza antiviral resistance. If you have any questions regarding influenza antiviral resistance testing, please contact Dr. Larisa V. Gubareva at LGubareva@cdc.gov or send an email to fluantiviral@cdc.gov. Influenza In-State Antiviral Resistance Surveillance Specimen Reference 1 Category and Purpose: Antiviral Resistance Surveillance (Pyrosequencing or NGS) To identify drug resistance in influenza A and B viruses conferred by mutations in the neuraminidase. Laboratories may submit specimens to the reference center (New York State Department of Health, NYSDOH). Note: ALWAYS SUBMIT TO NATIONAL INFLUENZA VIRUS SURVEILLANCE FIRST, PRIOR TO SUBMITTING ADDITIONAL VIRUSES TO ANTIVIRAL RESISTANCE SURVEILLANCE. What to send: Original clinical specimens only Positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses Ct values less than 29 When to send: Up to 5 specimens every other week. Do NOT submit aliquots from the same specimen for both Antiviral Resistance Surveillance and National Influenza Virus Surveillance. Please submit DIFFERENT specimens.

CDC-WHO Collaborating Center Guidance for Influenza Virus Diagnostic Submissions During the 2024-2025 Influenza Season For Influenza Diagnostic Submissions to CDC, please contact Dr. Marie Kirby or flusupport@cdc.gov. It is very important that you rapidly contact CDC, at these addresses, if your laboratory identifies specimens that are atypical or have non-standard results. Atypical or negative subtyping results could represent a variant influenza A virus or other novel influenza A viruses with pandemic potential. In particular, please send specimens with non-standard test results as detailed in the instructions for use of the CDC Flu SC2 Multiplex, A/B Typing, A subtyping assays and B genotyping assays. Please send any inconclusive results or presumptive positive results from the A(H5) or A(H7) assays and notify CDC IMMEDIATELY (flusupport@cdc.gov). More information on non-standard test results is included in References 2 and 3. Reminders: The A(H5) assay should not be performed unless the patient meets clinical, epidemiologic, or public health criteria for testing suspected specimens. PHL may run conjunctival swab specimens in the CDC A(H5) assay as long as they are paired with approved respiratory specimens and stored/shipped in approved media for the assay. CDC is approved to run conjunctival swab specimens with this assay as a CLIA validated laboratory developed test. If presumptive positive for a novel virus, per CDC's FDA approved instructions for use (IFU), they can be sent to CDC as a diagnostic specimen under typical diagnostic shipping protocols. Any unsubtypable results from CDC A(H5) assay should be shipped to CDC immediately. Any presumptive positive results from the CDC A(H5) assay should be shipped to CDC immediately. Any inconclusive test results from the CDC A(H5) assay should be shipped to CDC immediately. To submit viruses for diagnosis, please fill out the following forms and send along with your submission: CDC Specimen Submission Form, CDC: 50.34 (Requiredfor CLIA reporting) or you can use: CDC Specimen Test Order and Reporting (CSTOR) | Submitting Specimens to CDC | Infectious Diseases Laboratories | CDC Additionally, please include: Reason for Submission: Diagnosis If Clinical Specimen: Indicate specimen type Type/Subtype: Inconclusive Comments: Assign CDC-10421 Influenza Molecular Detection in Clinical Specimens for diagnostic submissions.

CDC-WHO Collaborating Center Guidance for National Influenza Reference Centers (NIRCs) During the 2024-2025 Influenza Season In the influenza surveillance and specimen submission guidance sent to state PHLs (referred to as originating lab) for 2024-2025, influenza positive specimens are to be submitted to NIRCs every two weeks which meet the stated specimen selection criteria and with the following representative subtype/lineages: 6 influenza A(H3N2) positive specimens 4 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive specimens 4 influenza B/Victoria lineage positive specimens All specimens received at the NIRC will continue to undergo NGS, however not all specimens will undergo isolation. Each NIRC should randomly select specimens from each originating lab package and follow the isolation right-size number. Any specimens received from the originating lab above the isolation right-size number do not undergo isolation. NIRC isolation right-size number: 3 influenza A(H3N2) positive specimens 2 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive specimens 2 influenza B/Victoria lineage positive specimens NGS of isolates - only the first 100 isolates should be sequenced by NGS. After which, the subsequent isolates should be sent in the ISA tube to CDC. Shipment to CDC should occur after the NIRC has completed the isolation workflows for selected specimens from the originating lab package/state PHL. The shipment will include all RCV tubes, as well as the additional aliquots for specimens with successful isolation results bundled by the originating lab(s)/state PHL. For example: 1) Specimens NOT chosen for isolation: ISR Aliquot – NGS performed @ NIRC RCV (ORIGINAL) – remaining tube sent to CDC Data fields would appear as follows: Inoculation Date: null; Grow TC?: null; Passage: null; HA titer: null 2) Specimens chosen for isolation: ISR Aliquot – NGS performed @ NIRC RCV (ORIGINAL) – remaining tube sent to CDC Successful Isolates ISA tube – NGS performed @ NIRC for first 100 isolates, after which the ISA tube of subsequent isolates should be sent to CDC REF tube – sent to CDC MET tube – sent to CDC RPS tube – sent to CDC RHI – scintillation vial – sent to CDC Data fields would appear as follows: Inoculation Date: Filled in; Grow TC?: Filled in; Passage History: Filled in, if successful; HA titer: Filled in, if successful. Once received and accessioned at CDC, the date received from contract lab will be filled in signifying that NIRC workflows have been completed. Additional Sequencing for NIRC Surveillance: The NIRC may be reimbursed for up to 500 additional specimens from their jurisdiction (beyond right size submission to NIRC) per season. This is approximately 85 specimens per month during the influenza season. NIRCs should select specimens that are representative of what are typically selected for NIRC submissions.

In November 2022, the Ecuadorian government declared an animal health emergency after the country detected its first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry. Large numbers of commercial and domestic birds—including chickens, ducks, and geese—were already sick or had died from the virus. Officials rapidly responded to control the outbreak in poultry, such as intensifying surveillance, testing, and monitoring disease trends. However, animal and human health experts shared a major concern—given the close contact between many people with poultry in their yards or workplaces, infection in humans was still possible. In December, the experts' concerns became reality. A nine-year-old girl in the province of Bolívar developed symptoms of a severe acute respiratory infection, which initially included a runny nose, nausea, and vomiting. With her condition worsening, she was transferred to a pediatric hospital in Quito on January 2, 2023, and subsequently diagnosed with avian influenza. The virus was confirmed by Ecuador's National Institute of Public Health and Research (INSPI) and by CDC's Influenza Division in the United States. It was the first human case of avian influenza ever detected in Ecuador. Health officials quickly notified the World Health Organization (WHO) as this was a public health emergency. Transmission in humans‎ Although transmission of avian influenza to humans is rare, people can become sick with the avian influenza virus if they have contact with infected birds or are exposed to places where the virus is present. For example, people can get sick by inhaling dust or droplets that contain the virus or by touching their mouth, eyes, or nose after touching something with the virus. Learn more Approach Trained professionals at the ready Staff trained through CDC's FETP-Frontline program were instrumental in confirming Ecuador's first-ever human case of avian influenza A (H5N1 bird flu). This first case was rapidly identified thanks to a group of fast-acting Ecuadorian public health professionals trained through two flagship global health security programs. Staff trained through CDC's FETP-Frontline program were instrumental in confirming the cause of the patient's illness. Since 2017, more than 250 Ecuadorian public health professionals have completed the three-month program, which focuses on surveillance and response to local disease cases or outbreaks. In October 2022, just before the initial bird flu outbreak, Ecuador became one of the first countries to a pilot a new CDC-funded course called "FETP-Frontline One Health." Did you know?‎ One Health is an approach that recognizes that the health of people is closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment. One Health encourages collaborative efforts of many experts (like disease detectives, laboratorians, physicians, and veterinarians) working across human, animal, and environmental health to improve the health of people and animals, including pets, livestock, and wildlife. Around the same time, 23 Ecuadorian trainees were taking part in the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme, which is the first laboratory leadership program to emphasize a One Health approach. This two-year, intensive program strengthens national laboratory system capacity, which helps keep Ecuadorians safe from infectious diseases through rapid detection and response. Together, these trainings meant that Ecuador had the right people at the right time when bird flu struck. Impact As soon as the human case of bird flu was identified, public health and laboratory teams worked together to quickly establish an "epidemiological barrier" in the affected community. They used their skills to conduct contact tracing, and actively searched for additional cases in humans. Public health officials monitored 25 contacts of the first identified index case, including four suspected cases with respiratory symptoms and possible exposure to birds. Experts from various areas jumped in to further coordinate the response, for example: Animal health experts implemented testing and vaccination interventions among commercial and domestic poultry in Bolívar province to identify and control additional cases of avian influenza. By May 2023, they had vaccinated 6.3 million birds in at-risk areas. Staff from the Ministry of Public Health and from Agrocalidad launched communication campaigns and made presentations at local fairs. Prevention activities included a national press release, informational leaflets, training sessions for farmers on biosecurity measures, and workshops on good hygiene practices. The national vaccination program carried out influenza vaccination campaigns in the human population. In just six days, the campaign reached 100% coverage in the affected locality. Thanks to efficient disease surveillance systems, astute clinicians, and the rapid action of local and national health officials, Ecuador's first human avian influenza infection was rapidly identified, examined, and treated. The girl recovered, and no one else fell ill with avian influenza. Looking ahead The success of this collaborative, multisectoral One Health response was made possible by the strong foundations laid through CDC's training programs: FETP-Frontline One Health and the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme. Through the South America Regional Office and staff based in Ecuador, CDC continues to strengthen national and regional public health systems by prioritizing workforce development programs such as One Health FETP and the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme. These ongoing efforts help ensure that the region is ready to implement rapidly coordinated responses to infectious disease outbreaks and protect the health of people globally.

Coadministration ACIP Recommendations‎ Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2023-2024 Influenza Season has been published. ACIP Recommendations Summary Coadministration or simultaneous administration of vaccines refers to giving or getting more than one vaccine during a visit. This is common clinical practice. While there are some exceptions, most vaccines can be given at the same visit. Why health care providers encourage people to get more than one vaccine at the same time The idea is to get people up to date on all the vaccines they are due for at one visit in case they are not able to return for additional vaccinations at a later time. Getting more than one vaccine at the same visit Vaccines given with a needle at the same visit should be given at separate places on the body (at least one inch apart). Adults and older children can get them in the same arm at least an inch apart, or they can get them in different arms. Young children can get them in the same thigh at least an inch apart, or they can get them in different thighs. Flu & COVID-19 Vaccines Flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time People can get a flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit if they are eligible, and if the timing for each vaccine is right. IIV3s and RIV3 can be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Safety of getting a flu and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time Studies support the safety of getting a flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit. For example, one CDC study showed that people who got a flu vaccine and COVID-19 monovalent vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely to have reactions including fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who only got a COVID-19 monovalent vaccine, but those reactions were mostly mild and went away quickly. Reasons to get a flu and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit This might be more convenient than having two separate visits. Getting both vaccines at the same time if you are due for both is an option. Recommended waiting time between vaccines There's no recommended waiting time between getting a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine. Flu & RSV Vaccines RSV and flu vaccines at the same time Getting an RSV vaccine (if you are eligible) at the same visit where you get a flu vaccine is acceptable and is an option that you can talk about with your health care provider. Safety of getting RSV and flu vaccine at the same time There are limited data on getting flu and RSV vaccines at the same time since RSV vaccines are new. However, in clinical trials, coadministration of RSV and flu vaccines was safe. Adverse events after coadministration of RSV and flu vaccines were similar to those observed after giving the vaccines separately. Reactions at the injection site might be more common after getting flu and RSV vaccines at the same time than after getting flu vaccine alone. However, vaccination with RSV vaccine and flu vaccine during the same visit is acceptable. Safety monitoring of co-administered RSV vaccine and flu vaccine is ongoing. What to expect after getting an RSV and flu vaccine at the same time People who get an RSV vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same visit might be more likely to have injection-site reactions or other common side effects after vaccination. Additional research is occurring to understand this better. Flu, COVID, and RSV Vaccines Getting COVID-19, flu, and RSV vaccines at the same time Flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines may be given at the same visit. For eligible patients, this means that if you're only able to make one trip to get your fall and winter vaccines, you can get all of those vaccines at the same visit. Talk with your health care provider about this option. If you prefer to receive each vaccine at a separate visit, there is no minimum waiting period between vaccines. It is important to make sure you are up to date and protected for this season. Talk with a healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have questions about these vaccines. Getting vaccines that have non-aluminum adjuvants at the same time An adjuvant is an ingredient in some vaccines that helps promote a better immune response. Aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum potassium sulfate have been used safely as adjuvants in vaccines for more than 70 years. Some vaccines have newer non-aluminum adjuvants. There is less experience with giving more than one vaccine with these newer non-aluminum adjuvants at the same time. One flu vaccine, Fluad, contains a nonaluminum adjuvant. It is licensed and recommended for people aged 65 and older (cross ref to Fluad page). It also can be used for people aged 18 through 64 years who have had a solid organ transplant and are taking medications that suppress the immune system. People who are due for an influenza vaccine and other vaccines that can include adjuvants (such as certain COVID-19 and RSV vaccines) can get a flu vaccine without adjuvant if available. But Fluad can be used if a flu vaccine without adjuvant is not available. Your healthcare provider can help choose the best options for flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines based on year age and medical conditions.

CDC Update September 20, 2024 – Last week, CDC and ODH staff at the AABP conference enrolled about 150 attendees who have worked closely with cattle in the past three months. Participants included veterinarians, credentialed veterinary technicians, and veterinary students who practiced in 45 U.S. states. AABP attendees expressed excitement at the opportunity to participate and inform the body of science around influenza A(H5) in the United States, especially risks of infection among veterinary professionals. They also shared their experiences of working with cattle during the multi-state H5 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows to help further contribute to the practical understanding of this disease on the ground. Veterinarians and other veterinary professionals play a key role in implementing a One Health approach in this H5 bird flu response. The goal of this serosurvey is to better understand the extent of prior influenza A(H5) infections among people who work closely with cattle and the current risk of infection associated with occupational exposures in the bovine veterinary practitioner community. Participants completed an online survey about animal exposures, personal protective equipment (PPE) worn around these animals, seasonal influenza vaccination, and attitudes toward a potential influenza A(H5) vaccine, if one were to be authorized. A trained team of phlebotomists collected blood samples that will be studied to look for antibodies to influenza A(H5) viruses, which would indicate a prior infection with H5 bird flu. CDC epidemiologists will assess associated risk factors in people whose samples test positive. They also asked whether the person had respiratory or flu-like symptoms since January of this year, and whether they sought care or received treatment for that illness. Through community engagement and meeting people where they are, the CDC and ODH team were able to engage the AABP community, educate about the current H5 bird flu outbreak, and achieve high participation in this serosurvey. The strong collaboration among these three organizations will continue in the coming weeks, including writing up and disseminating the results of this serosurvey. Aggregate results will be shared with AABP members and will be disseminated to other professional groups, in addition to the public, to help veterinarians and other veterinary professionals understand the risk of exposures to cattle and what they can do to protect themselves, other people, and their animals.

A seizure is a convulsion or uncontrolled body movements. A “febrile seizure” refers to a seizure/convulsion associated with a fever in a child. Febrile seizures usually last around one or two minutes and can occur with any condition that causes fever, such as a cold, influenza, or ear infection. They are most common with fevers of 102°F (38.9°C) or higher, but they can also happen at lower body temperatures or when a fever is going down. A person experiencing a febrile seizure may lose consciousness. ACIP Recommendation Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices‎ Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2024-2025 Influenza Season has been published. 2024-25 Summary of Recommendations Children who are likely to have febrile seizures Most febrile seizures happen in children between the ages of 6 and 59 months. Up to 5% of young children will have at least one febrile seizure. The most common age range for children to have febrile seizures is 14–18 months. About 1 in 3 children who have one febrile seizure will have more febrile seizures during childhood. If a member of a child's immediate family (a brother, sister, or parent) has had febrile seizures, that child is more likely to have a febrile seizure. Seriousness of febrile seizures Febrile seizures can be frightening, but nearly all children who have a febrile seizure recover quickly, are healthy afterwards, and do not have any permanent neurological damage. Febrile seizures do not make children more likely to develop epilepsy or any other seizure disorder. Febrile seizures are rare after vaccination Vaccines can cause fevers, but febrile seizures are rare after vaccination. Importantly, getting sick with the flu also can cause febrile seizures. Flu illness can cause high fever and febrile seizures in children. Flu vaccine can protect children against flu illness and its complications. Flu vaccine cannot cause flu. Keep Reading: Misconceptions About Seasonal Flu and Flu VaccinesSeveral studies of children in the United States have looked at whether flu vaccination is associated with an increased risk for febrile seizures. Flu vaccine was not found to be associated with febrile seizures in one study that looked at 45,000 children aged 6 months through 23 months of age who received a flu vaccine from 1991 through 20031 Seasonal flu vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine were not found to be associated with febrile seizures in children during the 2009-2010 flu season2. Some studies have detected a small increased risk of febrile seizures in young children following the flu shot in some flu seasons. In these studies, the risk of febrile seizures was increased for children 12 through 23 months of age, particularly when the flu shot was given at the same time as pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV133) and diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP)-containing vaccine4. After carefully reviewed the data on febrile seizures and considering the benefits of vaccinating children against these illnesses, the CDC decided that no changes in the childhood immunization recommendations should be made. CDC monitoring for the safety of vaccines CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely monitor the safety of vaccines approved for use in the United States. CDC primarily uses two systems to monitor the safety of flu vaccines: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA monitor problems following vaccination. Anyone can report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS. Generally, VAERS reports cannot determine if an adverse event was caused by a vaccine, but these reports can help determine if further investigations are needed. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): a collaboration between CDC and eight integrated health care organizations that conducts ongoing vaccine safety monitoring and in-depth analysis of vaccine safety data. Keep Reading: Vaccine Safety Monitoring at CDC Reporting to CDC Febrile seizures after a childhood vaccination can be reported to CDC via the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website.

Here we report the first-in-human, dose-escalation, open-label trial (NCT04579250) evaluating an unadjuvanted group 2 stabilized stem ferritin nanoparticle vaccine based on the H10 A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013 influenza HA, H10ssF, in healthy adults. Participants received a single 20 mcg dose (n = 3) or two 60 mcg doses 16 weeks apart (n = 22). Vaccination with H10ssF was safe and well tolerated with only mild systemic and local reactogenicity reported. No serious adverse events occurred. Vaccination significantly increased homologous H10 HA stem binding and neutralizing antibodies at 2 weeks after both first and second vaccinations, and these responses remained above baseline at 40 weeks. Heterologous H3 and H7 binding antibodies also significantly increased after each vaccination and remained elevated throughout the study. These data indicate that the group 2 HA stem nanoparticle vaccine is safe and induces stem-directed binding and neutralizing antibodies.

Since the licensure of the first egg-based influenza vaccine in 1945, the primary influenza protective intervention is the use of hemagglutinin (HA)-directed vaccines. Influenza A HAs are phylogenetically divided into 2 groups, group 1 and group 2. Each group contains multiple HA subtypes, of which only H1 (group 1) and H3 (group 2) subtypes are currently circulating in humans. The immunodominance of the HA head results in an immune response directed primarily against the antigenically variable HA head. These anti-HA head responses are highly potent, but highly strain-specific, contributing to the suboptimal vaccine efficacy of current commercial influenza vaccines, which can be as low as 10% and rarely exceeds 60%2. In addition, the licensed vaccines provide little protection against influenza viruses with HA subtypes of pandemic potential that are not currently circulating in the human population such as H2, H5, H9, H7, and H102.The immunologically subdominant HA stem is an attractive target for vaccine design for multiple reasons. The HA stem contains viral fusion machinery which plays an essential role during viral entry into the host cell3,4. The HA stem is also far more conserved than the HA head across influenza subtypes and more resistant to antibody escape mutations5,6,7. Multiple broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target the stem have been identified both after influenza infection and vaccination, and the presence of anti-stem antibodies independently correlates with protection in humans8,9,10,11,12,13.Multiple strategies have been used to design immunogens capable of inducing HA stem-directed antibodies. Vaccine concepts include chimeric HAs combining HA heads of non-circulating subtypes with the stem of seasonal HA subtypes14,15,16, multivalent display of stem peptides on virus-like particles17, and hyperglycosylation of the HA head region to dampen immune responses to it18. Another strategy to subvert the immunodominance of the HA head region is to design “headless” stem antigens19,20,21,22,23,24. Through structure-based design we and others have produced stabilized stem trimers that are both structurally and antigenically intact19,20,21,22,23,24. These stabilized stem trimers can be displayed on Helicobacter (H.) pylori ferritin nanoparticles, further enhancing their immunogenicity22,24,25,26. In a phase I vaccine clinical trial, the H1 stabilized stem ferritin nanoparticle (H1ssF) vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and induced bnAbs specific for group 1 subtypes26. However, H1ssF did not induce group 2 cross-reactive antibodies, demonstrating the need for immunogens that can generate protective antibodies against group 2 subtypes. Pre-clinical data indicated that a nanoparticle displaying the stabilized stem of H10 (H10ssF) provided superior protection to mice following group 2 influenza viral challenge compared to either H3 or H7 stabilized stem contructs25. Here, we report the results of the first-in-human vaccine trial in which volunteers were vaccinated with a group 2 H10ssF nanoparticle, derived from an H10N8 influenza virus (A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013). The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the H10ssF vaccine. The secondary objective was to evaluate H10ssF-induced antibody responses.ResultsTrial design and participantsBetween 8 October 2020 and 22 April 2021, we enrolled 25 healthy adults to receive the H10ssF vaccine (Fig. 1, Table 1). Participants received either a single 20 mcg dose, or two 60 mcg doses 16 weeks apart. All participants were followed for 40 weeks. Trial accrual was closed prior to the onset of the 2021 influenza season over concern of a prolonged enrollment period impacting participant baseline immunity. This resulted in incomplete enrollment in the single 20 mcg dose group and the 55–70 years cohort of the two 60 mcg dose groups. The participants had a mean age of 40 years (range 22–66) and were 60% male (n = 15). Most participants (80%) had received at least three seasonal influenza vaccines in the five years preceding the trial (Supplementary Table 1). The first three participants enrolled (18–50 years of age) each received a single 20 mcg dose of H10ssF. One participant completed all study visits; one was lost to follow-up after the week 12 visit; the third withdrew due to a time commitment after week 28. The trial escalated to a 60 mcg dose after the protocol safety review team reviewed the outcomes in the 20 mcg participants and assessed the vaccine to be safe for further investigation. Twenty-two participants each received two doses of 60 mcg H10ssF with a 16 week interval. Of these 22 participants, 17 (77%) completed all study visits. No participants withdrew from the trial due to safety or tolerability concerns. Five (23%) participants were lost to follow-up or withdrew between weeks 28 and 40 due to relocations or concerns over the time commitment required for participation (Fig. 1). The last study visit occurred on 27 January 2022.Fig. 1: Study CONSORT Diagram.Twenty-five healthy adults aged 18–70 years old enrolled between 8 October 2020 and 22 April 2021 to receive 20 mcg H10ssF once (n = 3) or 60 mcg H10ssF twice (n = 22) with an interval of 16 weeks between vaccines. A total of 7 early terminations resulted from participant relocation (n = 4), early withdrawal due to time commitment (n = 1), or loss of participant to follow-up (n = 2). All participants were monitored for safety and immunogenicity until study completion or termination.Full size imageTable 1 Participant demographicsFull size tableH10ssF vaccination was safe and well toleratedAdministration of the H10ssF vaccine in this trial revealed a favorable safety profile. Five asymptomatic adverse events (AEs) attributed to vaccination occurred (Supplementary Table 2). These included single cases of mild leukopenia, mild lymphopenia, and mild and moderate neutropenia, occurring 4 weeks after the first dose of vaccine. Additionally, a single mild AE of increased aspartate aminotransferase was detected 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Although the resolution of neutropenia in a 20 mcg dose recipient who was lost to follow-up could not be confirmed, all other vaccine-attributed AEs self-resolved by the following study visit. One influenza-like illness was reported in a 60 mcg dose recipient six days after their week 17 visit, but a nasal swab from the participant was PCR-negative for influenza virus.The H10ssF vaccine was well tolerated in this trial (Fig. 2). The only solicited reactogenicity reported in the 20 mcg dose group was a single episode of mild malaise. Half (n = 11) of the 60 mcg dose recipients reported no reactogenicity after each vaccination and the remaining participants experienced only mild symptoms. The most frequently reported local reactogenicity symptom in the 60 mcg recipients was mild painenderness at the injection site, reported by 8/22 (36%). The most common systemic symptom in the 60 mcg dose recipients was mild malaise (5/22, 23%), followed by myalgia (4/22, 18%). The incidence and severity of reported reactogenicity were similar after both the first and second vaccinations.Fig. 2: The H10ssF vaccine elicited mild reactogenicity.Percentage of participants (x-axis) reporting solicited reactogenicity symptoms (y-axis) in the seven days following each vaccination. For symptoms persisting more than 1 day, a single count per person at the maximum severity of the symptom was plotted. No injection site redness, pruritus, bruising, or fevers were reported. N/A indicates that no second vaccination was administered to the dose group.Full size imageTo explore the possibility that the H. pylori ferritin nanoparticle elicits a cross-reactive immune response against human ferritin, we measured antibody responses against H. pylori and human ferritin antigens following vaccination in an exploratory evaluation (Supplementary Fig. 1). The H10ssF vaccine elicited binding antibodies specific for the H. pylori ferritin component of the nanoparticle (week 20 compared to baseline, p < 0.0001). However, as observed previously with this vaccine platform26,27, binding antibodies specific for the antigenically distinct human ferritin proteins did not significantly increase over baseline levels.H10ssF elicited antibodies against autologous H10 HAWe next assessed the immunogenicity of the H10ssF by measuring the antibody responses to HA. Since the purpose of the 20 mcg dose group was to establish a safety profile for the H10ssF vaccine, the immunogenicity results for this group are separated from the 60 mcg groups and reported in the supplement (Supplementary Fig. 2).Vaccine-induced homologous H10-binding serum antibody responses were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, Fig. 3), with binding antibodies quantified in arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL, see Methods for details). Antibodies specific to H10 stabilized stem (H10ss) and H10 full-length (H10FL) were significantly (p < 0.001) increased from baseline at all timepoints following H10ssF vaccination (Fig. 3a, b). By week 2, binding antibodies for the H10ss antigen increased 5.0-fold (Fig. 3c). Similarly, H10FL binding responses increased 3.7-fold (Fig. 3d). The second H10ssF dose significantly (p < 0.001) increased the week 18 geometric means (GMs) of H10ss- and H10FL-binding antibodies from baseline (7.9-fold and 4.7-fold, respectively) and from the week 16 values (2.6-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively). These responses remained significantly elevated above baseline through 40 weeks (p < 0.001). In summary, the H10ssF vaccine elicited H10-specific binding antibodies following both the first and second vaccine administrations that remained elevated through the end of the study.Fig. 3: H10ssF vaccination elicited antibodies against homologous H10 HA antigens.Binding antibodies were assayed using H10 stabilized stem (H10ss, a, c) or full-length (H10FL, b, d) antigens by ECLIA. The AU/mL GM of the 60 mcg recipients’ binding antibodies (a, b) or fold change compared to baseline (c, d) are shown in black with 95% CI. Individual participants’ AU/mL are shown in red or blue lines based on their age group. In (c) and (d), the dashed line represents no fold change from baseline. Symbols in (a) and (b) indicate where the AU/mL GM values at week 2, 16, 18, or 40 after vaccination were significantly different (p < 0.001) from the AU/mL GM at day 0 or week 16.Full size imageHomologous H10N8 neutralizing antibody titers were also significantly increased (p ≤ 0.007) at all timepoints after vaccination (Fig. 4), as evaluated by a reporter microneutralization assay28. More than half (14/22, 64%) of participants had H10N8 neutralizing antibody responses below the assay limit of detection (LOD, IC50 of 40) at baseline; however, 17 of 22 (77%) 60 mcg dose participants responded to the H10ssF vaccine with detectable neutralization titers by week 2. The geometric mean titer (GMT) for the 60 mcg dose group at week 2 was IC50 of 85 (95% CI: 52–140). The second dose further increased the H10N8 neutralizing GMTs to IC50 of 116 at week 18, a significant increase from both baseline (p < 0.001) and the week 16 GMT IC50 of 54 (95% CI: 34–87), (p ≤ 0.001). These responses remained significantly elevated over baseline by 40 weeks after vaccination (p = 0.001). Similar kinetics were observed when the data were assessed in IC80 titers, including significant increases in H10-neutralizing antibodies over baseline at weeks 2, 16, 18, and 40, as well as a significant increase at week 18 over week 16 (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, the group GM IC80 titer was below the assay LOD at week 2. Together the data demonstrate that each 60 mcg administration of the H10ssF vaccine increased the magnitude of binding and neutralizing antibody responses to H10 HA, which remained significantly elevated throughout the duration of the study.Fig. 4: H10ssF vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies against H10N8 A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013.The geometric mean IC50 neutralizing antibody titers (GMT) and 95% CI of all 60 mcg H10ssF recipients are shown in black, with individual participants’ values in red or blue based on their age group. The dotted line indicates the assay LOD. Brackets indicate two time points that are significantly different from each other with the p value noted above the line. When the significance between a timepoint and baseline is p ≤ 0.001, this is noted by a symbol above the later timepoint. When LOD imputation with zero produced a different p value than imputation with half LOD, results are reported as p ≤ x, where x is the least significant p value resulting from the two test methods.Full size imageAnimal studies have fostered an increasing appreciation of the protective role of Fc-mediated effector functions in influenza infection29. Studies in mice have shown a role of Fc-mediated effector functions for both head- and stem-directed antibodies in protective responses to influenza virus30,31. To expand upon the microneutralization results and to confirm the presence of functional H10-specific antibodies, participant serum was assessed in a dimeric FcγRIIIa assay (Supplementary Fig. 4). FcγRIIIa is the only activating Fc receptor found on NK cells and is therefore critical for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)32,33. The dimeric FcγRIIIa assay was previously shown to correlate with ADCC activity34. The geometric mean dimeric FcγRIIIa binding response was significantly increased at all timepoints evaluated following vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 4a), peaking 1.7-fold over baseline levels at week 18 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This suggests that the polyclonal H10ssF-elicited serum may include antibodies with FcγRIIIa-mediated functionality in addition to direct virus neutralization.H10ssF elicited cross-reactive antibody responses against group 2 influenza HAsGiven the goal of increasing broad stem-directed antibody titers with this vaccine platform, the antibody responses against additional influenza HA antigens were also investigated. H10ssF vaccination significantly increased heterologous binding antibody AU/mL GMs for other group 2 influenza antigens, including H7ss, H7FL, and H3ss (Fig. 5) at all timepoints (p < 0.001). The binding antibody AU/mL GMs for the H7ss, H7FL, and H3ss antigens at week 2 were 3.1-, 2.3-, and 2.8-fold over baseline, respectively. The second dose significantly increased the antibody GMs at week 18 compared to the week 16 samples (p < 0.001 for H7ss and H3ss antigens, p = 0.013 for H7FL). Additionally at week 18, the binding antibody GMs for H7ss, H7FL, and H3ss antigens were 6.9-, 2.2-, and 4.2-fold over baseline, respectively. However, there was little to no increase in neutralizing antibodies to H3N2 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 5) and H7N9-specific neutralizing antibodies were not observed in any participant following vaccination. No significant increases in binding antibody GMs were observed for group 1 influenza antigens at any time after infection (Supplementary Fig. 6), nor were neutralizing GMTs increased for H1N1 A/Michigan/45/2015 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Although no H7N9-specific neutralizing antibodies were observed, the dimeric FcγRIIIa assay detected H7FL-specific antibodies in some participants (Supplementary Fig. 8). Together these data demonstrate that the H10ssF vaccine potently elicits a broadly cross-reactive group 2 influenza HA antibody response with limited neutralization breadth.Fig. 5: H10ssF vaccination elicited binding antibodies against heterologous group 2 influenza HAs.Binding antibodies were assayed using the H7 stabilized stem (H7ss, a, b) or full-length (H7FL, c, d) antigens, or the H3ss antigen (e, f) by ECLIA. The GM of the 60 mcg recipients’ binding antibodies in AU/mL (a, c, e) or fold change (b, d, f) are shown with 95% CI in black, with individual participants’ AU/mL in red or blue based on their age group. In (b), (d), (f), the dashed line represents no change over baseline. Brackets indicate two time points that are significantly different from each other, with the p value noted above the line. When the significance between a timepoint and baseline is p < 0.001, this is noted by a symbol above the later timepoint.Full size imageH10ssF elicited equivalent immune responses in younger and older adultsRecent data suggests that an individual’s first influenza exposure can skew subsequent responses towards stronger influenza HA group 1 or group 2 immunity35. We hypothesized that participants born after the group 2 H3N2 subtype emerged as a pandemic strain in 1968 might have improved immune responses to H10ssF when compared to participants initially imprinted only with group 1 influenza viruses. Therefore, participants were recruited from birth years prior to 1965, when only group 1 (H1N1 and H2N2) influenza subtypes were circulating (ages 55–70 at the time of the trial) or after 1970, following the 1968 group 2 H3N2 influenza pandemic (ages 18–50 at the time of the trial). However, few significant differences between age cohorts were observed in a protocol-specified subgroup comparison. Older individuals had higher baseline binding antibody GMs to the group 2 H7ss, H7FL, and group 1 H5ss antigens (Supplementary Fig. 9). For the H5ss antigen, this baseline difference (p = 0.026) was maintained, with the 55–70-year-old participants displaying a significantly higher GM at weeks 16 and 40 after the first vaccination (p = 0.049 and p = 0.043, respectively) as compared to 18–50 years old participants, underscoring our observation that H10ssF vaccination did not affect immune responses to this antigen. In contrast, the baseline differences for the H7 antigens (p = 0.013 for H7ss and p = 0.021 for H7FL) were largely eliminated following vaccination, with the only significant difference detected after vaccination being greater H7FL-specific antibody GMs among the older cohort at week 40 (p = 0.023). No other significant differences between the age groups were observed for any binding or neutralizing antibody responses in the trial. Overall, no detectable impact of age-based immune imprinting was observed on vaccine-elicitation of group 2 stem antibodies after H10ssF vaccination.DiscussionHere we report the results of the first-in-human phase I clinical trial evaluating a group 2 influenza stabilized stem nanoparticle vaccine. This immunogen, a ferritin nanoparticle displaying eight H10 HA stem trimers from A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013 (H10ssF), had a favorable safety profile and was immunogenic. Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity was mild in all trial participants. Administration of a 60 mcg dose of H10ssF significantly and durably increased binding antibody titers above baseline levels for group 2 antigens (including H10ss, H10FL, H7ss, H7FL, and H3ss) after both the first and the second vaccinations through 40 weeks after the first vaccination. Vaccination also induced anti-stem antibody-mediated modest increases in homologous H10N8 neutralizing antibody titers. Vaccination with H10ssF did not induce antibody binding responses to the group 1 antigens studied (H1ss or H5ss). In this small study, we saw no evidence of age-based antigen imprinting in the response to vaccination with H10ssF. Overall, the H10ssF vaccine was safe and well tolerated in this trial population and elicited antibody responses against the group 2 influenza antigens evaluated.The data show that the H10ssF vaccine induced stem-directed antibodies in serum as measured by both binding and functional antibody assays. The ECLIA demonstrated broad group 2 influenza responses to not only the homologous H10ss antigen, but also to heterologous group 2 influenza stabilized HA stems derived from H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 and H3N2 A/Finland/486/2004. At least a four-fold increase in binding antibodies was detected for all three group 2 influenza stem antigens. Although the removal of the HA head and introduction of stabilizing changes in the stem amino acid sequence could result in immunologically novel epitopes on the H10ssF vaccine, the vaccine elicited binding antibodies against full-length H7 and H10 HA antigens, demonstrating that H10ssF does induce antibodies against native group 2 stem epitopes. Additionally, vaccination with H10ssF elicited an H10N8 neutralizing antibody response with similar kinetics to the binding antibody responses.In our recent phase 1 trial evaluating the group 1 H1ssF vaccine26, H1ssF induced broadly binding antibodies to group 1 H1, H2, and H5 stem antigens and increased neutralizing titers against H1N1, H2N2, and H5N1 reporter viruses. In contrast, the immunogen used in this trial induced limited neutralizing responses against group 2 H3N2, H7N9, and H10N8 reporter viruses. Several factors may contribute to the limited generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies by H10ssF compared to the group 1 H1ssF vaccine. It is generally accepted that initial adult vaccine responses are driven by the activation of pre-existing memory B and plasma cells36. It is possible that differences in prior human exposure to the vaccine antigens used in these two trials may have contributed to these disparate results. Humans have been repeatedly exposed to the H1ssF vaccine-matched seasonal H1 subtype, whereas the H10ssF vaccine relies on a preexisting memory repertoire to the vaccine-mismatched seasonal H3 subtype, as only nine human H10 influenza infections have been reported worldwide37. Consequently, unlike the H1ssF vaccination, there is no H10 primary response to boost. More importantly, most isolated and characterized broadly neutralizing stem antibodies are specific to group 1 HAs38,39. The lower threshold development path for group 1 HA broadly neutralizing stem antibodies such as those of the VH1-69 antibody lineage may also contribute to their more efficient induction. Fifty to 60% of the identified group 1 stem-directed neutralizing antibodies36 are derived from the VH1-69 gene, in which the germline-encoded CDR H2 contacts group 1 HA stems with only the antibody heavy chain40 and requires only modest somatic hypermutation for high affinity binding and neutralization41. The generation of group 2 HA stem-directed bnAbs appears to be more diverse and restricted41. Therefore, a group 2 stabilized stem vaccination may have fewer pre-existing cross-reactive group 2 responses to boost than a group 1 stabilized stem vaccine. Although difficult to induce, cross-reactive group 2 antibodies have been identified after influenza infection and vaccination. The use of adjuvants or the use of an HA stem from a different group 2 subtype may improve these neutralizing antibody responses.Some stem-directed reactive antibodies require IgG Fc receptor (FcγR) engagement for optimal protection in vivo42. Indeed, prior small animal studies show discordance between in vitro neutralization activity and in vivo protective efficacy that may be explained by Fc-mediated functions30,31. Accordingly, a dimeric FcγRIIIa assay, which is a correlative readout of ADCC activity34, identified increases in FcγRIIIa-cross-linking functionality following H10ssF vaccination. Additional vaccine-induced Fc-mediated effector functions, including complement C1q deposition (shown to enhance HA stem-directed neutralizing activity)43, may also have been missed by our readouts.The small number of participants, unblinded dosing, and lack of multiple comparison adjustments, while typical for a phase 1 clinical trial, do limit the strength of our conclusions. Importantly, this trial was powered for the primary safety and secondary immunogenicity endpoints of the trial, not for efficacy. The COVID-19 pandemic suppressed enrollments, and the trial was closed to accrual before a new influenza season could confound the baseline immunity of the participant pool. Therefore, the group sizes were smaller than intended. Nonetheless, this trial revealed significant vaccine-induced elicitation of stem-directed antibodies to group 2 HA subtypes in the participants following vaccination with H10ssF.The limited efficacy and required annual reformulations of the currently licensed influenza vaccines make the improvement of influenza vaccines a priority. Although a truly universal influenza vaccine is beyond the scope of current approved vaccine technology, ongoing efforts from our group and others aim to improve upon the available influenza vaccine platforms. Self-assembling stabilized stem nanoparticles offer the advantage of enabling the boosting of heterosubtypic antibodies and are amenable to mRNA vaccine formulation. There is an ongoing trial evaluating the group 1 (H1ssF) vaccine in a mRNA vaccine format (NCT05755620). This trial and our previous study using a group 1 stabilized stem ferritin nanoparticle26 serve as proof of principle that group 1 and group 2 stabilized stem nanoparticle vaccines are safe and well tolerated and capable of inducing both stem-directed binding and neutralizing antibodies. A cocktail of group 1 and group 2 stabilized stem nanoparticles elicits both group 1 and group 2 HA as well as cross-group stem-directed antibody responses in preclinical animal models25, and is being evaluated in an ongoing trial (NCT05155319). Our pre-clinical and clinical trial results demonstrate the usefulness of a headless group 2 stabilized influenza HA stem construct in expanding subdominant and cross-reactive stem-specific immune responses.MethodsExperimental designThis phase 1, open-label, dose escalation clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04579250) was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of H10ssF in healthy adults. The primary objectives were evaluation of safety and tolerability of the vaccine after a single 20 mcg dose or two 60 mcg doses administered 16 weeks apart. The secondary objectives were evaluation of the antibody responses at two weeks after each vaccination with 20 mcg or 60 mcg H10ssF. The doses were chosen based on prior clinical experience with the ferritin nanoparticle vaccine platform26. Group sizes were selected to ensure the ability to detect severe adverse events and to allow for meaningful immunogenicity studies. For the 20 mcg dose participants (n = 5), there was a 90% chance to observe at least one SAE if the true rate was at least 0.369 and a more than 90% chance to observe no SAE if the true rate was less than 0.021. For the 60 mcg dose participants, within each age cohort (n = 15), there was a greater than 90% chance to observe at least one SAE if the true rate was at least 0.145 and a more than 90% chance to observe no SAE if the true rate was no more than 0.0069. To assess the primary safety and tolerability endpoints, participants recorded solicited local and systemic reactogenicity for seven days following vaccination, and clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted at protocol-specified visits for 40 weeks. Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 28 days after each vaccination, graded according to a modified FDA Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adults and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials (see Protocol). Influenza-like illness (ILI), serious adverse events, and new chronic medical conditions were recorded for the duration of the clinical trial, which lasted 40 weeks after the first vaccination. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for ILIs for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection by PCR. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of H10 stem-specific antibody responses at two weeks after each vaccination.The H10ssF (VRC-FLUNPF0103-00-VP) vaccine is a ferritin nanoparticle displaying eight stabilized-stem HA trimers from A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013 (H10N8, equivalent to A/Jiangxi-Donghu/IPB13/2013) influenza. H. pylori non-heme ferritin spontaneously assembles into stable nanoparticles, allowing influenza HA protomers expressed on each ferritin monomer to associate and properly fold into HA trimers44. The H10ss antigen was developed by replacing the H10 head with a glycine-rich linker, followed by a series of structure-based mutations to improve expression and immunogenicity24,25. The H10ssF vaccine was developed at the Vaccine Production Program Laboratory (VPPL) and produced at the VRC pilot plant (operated under contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, MD) under Good Manufacturing Practices. The vaccine was vialed at 0.7 ± 0.1 mL in 3 mL glass vials at a concentration of 180 ± 36 mcg/mL. The formulation buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mM sodium chloride, 5% w/v sucrose, and 0.01% w/v Pluronic F-68 (Poloxamer 188). The vaccine was stored frozen at −35 °C to −15 °C and thawed immediately prior to use. To administer the 20 mcg dose, the vaccine was diluted in sterile PBS, whereas no dilution was needed to administer the 60 mcg dose.H10ssF was administered by needle and syringe into the deltoid muscle. Participants were observed for a minimum of 30 min following each injection, including recording vital signs and local reactogenicity. Safety was first established at 20 mcg. Once the protocol safety review team (PSRT) found no safety concerns by two weeks after the first three participants received 20 mcg, a dose-escalation ensued with enrollment of 18–50-year olds to receive the 60 mcg dose. An additional safety review per protocol occurred following two weeks of safety observations for the first three recipients of 60 mcg H10ssF before enrollment was opened for administration of second doses of 60 mcg H10ssF and for enrollment of the older cohort of individuals, aged 55–70 years. Participants aged 51–54 at the start of the trial (birth years 1965 to 1970) were excluded to establish two distinct cohorts based on likely first influenza exposure.The trial was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center by the VRC Clinical Trials Program, NIAID, NIH in Bethesda, MD. Participants were recruited from the greater Washington, DC area with NIH institutional review board (IRB)-approved written and electronic media, advertisement campaigns, and community outreach strategies. Inclusion criteria specified the selection of adults aged 18–70 (exclusive of individuals born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1970), in general good health, and who had received at least one licensed influenza vaccine from 2015 to the time of enrollment. Exclusion criteria included receipt of a previous investigational H10 influenza vaccine and receipt of a licensed influenza vaccine within 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Full exclusion and inclusion criteria are included in the study protocol (https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/50/NCT04579250/Prot_SAP_001.pdf). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. The study followed guidelines for conducting clinical human subjects research in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46 from the US Department of Health and Human Services, US Food and Drug Administration regulations for investigational products, and principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The clinical trial protocol was reviewed and approved by the NIH IRB.Immunological MethodsParticipants’ serum samples were collected for immunogenicity analyses between baseline and 40 weeks after vaccination. HA binding antibodies were assayed using the Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) 10-Assay U-PLEX Development Pack (Cat# K15235N). Protein ligands were biotinylated at an AviTag site located proximal to the C-terminus from the trimer foldon, coupled to a unique streptavidin U-PLEX linker at 10 mcg/mL, and combined to form a multiplexed coating solution according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The stabilized stem proteins included: H1ss: A/Michigan/45/2015, H3ss: A/Finland/486/2004, H5ss: A/Indonesia/05/2005, H7ss: A/Anhui/1/2013, and H10ss: A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013. The full-length proteins were H7FL: A/Shanghai/02/2013 and H10FL: A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013. 96-well U-PLEX plates were coated for 1 h shaking at room temperature (RT). Following coating, plates were washed and incubated with serially diluted test samples and reference standard for 1 h shaking at RT. 315-53-1F12 (group 1 and 2 binding) antibody was used as a reference standard28. The binding of 50 ng/mL of 315-53-1F12 to H10ss was assigned a value of 100 arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL)26. AU/mL values for 315-53-1F12 binding to the heterologous HAs were assigned relative to H10ss binding. After sample incubation, plates were washed and 0.25 mcg/mL SULFO-TAG (MSD, cat #R91AO-1)-labeled anti-human IgG, IgM, and IgA (H + L) secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Cat#31128, RRID AB_228255, lot #0031128) was added for 1 h, shaking at RT. After the detection antibody incubation, plates were washed and a 1X MSD Read Buffer was applied, and plates were analyzed using the MSD Sector Imager S600. All samples were tested in duplicate. Samples with a replicate coefficient of variation > 30% were retested. Serial dilutions of samples within the dynamic range of the standard curve were interpolated to determine a sample’s AU/mL. Results were plotted and analyzed using Prism version 8 or newer (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).Anti-ferritin binding antibodies were measured by MSD ECLIA. MSD 96-well bare plates (Cat# L15XA-3) were coated with respective ferritin proteins for 16–24 h at 4 °C. Ferritin antigens used were those previously described26,27. Following the overnight incubation, plates were washed and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, shaking at RT. Following blocking, plates were washed and incubated with serially diluted test samples (1:100 followed by seven 3-fold serial dilutions) and control for 2 h shaking at RT. Plates were then washed and 5 mcg/mL SULFO-TAG (MSD, cat #R91AO-1)-labeled anti-human IgG, IgM, and IgA (H + L) secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Cat#31128, RRID AB_228255, lot #0031128) was added for 1 h, shaking at RT. After the detection antibody incubation, plates were washed, 1X MSD Read Buffer was applied, and plates were analyzed using the MSD Sector Imager S600. All samples were tested in duplicate. Serial dilutions of the sample were used to calculate and assign an area under the curve (AUC) value as the primary readout. Results were plotted and analyzed using Prism version 8 or newer (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Samples with a replicate coefficient of variation >30% were retested.Generation of the replication-restricted reporter (R3ΔPB1) virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H10N8, as well as “rewired” replication-restricted reporter (R4ΔPB1) virus H7N9 is described elsewhere28. Briefly, to produce the R3ΔPB1 viruses the viral genomic RNA encoding functional PB1 was replaced with a gene encoding the fluorescent protein (TdKatushka2), whereas R4ΔPB1 H7N9 virus has the PB1 and H1 viral segments modified (“rewired”) to prevent HA reassortment: the HA coding region was inserted between PB1 genomic packaging signals and the fluorescent protein TdKatushka2 between the HA genomic packaging signals. The R3/R4ΔPB1 viruses were rescued by reverse genetics and propagated in the complementary cell line which expresses PB1 constitutively. Each virus stock was titrated by determining the fluorescent units per mL (FU/mL) prior to use in the experiments. For virus titration, serial dilutions of virus stock in OptiMEM were mixed with pre-washed MDCK-SIAT1-PB1 cells (8 × 105 cells/ml) and incubated in a 384-well plate in quadruplicate (25 mcL/well). Plates were incubated for 18–26 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After incubation, fluorescent cells were imaged and counted by using a Celigo Image Cytometer (Nexcelom) with a customized red filter for detecting TdKatushka2 fluorescence.Neutralization activity of serum antibodies was determined using a reporter virus microneutralization assay as previously described26,28. Briefly, serial dilutions of Receptor Destroying Enzyme-treated serum were mixed with an equal volume of R3/R4ΔPB1 virus. The reporter viruses used were H10N8: A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013, H7N9: A/Anhui/1/2013, H3N2v: A/Indiana/10/2011, H3N2: A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016, and H1N1: A/Michigan/45/2015. After incubation, pre-washed MDCK-SIAT1-PB1 cells were added to the serum-virus mixtures and transferred to 384-well plates in quadruplicate (25 mcL/well). Plates were incubated and imaged as described above. The percent neutralization was calculated for each well by constraining the virus control (virus plus cells) as 0% neutralization and the cell-only control (no virus) as 100% neutralization. A 7-point neutralization curve was plotted against serum dilution for each sample, and a five-parameter logistic curve fit generated using LabKey was used to estimate the 50% (IC50, dilution−1) or 80% (IC80, dilution−1) inhibitory concentrations. Of note, serum dilutions take into account the sera concentrations after mixing with virus at 1:1 ratio. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 40 dilution−1; one-half the LOD (20 dilution−1) was used to impute values below the LOD. For the calculation of GMTs, the results using the one-half LOD imputation were reported. Because most participants had an H10 neutralizing antibody titer below the LOD at baseline, statistical comparisons between time points for the H10 assay were subjected to a sensitivity analysis. Substitution of zero instead of half LOD did not change the conclusions of statistical testing. When different imputation methods changed the p value, the significance was reported as p ≤ x, where x is the least significant p value resulting from the two test methods.The capacity of anti-HA antibodies in participant sera to bind human FcγRIIIa was measured using a recombinant soluble human FcγRIIIa (rsFcγRIIIa) dimer ELISA as previously described45. Briefly, 50 ng of recombinant H10 HA protein for the H10N8: A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013 virus or recombinant H7 HA from the H7N9: A/Shanghai/02/2013 virus was coated in the wells of 96-well NUNC Maxisorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. The wells of the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Two-fold serial dilutions of participant sera, starting at a 1:10 dilution, were added to the wells of the plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed then incubated with 50 mcL of 0.1 mcg/mL biotinylated human rsFcγRIIIa dimer for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, plates were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of Pierce High Sensitivity HRP-Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C then washed. The color was developed by adding 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) then stopped with 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and absorbance read at 450 nm on a SPECTROstar Nano microplate reader (BMG Labtech).Statistical methodsBinding and neutralizing antibody titers were log10-transformed before analysis, after which data was assumed to be normally distributed. Binding antibody AU/mL GM or neutralizing antibody GMT and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated for each antigen at each time point. Comparisons of antibody AU/mL or neutralization titers between weeks were made using paired t tests. Fold changes and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated. Between group comparisons were performed pairwise at each available time point using two-sample t tests unless noted otherwise and are exploratory because of small group sample sizes. For the microneutralization assay, values at the LOD were imputed to half the LOD. GMT and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated for each antigen at each time point. To determine whether the H10ssF vaccine increases ferritin binding antibody responses, two-sided Wilcoxon Sign-Rank tests were performed stratified by group. For the FcγRIIIa analysis, absorbance readouts over the entire dilution series were used to calculate an area under the curve (AUC) for each sample. The AUC calculation was performed using the trapezoid method in R using the package DescTools46. AUCs were log10-transformed before analysis. AUC GMs and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated at each time point. Fold-changes between visits with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated, and comparisons between weeks were made using paired t tests. Between group comparisons were performed pairwise at each available time point using two-sample t tests. All analyses were two sided and results were deemed significant if the p value < 0.05. No multiple comparison adjustments were employed per protocol. R version 4.3.0 was used to analyze the microneutralization and ADCC data. R version 4.2.1 was used to analyze the anti-ferritin and ECLIA data. Data availability All data associated with this study are present in the paper or the Supplementary Materials.

Of 158 children who were eligible to receive the vaccine and had known vaccination status, 131 (83%) were not fully vaccinated.Half were in previously healthy kidsAmong the fatal cases, 73 were younger than 5 years old and 126 were ages 5 to 17. Roughly half involved influenza A. Of those with known subtypes, 43 had H1N1 and 16 had H3N2. Three children died from coinfections involving both influenza A and influenza B. Of 189 kids with health status information, 93 (49%) had at least one underlying medical condition.The CDC also noted a drop in flu vaccine uptake in kids for the 2023-24 season, with coverage 2.2 percentage points lower than the previous season and 8.5 percentage points lower than the prepandemic period. It also warned that vaccination disparities, such as urbanicity, race, and ethnicity, are worsening.The CDC said any number of children’s flu deaths is a deeply tragic reminder that flu can cause severe illness and deaths, with the risk highest in those with certain underlying health conditions. The group has recommended annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older and that children ages 6 months to 8 years old who have never received two flu shots before need two doses given 4 weeks apart. Massachusetts wraps up avian flu testing of all licensed dairy farms News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) said yesterday that it, along with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), has completed H5N1 avian flu testing of all 95 licensed dairy farms in the state, with no positive samples found. USDA/Peggy Greb/Flickr cc In a statement, MDAR said it is the only state in the nation to test all dairy herds and find no evidence of H5N1 infection. Massachusetts officials said they decided to test all herds to protect public health and to demonstrate the safety of the food supply from the state’s farms. MDAR inspectors visited the dairies in August to collect samples from bulk-milk tanks. The DPH worked with the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University to test samples at no cost to farmers.A few states, including Colorado and California, have done bulk-milk tank testing as part of enhanced surveillance in outbreak settings.USDA confirms another affected herd in CaliforniaThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed one more H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle, which involved another herd from California. The state now has 10 infected herds, which are all located in the Central Valley. The latest confirmation lifts the nation’s number of confirmed outbreaks to 208 across 14 states. WHO calls on countries to address gender inequalities in antimicrobial resistance News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship allg / iStock The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday released new guidance to help countries address key gender disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of drug-resistant infections.The document provides a summary of the evidence on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and gender and proposes recommendations for policymakers to consider when they develop, revise, implement, and monitor their national AMR action plans. "Gender influences people's exposure to infections, what they do to prevent infections and whether they seek timely care or try to treat themselves," Anand Balachandran, Unit Head for National Action Plans and Monitoring and Evaluation in WHO's AMR division, said in a press release. "Yet the majority of national action plans on AMR do not mention sex or gender."More antibiotic exposure for women, girlsAmong the key findings of the report are that lack of clean water and safe sanitation in the community and health facilities puts women and girls at increased risk of exposure to drug-resistant infections because of their menstrual hygiene needs, more frequent contact with the healthcare system, and their responsibility for household water provision. Women are also at heightened risk of an AMR infection because they represent 70% of the global workforce. On the other side, male-dominated professions such as animal husbandry, industrial farming, and slaughterhouse work can expose men to antibiotics and drug-resistant pathogens, while men's roles as primary income earners can contribute to their delaying diagnosis and treatment of resistant infections. Gender influences people's exposure to infections, what they do to prevent infections and whether they seek timely care or try to treat themselves.Meanwhile, stigma and negative experiences with the healthcare system can deter both men and women from seeking diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted and urinary tract infections. The WHO also found that women are 27% more likely to receive antibiotics throughout their lifetime than men, female doctors take a more conservative approach to antibiotic prescribing than their male counterparts, and antibiotic recommendations made by male pharmacists are more likely to be accepted than those made by female pharmacists.The guidance includes 20 recommendations aimed at identifying and addressing gender-specific vulnerabilities, embedding gender analysis into AMR research, incorporating policies that strive for gender equality into national AMR action plans, and promoting equitable access to antibiotics. Quick takes: H9N2 flu case in China, local dengue in Florida, NIH pan prep research network News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Dengue Pandemic Influenza Public Health China has reported another human case involving H9N2 avian influenza, its sixth of the year, according to the latest weekly avian influenza update from Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Protection. The patient is a 3-year-old girl from Guangdong province in the southern part of the country. Her symptoms began on August 12. No details were available about her condition or how she contracted the virus. H9N2 is a low-pathogenic virus in poultry in many countries, including China. Many of the earlier illnesses involved contact with poultry or poultry environments. The illnesses are often mild and often involve children. The Florida Department of Health (Florida Health) recently issued a mosquito-borne illness advisory for Palm Beach County following the confirmation of a locally acquired dengue infection. The state typically reports sporadic local cases, and the latest case marks the first of the year from Palm Beach County. In its surveillance update last week, Florida Health reported 31 local cases from six counties this year, of which 21 were from Miami-Dade County. Other affected counties include Hillsborough, Manatee, Monroe, Orange, and Pasco.The National Institutes of Health has established a pandemic preparedness research network with a goal of developing vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, and the group recently announced award recipients to make up the Research and Development of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) network. The group will focus on five virus families: Bunyavirales, Flaviviridae, Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae, and Togaviridae. The Research Triangle Institute in Durham, NC, will coordinate the network, which also includes projects at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of California, Irvine, the University of Texas Medical Branch, the University of Washington, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Washington University, St. Louis.

Saunders, County of San Diego Communications OfficeSep. 16, 2024 | 5:02 PMSep. 16, 2024 | 5:05 PM Reading Time: 2 minutesSan Diego County has become the fifth location in California to report the environmental detection of H5 influenza virus, commonly referred to as bird flu. This detection was made through wastewater testing conducted on Sept. 1, 2024, by WastewaterSCAN, a privately funded operation that monitors wastewater for pathogens at more than 150 sites nationwide and 57 sites across California. Regular follow up sampling has not detected any virus. H5 influenza regularly circulates in wild birds and occasionally causes human cases. Recent outbreaks of H5N1 in cattle and a small number of human cases, primarily in farm workers, have brought attention to the virus this year. The detection in San Diego County does not confirm the presence of a human H5 infection, the presence of live H5N1 virus, or the presence of the H5N1 B3.13 strain, also known as “Cattle Clade,” currently circulating in cattle and occasionally causing human disease in farm workers. H5 is also regularly detected in states with infected dairy herds such as Colorado, Michigan, and Texas. No detections of the H5 influenza virus have occurred in San Diego County cattle, birds or humans in 2024. There were wild bird detections in 2022 and 2023, and a poultry flock was infected in 2022. County Public Health Services conducts surveillance of human influenza cases all year round and receives information about lab confirmed case reports, hospitalizations and deaths. In addition, the Public Health Lab collaborates with a network of regional labs to perform advanced testing to identify novel strains that might be emerging in our region or flu virus that may not be well matched with the annual flu vaccine. Regular surveillance updates on major respiratory viruses including Influenza, COVID-19 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are available online. “San Diego County has a robust flu surveillance system,” said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, County interim public health officer. “While we have no evidence of the virus in people or animals, it is important to be transparent with the public both about the detection status and that we are vigilant and working with our partners at the California Department of Public Health, California Department of Food and Agriculture, and California Department of Fish and Wildlife to monitor for signs of H5 presence locally.” San Diego County has a closed sewage system, meaning that its stormwater and wastewater do not intentionally intermix. This greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the probability that this detection is from an environmental source such as migrating birds. The virus may have been introduced into wastewater by discarding of contaminated animal products, infected wild bird droppings entering the sewage system, human infection, or animal infection. More information about H5 can be found on the Public Health Services website. Related: avian flubird fluDr. KadakiaH5phspublic health Cassie N.

The study period spans the first 9 weeks of the ongoing H5N1 outbreak in US cattle and poultry, as well as 13 related human infections."As part of the response to this outbreak, CDC and state and local health departments are using wastewater surveillance to monitor influenza A virus and the H5 subtype; however, current testing techniques cannot distinguish between human and animal sources," the study authors wrote. Public health agencies that conduct wastewater monitoring to complement influenza surveillance systems should be prepared to add influenza A virus subtype testing when needed.Among 309 sites in 38 states that generated sufficient data from monitoring wastewater for influenza A from May 12 to July 13, 2024, 11 sites in four states (California, Illinois, Kansas, and Oregon) detected high concentrations of the virus. Three of the four states also had evidence of human flu activity from other surveillance systems. H5 subtype testing performed at 203 sites in 41 states revealed H5 in wastewater at 24 sites in nine states. Seven of the nine states with H5 in wastewater reported an H5N1-infected herd, and another state reported an infected herd before the study period. Two states, Colorado and Michigan, documented human H5N1 infections. Each detection or high concentration triggered the CDC to work with state and local health departments to analyze data from other flu surveillance systems. The agencies also worked with wastewater utilities and agriculture departments to identify potential sources of the virus.Of the 24 sites with H5 detections, 15 pinpointed animal sources in the sewershed or neighboring county, including eight milk-processing sources. Other sources were meat-processing and dairy facilities, wild birds, domestic poultry farms, and livestock waste from, for example, a truck wash. "The current zoonotic outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) virus highlights the importance of coordination across health, agriculture, wildlife, food safety, and other partners," the study authors wrote. "Investigations into wastewater signals also require coordination among public health, academic, municipal water treatment, and community partners.""Public health agencies that conduct wastewater monitoring to complement influenza surveillance systems should be prepared to add influenza A virus subtype testing when needed to improve understanding of influenza A virus detections in the context of the current HPAI A(H5N1) outbreak," they added. "CDC-funded National Wastewater Surveillance System’s Centers of Excellence are expanding influenza A virus testing and subtyping, which can contribute to source investigations and be deployed at strategic times and places."75% support public health wastewater monitoringFrom July 24 to 26, 2024, Porter Novelli Public Services fielded a nine-question online survey developed with the CDC to 1,016 US adults to gauge their support for wastewater infectious-disease monitoring and protective health behaviors to help shape messaging about wastewater surveillance. These findings indicate strong support for wastewater monitoring for infectious diseases among U.S. adults across various sociodemographic groups and intention to use reported wastewater data to guide certain health-related behaviors.In total, 74.6% of respondents strongly or somewhat supported public health wastewater monitoring for infectious diseases. The results were similar across races but varied significantly by age, education, and marital status.Participants strongly or somewhat agreed (57.8%) that they wanted access to rapid wastewater data, even if it contained insufficient information to determine public health risk or inform specific protective actions. Black respondents (67.5%) were most likely to say they wanted rapid wastewater data, followed by Hispanic (64.2%) and non-Hispanic people of other races (65.5%), and White people (52.9%). Respondents most supportive of rapid access to wastewater data were men, employed people, and those living in urban or suburban communities.Nearly all participants (95.3%) said they would consider taking at least one action to protect their health if wastewater data showed a virus such as flu in their area. The most-cited actions were more frequent handwashing (76.1%), avoidance of large gatherings (61.1%), and avoidance of visiting people at high risk for flu-related complications (59.1%)."These findings indicate strong support for wastewater monitoring for infectious diseases among U.S. adults across various sociodemographic groups and intention to use reported wastewater data to guide certain health-related behaviors," the researchers wrote."In addition, most respondents indicated that they wanted access to rapid wastewater data even if information available to determine public health risk or which actions should be taken is insufficient," they added. "Wastewater data can help keep the public informed and should be accompanied by clear public health interpretations."

John Beeby runs milk samples through a robot that automates part of the process. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) Inside Cornell Universityâs avian influenza testing lab By Emily Kenny, Report for America corps member Central NY PUBLISHED 2:47 PM ET Sep. 17, 2024 PUBLISHED 2:47 PM EDT Sep. 17, 2024 SHARE Gloved and masked behind a closed curtain under hoods vented with air filters, technicians at Cornellâs Animal Health Diagnostic Center open boxes of milk samples as they work to help slow the spread of a virus infecting hundreds of cows across the country. First discovered in March, 14 states in the U.S. have confirmed high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in livestock, and the research center has led the testing of these animals by tripling its capacity. A receiving supervisors opens samples from cows. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) âWe were hearing rumors that there were a high number of sick cows in the panhandle of Texas, and we knew other labs had done a lot of testing for the common diseases,â said Elisha Frye, a veterinarian and professor at Cornell University. âThe veterinarian mentioned there were dead birds and cats on the farm, which made me think of HPAI.â Frye and Diego Diel, a veterinarian and director of virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostics Lab, were both authors on the study confirming mammal to mammal spread of HPAI. It has not yet been detected in New York. Since March, the lab has tested 7,200 samples of milk from dairy cows. New York has implemented testing requirements for lactating animals going to county fairs and for cows coming into the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also has testing requirements for cows moving interstate. Mani Lejeune (left), Elisha Frye (center) and Diego Diel (right) stand for a portrait in the Animal Health Diagnostic Center. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) âI think that provided some sort of barrier for introduction of the first. It seems like thereâs not a lot of evidence that the virus continues to jump from birds to cattle, but it may have been a single introduction and is spreading with cattle movement,â Diel said. Mani Lejeune, director of molecular diagnostics at the lab and co-author on the same report, said this outbreak has helped the lab expand their testing capabilities. âBefore the outbreak if you had asked how many HPAI samples can our lab handle per day, if we stretch out resources thin, we could handle a maximum of 800 samples,â Lejeune said. HPAI samples are marked with an 'F' to help identify them when they come to the facility. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) Now, they can handle between 2,500 and 3,000 samples per day by automating some steps in the process. âAlthough we have not reached that yet, we are well prepared to handle any surge,â he said. The Animal Health Diagnostics Center is the veterinary diagnostics laboratory for New York and employs over 250 faculty and staff. The facility tested specimens from over 700,000 individual animals last year. It receives funding from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, Department of Enviornmental Conservation and the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. A look at the testing process Cornell has shipped nearly 22,000 test tubes to clinics across the Northeast, and all precautions are taken when they are returned. âWe open them, we go through the samples and the paperwork. We make sure that the samples they submitted is labeled with the right IDs, after that we enter the information into the system and it generates labels for us,â receiving supervisor Esref Dogan said. Dogan closes the curtain to seal off where they open the samples from other employees. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) When opening up the samples, each one is treated as if it could be positive. The staff wear personal protective equipment and open the packages in a sealed room to prevent any unnecessary exposure to other employees, Dogan said. Barcode labels are placed on the tubes in a specific location so when they go to the molecular lab, a robot can scan them. âAfter the barcode is read, it knows which sample is in each of these locations and so we use that same format for actually running the PCR and analyzing these samples,â laboratory manager John Beeby said. Testing GIFfrom Testing GIFs This system helps to eliminate human errors that can occur when running hundreds of tests a week, he said. The PCR test may be familiar as it was used frequently during the coronavirus pandemic. It stands for polymerase chain reaction and is a technique used to amplify a small section of DNA. âPolymerase chain reaction, itâs just looking for a specific DNA sequence of the pathogen of interest, so in this case, influenza,â Beeby said. The results are then analyzed with another computer before they are interpreted by lab technicians. Testing GIFfrom Testing GIFs Beeby said the outbreak has helped him and the laboratory staff be more prepared for larger amounts of samples. âWe wanted to be prepared for higher volumes, which is why we have these two robots that could handle maybe 2,000 probably even 3,000 samples a day. It was challenging and intense to get this up and running, but itâs definitely a much more comfortable feeling,â he said. Dogan checks the labels that will be placed on the test tubes (left). The robot scans the labels on the tubes (right). In the event of a ânon-negativeâ test result New York is not among the 14 states that have seen HPAI in livestock, but just last week California reported their first positive result suggesting that the virus is still spreading. âWe cannot call an HPAI result positive. We call it a non-negative and then that sample gets referred to the National Veterinary Services laboratory in Ames, Iowa, and they would test the sample to confirm,â Olson-Damaj said. After verifying the result, the state is notified and they implement their own procedures, she said. The samples are transferred throughout the building in a sealed container. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) For poultry that contract avian influenza, it results in rapid mortality but for dairy cattle the disease shows up first with lower milk production. âThe virus replicates mainly in the mammary gland or the udder of the affected cows resulting in severe mastitis. Mortality in dairy cows is debatable, but there is now some data coming out that indicate there is a slight increase in mortality in dairy, however, the disease is not nearly as severe as it is in poultry,â Diel said. Testing GIFfrom Testing GIFs This means the virus is found in milk samples of cows, but consumers purchasing milk from grocery stores are not at risk. âIf consumers consume dairy products that are subjected to FDA-approved pasteurization methods, then most likely the risk is very close to zero. However, raw milk products continue to pose a risk,â Diel said. For producers who have been impacted by HPAI, the USDA has funding available to offset the loss of that milk. Additionally, they offer funding to cover the costs of veterinary samples and improve biosecurity measures. Beeby explains the results of a sample, these indicate there is no presence of avian influenza.

Matt Bargar/Flickr cc Both patients sought care the week ending September 7, and neither were hospitalized. Both have recovered from their infections. The cases raise the nation's variant flu case total to nine for the season. Investigators found that the patients were not contacts of each other but had attended the same agricultural fair. One child had indirect contact with pigs, and the other had direct contact. One family member had COVIDThe probe into the first case found that that all household members became ill the day after attending the fair. One household member tested positive for COVID, and all recovered, including the first patient. Soon afterward, the first patient got sick with new symptoms and was tested for influenza A, which was further identified as H3N2v. No related illnesses were found among the first patient's contact.The investigation into the second case found no related illnesses among contacts. "No human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H3N2)v associated with either case was identified" the CDC said. US COVID markers show more declines News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 US COVID activity continued to decline in many areas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest updates. NIAID/Flickr cc Test positivity for COVID was 13.5% last week, down from 14.9% the week before.Hospitalizations continue to decline but remain highest in seniors, followed by adults ages 50 to 64 and children younger than age 4 years. Emergency department visits dropped about 19% compared to the previous week and are now at low levels across much of the country. Deaths held steady, and provisional data show that the CDC received reports of 563 COVID deaths for the week ending September 14.Detections of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are still high nationally, according to CDC tacking. The highest levels remain in the West, followed by the Midwest and the South. However, all regions show downward trends.The latest data from WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, show that detections are still high nationally and in the Midwest, with no significant up or down trend over the past 3 weeks.Very low uptake of COVID, flu vaccines in adultsIn its updates today, the CDC also had some respiratory virus vaccine uptake estimates. So far, about 2.8% of adults have received the updated COVID vaccine, and 6.8% have received a seasonal flu vaccine.Among adults ages 75 and older, 33.1% have reported ever receiving a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. California confirms more avian flu in dairy herds, poultry News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 6 more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in California dairy herds, raising the state's total to 16 since the virus was first found in the state's Central Valley dairy farms in the middle of August. pixinoo/iStock The detections push the national total of dairy farm outbreaks to 214 across 14 states.In another avian flu development, the USDA confirmed highly pathogenic avian flu at a commercial turkey farm in California. The California Department of Food and Agriculture said the detection at the turkey farm is the state's first in domestic poultry since the state was declared free of the virus at the end of June.Though Merced County is part of California's Central Valley, it's not clear if the turkey farm has any connection to the cattle outbreaks in that part of the state.FDA advisers to discuss human H5 vaccinesMeanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory group will discuss the composition of human H5 vaccines as part of preparedness for highly pathogenic as one of three topics at its upcoming meeting on October 10. The other topics on the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) agenda are recommendations on strain selection for seasonal flu vaccines for the Southern Hemisphere's 2025 season and research programs regarding departments that study viral diseases. FDA approves at-home FluMist administration News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza Vaccines The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced that it has approved self- or caregiver-administered FluMist, making it the first flu vaccine that doesn’t have to be administered by a healthcare provider. Karen Mower / iStock In a statement, the FDA said that MedImmune, the maker of FluMist, plans to offer the vaccine through a third-party pharmacy. People interested in the self or caregiver option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order the vaccine. If eligibility is established, the pharmacy writes the prescription and ships the vaccine to the person who placed the order.Then the vaccine is given at the household's convenience. The FDA recommends that a caregiver administer FluMist to those ages 2 to 17 years old.Convenient and accessiblePeter Marks, MD, PhD, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the approval gives people a new option for receiving a safe, effective flu vaccine that is more convenient, flexible, and accessible. “"Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death," he said.FluMist is the only needle-free seasonal flu vaccine option in the United States and is given intranasally. In use since 2003, the vaccine contains a weakened form of live virus strains. It is approved for use in people ages 2 through 49 years old. MedImmune is part of AstraZeneca, which filed for FDA approval of self- or caregiver-administration of FluMist in October 2023. Quick takes: Measles uptick in US, more polio cases in 3 countries News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Measles Polio The number of measles cases reported in the United States this year has risen to 262, up 11 from a week ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported today in an update. Of the patients, 107 (41%) have been hospitalized, with the highest percentage of hospitalizations seen in children under 5 (52%). Eighty-eight percent of the case-patients are either unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. A total of 13 measles outbreaks have been reported in 2024, compared with 4 reported in all of 2023, and 70% of cases are outbreak-associated. Thirty-two jurisdictions have reported measles cases, including Minnesota, which now has 51 cases from an outbreak that began in May.Three countries reported new polio cases this week, according to an update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Afghanistan reported one case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Kandahar province, bringing its total number of cases for 2024 to 19. Cameroon reported two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from Est province, its first two this year. In Nigeria, 4 cVDPV2 cases were reported from Yobe province, bringing its total number of cases this year to 53. GPEI also reported that the first round of an emergency polio vaccination campaign in Gaza was completed on September 12, with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 provided to an estimated 560,000 children under 10.

Learn More These CPT codes, updated by the CPT Editorial Panel, will be effective for use if vaccine candidates receive emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While the current public health risk is low, the update is being published now to ensure health systems across the country are prepared in advance of potential FDA authorization.There is no immediate recommendation to start vaccination of the general public or specific at-risk populations. However, federal agencies are actively planning for potential H5 vaccination, including beginning to stockpile vaccine should it be needed.“The new CPT code is a vital preparatory step in response to the potential danger to humans from a highly infectious avian influenza disease,” said AMA President Bruce A. Scott, MD, a Louisville, Kentucky-based otolaryngologist.“A CPT code that clinically distinguishes the avian influenza vaccine allows for data-driven tracking, reporting and analysis that supports planning, preparedness, and allocation of vaccines in case a public health response is needed for avian flu prevention,” Dr. Scott added. Here are the CPT updates Here are the CPT updates The new product code assigned to H5N8 influenza virus vaccines is:90695: Influenza virus vaccine, H5N8, derived from cell cultures, adjuvanted for intramuscular use.The new CPT code for H5N8 influenza virus vaccines should be used with one of the following administration codes to report the work counseling patients or caregivers, administering the vaccine and updating the medical record.For children (through 18 years old) the administration codes are:90460: Immunization administration through 18 years old via any route of administration, with counseling by physician or other qualified health care professional; first or only component of each vaccine or toxoid administered.90461: Immunization administration through 18 years old via any route of administration, with counseling by physician or other qualified health care professional; each additional vaccine or toxoid component administered.For adults the administration codes are:90471: Immunization administration (includes percutaneous, intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections); 1 vaccine (single or combination vaccineoxoid).90472: Immunization administration (includes percutaneous, intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections); each additional vaccine (single or combination vaccineoxoid).Short, medium and long descriptors for all the new vaccine-specific CPT codes can be found in the AMA Bird flu (H5N1) resource center, along with several other recent modifications to the CPT code set that have helped streamline the public health response.

Sign Up Now CDC monitoring continues CDC monitoring continues Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus is a type of influenza virus that causes highly infectious and severe respiratory disease in birds. It is causing outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows in the U.S. And while the current public health risk for the general public is low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is carefully watching the situation and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures.Human cases have been reported in Colorado, Michigan and Texas.The CDC reports that, since April 2024, 13 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) infection have been reported in the U.S. Four were associated with exposure to sick dairy cows and nine with exposure to avian influenza A(H5N1)-infected poultry.Meanwhile, the CDC is spending $5 million on outreach and educational efforts and working with partner organizations to protect farmworkers’ health and safety.The agency will spend another $5 million to offer seasonal flu vaccines to livestock, dairy and poultry workers. The seasonal influenza vaccine won’t prevent infection from bird flu, the CDC said, but it will reduce strain on rural health systems and, if fewer people get the seasonal flu, it will help public health workers better detect if a person is sick with avian flu.Changes to the CPT code set are considered through an open editorial process managed by the CPT Editorial Panel that collects broad input from the health care community and beyond to ensure CPT content reflects the coding demands of digital health, precision medicine, augmented intelligence, and other aspects of a modern health care system.

The Conversation U.S. asked immunologist and microbiologist Jenna Guthmiller from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain the historical roots of H5N1, its mode of transmission and how to avoid coming into contact with it. What is H5N1? H5N1 is a subtype of influenza A viruses. Other commonly known influenza A virus subtypes include H1N1 and H3N2, which cause seasonal outbreaks in humans. Unlike H1N1 and H3N2, H5N1 largely infects wild birds, with waterfowl such as ducks and geese being the natural reservoirs for H5N1 viruses. Most H5N1 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza, meaning spillovers into other bird populations can lead to high mortality rates, including domesticated poultry. H5N1 viruses were first identified in 1959 due to an outbreak in domesticated chickens in Scotland. In 1996, waterfowl were identified as the natural reservoir for H5N1. Since its identification, H5N1 viruses have led to four major outbreaks: in 1997, 2003-2005, 2015 and 2021-to-present. The outbreaks in 1997 and 2003-2005 led to substantial spillover to humans. Since 2003, nearly 900 H5N1 infections in humans have been recorded. Of those infections, more than half were fatal. Where did H5N1 originate? The current outbreak of H5N1 started in late 2021 and derives from the virus that caused a major outbreak in 2015. Since 2021, H5N1 strains have spread to six continents by migratory birds. Spillover to domestic poultry has led to the culling of millions of domestic birds. Researchers have documented the current H5N1 strain in numerous mammals, with it largely affecting aquatic mammals like seals and scavenger mammals. Sporadic spillover to domestic mammals has been recorded, including to minks, goats and alpacas. In March 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported an outbreak of H5N1 in lactating dairy cows. As of Aug. 27, 192 herds in 13 states have been confirmed H5N1 positive. Dairy cow-associated H5N1 viruses have since jumped back into wild birds, and recent outbreaks in domestic poultry resembled H5N1 in dairy cows. Between May and July 2024, 13 confirmed H5N1 infections have occurred in humans, with all cases directly linked to dairy farms and poultry culling. Why did the avian flu become more widespread? It is unclear why H5N1 has become such a widespread problem. H5N1, like all influenza viruses, rapidly mutates to infect new hosts. However, H5N1 has several features that could increase its host range. First, H5N1 viruses use a protein called hemagglutinin that allows H5N1 to infect with new hosts. Second, my research group identified a mutation in H5N1 viruses causing the dairy cow outbreak that allows hemagglutinin to bind to its receptor more efficiently. Lastly, H5N1 viruses are mutating genes associated with replication and immune evasion that are known to increase the infection of mammals. Together, these factors could heighten H5N1 transmission and increase H5N1 spillover to mammals. How is the strain transmitted to dairy cattle? H5N1 viruses are largely causing infections in the mammary glands of cattle rather than the respiratory tract, which is the main site of infection for other influenza viruses in mammals. Recent studies have shown that the mammary tissue has receptors for H5N1, which could make this tissue susceptible to infection. Since the infection is largely restricted to the mammary glands, researchers believe that H5N1 is being transmitted to cows by contaminated milk equipment, particularly the milking apparatus that attaches to the cow udders. Transmission across farms is due to infected cattle movement and shared equipment and personnel across dairy farms. To reduce transmission, in April 2024, the USDA put in testing requirements for when cows are transported across state lines. In addition, Colorado, the state with the greatest number of positive herds, requires weekly testing on farms to identify infected herds. What are the risks to people and other animals? H5N1 does not pose a risk to the general public, as this virus is not known to transmit between people. As all known cases were those with direct contact with infected animals, people with occupational exposure to H5N1-infected cows and poultry continue to be at the greatest risk of infection. People with occupational hazards should be aware of the H5N1 symptoms – similar to those of a cold – such as congestion, sore throat and fatigue, as well as conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pink eye. For more information, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s webpage on avian influenza in people. Domestic and wild animals near dairy farms are at high risk of infection. Particularly, barn cats that have been fed raw milk have been reported dead on dairy farms with infected cows, with these animals coming back positive for H5N1. In addition, spillover of H5N1 to other domesticated farm animals near infected dairy cows has been recorded. What are the best ways to keep farm workers safe? Using personal protective equipment, such as goggles and gloves, remains the best way to prevent the transmission of H5N1 to humans and from humans back to animals. People working around poultry or dairy cattle should also be aware of biosecurity measures, such as not wearing the same clothes and boots when traveling from one farm to another. Is drinking dairy milk a concern? As long as you are consuming pasteurized milk products, there are no concerns for infections in humans. Pasteurization is very effective at killing any H5N1 virus that ends up in milk. People should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk, as H5N1 virus has been found at very high levels in raw milk.

The person, who had severe underlying conditions, has since recovered.The CDC reported last week that a health care worker who cared for the patient developed mild respiratory symptoms and tested negative for influenza. Additionally, a person who lived with the Missouri patient also became sick on the same day. The household contact had gastrointestinal symptoms, an agency spokesperson said, which can sometimes be associated with an influenza infection.Initially, Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, had stated on a call with reporters last week that none of the patient’s close contacts showed signs or symptoms of illness, calling the situation a possible “one-off.” Since then, the three contacts have been identified, but it’s still not clear if they were sick with the H5 virus.The CDC has collected blood samples from the Missouri patient and household contact. It will do so-called serological testing that could confirm a previous H5N1 infection, although the tests could take several weeks.The CDC said Friday that the second health care worker wasn’t tested for influenza because the illness had resolved before the investigation began. The second health care worker will be offered a blood test to determine if there are antibodies for the bird flu virus.H5 viruses don’t typically spread person to person. However, they remain worrisome to health officials given their high mortality rate worldwide.It isn’t yet known how the Missouri patient got infected with bird flu, the CDC said Friday.Outside experts were alarmed by the unusual timing of the illnesses, particularly given that they occurred outside of flu season.Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the clinical virology laboratory at the Mayo Clinic, said it’s possible that the Missouri patient and the household contact were infected by the same source, or that one transmitted it to the other, indicating potential human-to-human spread.“I’m really hoping that they ultimately find out that there was some likely animal exposure, because the alternative is a little bit scary,” Binnicker said in an interview before Friday’s update.Although the Missouri patient had no known animal contact, CDC officials last week said they were investigating whether the person had any interactions with wild birds and bird feeders, or whether they consumed meat or dairy products, including raw milk.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said if the virus has transmitted from person to person, it doesn’t necessarily mean it has changed in a way that makes it more easily transmissible to humans.“Bird flu infections can be transmitted in a very limited fashion to people who have very close contact with the original patient,” Schaffner said. “That doesn’t mean that virus has picked up the genetic capacity to spread readily.”Since March, there have been 14 bird flu infections, mostly in poultry and dairy workers, amid an outbreak of H5N1 spreading rapidly in dairy cows across 213 dairy herds in 14 states, according to the CDC.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

Though not all genes could be sequenced owing to low amounts of genetic material in the patient's sample, the lab work found more evidence that the H5N1 virus that infected that patient is closely related to the US dairy cow virus.Household illness timing hints at common exposureNews of symptomatic contacts came as a surprise, after a CDC official said a day earlier that the evidence so far pointed to a "one-off" case. The CDC had said Missouri health officials are leading the investigation, but that it was in close, almost daily contact with the state's health department about the case. So far, no links to animals or raw milk have been found.In a September 13 situation update, the CDC said the state has subsequently shared information about two symptomatic contacts. One is the patient's household contact, who had similar symptoms on the same day. The patient wasn't tested and has since recovered.The index patient was hospitalized for a significant underlying medical condition and reported to the hospital with chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness. However, the person wasn’t severely ill and wasn't transferred to the intensive care unit. The CDC had said earlier that a respiratory panel was done during hospitalization, which turned up a positive flu result that was batched with other samples and sent to the state lab for subtyping.The patient received antiviral treatment, was discharged from the hospital, and has recovered. "The simultaneous development of symptoms does not support person-to-person spread but suggests a common exposure," the CDC said.Missouri officials also told the CDC that a health worker developed mild symptoms but tested negative for flu.At last week's briefing, a CDC official said serology testing for H5 infection has been discussed for the index patient's contacts, but it's probably too soon for detectable antibody levels to be found.Sequencing finds 2 HA mutations, confirms N1 In its update, the CDC also shared findings from sequencing, which was limited by low amounts of genetic material in the flu virus from the patient's sample. CDC scientists were able to fully sequence the matrix (M) and nonstructural (NS) genes, but were only able to partially sequence the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. The HA sequence analysis confirms that the patient's virus belongs to the 2.3.4.4b clade and the NA analysis confirms N1. The CDC said there were two amino acid substitutions in the HA sequence that haven't been seen in other human cases, and though they aren't thought to affect infectivity or spread, they are located on an area of the virus that might affect cross-reactivity of 2.3.4.4b candidate vaccine viruses. One of the HA differences (HA A156T) has been seen in less than 1% of dairy cow samples, and the other (HA P136S) has turned up in only one dairy cow sequence.In other tests on the sample, the CDC said it found no markers of reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drugs and no mutations linked to an increased potential for human-to-human spread. Despite multiple tries, scientists weren't able to grow the virus from the patient's sample.Virologist weighs in on mutation implicationsAfter the CDC submitted the sequences to two databases, other labs began analyzing the findings. Jesse Bloom, PhD, MPhil, who leads the Bloom Lab that studies virus evolution at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said on X that earlier work by a scientist from the team found that the A160T mutation (which corresponds with A156T in H5 numbering) causes a 10- to 100-fold drop in neutralization by sera from ferrets exposed to the current candidate vaccine virus. He added that, so far, the mutation has been seen in only a handful of infected dairy cattle.He noted that the mutation underscores the challenges of the candidate vaccine virus approach, adding that the CDC'’s update acknowledges the potential implication. Bloom said though the second mutation is on the antigenic region of the HA head, it doesn't seem to have much impact on neutralization. He said, however, that it could slightly affect receptor binding. He said the mutation, referenced as P136S in the CDC update, deserves further study because of an estimated modest improvement in receptor binding and the fact that it was found in the Missouri human case, even though it had been found in only one of many known dairy cow sequences.

toX Share this article Share toX First Influenza Vaccine That Does Not Need to be Administered by a Health Care Provider SILVER SPRING, Md., Sept. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration. FluMist is approved for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B in individuals 2 through 49 years of age. FluMist is sprayed into the nose and has been used safely and effectively for many years. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 for use in individuals 5 through 49 years of age, and in 2007, the FDA approved the use of FluMist to include children 2 through 5 years of age. It is the first vaccine to prevent influenza, more commonly known as the flu, that does not need to be administered by a health care provider. "Today's approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death. This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA's commitment to advancing public health." The flu is a common and contagious respiratory disease that is caused by influenza viruses that typically circulate during the fall and winter in the U.S. It can cause mild to severe illness with a range of symptoms that usually appear suddenly, such as body aches, fever, coughing, sore throat, tiredness and a stuffy or runny nose. Flu can be life-threatening and cause serious complications that can lead to hospitalization or death, particularly in high-risk groups such as the elderly, young children and people with certain chronic medical conditions. Each flu season is different and the health impacts can be substantial and vary widely from season to season, with some flu seasons being worse than others. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu has resulted in about 9.3 million to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2023. Numerous FDA-approved vaccines are available each flu season to prevent influenza. FluMist contains a weakened form of live influenza virus strains and is sprayed in the nose. A prescription is still required to receive FluMist. There are now two approved options for receiving FluMist. The vaccine may be administered by a health care provider in a health care setting (including a pharmacy) or it may be administered by the vaccine recipient or a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older. The most commonly reported side effects of FluMist are fever over 100°F in children 2 through 6 years of age, runny nose and nasal congestion in individuals 2 through 49 years of age and a sore throat in adults 18 through 49 years of age. For those interested in self- or caregiver-administration, the vaccine manufacturer plans to make the vaccine available through a third-party online pharmacy. Those who choose this option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order FluMist. The third-party pharmacy determines eligibility based on the completed screening and, if it is determined that the intended vaccine recipient is eligible, the pharmacy writes the prescription and ships the vaccine to the address provided by the individual who placed the order. The vaccine can then be administered to the prescribed household member(s) at their convenience. A caregiver should administer FluMist to individuals 2 through 17 years of age, as individuals in this age group should not self-administer the vaccine. A study was conducted with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that recipients and caregivers could safely and effectively use the vaccine. Vaccine recipients and caregivers who administer FluMist will be sent the vaccine, the Prescribing Information, Information for Patients and their Caregivers and Instructions for Use. The Instructions for Use provides detailed instructions for storage, administration and disposal of FluMist. The FDA granted this approval of FluMist (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal) to MedImmune LLC.

Officials announced the death count last week after two children died in early September.The season’s death toll of 199 matches the 2019-20 flu season, CDC said. The highest death toll recorded was 288 children who died from the flu in the 2009-10 season, at the height of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic.Most of the 199 total children who died from the virus were eligible for a vaccine but did not receive one. Studies have shown that annual flu vaccines, while not foolproof against infection, are effective against serious illness.“It’s hard to watch,” Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said. “There was a way to prevent this.”Officials must now contend with misinformation and hesitancy around vaccines that took hold with COVID-19, Offit said. The COVID-19 pandemic also disrupted families' regular visits with their doctors, when they may have received routine vaccines. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get their annual flu shot, especially if they are at higher risk, such as having asthma, neurologic conditions, or being obese.The CDC data included 158 children who died who were eligible for a vaccine and whose vaccination status was known. Out of those, 131 children, or 83%, were not fully vaccinated. Among the 189 deaths with known information on medical conditions, 93, or 49%, had at least one preexisting medical condition. By age, 126 of the children were between 5 and 17 years old. There were 73 children younger than 5 years old. Children younger than 5, along with children with certain underlying conditions, face a greater risk of complications such as bronchitis or pneumonia from the flu.The deaths coincide with drops in vaccinations among children. As of May 11, just over 53% of children between ages 6 months and 17 years old were vaccinated this season, which was lower than the prior season’s 56%, when there were 187 deaths. This past season is also lower than pre-pandemic coverage when 62.4% of children were vaccinated in 2020.Vaccinations by children's race, ethnicity, and whether they lived in rural areas appear to be worsening. Less than half of Black children received their annual flu vaccine, and slightly more than half of white children did, compared to nearly 60% of Hispanic children and nearly 59% of children listed as "Other," CDC data showed. Less than 40% of children in rural areas received their annual dose, compared to nearly 60% of children in urban areas and nearly 54% in suburbs.How effective is annual flu vaccine?Annual flu vaccines target last year’s circulating strains of the virus. While it doesn’t completely eliminate the risk of getting infected, it reduces the chances of serious illness. A 2022 study found that vaccines were increasingly effective against the most life-threatening forms of disease.“A lot of this is preventable with vaccination against severe illness,” Dr. Adrienne Randolph, the study's senior author and a critical care physician at Boston Children's Hospital, said. “It’s really important that parents go get their kids vaccinated.”Still, Randolph added the latest season's children’s deaths are the only ones reported as positive for flu. There are also other factors, such as longer-term issues from serious respiratory illness and missed school days, that affect children and their families. In addition, elderly people and others with underlying conditions are especially vulnerable to the flu, which kills tens of thousands of people annually.Where can I get a flu shot?Just before respiratory illness season in the fall and winter months, Randolph recommended families start planning their annual flu shots in October. It’s easier now with pharmacies administering vaccines, along with free clinics in communities.In Memphis, Fight Flu Tennessee is set to bring free vaccines through a state program whether or not people are insured.“We are a healthier society when we make sure our children are vaccinated,” Dr. Michelle Taylor, director of the Shelby County Department of Health Services, which serves Memphis, told USA TODAY. “We know that when children are protected, and their health is protected, it means that the entire community is more protected.”The results of more deaths and lower vaccination means more work needs to be done, said Michele Slafkosky, executive director of Families Fighting Flu, a nonprofit founded in 2004 by parents whose children died from flu complications.The organization has fought to include universal flu vaccine recommendations to reduce illnesses and deaths. This work also includes improving vaccine confidence and making families aware of options available for annual shots.“We all need to do a better job of taking care of not just our loved ones, but our communities,” Slafkosky said.

REUTERS/Jim Vondruska by Rachel Nuwer September 17, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Copy link A recent human case of bird flu in Missouri—one without an obvious path of exposure to the virus that led to a hospitalization—has prompted scrutiny into the U.S. government's response to this year's outbreak in dairy cattle. On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that a person living with the patient had also become ill around the same time but was not tested—raising the possibility of a human-to-human outbreak.Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, who has special insight into the danger this would pose to public health, says he's not surprised. He recalls offshoot human cases with H3N2, another variant influenza virus that infects pigs. What would be concerning, he says, is confirmed person-to-person transmission. Osterholm has spent his life tracking viruses and trying to strengthen public preparedness for them—during a career spanning Minnesota's Department of Health, an interim management team that led the CDC, and an appointment in 2020 to President Joe Biden's COVID-19 Advisory Board. Currently, he is the Regents Professor and McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm also directs the university's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, where he helps oversee the influenza vaccine and coronavirus vaccine roadmaps. He describes these projects as "one-stop shopping locations" for all information about what's already happening and what more needs to be done to create truly game-changing universal vaccines. Think Global Health interviewed Osterholm about gaps in vaccine development and manufacturing, public health failures surrounding H5N1, and the certainty of the next pandemic. He and his colleagues' findings show that critical milestones are still far from being met but could nonetheless be within grasp, should we choose to pursue them. □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □Think Global Health: You've dedicated much of your time recently to advocating for universal influenza and coronavirus vaccines. What would that look like, and are there signs that such vaccines could actually be developed? Osterholm: The current vaccines that we have for both influenza and coronavirus are good vaccines—but they're not great. They can reduce serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. But protection has a decidedly limited duration, and even if someone gets vaccinated, they could still get infected and transmit the virus. The CDC has been really challenged here because public health by its very nature is a voluntary activity The best of all scenarios would be what we call a game-changer universal vaccine that creates a broad immune response that covers a wide range of flus or coronaviruses. We also want much more durable protection, so we're not doing annual immunizations or immediate immunization of the new vaccine for an emerging pandemic. We are moving toward that, but the investment in it is incredibly limited relative to the actual payback. There will be another influenza pandemic, and there will be another coronavirus pandemic—and the ones that come later could be much worse than anything we saw with COVID-19. This is where we really have to ask ourselves, are we being pennywise and pound foolish? Think Global Health: You recently asserted in a Foreign Affairs article that the world is not ready for the next pandemic. Can you summarize your argument? Osterholm: The bottom line is that we all focus on how long it takes to develop a vaccine to address a specific emerging pandemic. That's less of a question for me. Instead, I want to know how long it takes to get the last dose of the vaccine. If we develop a vaccine within six to 10 months but can't get most people vaccinated for several years because we don't have the manufacturing capacity, that paints a very different picture. Right now, we don't have the capacity to manufacture vaccines at the levels we would need to respond to a pandemic. Think Global Health: What accounts for that manufacturing bottleneck? Osterholm: Vaccine research and discovery along with manufacturing are often at the private-sector level. If I'm a pharmaceutical company and I make vaccines, but I need to have capacity to make a lot more of it within a short time, who's going to pay for it? That capacity requires a sizable investment in capital. You have to have experts who are there day in and day out, ready to go at a moment's notice, but there's no business model for that. Pfizer's new respiratory syncytial virus vaccine is seen during its manufacture. Pfizer/Handout via REUTERS Think Global Health: Are you seeing any specific pandemic preparedness failures playing out in the current H5N1 bird flu outbreak in cattle in the United States? Osterholm: This situation is causing everyone in public health to ask whether the system in place right now can really protect us from a potential emerging pandemic in the future. I would largely say that system will give us a shout-out that a pandemic is coming—but I'm not sure that it will do anything else to really protect us. For example, if you look at our capacity today to make flu vaccines that are not even great, just good, we're talking about having basically the same capacity as we had in 2009 with H1N1. Most of the vaccine back then didn't arrive until more than eight months after the pandemic began, and it took almost two years to get most people vaccinated, by which time the virus had gone through the population. Think Global Health: How concerned are you about the specific risk H5N1 poses to cattle? Osterholm: We don't really understand yet what's happening with H5N1. We've been dealing with this since April, but big questions remain about how much infection is in cattle and why it continues to spread within farms. This has been a real challenge because the dairy industry has largely not been helpful. They have basically not given permission for testing milk from their farms. For example, we just had eight new farms confirm infections in California, and we have no idea how that happened because no one has allowed testing. Think Global Health: What are your thoughts on how well the CDC is doing in all of this? Osterholm: It's fair to say that this has not gone all that well relative to the kind of public health action we need. But a large part of that is due not to the inadequacies of the public health agencies, at either the federal or the state level, but to agriculture's unwillingness to collaborate and cooperate. We don't know whether this is going to become a serious threat to human public health The CDC has been really challenged here because public health by its very nature is a voluntary activity. What we would like to see being done are routine sampling of farms around the country to understand how much we're currently missing in terms of new infections. But if farms refuse to cooperate, there's not much public health workers can do. Think Global Health: Do you think the risk that H5N1 poses to people has been overblown so far? Osterholm: I don't think it's overblown. Again, I think the problem we have is that we just don't know. I don't see any signs right now suggesting that this is going to become a human pathogen transmitted to people by people. On the other hand, all it would take is one reassortment. We now know that cow udders actually have receptor sites for both the bird viruses and the human viruses. If cows get coinfected, the viruses could get together and swap out genetic material and create a new virus that could be the cause of the next pandemic. That could happen tomorrow. So I don't think you can say we've overreacted at all. But we also have to be honest and say we don't know whether this is going to become a serious threat to human public health. Think Global Health: Any predictions about what this fall might bring for H5N1? Osterholm: Niels Bohr, the famous physicist from World War II, once said that predictions are very difficult, particularly about the future. The only thing I can tell you is that we're going to see more pandemics of influenza and coronaviruses. Beyond that, none of us can tell you what that means—other than we've got to be ready.

But a lack of coordination and testing continues to hobble the U.S. response. Howard P. Forman Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Economics, Public Health, and Management; Co-founder, Pozen-Commonwealth Fund Fellowship in Health Equity Leadership, MD/MBA Program, and MBA for Executives Program September 20, 2024 This commentary was adapted from episode 141 of the Health & Veritas podcast. H5N1 remains a major public health story, even if the press rarely covers it. We have had a concerning outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, since early this year. When I last gave an update in June, I mentioned that 10 farm workers, 100 million poultry, and 168 dairy herds had been affected during this outbreak. While the numbers have moved up since then, the change is not dramatic: 1% more poultry have either died or were euthanized, and we are now up to 13 farm workers affected, with 9 of them from poultry farms in Colorado. There are, however, 18 new cattle herds infected with H5N1, with the most being in Colorado and the newest being 3 herds in California. California is especially concerning because it is the nation’s number one source of milk, and because California has been particularly cautious, knowing how easy it would be for this outbreak to spread. Unlike in other areas, California dairy farms are huge and don’t have the same risks of cattle being transferred between farms; they also have seemingly been hard at work cleaning the milking equipment to prevent spread, and cleaning trailers when they do need to move cattle. But even that has not been enough to prevent spread entirely. Subscribe: Health & Veritas The biggest recent news on this front is the discovery of a patient in Missouri with H5 avian influenza; this case was detected through surveillance of patients testing positive for flu and was not associated with an animal outbreak. In fact, Missouri is one of the states that has not had a cattle herd avian influenza case. They are still doing genetic sequencing of this case and it may turn out to be related to wild bird outbreaks that have occurred in Missouri or something entirely different, even possibly from contaminated milk or dairy products. Is there any evidence of human-to-human transmission, which is the thing we dread most at this point? Absolutely not. But for the first time in a while, we have at least a question about a human case and how it was spread. Are we doing enough? No. The state of Missouri has not been actively testing and seems to want to hide their head in the sand on this. Maybe they have no infected cattle, but there are good reasons to be suspicious, since testing is nearly absent. It would be great to see the CDC continue to organize their efforts and coordinate with state public health and agriculture officials to establish best practices and create incentives for more effective testing and quarantining/isolation as needed. Nobody knows when this could affect us. It could be next month or next decade. But we look foolish if we aren’t actively learning and preparing for the worst, while hoping for the best.

What to expect for the 2024-2025 flu seasonAs flu season nears, experts encourage people to prepare by getting their annual flu vaccine. Here's the best time to get the flu shot, how long it lasts, side effects and more.Sept. 19, 2022, 1:09 PM UTC / Updated Sept. 17, 2024, 1:35 PM UTCBy Caroline KeeAs summer comes to an end, pharmacies across the country are rolling out seasonal influenza vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and older. Although flu season has not yet stared in the United States, experts are already spreading the word about the best time to get the flu shot for protection all winter long.The flu is a common and highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. In the U.S., flu season usually occurs during the fall and winter months. Influenza activity tends to ramp up in October then peaks between December and February. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “FluView” weekly surveillance report for the 2024-25 season, flu activity remains low nationally, and less than 200 cases were reported during the week ending Aug. 31. However, cases are expected to increase in the coming weeks and months. As flu season approaches, experts are urging Americans to be cautious and get their flu shots on time this year. What do we know about the 2024-2025 flu season so far, when is the best time to get a flu shot this year, and how else can you protect yourself? We spoke to experts to answer all of your questions. When is the best time to get a flu shot?“The best time to get the flu shot is the end of September and during October,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, tells TODAY.com. The CDC recommends getting the flu vaccine before October ends.Getting the flu shot at this time allows immune protection to build before the flu activity ramps up, and it makes it more likely that the protection will last through the winter, according to Schaffner.The flu shot does not work right away because it takes time for the body to develop antibodies, which help fight off the virus. It takes about two weeks after getting vaccinated for the flu shot to provide full protection, per the CDC.People should aim to get vaccinated before flu activity peaks, experts say. “You don’t want to get vaccinated during the flu season. ... The biggest benefit is when you get vaccinated before the season starts,” Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease physician and professor of public health, epidemiology and medicine at Yale School of Public Health, previously told TODAY.com.Some children may need two doses of the flu vaccine, which are given at least four weeks apart, per the CDC. For those children, the it is recommended to get the first dose as soon as possible. What can we expect for the 2024-2025 flu season? It’s difficult to tell how the 2024-2025 flu season will unfold at this point. The timing and duration of flu season varies from year to year. It can start as early as October, and significant activity can continue as late as May, according to the CDC.Researchers often look to the Southern hemisphere for clues, as flu activity in temperate regions peaks earlier in the year, between April and September, per the CDC.“It’s not a direct predictor of what happens here in the U.S.,” said Ko. However, it can offer some insight into what kind of flu season the Northern hemisphere may experience. Australia, which is often viewed as a harbinger for flu trends in the U.S., had a moderately severe 2024 flu season, says Schaffner.Influenza activity seems to have returned to pre-pandemic levels. “It looks as though flu is back to its conventional seasonal patterns,” Schaffner adds.However, the severity of flu season in the U.S. has always varied from year to year, even before the pandemic, according to Ko, so it’s important for people to prepare regardless. How to protect yourself during flu season Fortunately, there's a safe way to build up immunity and protect yourself ahead of flu season: the seasonal flu vaccine, which the CDC recommends for everyone ages 6 months and older.In addition to protecting against influenza viruses, the flu shot helps reduces the burden of flu illness, hospitalizations and deaths.Influenza sickens millions of people and causes 10,000 to 52,000 deaths in the U.S. every year during flu season, Andrew Pekosz, Ph.D., virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told TODAY.com. “It’s not something that is insignificant in terms of how much danger it poses to the population,” Pekosz said.Even if you've never gotten a flu shot before, it's not too late to start. The flu shot is widely available and free under most health insurance plans. "Influenza is a nasty virus, particularly for older, frail people and people with underlying illnesses. But the more we all get vaccinated, the better we protect ourselves and others," says Schaffner.How long does the flu shot last?How long protection from the flu shot lasts varies by person and timing of the flu shot, but generally if you get the vaccine in October, protection should last through the winter into March, according to experts."Younger, healthier people who have a more robust immune systems may get protection well beyond the winter," says Schaffner.All of the flu shots for the 2024-2025 season are trivalent, meaning they protect against three different flu viruses. The new shots will include two influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B virus, per the CDC. “We include different strains because more than one strain is usually active at any one time,” says Schaffner. Occasionally the season starts with A strains being more active and ends with B strains being more active, Schaffner adds, which is why the shot can offer continued protection for months. Is it better to get the flu shot earlier or later in the season?It's better to get the flu shot early in the season, before influenza activity ramps up. The CDC guideline is to get vaccinated before the end of October. "The greatest protection, of course, (comes from) when you get it before the season starts,” said Ko.For most people, as long as you’re getting the flu shot within the recommended timeframe — late September through October — it doesn’t matter if you get it earlier or later, experts note. “(For) people who are older or have underlying chronic illnesses, the timing of the vaccine is more important because their immune systems don’t respond optimally,” says Schaffner. “We ask them to wait until October to get the vaccine because we want the protection to extend through the entire winter season into March.” Children who need two doses should schedule their first flu shot appointment right away, NBC News previously reported.In any case, aim to get your flu shot before Halloween. “The bottom line is that you don’t want to wait until you’re already going to be at risk of getting influenza to get vaccinated,” Ko said. "It's a preventive vaccine."When is it too late to get a flu shot?Although you'll get more protection by getting vaccinated by the end of next month, it is never "too late" to get the flu shot, the experts emphasize. “If you’ve never had the flu shot, no matter where you are during the season, you should get it,” said Ko.The flu shot can still provide protection if you get it later in the season when flu activity peaks, according to the CDC. “The timing of the flu shot is kind of like timing the stock market. You really don’t want to think too much about it — you just sort of have to get it when you can,” said Pekosz.It’s hard to predict when this flu season will end, but based on pre-pandemic trends, flu activity will likely wind down in April or May.Which flu vaccines are available?There are several different types of flu shots available — the one that is appropriate for you will depend on your age, health status, allergies and other factors. “It’s always good to talk to a primary health care provider who knows you well,” said Ko.According to the CDC, these are the influenza vaccines available for the 2024-2025 season: Standard dose flu shot: These vaccines are manufactured using inactivated (killed) influenza virus grown in eggs and recommended for everyone aged 6 months to 64 years (including pregnant women), per the CDC. High-dose flu shot: This egg-based flu shot contains four times the antigen of the standard-dose, inactivated virus vaccines to produce a stronger immune response in the body. It’s approved for individuals 65 and older, per the CDC.Cell-based flu shot: This flu shot contains virus that was grown in cell culture, so it is completely egg-free, and it’s approved for people 6 months and older, per the CDC. Adjuvanted flu shot: This is an egg-based flu shot approved for people 65 and older that contains an adjuvant, which makes an individual have a stronger immune response, per the CDC.Recombinant flu shot: This is an egg-free flu shot made using recombinant technology, which contains three times the antigens of standard-dose flu shots, per the CDC, and it is approved for adults aged 18 and older. Nasal spray vaccine: This nasal mist uses live, attenuated (weakened) virus, and it’s approved for people from 2 to 49 years of age, Ko said, but it is not recommended for pregnant or immunocompromised individuals.For people aged 65 and older who are at higher risk, three vaccines are preferentially recommended by the CDC: the high-dose shot, the adjuvanted shot and the recombinant shot, says Schaffner.It's safe for pregnant people to get the flu shot during any trimester, which also helps protect the baby after birth, per the CDC.Flu shot side effectsSide effects from the flu vaccine are generally mild and, according to the CDC, may include:Redness or soreness at the injection siteMild headacheFeverFatigueMuscle achesYou can’t get the flu from the flu shot, Pekosz said. If you have questions, always talk to your doctor.How effective is the flu shot?The efficacy of seasonal flu vaccines varies from year to year, but studies show that it can reduce the risk of flu illness by 40% to 60% when most of the virus strains in the vaccine match the strains circulating that season, according to the CDC.“There’s a very good match between what’s in our vaccine and the circulating strains in Australia, (and) the influenza virus hasn’t mutated in a way that has us especially concerned,” says Schaffner.However, it's hard to tell how well the flu shots for the 2024-2025 season will work at this point. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is usually determined towards the end of the season or afterwards, when there's more data available.Can you still get the flu after getting the flu shot?Some people who get the influenza vaccine may still get sick with the flu.However, there is evidence that the flu shot reduces the severity of illness in people who get infected after vaccination, per the CDC. The flu shot can also help prevent flu-related complications in individuals with chronic health conditions.So just because the flu shot doesn’t always prevent infection does not mean it’s not working, the experts emphasize.“By getting flu vaccine, you take a more serious infection and you turn it into a milder one. ... The vaccines keep us out of the emergency room, prevent hospitalizations, ICU admissions and death,” says Schaffner.A secondary effect of the vaccine is it helps reduce the burden of influenza on health care systems during fall and winter, Ko added.Can I get my flu shot and COVID-19 booster at the same time? Yes, you can and should get your flu shot and COVID-19 booster at the same time, says Schaffner. After a summer surge of COVID-19 in the U.S. driven by the FLiRT variants, officials are encouraging Americans to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall.The CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and older get the COVID-19 vaccine, which has been reformulated to better protect against the highly contagious strains circulating, TODAY.com previously reported. Experts recommend getting both shots during one appointment for convenience. “There isn’t any scientific evidence that tells you that you have to space them out,” said Ko. However, you may want to get the shots in different arms.“I encourage people to get both at the same time ... especially if you’re in one of the high-risk groups for COVID-19 or influenza ... whether it be the elderly, the immunocompromised, people with secondary medical conditions,” said Pekosz. In addition to the COVID-19 booster, an RSV vaccine is also available for pregnant people (to prevent RSV in newborns), adults ages 75 and older, and high-risk adults ages 60 to 74.All three of these vaccines — for flu, COVID and RSV — can help prevent serious disease and complications, says Schaffner. How to prepare for flu seasonIn addition to getting vaccinated, you can take everyday actions to prevent the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses.These include staying home when sick, avoiding contact with sick people, covering coughs and sneezes, washing your hands and disinfecting contaminated, shared surfaces. Influenza viruses are highly contagious and spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, per the CDC.If you do get sick with the flu, it's important to monitor symptoms. Flu can range from mild to severe, but most people will recover without needing medical care or treatment, the experts note.Flu symptomsThe most common flu symptoms include: FeverBody achesHeadacheFatigueChillsCoughSore throatStuffy noseThe CDC recommends staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone (except to seek medical attention) and to contact your health care provider if you are concerned, feeling very sick, or in a high-risk group (over 65, immunocompromised, pregnant, etc.).There are also flu antivirals available, such as Tamiflu, which require a prescription from a doctor. "Those work really well in terms of keeping people out of the hospital and limiting disease severity," said Pekosz, adding that antivirals are particularly important for high-risk groups.Ultimately, the goal is to prevent people from getting sick in the first place. “When we’re thinking about public health, the most efficient thing is to prevent disease rather than wait until people are sick and they need to get treated,” Ko said.Caroline KeeCaroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.RelatedGetty Images/iStockphotoThese are the best cold remedies according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Nov. 8, 2024Mindful Media / Getty ImagesHow to make yourself sneeze, according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Oct. 15, 2024Getty ImagesAre your fall allergy symptoms worse this year?

Karen Mower / iStock In a statement, the FDA said that MedImmune, the maker of FluMist, plans to offer the vaccine through a third-party pharmacy. People interested in the self or caregiver option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order the vaccine. If eligibility is established, the pharmacy writes the prescription and ships the vaccine to the person who placed the order.Then the vaccine is given at the household's convenience. The FDA recommends that a caregiver administer FluMist to those ages 2 to 17 years old.Convenient and accessiblePeter Marks, MD, PhD, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the approval gives people a new option for receiving a safe, effective flu vaccine that is more convenient, flexible, and accessible. “"Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death," he said.FluMist is the only needle-free seasonal flu vaccine option in the United States and is given intranasally. In use since 2003, the vaccine contains a weakened form of live virus strains. It is approved for use in people ages 2 through 49 years old. MedImmune is part of AstraZeneca, which filed for FDA approval of self- or caregiver-administration of FluMist in October 2023. US COVID markers show more declines News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 US COVID activity continued to decline in many areas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest updates. NIAID/Flickr cc Test positivity for COVID was 13.5% last week, down from 14.9% the week before.Hospitalizations continue to decline but remain highest in seniors, followed by adults ages 50 to 64 and children younger than age 4 years. Emergency department visits dropped about 19% compared to the previous week and are now at low levels across much of the country. Deaths held steady, and provisional data show that the CDC received reports of 563 COVID deaths for the week ending September 14.Detections of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are still high nationally, according to CDC tacking. The highest levels remain in the West, followed by the Midwest and the South. However, all regions show downward trends.The latest data from WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, show that detections are still high nationally and in the Midwest, with no significant up or down trend over the past 3 weeks.Very low uptake of COVID, flu vaccines in adultsIn its updates today, the CDC also had some respiratory virus vaccine uptake estimates. So far, about 2.8% of adults have received the updated COVID vaccine, and 6.8% have received a seasonal flu vaccine.Among adults ages 75 and older, 33.1% have reported ever receiving a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Minnesota reports 2 H3N2v flu infections in fairgoers News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics H3N2v Influenza The Minnesota Department of Health has reported two variant H3N2 (H3N2v) flu infections, both involving young people who visited agricultural fairs, where they were exposed to pigs, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest weekly flu update. Matt Bargar/Flickr cc Both patients sought care the week ending September 7, and neither were hospitalized. Both have recovered from their infections. The cases raise the nation's variant flu case total to nine for the season. Investigators found that the patients were not contacts of each other but had attended the same agricultural fair. One child had indirect contact with pigs, and the other had direct contact. One family member had COVIDThe probe into the first case found that that all household members became ill the day after attending the fair. One household member tested positive for COVID, and all recovered, including the first patient. Soon afterward, the first patient got sick with new symptoms and was tested for influenza A, which was further identified as H3N2v. No related illnesses were found among the first patient's contact.The investigation into the second case found no related illnesses among contacts. "No human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H3N2)v associated with either case was identified" the CDC said. California confirms more avian flu in dairy herds, poultry News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 6 more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in California dairy herds, raising the state's total to 16 since the virus was first found in the state's Central Valley dairy farms in the middle of August. pixinoo/iStock The detections push the national total of dairy farm outbreaks to 214 across 14 states.In another avian flu development, the USDA confirmed highly pathogenic avian flu at a commercial turkey farm in California. The California Department of Food and Agriculture said the detection at the turkey farm is the state's first in domestic poultry since the state was declared free of the virus at the end of June.Though Merced County is part of California's Central Valley, it's not clear if the turkey farm has any connection to the cattle outbreaks in that part of the state.FDA advisers to discuss human H5 vaccinesMeanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory group will discuss the composition of human H5 vaccines as part of preparedness for highly pathogenic as one of three topics at its upcoming meeting on October 10. The other topics on the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) agenda are recommendations on strain selection for seasonal flu vaccines for the Southern Hemisphere's 2025 season and research programs regarding departments that study viral diseases. Quick takes: Measles uptick in US, more polio cases in 3 countries News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Measles Polio The number of measles cases reported in the United States this year has risen to 262, up 11 from a week ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported today in an update. Of the patients, 107 (41%) have been hospitalized, with the highest percentage of hospitalizations seen in children under 5 (52%). Eighty-eight percent of the case-patients are either unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. A total of 13 measles outbreaks have been reported in 2024, compared with 4 reported in all of 2023, and 70% of cases are outbreak-associated. Thirty-two jurisdictions have reported measles cases, including Minnesota, which now has 51 cases from an outbreak that began in May.Three countries reported new polio cases this week, according to an update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Afghanistan reported one case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Kandahar province, bringing its total number of cases for 2024 to 19. Cameroon reported two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from Est province, its first two this year. In Nigeria, 4 cVDPV2 cases were reported from Yobe province, bringing its total number of cases this year to 53. GPEI also reported that the first round of an emergency polio vaccination campaign in Gaza was completed on September 12, with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 provided to an estimated 560,000 children under 10.

The number of turkeys in the flock has not yet been disclosed.Prior to this flock infection, there had not been detections of HPAI in a commercial poultry flock in the United States since July 19, according to information from APHIS.In that instance, a flock of 300,800 commercial table egg pullets in Weld County, Colorado, was affected. The control area surrounding that flock was released on August 27.California, however, had not had any confirmed cases in commercial poultry since January 18, when a commercial table egg pullet flock, also in Merced County, was affected. That flock involved 285,600 birds.According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), the state had been declared free from H5N1 HPAI in poultry on June 28 after completely fulfilling the necessary actions and surveillance requirements.Despite the lack of H5N1 in commercial poultry in California for those months, the virus has been detected in 10 commercial dairy operations in the state. According to APHIS, the first three of those instances were confirmed on August 30, and the most recent cases were confirmed on September 13. APHIS and CDFA have not identified the counties where H5N1 was confirmed in cattle.Despite the new case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States, it has been seven months since any new HPAI detections in commercial poultry have been confirmed in Canada.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

By Kristina Herndon, RN Updated on September 15, 2024 Medically reviewed by Amelia MacIntyre, DO Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Flu Season Symptoms Other Causes See a Provider Treatment Close You can get the flu in summer, but it's not very common. The influenza virus is more active in the fall and winter in the United States. However, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide flu patterns have been less predictable. This has led to an unusual rise in summer flu cases. Still, a summertime upper respiratory infection is likely something other than influenza. COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Lyme disease, bronchitis, and pneumonia can cause flu-like symptoms like fever, headache, congestion, and fatigue. This article discusses summer flu and flu-like illnesses. It explains why you may get influenza in the summer and lists other illnesses that cause similar symptoms. It also provides tips for managing cold and flu symptoms in the summer heat. How the Flu Season Has Changed The influenza virus is always circulating in some part of the world. In the United States, flu season traditionally runs from October to April and peaks between December and February. In the Southern Hemisphere, influenza is typically active from May to September. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global flu patterns, making worldwide flu activity less predictable: The 2020-2021 flu season was exceptionally mild—somewhat expected due to social distancing and masking.The 2021-2022 flu season started mild but began to pick up in mid-2022 around the globe. U.S. flu rates peaked in April, which is very late in the season. Unusually high influenza rates continued through June.The 2022-2023 flu season started much earlier than usual in the Southern Hemisphere, and the U.S. followed a similar pattern. However, Mexico, which typically follows a similar flu pattern as the U.S., had unseasonably high flu activity as late as June.The 2023-2024 flu season started early again in the Southern Hemisphere, but flu cases did not rise above the U.S. baseline until the first week of November, peaking the last week of December, and remaining above baseline through March. Only time will tell if flu seasons will return to standard pre-pandemic patterns. Until then, getting the flu in the summer will likely be more common than in the past.

They include: Fever or feeling feverishBody achesCoughHeadacheChillsExhaustion and fatigueCongestionVomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults) Flu symptoms typically last between three days and two weeks. People can be contagious the day before symptoms appear for up to a week. However, it's most contagious during the first three or four days of symptoms. If you suspect you have the flu, contact your healthcare provider. Prescription antiviral medications can shorten the duration of the flu. Symptoms of the Flu Other Summer Flu-Like Illnesses Flu-like symptoms in the summertime are often caused by something other than influenza. These flu-like illnesses can cause body aches, fever, headaches, and upper respiratory symptoms. The main difference between the flu and other viral respiratory infections is the onset of symptoms. Influenza symptoms tend to occur rapidly over the course of a few hours. Other respiratory infections, like the common cold, gradually build up over a few days. Other viruses or bacteria can cause flu-like summer illnesses. Mosquitos and ticks can also transmit infections with flu-like symptoms. Common Summer Infections Summer flu-like symptoms are most likely a viral or bacterial infection. Possible common causes include: Bronchitis (technically, this is a complication of a virus, such as influenza) COVID-19 Enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus or rhinovirus (the common cold) Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) Mononucleosis Parainfluenza Pneumonia Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Strep throat Flu-Like Symptoms and Their Causes Insect-Borne Illnesses Flu-like symptoms in the summer can also be caused by a mosquito or tick bite. Insect- or vector-borne illnesses are often linked to specific regions. Let your healthcare provider know if you have flu-like symptoms and have recently traveled abroad or within the United States. Insect-borne illnesses that can cause flu-like symptoms include: Anaplasmosis Babesiosis Chikungunya virus Dengue Lyme disease Malaria Rocky Mountain spotted fever Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) West Nile virus Zika virus Your symptoms, along with your travel itinerary, can help your healthcare provider pinpoint a diagnosis. For example: High fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms with recent travel to Africa, Asia, or South or Central America could be malaria.A bull's-eye rash, fever, body aches, and other flu-like symptoms in New England or the Mid-Atlantic states could be Lyme disease.The same bull's-eye rash in Texas, however, could be the Lyme-like infection STARI, which also causes fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain.A high fever, headache, and vomiting in the Western, Southwestern, and Central states could be Rocky Mountain spotted fever. What to Do if You Get a Tick Bite When to See Your Healthcare Provider If you suspect you have influenza, contact your healthcare provider. Antiviral medications can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms and may prevent serious complications. Antivirals must be started within the first two days of symptoms, so don't delay. The following factors may put you at higher risk of flu complications: Ages 5 and younger, especially those under age 2Ages 65 and older AsthmaChronic kidney diseaseChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)DiabetesHeart diseaseLiver or metabolic disordersNeurologic conditions, such as strokePregnancyWeak immune system If you or your child develops flu-like symptoms and are at high risk of complications, contact your healthcare provider for guidance right away. Verywell / Brianna Gilmartin Other symptoms that should be evaluated by your healthcare provider include: Cough that is severe, persists longer than 10 days, or returns after clearing upEar pain that does not resolve with over-the-counter pain relieversPersistent high fever in an adultAny fever in a baby 3 months old or youngerFever of 102.2 F or higher in children under 1 yearFever lasting longer than 24 hours in children under 2 or more than 48 hours in a child older than 2New rash, bulls-eye rash, or rash that is spreading or covers large parts of the bodySore throatSwollen glands When to Go to the ER Seek emergency medical care if you or a loved one has any of the following symptoms: Breathing difficulty or shortness of breathChest or abdominal pain or pressure that persistsConfusion or altered mental stateFever of 105 F that does not come down with medicationInability to arouse or lack of alertnessLack of urinationPersistent dizzinessSeizuresSevere headacheSevere muscle painSevere weakness or unsteadinessStiff neck with a fever Additional symptoms in children that warrant immediate medical care: Bluish lips or faceDehydrationFast or troubled breathing, such as ribs pulling in with each breathFever above 104 F in children 3 months or older or a rectal temperature of 100.5 F or higher in infants younger than 12 weeksUnable to speak, see, walk, or move Flu Symptoms and Treatment Treating Summer Colds and Flu The summer heat and humidity can make cold and flu symptoms feel more miserable. While symptoms can be managed with the same remedies you would use at other times of the year, summer presents some unique challenges. Air Conditioning Finding a comfortable air temperature can be hard when you have a fever in the summer. If you have air conditioning, aim to set it just cool enough to keep you from sweating but not so cold it triggers chills. Shivering will raise your core body temperature, making a fever worse. Air conditioning will also remove the humidity from the air, which can dry out congested sinuses and make breathing difficult. It may help to run the humidifier while you sleep. Hydration Keeping hydrated will help relieve congestion. Drink plenty of water and other fluids. Suck on ice pops or ice chips. Common go-to cold remedies like tea with honey and lemon or chicken broth may not be appealing in the heat. Try them at room temperature or cool instead. Electrolyte drinks, like Gatorade or Pedialyte, can also help keep you hydrated in the heat. To keep your sinuses hydrated, use a saline nasal spray, rinse, or Neti pot and run the humidifier. Medications Summer flu symptoms can often be managed with over-the-counter cold and flu treatments such as: AntihistaminesCough medicineDecongestantsFever reducersNasal spraysPain relievers In some cases, prescription medications may be needed. These may include: Antibiotics to treat a bacterial infection like strep throat, pneumonia, or Lyme disease Antimalarial drugs to treat malaria Antivirals to treat the flu or COVID Breathing treatments, such as a steroid inhaler or nebulizer Cough medicine to relieve bronchitis symptoms Other medications to manage symptoms or the underlying cause Summary Summer flu cases have been on the rise in recent years. Global flu patterns have become less predictable following the pandemic. As a result, more people get the flu in the summer than in years past. Still, flu symptoms in the summer are more likely to be something other than the flu. Bronchitis, the common cold, COVID, and other viruses can cause flu-like symptoms. You can also get a flu-like illness from mosquitoes and ticks, such as Lyme disease, malaria, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If you suspect you have the flu, contact your healthcare provider for advice. People at high risk of flu complications may benefit from antiviral medications, which must be started within two days of symptom onset. Flu symptoms can feel more miserable in the summer heat. Drink extra fluid to stay hydrated. Air conditioning can help you to feel more comfortable. If you have a fever, set the A/C so it is cool enough to prevent sweating but not so cold you shiver. OTC cold and flu medications can help to relieve summer flu symptoms. If symptoms persist or worsen, contact your healthcare provider.

On CNBC’s Make It, Bill Gates said he believes another pandemic is likely within the next 25 years based on a growing body of scientific evidence. At the same time, researchers suggest pets could be an overlooked mixing vessel for pathogens crossing from wildlife and livestock to humans. Those species-hopping diseases could become the next pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted pet ownership and, with it, the pet food industry. However, a pandemic spread via pets would have the opposite effect. Dog, cat and other pet food companies can play a role in preventing the next pandemic by supporting conservation and zoonotic disease research.Potential for another pandemicReducing the probability of a pandemic depends on many factors, but many of those variables trend toward a greater chance of disease. For example, wildlife may harbor diseases with the potential to become zoonotic. As humans encroach on ecosystems, the probability of a pathogen passing from wildlife to livestock or humans increases. Deforestation, especially in the tropics, has accelerated dramatically in the past century, opening new pathways for diseases to cross the species barrier. In the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers calculated that the probability of experiencing a pandemic within one’s lifetime is approximately 38%, which may double in coming decades.One disease has been testing that potential to go pandemic for two decades. Avian influenza is already spreading among people, livestock and wild animals. Earlier this month, another human case of A(H5) avian influenza was confirmed in Missouri, WATTPoultry reported. However, unlike other human cases, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the patient had no known contact with animals. Epidemiologists worry that avian influenza could mutate and become more virulent in humans and other non-avian animals. Dogs and cats could become that mixing vessel that allows avian influenza to become a virus more capable of spreading easily among humans, Jane Sykes, professor of medicine and epidemiology at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told the L.A. Times. Consider a situation where an infected bird dies in a suburban backyard or city park. Dogs and cats eat dead animals despite owners’ best intentions. Avian influenza could mutate within those pets, spread to their owners and become the seed of a pandemic.The probability of a diseased pigeon passing a pathogen to a pet is low, she said. Yet, the sheer number of pets worldwide increases the potential for pandemic. Similarly, people cuddle with cats and dogs in ways that no farmer does with a chicken. That close contact makes disease transmission more likely. Although the probability is minuscule, the potential cost of the risk is high. Pet don’t need to eat wild birds to get avian influenza. Pet food ingredients can spread the disease.Avian influenza and petsOn July 25 and 31 of 2023, health officials confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in two cat shelters in Seoul, South Korea. At one of the cat shelters in South Korea, 38 out of the 40 infected cats died within a month. The shelter cats had all been kept indoors, so it seemed unlikely that wild birds had spread the pathogen to the cats. Instead, the virus may have spread to the cats through their food. Investigators with South Korea’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) detected influenza A(H5N1) virus in cat food from one of the shelters. The cat foods were Balanced Duck and Balanced Chicken manufactured by Nature's Raw at its facility in Gimpo, west of Seoul. The Ministry stated that the company had failed to follow necessary sterilization steps since May 25 due to an equipment malfunction. The virus may have entered the cat food stream during an outbreak of the virus on South Korean poultry, including duck, farms that lasted until April 2023. A team of researchers examined this outbreak and published a summary in Nature Communications, along with suggestions for controlling future cross-species disease transmission.“The influenza A(H5N1) outbreaks in the cat shelters in South Korea, along with an increasing number of reports of influenza A(H5N1) infection in mammals, suggest the need to enhance the effectiveness of infectious disease surveillance and prevention in any settings where a group of potentially susceptible animals are kept in close contact,” they wrote. “This is particularly important for groups of animals that typically are not covered by regulatory efforts aimed at maintaining or improving animal health and welfare standards. These animal groups could not only provide environments for cross-species viral transmission, promoting zoonotic risk, but could also serve as sentinels for detecting such events, thereby offering opportunities to assess and then mitigate such risk.”H5N1 avian flu can spread to and kill humans. Between 2003 and 2023, the World Health Organization received 882 reports of human infection with H5N1 bird flu in 23 countries. Of these, 461 cases were fatal. A pandemic infecting both people and pets could be devastating.Even the rumor that pets could transmit the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus led people to abandon their dogs and cats in the streets in some regions, as the BBC reported. What if a zoonotic disease erupted that could spread from pets to people and vice versa? The World Health Organization (WHO) prepared for just that scenario with a simulation exercise in 2017, one of an annual series of drills called Exercise Crystal.WHO doctors used the exercise to test the outbreak responses of 30 countries and area in the Western Pacific region. The simulation supposed that a previously unknown illness began spreading among cats. Meanwhile, cat owners and veterinarians also start reporting flu-like symptoms to their doctors. By the end of the hypothetical outbreak, cat flu had infected hundreds of people in participants’ own countries and spread internationally.Pet food industry action against pandemicBird flu is already out of Pandora’s box of pathogens and provides an example of how a zoonotic disease can spread. Pet food companies can help keep avian influenza from becoming the next human pandemic. Biosecurity and ingredient sourcing: As the case in South Korea makes obvious, pet food companies must ensure that poultry ingredients are sourced from farms with strict biosecurity measures to minimize the risk of infected birds entering the supply chain. Collaborative research: Beyond their own products, pet food companies could fund or collaborate on research into avian influenza transmission, particularly how the virus might spread among wildlife, poultry, pets and people.Sustainable farming: By supporting sustainable, ethical farming practices that reduce crowding and improve animal health, pet food companies can help lower the risk of outbreaks among livestock, particularly poultry. Encouraging regenerative agriculture may help restore ecosystems or reduce pressure on the environment, including deforestation.Safe food handling: Pet food manufacturers could promote avian-influenza-specific safe food handling and preparation guidelines for pet owners, retailers and others in the supply chain. These guidelines could include proper storage, cooking, and hygiene practices to prevent the transmission of avian influenza through contaminated products. These proactive steps may help pet food companies mitigate the risk of avian influenza becoming the next pandemic that Bill Gates fears.RecommendedPet Food MarketNew Zealand pet food cannery expands into North AmericaPet Food NewsCompanions and Animals for Reform and Equity receives PetSmart grantRelated StoriesNews HoundTransparency tames social media rumors for pet food brandsNews HoundKeep watching the SKUs!

Add in COVID-19, and you’ll see a lot of overlap and similarities. Hackensack Meridian Medical Group family medicine physician William Brian Glenn, DO, shares what you need to know to be ready for the season.What is the difference between a cold, the flu and COVID-19? The challenge with cold, flu and COVID-19 is that the symptoms for each are very similar. A cold can present with cough, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat and fatigue. The flu can present with all of those symptoms plus headache, fever, chills, body aches and fatigue. COVID-19 can present with cold and flu symptoms, plus new loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or shortness of breath. Cold symptoms tend to come on gradually, while flu symptoms come on suddenly – usually all at the same time where a person feels ‘wiped out.’ COVID symptoms start gradually between two and 14 days after exposure and can progress to more severe symptoms in some people – although not everyone has symptoms. Are some people more at risk of developing colds, flu and COVID-19 than others?The elderly, as well as children and adults with chronic conditions including diabetes, lung or kidney disease, metabolic disorders, heart disease and cancer are more susceptible to developing and fighting a cold, flu or COVID-19. Even taking certain medicines that weaken the immune system can put people at a higher risk of developing and fighting these illnesses.What are the biggest misconceptions about cold, flu and COVID?One of the biggest myths is that we should be on heightened alert for these illnesses during the fall and winter. While all three ailments are more prevalent during these times in the U.S. due in part to many people remaining inside and in close quarters, we should be mindful all year long to protect against all three. Also, if you’re traveling – keep in mind that cold and flu season in your destination site may be different from what we experience in the U.S. Especially if you’re susceptible to any of these conditions, you may want to check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to see what vaccines are required for your destination country and with the U.S. State Department to see if any travel advisories mentioning health risks are issued for your destination. You can then discuss with your healthcare provider what kind of health protections are available to you. Another myth claims that vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza cause these illnesses and possibly others. In the case of COVID-19, this is not true as the live virus is not used in any of the COVID vaccines developed for use in the U.S. For influenza, this is also false, as an inactive virus, proteins from a flu virus (instead of the virus itself), or a very weakened virus (in the case of nasal sprays) are used for vaccines instead of a fully activated virus. What people generally feel is minor side effects from the shot itself, which are similar to flu or COVID symptoms. Also, it can take a few weeks for immunity to these viruses to ramp up, so it is possible for people to get sick in between that time. What can I do to protect myself from cold, influenza or COVID, and do any of these conditions require seeing a specialist?If you’re at average risk, follow vaccine guidelines for influenza and COVID based on age. If you’re at higher risk because of co-existing health conditions and/or other concerns, you should discuss with your health care provider what prevention approach is right for you. And to protect from all of these viruses, it helps to frequently wash your hands, cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze into your shoulder, wear a mask as appropriate, regularly clean highly touched surfaces (counters, doorknobs, toilet handles), keep hydrated and rest when needed.Dr. Glenn is part of the Hackensack Meridian Medical Group - Family Medicine Center which is affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Southern Ocean Medical Center in New Jersey.### Request an Expert MEDIA CONTACT Register for reporter access to contact details TYPE OF ARTICLE Feature Expert SECTION MEDICINE CHANNELS Coronavirus Influenza social media distr - auto for marked clients Top Hit Stories KEYWORDS Flu COVID-19 New Jersey Flu Influenza COMMENTS | COMMENTING POLICY View All Latest News Join Newswise!

The virus killed 52 geese at a farm in the town of Martinice u Breznice, with another 848 birds slaughtered, the WOAH said, citing Czech authorities. Avian influenza can be deadly for poultry and has ravaged farm flocks worldwide in recent years. Health officials are also grappling with transmission beyond birds, including among dairy cows and farm workers in the United States.

(Photo by Ben Moreland on Unsplash)TUCKER, Ga. — USPOULTRY and the USPOULTRY Foundation are accepting research preproposals from colleges, universities and research facilities through Nov. 1, on further understanding highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Since the HPAI outbreak began in early February 2022, thousands of cases have been reported in both commercial poultry and backyard flocks, leading to the loss of millions of birds. The H5N1 strain has affected domestic and backyard flocks across 48 states, impacting farmers and communities nationwide. Additionally, the virus has been transmitted to commercial dairy cattle, and several human infections have been reported. While previous HPAI outbreaks have enhanced understanding of the virus and led to significant advancements in biosecurity and disease response protocols, key questions remain regarding biosecurity, depopulation, disposal and repopulation. This initiative aims to deepen understanding of how to prevent HPAI’s introduction to commercial facilities, reduce spread, and improve response strategies. The goal is to assist the industry in minimizing the impact of HPAI during the current outbreak and in preparing for potential future occurrences. The research will involve examining the epidemiological link between cattle and poultry operations, investigating enhanced biosecurity measures and compliance to prevent the introduction and/or spread of HPAI, and identifying methods to reduce viral shedding that are not related to vaccination. Additionally, the research aims to identify the proper personal protective equipment procedures that should be adhered to during an HPAI event. On Oct. 3 at 1:30 p.m. ET, the USPOULTRY Foundation Research Advisory Committee (FRAC) will host a Zoom webinar to provide an overview of the request for proposals (RFPs) related to this topic and two other Board Research Initiative topics as well as the process for submitting a preproposal. The webinar is free and open to all researchers interested in learning more about the RFPs for the three topics. The webinar will provide an opportunity to ask specific questions to the FRAC, and it will be recorded and made available afterward. The link can be accessed here.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article The FDA approved FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration, making it the first influenza vaccine that does not need to be administered by a healthcare provider, the agency announced on Friday. The nasal spray, which contains weakened forms of live virus strains, requires a prescription and is approved for the prevention of flu caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B in individuals ages 2 to 49 years. "Today's approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility, and accessibility for individuals and families," said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death." Approval was supported by a usability study confirming that individuals 18 years and older could either self-administer the vaccine or administer it to eligible individuals when given instructions for use or without any additional guidance. "For the first time, families and caregivers will be able to protect themselves against influenza with a needle-free, self-administered vaccine, from the convenience of their own home," said Ravi Jhaveri, MD, of the Northwestern University School of Medicine in Chicago, in a release from drugmaker AstraZeneca. "Each year, influenza poses a significant burden for people, society, and health systems; additional tools to increase access to vaccinations, while also reducing disparities, are critical." The most commonly reported adverse events with FluMist are fever over 100°F in children ages 2 to 6 years, runny nose and nasal congestion in individuals ages 2 to 49 years, and a sore throat in adults ages 18 to 49. With the approval, the nasal spray can now either be administered by a provider in a healthcare setting (including a pharmacy), self-administered by an adult vaccine recipient, or administered to children by an adult caregiver. AstraZeneca said it plans to make the vaccine available through an online pharmacy for those interested in self- or caregiver-administration. According to the FDA, individuals will need to complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order the vaccine, and if the pharmacy determines eligibility, the pharmacy will write a prescription and ship the vaccine to the address provided by the individual.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Slippery Rock University partnered with Giant Eagle Pharmacy to hold a vaccine clinic at the ARC and Alumni House from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. To prepare students for the fall and winter season, the clinic offered both flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines/boosters. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated every flu season. While we are not in pandemic mode as we were four years ago, the CDC still recommends everyone over the age of 6 months to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Yale School of Medicine reported that this fall, the FLiRT strain – a subvariant of Omicron, and the LB.1 strain have been accounting for more infections in the United States. The CDC has reported that in the United States, Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) have been the most circulated flu strains. The American Medical Association released a statement detailing that the new vaccine is not a reinvented vaccine but rather a modified vaccine to keep up with the current strains. The new vaccine is designed to give the best protection for new variants of COVID-19. The CDC recommends that people receive all recommended boosters as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Health in Butler County has said that cases are not on the rise now. “So far, it’s not been too bad, but it is still early,” a spokesperson from the Butler County Department of Health said. Although mass collection of COVID-19 cases ended following the state of emergency’s end in April 2023, thus making data collection less robust, the CDC continues to monitor the rise and fall of COVID cases. According to the CDC, Pennsylvania is ranked as “stable” when predicting its epidemic status based on National Syndromic Surveillance Program data. While the vaccine is important for keeping yourself healthy in the fall and winter months, the CDC also recommends that everybody continue to maintain good hygiene. If you are sick, the Pennsylvania Department of Health recommends people “should mask, and if you’re sick you should social distance.” The CDC continues to recommend that you wear a mask to protect yourself even further from infection. To register for future vaccine clinics, you must do so in advance online to secure a time. You will need to print the administration form for both vaccines. When you arrive for your dosage, you are asked to bring your health insurance card, your Giant Eagle Advantage Card and if you would like five dollars in free groceries. According to the CDC, it is safe to receive COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same visit. Following the events, future influenza vaccinations can be administered by Student Health Services pending an appointment while supplies last. Other vaccinations are available at local pharmacies for staff and students as needed. You can contact Student Health Services at 724.738.2052 with any questions.

Download image September 16, 2024September 16, 2024 Flu vaccines are available now to students and employees through Student Health Services and Clemson Rural Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone six months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine each year, ideally during the months of September and October so the body has time to develop antibodies and provide protection against flu viruses before they begin circulating at high levels. Why get vaccinated? Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness. Every flu season is different, and influenza infection can affect people differently. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu. An annual seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to reduce the chances of getting seasonal flu and spreading it to others. When more people are vaccinated against the flu, less flu can spread through the community. Flu vaccination can also reduce the severity of illness in people who get the vaccine but still get sick (CDC). Vaccine for students The seasonal flu vaccine is offered at Redfern Health Center. Students can schedule an appointment online in MyHealth-e or by calling the pharmacy: 864-656-3562. Most flu vaccines given in Redfern’s pharmacy will be covered by insurance at no cost to the student. Students should try to bring their pharmacy insurance card or upload it in MyHealth-e. If not covered, the flu vaccine costs $49. This can be paid at the time of service or added to your student account. Acceptable forms of payment include check, debit, credit, Apple Pay, Health Savings Account and Tiger Stripe. Students can also pay for their flu vaccine online in MyHealth-e. The vaccine is covered 100% for students who have the Clemson University Student Health Insurance Plan when received at Redfern or through any Preferred Provider. Vaccine for employees The Joseph F. Sullivan Center, located on the first floor of Edwards Hall, is offering the flu vaccine to employees at no cost to those insured under the State Health Insurance Plan (PEBA). Pop-up flu clinics are planned at various University locations most Tuesdays and every Friday during the month of October, no appointment needed. See the events calendar for walk-up clinic locations, dates and times. Employees can also schedule an appointment to receive a flu vaccine by calling 864-656-3076 or by using their existing Clemson Rural Health MyChart portal. –– Learn more about the flu on the Student Health Services website.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:A household contact developed symptoms but was not a tested for H5, and a health care worker with symptoms tested negative.The CDC said there is no evidence of person-to-person spread of bird flu.A household contact of a person in Missouri confirmed to be infected with H5 avian influenza began exhibiting symptoms of infection on the same day but was not tested for the virus, the CDC said.Both people have recovered from their illness, according to the CDC, which said the risk to the public from H5 is still low. Two close contacts of a person with avian influenza developed influenza-like symptoms. Image: Shutterstock “The simultaneous development of symptoms does not support person-to-person spread but suggests a common exposure,” the agency said of the cases.The initial case was reported in a person who was hospitalized because of other underlying medical conditions and had not been around birds or dairy cows, which have been at the center of an ongoing H5N1 outbreak in the United States.The person was not severely ill and was treated with influenza antiviral medications before being discharged, the CDC reported. In addition to the household contact, a health care worker who had close contact with the initial case also developed mild symptoms but tested negative for influenza, the CDC reported, reiterating that “there is no epidemiologic evidence to support person-to-person transmission of H5 at this time.”"Based on available data, CDC's current assessment is that the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low,” the agency told Healio. “CDC's recommendations related to H5 virus have not changed at this time. As always, circumstances may change quickly as more information is learned."The CDC said it has attempted to sequence the full genome of the virus from the Missouri case, but because of low amounts of genetic material in the clinical specimen, limited data were produced by sequencing viral RNA samples.“The available gene sequences are all closely related to U.S. dairy cow viruses, and similar sequences have been found in birds and other animals around dairy farms, raw milk and poultry,” the CDC said.The H5N1 outbreak has affected more than 100 million birds and more than 200 dairy herds in the U.S. Since April, there have 14 confirmed cases of H5 in humans — four after exposure to dairy cows, nine after exposure to poultry, and the case in Missouri, according to the CDC.Overall, the agency reported that more than 4,800 people have been monitored because they were exposed to infected animals, and roughly 240 have developed influenza-like symptoms.Testing of H5N1 virus specimens determined they were susceptible to influenza antivirals, including oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and baloxavir, the agency said.The U.S. in July awarded $176 million to Moderna to develop messenger RNA pandemic influenza vaccines, and the CDC has also started awarding contracts to bolster the U.S. public health response by expanding testing capacity and upgrading data reporting methods for new emerging health threats.“CDC continues to support states that are monitoring people with exposure to cows, birds or other domestic or wild animals infected, or potentially infected, with avian influenza viruses,” the agency said in the update.References:CDC.

September 18, 2024 • By Alice Berry, aberry@virginia.edu Alice Berry, aberry@virginia.edu By Alice Berry, aberry@virginia.edu September 18, 2024 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email A “tripledemic” describes when flu, COVID-19 and RSV cases rise, further burdening the medical system. (Illustration by John DiJulio, University Communications) There’s a chill in the air, students are back in school and summer’s colors are fading: Cold and flu season is nearly upon us.For the last three years, health care providers have warned of a “tripledemic,” during which rising cases of COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, potentially burden already-beleaguered health systems.But there are ways to keep yourself healthy this cold and flu season. UVA Today reached out to University of Virginia nursing professor and family nurse practitioner Jeanne Alhusen for tips on preventing illness and telling the difference between COVID, the flu, RSV and other common viruses. Related Story Dr. Petri: Get ‘Revolutionary’ New Vaccines Against COVID-19 and RSV Q. What illnesses should people be concerned about this fall and winter?A. The flu, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, the common cold, norovirus or the stomach flu, and pneumonia.Q. Are we going to have a tripledemic?A. A tripledemic refers to the simultaneous surge of three respiratory illnesses: COVID-19, influenza (flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which occurred during the fall and winter of 2022-2023. This created a significant strain on health care systems due to overlapping waves of infections. Concerns about another tripledemic arise as we approach the fall and winter seasons.COVID-19 remains a concern, particularly as new variants continue to emerge. Vaccination rates, updated boosters and immunity levels from previous infections will influence how much COVID-19 circulates this season. UVA School of Nursing professor Jeanne Alhusen says vaccines are the most effective way to prevent flu and COVID-19. (UVA School of Nursing photo) The flu tends to be seasonal, with peak activity during fall and winter. Experts encourage people to get their annual flu vaccine to reduce its impact. The Southern Hemisphere’s flu season (which occurs before the Northern Hemisphere’s) often provides clues about what to expect, and some reports have suggested higher flu activity this year.But we have increased vaccination options this year. Alongside flu vaccines and COVID-19 boosters, new RSV vaccines have been approved for older adults, and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants have been made available. These could reduce the severity and spread of RSV. There’s a greater focus on personal protective measures (e.g., hand hygiene, masks, staying home when sick) as people are more aware of how respiratory infections spread.While there is a potential for another tripledemic, the situation may not be as severe as last year. However, the overlap of these viruses still presents a significant public health challenge. It’s important to stay vigilant, get vaccinated and follow public health guidance to help mitigate the spread of these illnesses.Q. How can I tell the difference between the flu, COVID and RSV?A. Flu symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, cough, sore throat and runny or stuffy nose. COVID-19 symptoms are similar, but can also include loss of taste or smell, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues. Most people who get RSV have mild, cold-like symptoms but it can cause severe respiratory illness in infants, older adults and those with weakened immune systems.The only way to definitively know whether you have the flu, COVID-19 or RSV is to get tested, as the symptoms overlap significantly. There are rapid tests for flu and COVID-19, and some health care providers may test for all three viruses at once.Q. How do I prevent myself from getting sick?A. Annual flu vaccines, the COVID vaccine and COVID boosters are the best prevention for those illnesses. For RSV, preventive treatments like monoclonal antibodies are available for high-risk infants and older adults.Practice good hygiene, avoid contact with sick people and wear a mask in high-risk areas. If you do get sick and experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion or bluish lips, seek immediate medical attention.

Now the vaccinemaker has approval to sell FluMist to adults for use at home on themselves or to administer to their children. The FDA says patients will still need to get a prescription for the vaccine from a health care provider. AstraZeneca says it plans to sell FluMist directly to patients through an online pharmacy. Adults will be able to complete a screening questionnaire to get the prescription, and then order shipments to their home. There are also some limits to the kinds of people FluMist is recommended for. Since it uses a live but weakened version of the virus, some patients, like pregnant people or those who are severely immunocompromised, should not get this vaccine. The FDA approved AstraZeneca's FluMist flu vaccine spray for self-administered use at home. AstraZeneca FluMist is less commonly used these days by pharmacies and doctors, in part due to fallout from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation in 2016 against use of the spray over "poor or relatively lower effectiveness" compared to other vaccines.AstraZeneca later redesigned the antigens in the vaccine, earning back the CDC's recommendation starting in 2018. Since then, the CDC says it has not had enough data for new official effectiveness estimates comparing FluMist to other flu vaccines, "because of limited use" in the U.S. But AstraZeneca has cited data showing the shot has had "comparable" effectiveness in Europe versus more widely used shots.AstraZeneca had initially told investors it hoped the FDA would broaden approval in time for this flu season, after the company submitted data last year showing that adults were able to correctly follow instructions to administer the vaccine spray on their own.AstraZeneca did not comment when asked why the FDA's approval decision came later than the company previously said it expected."We're working diligently to bring this 'first-of-its-kind' innovative and convenient self-administrated flu vaccine to consumers and look forward to launching FluMist Home as soon as next flu season," a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.The spokesperson said AstraZeneca needed time to work with its partners to "ensure a seamless customer experience" for FluMist's rollout for home use.

The CDC said Missouri health officials didn’t learn that the health worker had symptoms until after the individual had recovered, too late to run a diagnostic test.“CDC is in close communication with the state of Missouri in its ongoing investigation into the positive H5N1 case there, including regarding the identification of an additional symptomatic close contact,” a spokesperson for the agency told STAT via email. “The finding does not change CDC’s assessment that the risk to the public remains low.”advertisement This makes the second time that possible cases associated with the confirmed case have come to light well after the fact. Last week it was disclosed that a household contact of the confirmed case and a health worker who had cared for the individual while he or she was in hospital had also been ill. That first health worker tested negative for influenza. In the case of the household contact, the person became ill the same day as the confirmed case, which all but rules out the possibility of person-to-person spread of the virus between these two people. Instead, it suggests that if indeed the second person was also infected with H5N1, he or she had the same exposure to the virus as the confirmed case. It is still not known how that individual contracted H5N1. Although a number of U.S. states have seen the virus spread among cows, Missouri has not reported any infected dairy cattle, or any recent poultry outbreaks involving the virus.advertisement The Missouri individual was hospitalized on Aug. 22, though the case was only reported publicly on Sept. 6, after the person had been released from hospital and had recovered. STAT tried to contact Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services several times over the past week to ask about the status of its investigation into this case. Late Friday, after the first version of this article was published, the agency provided a response.“The investigation is ongoing and health care workers that may have had contact with the case have been identified and are in the process of being followed up with,” department spokesperson Lisa Cox said in an email. Related Story Q&A: The U.S. can, and should, do more on H5N1 bird flu, a top WHO official says Missouri is conducting the investigation. The CDC can only send its disease investigators if invited by a state, and Missouri has not issued an invitation. The CDC reported on the new health care worker in an influenza “spotlight” that was posted on its website on Friday. The update revealed that Missouri has collected blood samples from both the confirmed case and the household contact. Those samples will be used for what’s known as serological testing — looking for antibodies that could confirm previous infection with H5N1 bird flu. The samples are being sent to the CDC for analysis. The CDC said that the newly identified health worker will also be asked to submit a blood sample for testing. Asked if the health care workers have agreed to provide blood samples for antibody testing, Cox said: “We should know more next week.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said there could be another explanation for this health care worker’s illness. At the time the confirmed case was in hospital, there was a lot of respiratory illness, including high levels of Covid-19 activity. “We’ll have to see what the serology shows,” Osterholm said. This news emerged as California announced it had found seven more infected dairy herds, bringing the number of affected farms in the state to 17, and the cumulative number of infected herds in the country to 215 in 14 states. The outbreak in cattle was first confirmed in late March.advertisement Determining how widespread the virus is in dairy herds is a challenge because many farmers have resisted testing their animals, seeing no upside to having their operations tied to the outbreak. Some, though, took and stored samples from ill cows earlier in the outbreak and have submitted them for testing only recently, after a federal program that compensates farmers for milk production losses went into effect. At least seven herds have been retrospectively confirmed in this way. Fourteen human cases have been detected so far this year, four involving farmworkers who worked with cattle, nine in people who worked at culling infected poultry, and the Missouri case. There have been multiple reports of symptomatic workers who have not been tested, and there is a widespread belief that the 14 confirmed cases represent only part of the human infection picture. In an effort to flesh out that issue, the CDC and the Ohio Department of Health are conducting a serological survey of veterinarians and other veterinary professions, taking advantage of a gathering of these professions at the recent annual conference of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners in Columbus, Ohio. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected from about 150 veterinarians and others from 45 states who work with cows. The goal is to see if there were any undetected infections among these individuals.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article Getting flu shots during successive pregnancies did not increase the risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, according to a large U.S. cohort study. Compared with no vaccination, immunization against influenza in successive pregnancies was not associated with any increased risk for:Preeclampsia or eclampsia (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.10, 95% CI 0.99-1.21)Placental abruption (aRR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84-1.21)Preterm birth (aRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89)Small for gestational age (aRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.05)Maternal fever (aRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47-1.59)Preterm premature rupture of membranes (aRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94-1.06)Chorioamnionitis (aRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90-1.18) Of note, interval time length between pregnancies or type of influenza vaccine formulation did not alter the associations, reported Darios Getahun, MD, PhD, MPH, of Kaiser Permanente Southern California in Pasadena, and colleagues in JAMA Network Open. "Our results have important implications for healthcare practitioners and people having successive pregnancies," Getahun and investigators posited. "These are reassuring results regarding influenza vaccine safety for pregnant people." "The study findings support recommendations to vaccinate people during pregnancy regardless of the interval between any two successive pregnancies and the type of vaccination," they added. Pregnant and postpartum women are at higher risk for serious outcomes from the flu than nonpregnant individuals. Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all individuals ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, should be vaccinated against the flu during the respiratory virus season. Vaccination during pregnancy also confers some passive immunity to newborns. The CDC maintains that flu shots are safe for pregnant women. Even so, although flu vaccine uptake among pregnant people has improved over the years, it still remains suboptimal. During the 2022-2023 respiratory virus season, coverage was 47.2% among pregnant women. Although adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes have not generally been linked to the flu vaccine, a case-control study analyzing 2010-2012 data from the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) found significantly increased odds of spontaneous abortion in mothers who were vaccinated with inactivated influenza A (pH1N1) in the previous influenza season in the first 28 days after vaccination (adjusted OR 7.7, 95% CI 2.2-27.3). However, a larger study of that database during several subsequent flu seasons failed to confirm that association. For the present study, Getahun and colleagues relied on the VSD's postmarketing vaccine safety data collected by the CDC and 13 integrated healthcare plans. The retrospective longitudinal cohort study included VSD data from 82,055 women with two singleton pregnancies from 2004 to 2018. In this population, 54.7% had received a flu shot in successive pregnancies and 45.3% were unvaccinated for both pregnancies. The mean age at the start of the second pregnancy was about 32 years in the vaccinated group and 31 in the unvaccinated group. Vaccinated women were more likely to be age 30 or older, college graduates, and to have had earlier or more frequent prenatal care and an interval between pregnancies of 1 to 3.49 years. They were also more likely to have one or more comorbidities. In the initial crude analysis of the study, researchers found that those vaccinated in successive pregnancies had modestly increased risks for preeclampsia or eclampsia (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.24), preterm premature rupture of membranes (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.18), and chorioamnionitis (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.26). However, after adjusting for a variety of factors known to negatively influence perinatal outcomes, vaccination was no longer an independent risk factor for any adverse perinatal outcome. Factors that were adjusted for included maternal age, smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, prepregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, maternal comorbidities, and a history of adverse perinatal outcomes in a prior pregnancy, among others. The authors acknowledged several limitations to their study. Women may have received flu vaccines outside healthcare organizations participating in the VSD, such as at work or a retail pharmacy. Only data from pregnancies resulting in live births were included. Also, results may have been biased due to potential unmeasured confounding factors.

However, the initial report did not state how many birds were affected. APHIS has since updated its website to include the flock size.Prior to this instance of HPAI, the last time the virus was found in a U.S. commercial poultry flock was July 19. The last time California had a commercial poultry flock affected by HPAI was January 18. That flock infection also occurred in Merced County. California also had three commercial flocks struck by HPAI on January 3, with two of those in Merced County and the other in Sonoma County.So far, all commercial poultry flocks in the United States to have been affected by HPAI during the 2022-24 outbreak have been struck by the H5N1 strain.H5N1 in dairy cattleWhile there had been a lengthy period between cases of H5N1 in California’s commercial poultry flocks, there has been a surge in H5N1 cases in the state’s commercial dairy cattle herds.On the same day the Merced County turkey flock was infected with the virus, the presence of H5N1 was confirmed in six dairy herds in the state, APHIS reported.Since the end of August, 16 dairy farms in California have had confirmed cases of H5N1.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

About 36,000 Americans die from the flu every year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Flu season typically begins in October, peaks between December and February and lasts through May. Manufactured by the pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca, FluMist requires a prescription. AstraZeneca said it intends to make FluMist available through a third-party online pharmacy that can fill the prescription if it is approved and mail it to the person who placed the order. The FDA advises that FluMist be administered by a caregiver in individuals under the age of 18.

The FDA approved FluMist as the first flu vaccine that can be self-administered at home. Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images CNN — The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first flu vaccine that does not have to be administered by a health care provider, but it won’t be available in time for this respiratory virus season. FluMist is a nasal spray manufactured by AstraZeneca that has been used to protect against influenza in the United States since 2003. It’s currently available in pharmacies and other health care settings for people ages 2 to 49 who have a prescription. A hand wearing latex gloves hold a phial of clear liquid and a syringe.

Catherine Falls Commercial/Moment RF/Getty Images Related article What to know about the vaccines available this respiratory virus season Friday’s approval from the FDA adds a second option for those eligible to receive the vaccine: It can be taken at home, through self-administration by adults or to children with the help of a caregiver. AstraZeneca plans to make the vaccine available for self-administration through a third-party online pharmacy, which will prescribe and ship the vaccine after reviewing a screening and eligibility assessment. It expects this option to be available in time for the start of next year’s respiratory virus season. “Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death,” he said. “This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA’s commitment to advancing public health.” The flu caused at least 35 million illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths in the 2023-24 season, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older each season. But uptake has fallen in recent years; last season, only about half of adults and children got their annual flu vaccine. FluMist is the only needle-free option available for flu vaccination in the US. It uses a live, weakened version of the influenza virus to provide protection, but injectable versions use different technology: either killed viruses or proteins to train the immune system to fight off the virus. AstraZeneca says FluMist has been shown to be as effective as other flu vaccines. When the FDA announced last year that it was reviewing the possibility of a self-administered flu vaccine, physicians told CNN that they welcomed more accessible options but didn’t expect that self-administration would change vaccination rates significantly.

Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and the former White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said at the time that a self-administered flu vaccine option could be even more accessible if it were available to buy on pharmacy shelves, rather than through a gatekeeper. But he noted as many as 10% to 15% of people may be needle-phobic and hesitant to get vaccines, so increasing ways to access a needle-free version could boost uptake. “I think the impact is going to be modest,” he said of the possibility. But he said he hoped it to would lead to increased awareness, potentially through more marketing from AstraZeneca, or more research into additional intranasal vaccines that are easier to get. “I see this as a relatively positive step.” CNN’s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.

Starting in fall 2025, people who want to order the vaccine to give it to themselves or their children at home will be able to do so. advertisement FluMist is the only flu vaccine administered by nasal spray, not injection. It is licensed for individuals between the ages of 2 and 49. This FDA approval makes it the only flu vaccine in the United States that can be administered at home and that does not need to be administered by a health care professional. “Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility, and accessibility for individuals and families,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. While the vaccine will continue to be available through doctors’ offices and pharmacies for administration by a health care provider, this new option means that it can be ordered for home use, as long as it will be administered by an individual 18 or older.advertisement Supplies for home administration will be ordered through an online portal, FluMist Home. Individuals will need to fill in an online questionnaire, which will be reviewed by a pharmacist to determine if they are eligible for self-administration; those approved will have their vaccine delivered to them. Related Story Q&A: The U.S. can, and should, do more on H5N1 bird flu, a top WHO official says “The approval of FluMist for self-administration is an important step forward in making vaccines more accessible to fight the high annual burden of influenza,” Iskra Reic, AstraZeneca’s executive vice president for vaccines and immune therapies, said in a statement. Side effects reported after receipt of FluMist include fever over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in children from ages 2 through 6, runny nose and nasal congestion in individuals ages 2 through 49, and a sore throat in adults 18 through 49 years of age.

From 2016 to 2023, the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in mustelids (Mustelidae), pinnipeds (Phocidae), and cetaceans (Delphinidae and Phocoenidae) in more than 24 European countries (7–9). Additional cases of H5N1virus infections in marine mammalian species (e.g., otariids, phocids, and delphinids) have subsequently been reported in Europe, North America, South America, West and South Africa (8, 9), while few reports of H5N1 virus prevalence have been documented in Australasia, with the detection of the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in Bangladesh but a lack of detection of this clade in Australia (10, 11). Then, between October and November 2022 and in 2023, the H5N1virus was confirmed along South American coasts, including Argentina, Chile, Perú, Brazil, Uruguay, the Antarctic circumpolar regions (2, 3, 5, 7, 12–16), and two remote biological diversity hotspots, the UNESCO World Heritage site Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) in September 2023, and South Georgia (sub-Antarctic) in December 2023 (7, 17). Depending on the species of wildlife, cumulative mortalities in South America due to highly pathogenic H5N1 have ranged from 3,000 to 7,000 to over 260,000 animals, including thousands of seabirds and pinnipeds that have succumbed to this deadly virus (14, 18–20). A timeline of the HPAI (H5N1) events affecting marine mammals in South America in chronological order with references from February 2021 to July 2024 is documented in Supplementary Table 1. Although H5N1 virus variant infections have not previously been found in the past within the Galapagos Islands (17), massive commercial poultry losses in Ecuador have been attributed to the highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade (21). This virus variant is suspected as the cause of the mortality of frigatebirds (Fregata sp.) and several red-footed boobies (Sula sula) on Genovesa and Wolf islands and Punta Pitt at San Cristóbal Island (17). Subsequent laboratory analysis confirmed that red-footed boobies and frigate birds and other free-ranging avian species, including the Galapagos red-billed tropical bird (Phaethon aethereus), Nazca booby (Sula granti), and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii), were infected with the H5N1virus, likely exposed to the 2.3.4.4b clade. This virus was also detected in dead or dying seabirds (e.g., frigatebirds, blue-footed bobbies) from Ecuador's mainland coast and mangroves in November 2023. According to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISIAD), the influenza genome sequence subtypes detected in early 2024 in birds of the Galápagos and Ecuador's continental coast were the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata (22). Nonetheless, the long-term population health impacts of the avian flu epizootic in endemic seabird colonies and potential horizontal transmission to endemic and endangered Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) and Galápagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) across several islands have not yet been resolved. This situation is criticalsince the virus has the capacity to rapidly mutate, evolve, and infect other warm-blooded species such as marine mammals, and is of great concern to the conservation and management of these enigmatic species (19). Herein, we provide an overview on the detection of H5N1 avian influenza in seabirds of the Galápagos Islands and reports in mammals from other regions of the world (8, 18, 19) highlighting the potential epidemiological risks and health implications to endemic pinniped populations. The emerging H5N1 avian influenza in the Galápagos Islands In contrast to prior outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, there are distinct differences in the spatiotemporal infections of the European H5N1 subtype, clade 2.3.4.4b in wild and commercial birds, as well as free-ranging wildlife (8, 23). Historically, in the European Union, there was a distinct seasonality with the number of HPAI detections in birds; however, with the current panzootic, infections have persisted from 2021 to early 2023 and the number and types of affected species have expanded (8). Aggregation in large numbers of susceptible animals is particularly prone to rapid viral dissemination once introduced. In South America, there has been a spillover of H5N1clade 2.3.4.4b to marine mammals with devastating impacts, which likely reflects a complex and dynamic transmission pathway (15), with discontinuous dissemination of the virus to susceptible host populations likely via migratory flyways. The recent detection of avian influenza in subantarctic and Antarctic seabirds reflects the further southward expansion of the virus range (24). Based on the natural history of the virus and the detection of other influenza virus types in the Galápagos Islands, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b poses a significant threat to endemic and native wildlife species. While there is no historical evidence of prior exposure of Galápagos sea lions or fur seals to influenza viruses, serological surveys between 2001 and 2002 in Santa Cruz Island documented the local exposure in introduced mammals (i.e., dogs and cats) to other viral pathogens, including canine distemper virus (CDV; 50% or 7/14), canine parvovirus (14% or 1/7), and canine adenovirus (canine infectious hepatitis virus, 100% or 1/1) in the free-ranging, feral and companion canine population (25, 26). Similarly, seroepidemiological surveys and DNA sequencing conducted at Isabela Island detected exposure to and infection with several pathogenic viruses in dogs, including canine parvovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus, and CDV, as well as feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, and feline herpesvirus 1 in cats (27). Moreover, as evidence of horizontal virus transmission from domestic dogs, Galapagos sea lion pups were already exposed to CDV over the past decade (28). One example occurred in the Galápagos sea lion colonies at Wreck Bay on San Cristóbal Island, where the death rate of juvenile and adult sea lions related to disease increased from 2008 to 2015, while pup mortality peaked in 2011 and remained high in 2012 (28). Most of the pups showed signs of upper respiratory tract infections; and, tissue samples collected in Wreck Bay during 2011–2012 confirmed the detection of CDV-RNA in six out of 48 Galápagos sea lion pups found dead in haul-out sites of Wreck Bay, where sea lions inhabit the harbor and urban environment of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno (28). Four of six pups (66.7%) were positive for CDV by nucleotide sequencing (28). Also, CDV was recently detected in a population of 125 dogs sampled at Santa Cruz, where the positivity rate detected via RT-qPCR reached 74.4% (29). Through horizontal dissemination, these pathogenic viruses have posed a significant risk to fragile local endemic pinniped populations over the last two decades (26, 30–32). Recent studies suggested that H5N1 avian influenza viruses have increased pathogenicity in laboratory mice, indicating that the virus is becoming more virulent for terrestrial mammals (33). Thus, a looming threat exists for not only local CVD outbreaks from domestic dogs but also the ongoing regional epidemic and circulation of the H5N1 strain among South American sea lions and fur seals from colonies in Perú and Chile (19), as well as in coastal seabirds in the Galápagos Islands (17). Based on the precedent of non-influenza virus transmission and infection from companion animals, the risk of exposure to sea lions is a paramount concern for the population health, conservation, and survival of these endangered Galápagos pinnipeds. Due to the propensity of Galápagos sea lions and fur seals to haul out in large numbers in rockeries and lack of prior exposure and development of protective immunity to H5N1, there is a strong likelihood of rapid viral dissemination. Based on reported mortalities in other marine mammal species along the Pacific coast of South America, the impact of infection on Galápagos sea lion and fur seal rookeries may be catastrophic. Colonies of Galápagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), flightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and Galápagos albatrosses (Phoebastria irrorata) can also be exposed in the short-term. Along the Peruvian and Chilean coastlines, multiple large-scale mortality events have been reported for Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus), Guanay cormorants (Leucocarbo bougainvillii), and a close relative of the Galápagos penguin, the Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens), and several small-toothed cetacean species (e.g., common dolphin, Delphinus delphis; Chilean dolphins Cephalorhynchus eutropia; Burmeister's porpoise, Phocoena spinipinnis), with sporadic cases in marine otters (Lontra felina) and the southern river otter (Lontra provocax) (19, 34–36). These events mark the first H5N1 spillover and avian flu mass mortality for these species in South America. In October and November 2023, the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b caused the devastating mass mortality of >17,000 southern elephant seal pups (Mirounga leonina), accounting for over 95% of the entire population in a single continental colony on Península Valdés, Argentina (18). These mass die-off events observed along the South American coasts raise serious concerns for other pinniped populations, particularly threatened or endangered species with small, geographically confined breeding populations such as Galápagos sea lions and fur seals, in the southeastern tropical Pacific. In early January 2024, 11 Galápagos sea lion pups were found dead on a rookery (La Lobería), located at San Cristóbal Islands (Figure 1). According to the field observations and inspections of dead pups, the Galápagos National Park and Ecuador's Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition reported the presence of wounds on the pups, concluding that the lesions were associated with bites inflicted by feral or stray dogs. However, given the external appearance, size and shape of apparent lesions in the dead pups (Figure 1), this mass mortality event was unlikely to be associated to dog attacks alone. No injuries were seen in other sea lions at the same rookery the next day (J. Denkinger, personal observation, 10 January 2024, USFQ, Galápagos Science Center, San Cristóbal, Galápagos, Ecuador), which would have been a typical scenario for a case where feral dogs attack a group of about 30 sea lions. Thus, questions remain on the association of the pups' mortality to a dog attack. No further clinical or diagnostic information on the cause of death or any pre-existing pathology was reported by the authorities. Without a conclusive cause of death for the pups, the possibility that these pups from La Lobería rookery died to an infection such as CDV (28), malnutrition (i.e., nutritional stress linked to more frequent, intense El Niño events or El Niño Southern Oscillation-ENSO (30, 32, 37, 38), maternal neglect and sibling conflict (39), attempted predation (40), as well as other diseases processes and environmental factors or anthropogenic stressors, cannot be ignored (28, 31, 32, 37, 41). Figure 1 Figure 1.

Discussion Small populations of endemic and endangered Galápagos pinnipeds and seabirds are currently affected by multiple anthropogenic stressors, including marine pollution, fishing pressure, and climate change (31, 32, 41, 42). These multiple anthropogenic stressors are further exacerbated by periodic El Niño and ocean warming (ENSO episodes) events, which may cumulatively impact small teetering populations of endemic species in the Galápagos (32, 38, 42). A La Niña event cold conditions was anticipated in mid-2024 and may further influence viral dissemination among the susceptible endemic seabirds and pinnipeds in the Galápagos. These environmental processes may predispose and possibly exacerbate host susceptibility to emerging pathogens (31, 32, 41). In the Galapagos Islands, epidemiological monitoring and surveillance efforts to detect and eradicate avian flu are led by the Control and Regulation of Biosecurity and Quarantine Agency in collaboration with the Galápagos National Park Directorate. These local agencies have enacted rigorous biosecurity and sanitary protocols with restricted ecotourism to visit islands harboring seabirds exposed to the influenza virus. In addition to the regional emergency response measures in the Galápagos and Ecuador's continental coast to limit the dissemination of the avian flu across the islands, we emphasize the development of appropriate reporting strategies, sampling protocols, case definitions, use of personal protection equipment (PPE), and epidemiological data sharing, as outlined in Table 1. Table 1 illustrates a high-level strategic direction to support and inform the development and/or revision of the national and regional action plans for HPAI H5N1 prevention and control intended to be adapted for the animal health sector including the wildlife component (with a particular focus on wildlife where animal health interventions can significantly reduce HPAI H5N1) and public health of a wider One Health approach to the prevention and control of HPAI H5N1 (43). Table 1 Table 1. Proposed strategic actions and recommendations to reinforce the Galápagos Islands preparedness and surveillance plan to combat HPAI H5N1 influenza virus epizootic in Ecuador in close conjunction with the Control and Regulation of Biosecurity and Quarantine Agency and the Galápagos National Park Directorate. Developing an effective multidisciplinary monitoring and surveillance program to combat viral disease affecting threatened marine-coastal fauna, including marine mammals and sea birds, from remote oceanic islands is imperative. Emergency preparedness, early detection, immediate notification, and biosecurity response, including vaccines against the avian flu (4), are fundamental in preventing strategies to protect biodiversity and humans (23, 44). In this context, it is important to implement strict biosecurity and sample collection protocols for in situ virus detection on the field to avoid further viral dissemination or breakouts (6). This emergency response program should be implemented to safeguard biodiversity following the One Health principles (23) in accordance with the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (e.g., Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 14: life below water) and the Kumming-Montreal Global Biodiversity framework. Low pathogenic avian influenza has previously been documented in seabirds in the Galápagos Islands, while highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, specifically H5N1) has not yet been identified. The HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade was identified as the cause of the massive poultry mortality in continental Ecuador (21), located 1,000 km from the Galápagos Islands) and detection of CDV in domestic and feral dogs and subsequent isolation from dead Galápagos sea lion pups establishes a precedent for horizontal transmission of highly infectious pathogens. Throughout the northern and southern hemispheres, there are profound disparities in case reporting and surveillance efforts. In the Galápagos Islands, heightening public awareness through education campaigns and contact with veterinarians is recommended. Any birds that present neurologic signs, including ataxia, torticollis, or hemiparesis, should be reported to the Galápagos National Park and Ecuador's Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition. Appropriate personal protective equipment and rigorous biosecurity measures should be instituted with suspect cases. While the H5N1 viruses continue to spread globally in record numbers and diversity of affected species, the source of infection among marine mammal species such as seals and dolphins is still poorly understood (44). Increasing surveillance for infection in marine mammals is important in assessing the risk of transmission. As these viruses continue to evolve, employing One Health measures would be prudent to limit exposures and prevent their spread including enhanced surveillance, rapid diagnostics and collaboration between animal and human sectors. Based on prior knowledge, the introduction of H5N1 into the local Galápagos sea lion and fur seal populations could have catastrophic outcomes.

The FDA said FluMist, which can be used for children 2 to 5 years old, does not need to be administered by a physician. Advertisement "Today's approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families," Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. "Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications." Marks said those complications include hospitalizations and death. The FDA said the most commonly reported side effects of FluMist are a fever of more than 100 degrees in children 2 to 6, and a runny nose and nasal congestion in people 2 through 49. The flu is a common and contagious respiratory disease that is caused by influenza viruses that typically circulate the most during the fall and winter in the United States. Advertisement According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seasonal flu activity remains low nationally, but the agency continues to recommend vaccinations as long as the virus continues to spread. Adults 65 and older, those with chronic health conditions and pregnant women continue to be the most vulnerable for the flu.

Roche plans to discuss the data with regulators. Published Sept. 19, 2024 Delilah Alvarado Staff Reporter post share post print email license Xofluza, sold by Roche, is currently approved to treat influenza symptoms and prevent infection after exposure. Courtesy of Roche Dive Brief: Roche’s antiviral drug Xofluza reduced influenza transmission among household contacts in a large Phase 3 study, the company said Wednesday. Treatment with a single dose of Xofluza within 48 hours of symptom onset lowered the likelihood an infected person passed on the virus to other individuals within the same household. Roche didn’t disclose detailed results in its press release. Xofluza is currently approved to treat flu symptoms and prevent infections after exposure to the virus. The new data bolster its benefits and, according to Roche, represent the first time an antiviral drug has reduced transmission of a respiratory virus in a global Phase 3 study. Dive Insight: Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases, typically occurring in the fall and peaking in winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections can lead to more severe disease in young children, adults over the age of 65 and immunocompromised individuals. Over the past few years, the flu’s seasonal patterns have overlapped with the circulation of respiratory syncytial virus and COVID-19. Roche’s study involved more than 4,000 people between the ages of 5 and 64, both individuals diagnosed with influenza and those within their household. Infected individuals were given a single dose of Xofluza or a placebo, and investigators tabulated how many household contacts tested positive for the flu within five days. The study also measured how many of those who did test positive developed symptoms. According to Roche, treatment was well-tolerated and no new safety signals were identified. Full data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in Australia. The U.S. government helped fund the study and gave input into its design. Xofluza competes in a market in which many preventive flu vaccines are available. Uptake among adults can be spotty, though — an issue companies like Moderna and Pfizer are trying to solve with new shots that target both flu and other respiratory illnesses. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Biotech BioPharma Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: Select Newsletter: Daily Dive M-F Select Newsletter: Commercialization Weekly Every Wednesday Select Newsletter: Gene Therapy Weekly Every Thursday Select Newsletter: Emerging Biotech Weekly Every Tuesday Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

The viruses within the influenza A category are further categorized or subtyped based on the proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are at least 130 combinations of subtypes within Influenza A, according to the CDC.“So here’s the bottom line, our influenza surveillance system is designed to find needles in haystacks,” Shah said. “And as this case and others show, it is working. And here, in this case, we found such a needle, but we don’t know how it got there.”The Missouri patient, who has significant underlying medical conditions, was admitted to a hospital on Aug. 22 after presenting to health care providers with “acute symptoms of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness,” according to the CDC. The patient is not being identified out of privacy concerns.The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services announced the diagnosis on Sept. 4, as did the CDC in a separate statement.Missouri DHSS noted the patient had recovered and been sent home from the hospital, while the CDC pointed out that the state has reported cases of H5N1 in commercial and backyard poultry flocks this year.The patient hadn’t been in contact with any livestock or poultry and didn’t indicate in a detailed questionnaire that they had consumed any food products, like raw milk, that could have potentially transmitted the virus.Shah said on the call that public health officials are technically classifying this as a case of H5 and not H5N1 as they work to sequence the virus more fully, though that might not be possible.The CDC has begun classifying the virus’ genetic sequence, but since the patient’s viral RNA levels were “extremely low” the agency may not be “able to generate a full flu genome, including the neuraminidase or the N part of the virus,” he said.“We’re throwing everything we’ve got at this, but ultimately a full sequence may not be technically feasible because of the low concentration of viral RNA,” Shah said. “The data that we do have and that have been generated thus far show an H5 virus that is closely related to the (H5N1) virus circulating among dairy cows.”The CDC, he said, is “continuing to look for evidence of genetic changes that would suggest, for example, an increased potential for spread.” None have yet been found.Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC, said the risk to the general public from bird flu remains low.“We assess risk continuously with every case and with every sort of change, and we continue to look at it as low,” Daskalakis said. “If there are changes, we would reassess that risk in real time.”While the CDC investigation is ongoing, Shah said the further out from the case public health officials get without seeing any new diagnosis, the less likely they become.“We are beyond the typical 10-day window for transmission,” Shah said. “And so with each passing day, the likelihood of this being something that’s happening deep underwater goes down.”Washington State Standard is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Seabirds often stay aloft, scanning the churning waters for elusive prey. Most seabirds take fish, squid, or other prey from the first few metres of seawater. Scavenging is common.But there are other tactics. Frigatebirds, skuas, and gulls rely on the success of other seabirds. These large, strong birds chase, harry, and attack their targets until they regurgitate or drop the prey they’ve just caught. They’re the pirates of the seabird world, stealing hard-earned meals from other species. This behaviour is known as kleptoparasitism, from the Ancient Greek word kléptēs, thief.The strategy is brutal, effective, and a core behaviour for these important seabirds. But as our new research shows, it comes with major risks for the thieves. The new strain of avian flu is killing birds by their millions – and we found kleptoparasitism could spread the virus very easily.Food thieves at seaIt’s not that frigatebirds, skuas, and gulls can’t hunt. They can and do catch their own food. But hunting fish and squid is hard work. It’s much easier to use extortion tactics to win the food from other seabirds. How climate change is altering animal brains and behaviourThese tactics have made these birds very successful as foragers. They hang around the breeding sites of birds such as gannets and terns waiting for a tired parent to return from the sea with a crop of food.For the seabirds being targeted, these kleptoparasitic birds are just one more threat. The world’s 362 species of seabird can be found across every ocean and many islands. At sea, they prey on fish and squid. When they nest or rest on islands, their nutrient-rich guano shapes soil and plant communities, defining entire ecosystems.But they are not doing well. Just under half of all seabird species (155) are now classified between “near threatened” and “critically endangered” on the world’s list of threatened species, the IUCN Red List. Of those with known trends, 56% have populations in decline.The threats they face are daunting. Invasive predators such as mice and rats eat eggs or chicks on breeding islands. Many are caught by fishing boats as accidental bycatch, while overfishing depletes their prey. Then there’s climate change, habitat loss, and many other threats, including disease.Seabirds are generally long-lived. They often raise only one chick every one or two years. Many species breed in only a few locations. They take many years to mature. Put together, these traits make recovery from population declines slow.Of parasites and virusesThree years ago, a more lethal strain of avian influenza virus emerged. This HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b strain has spread around the world, killing at least 280 million wild birds. The strain can also infect and kill marine mammals such as seals. Animal personalities can trip up science, but there’s a solution“HPAI” stands for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, meaning the virus can more readily cause severe disease and death. The strain has become an animal pandemic (formally, a panzootic). It’s made it to Antarctica, but not yet to Australia or the rest of Oceania.We know seabirds are particularly at risk. Our new research has shown kleptoparasites are at an even higher risk relative to other seabirds.During the 2022 northern hemisphere summer, the virus killed roughly half of the world’s great skua (Stercorarius skua).Food-stealing behaviour can enable the virus to spread. When a great skua harasses a gannet and makes it regurgitate food, the skua gets a fish meal – coated in saliva. If the gannet is infectious, its saliva will likely have a high viral load.Once infected, these pirate birds can drive spread faster. Skuas, frigatebirds and gulls can cover great distances across polar regions and the tropics. They can transmit the disease to their mates, chicks, and other seabirds.This means we could see outbreaks in new populations or places, hundreds or even thousands of kilometres apart. We have already seen signs of this in skua populations in the northern and southern hemispheres, with brown (Stercorarius antarcticus) and great skuas being some of the first detected H5N1 infections at new locations.Skuas more often steal food from other seabirds when away from their breeding sites – including when they’re migrating back to these areas. If skuas get infected en route, they could bring the disease to their breeding sites and then beyond.Frigatebirds are known for the red pouches on the necks of the males, which they inflate during breeding season. But they have other remarkable traits, such as travelling tens of thousands of kilometres across oceans outside breeding season. These travels are often broken up by “island-hopping”, where they will encounter and potentially infect other seabirds.Frigatebirds and skuas have already suffered mass deaths from this strain of avian influenza.While the virus is now almost everywhere, it hasn’t reached Australia, New Zealand, Oceania, and parts of Antarctica and the subantarctic. We can monitor skuas, frigatebirds and gulls for signs of illness to give us early warning that the virus has arrived.By itself, avian influenza is a major threat to seabirds. But the outlook is even more dire when this is compounded with further human-caused threats. Identifying, managing, and reducing these threats is critical for their conservation, and the health of our islands and oceans.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is predicting respiratory illness case numbers to be similar to or lower than last year’s. Health experts suggest getting a flu shot to stay protected throughout flu season.People over 65, children under 5 and pregnant people are more at risk of complications from the flu, including death.

Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. ♡ Donate nowShots are designed to protect against three strains This year, the available vaccine is trivalent, meaning it will target three strains of the influenza virus, including two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus.The vaccine is typically administered as an intramuscular injection in the arm. There is also a nasal spray vaccine, but it is not recommended for everyone. Mayo Clinic encourages people to check with their health care provider to determine if the nasal spray is safe to use. There are better times than others to get vaccinated Seasonal flu shots are available now for everyone 6 months of age and older. “The best time to get a flu shot is in September or October, but it’s never too late to get vaccinated,” said Jessica Metzger, clinical immunization unit supervisor at the Minnesota Department of Health. The CDC recommends being vaccinated by the end of October.Minnesota health officials tend to see flu cases peak in January and February, so Metzger suggests people still get vaccinated in November or December if they have not already. “The vaccine can lower the risk of getting the flu and prevent serious illness and hospitalization,” Metzger said. Protection from the shot lasts about five to six months, depending on an individual’s age. Flu shots are widely available The vaccine is readily available at Minnesota pharmacies, health care clinics and local health departments beginning in September. Metzger said it is good to get the updated flu vaccine every year due to changing strains.Most insurance plans cover 100 percent of the cost. For patients younger than 19 who do not have health insurance, the Vaccines for Children Program provides flu shots at no cost.Trump plans to revoke many Biden policies.

The intensity and exactly when surges will occur varies."Right now, we're in a late summer surge and we're coming out of that," she said. "So I think we'll likely not see that until later into the winter."Influenza is commonly introduced when there are "hot spots" in certain areas, likely when there are a lot of travelers moving in and out of the area. Influenza enters into one region first, then spreads throughout the other areas.There are updated seasonal vaccines available in some areas for COVID-19 and influenza recommended for all people six months of age and older.Oregonians can contact their healthcare provider, or search for a clinic at vaccinefinder.org, by calling 211 or visiting 211info.org.Seasonal increase in RSV hospitalizations, deaths is certain"RSV is the most common cause of hospitalizations among infants in the United States," Sutton says."Every respiratory season, we see a dramatic increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by respiratory viruses," she said. "And we cannot always predict who will become severely ill."Mothers can protect their children from the severe effects of RSV by either getting a maternal RSV vaccine during pregnancy or an injectable monoclonal antibody called Nirsevimab. Sutton said only one of these options is necessary.The maternal vaccine reduces the risk of severe outcomes in infants caused by RSV, including low oxygen in the blood, a need for mechanical ventilation and admission into an intensive care unit, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Nirsevimab protects infants and young children from severe RSV. "Nirsevimab does not provide long-term immunity to RSV disease but provides protection to infants when they are most at risk of getting severe RSV disease," according to the CDC.An RSV vaccine also is available for adults 60 years or older have underlying medical conditions, and all adults aged 75 years or older.'Very effective vaccines'Measles and pertussis are two of the most contagious diseases known, said Multnomah County Health Department Officer Richard Bruno, and have been on the rise this year in Oregon."But they also have very effective vaccines," Bruno said.There have been 31 measles cases this year, which is the biggest outbreak in Oregon since 1991, Dr. Bruno said. In 2023, there was just a single case of measles in the state, according to OHA's Disease Report."All of these cases have been unvaccinated people," Bruno said. "Unfortunately, two needed hospitalization."Bruno said the outbreak may be diminishing since the recent case was confirmed in mid-August. Now that kids are back in school, however, there may be a possibility of additional cases, he said.Oregon also has seen a spike in pertussis this year, with 560 cases, which is 534 more than in 2023, according to OHA's Disease Report."Pertussis usually begins mild. Cold-like symptoms can be missed at first," Bruno said. Eventually, it progresses into uncontrollable coughing. Babies, in particular, are at a high risk for complications including struggling to breathe."Pertussis is a bacteria," Dr. Bruno said. "So it's important to see your healthcare provider if you have a cough that's not getting better" so antibiotics can be prescribed.Most people get pertussis vaccinations when they're children, the last dose typically administered around 12 years of age. Many people get updated vaccines every 10 years as part of the tetanus booster, Bruno said.Protection can wane over time, but people who get sick will likely experience less severe symptoms, he said.How to protect yourself during the traditional respiratory infection season"Immunizations act as our best defense against severe disease, which can affect anyone," Sutton said.COVID-19, influenza, RSV, pertussis and measles are all spread when somebody who is sick coughs or sneezes.People with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection include the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying medical conditions.People with an increased risk for severe influenza include all those same groups, as well as children under five, said Sarah Laiosa, public health officer for Malheur and Harney counties.Laiosa noted there is "an incredible amount of disinformation' and encouraged Oregonians to ask their healthcare provider any questions they might have. "They want to hear from you and they want to inform and empower you," she said.“Compared with other states, we (Oregon) have among the lowest number of hospital beds per person in the nation," Laioa said. "That means that any increase in respiratory diseases can quickly fill our emergency rooms and hospitals, slowing care for all and putting incredible pressure on our dedicated frontline healthcare workers.”Strategies to reduce the risk of getting a respiratory virusIn addition to vaccination, Sutton said Oregonians can to help reduce the risk of contracting a respiratory virus by:Practicing hand hygiene and coughing etiquetteImproving ventilationStaying home when sickWearing a maskAvoiding crowded indoor gatherings when sickOregonians can monitor respiratory virus data through the OHA analytics portfolioAlexander Banks is an AAJA-SPJ reporting intern at the Statesman Journal.

By Hope Kirwan September 16, 2024 Download In this Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018 file photo, Ana Martinez, a medical assistant at the Sea Mar Community Health Center, gives a patient a flu shot in Seattle. Ted S. Warren/AP Photo After several years of declining vaccination rates, Wisconsin health officials are urging residents to get their flu shot and other boosters this fall. A national forecast for respiratory illness shows this fall and winter are expected to be more mild than last year, according to Tom Haupt, influenza surveillance coordinator for the state Department of Health Services. The 2023-24 season was considered moderate to severe, with around 4,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations in Wisconsin. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email CommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. But Haupt said whether or not this year’s season turns out to be milder depends in part on whether the expected number of state residents get their flu shots. “If we have more people being vaccinated, it could be even a less severe year,” he said. “If fewer people get vaccinated, it could be more severe.” Flu vaccination rates have declined for the last three years, with only 35 percent of Wisconsinites choosing to get the shot last winter. By comparison, nearly 44 percent of residents got a flu shot during the 2020-2021 season. COVID-19 booster rates are even worse, with fewer than 19 percent of people choosing to get the updated shot last winter. Dr. Stephanie Schauer, manager of the Wisconsin Immunization Program at DHS, said people need to remember that COVID-19 and influenza are serious diseases. “We don’t know who or how these diseases will affect an individual,” she said. Mild cases can mean “a couple of really crummy days,” she said, while severe cases can involve severe complications, hospitalization or even death. As an example, Schauer said half of the children and teens who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. last year had no underlying health conditions. Vaccinations for flu and COVID-19 are covered by most insurance plans. But for those who are uninsured or underinsured, getting the new COVID-19 booster covered will be slightly different this year. Most pandemic-era programs that provided the shot have ended, including the Bridge Access Program operated by the state last winter. But Schauer said some under- or uninsured adults will still be able to get the COVID booster through the state’s Vaccines for Adults program. The program already provides free or low-cost flu shots at around 120 providers around the state. The state will have 7,000 COVID boosters available through the program this year, which Schauer said is more than double the number of people who accessed the shot through the Bridge Access Program last year. She said people should aim to get their shots by the end of October for the best protection.

FDA approves FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration | Image Credit: © Calin - © Calin - stock.adobe.com.Influenza Vaccine Live (FluMist; AstraZeneca) is now FDA approved for the prevention of influenza disease caused by subtypes A and B for self- or caregiver-administration among individuals aged 2 to 49 years, according to an announcement from the federal agency.Initially approved for use in 2003 for individuals aged 5 to 49 years, the FDA approved use of the nasal vaccine in children as young as 2 years of age in 2007. FluMist, which still requires a prescription, contains a weakened form of live influenza virus strains that are sprayed in the nose. With the updated indication, the vaccine may be administered by a health care provider in a health care setting (including a pharmacy) or it may be administered by the vaccine recipient or a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older, the FDA stated.Tina Tan, MD, FAAP, FIDSA, FPIDS, Professor of pediatrics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University; pediatric infectious diseases attending, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, told Contemporary Pediatrics this expanded indication should help boost vaccination rates, though there are limitations."This intranasal live attenuated vaccine has been around for years as an option for influenza vaccination but utilization of the vaccine has been less than expected," Tan said. "It can only be given to healthy individuals 2 to 49 years of age with no underlying conditions, including asthma. Making it available for in home use should increase the use of this vaccine and influenza vaccine, however, it will be important that the selling of this vaccine be monitored as you do not want the wrong individuals receiving the vaccine." Tan added caution and attention to instruction for FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration should be taken, and that when available, the vaccine should help those weary of needles. "There will need to be clear instructions as to what should be done if the person does not receive the entire dose given that this is a nasal spray, but there is some volume to it, so parts of the dose could drip out of the nose," Tan said. "In home vaccine is not available this influenza season but is expected to be available next influenza season. It's definitely an option for needlephobic individuals.""Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, in a press release from the FDA.Marks is the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics and Evaluation and Research. "This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA’s commitment to advancing public health.”The common and contagious respiratory disease typically circulates during the fall and winter seasons in the United States. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), influenza has resulted in about 9.3 million to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2023. Several vaccines approved by the FDA are available during the traditional influenza season, including those recommended by the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).Fever over 100°F in children 2 through 6 years of age, runny nose and nasal congestion in individuals 2 through 49 years of age, and a sore throat in adults 18 through 49 years of age are the most commonly reported side effects of FluMist, according to the FDA. The agency noted that those interested in self- or caregiver-administration can expect the vaccine to be available via a third-party online pharmacy, and those who choose this option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order FluMist. Caregivers should administer FluMist to individuals aged 2 to 17 years, "as individuals in this age group should not self-administer the vaccine," the FDA stated.Reference:FDA Approves Nasal Spray Influenza Vaccine for Self- or Caregiver-Administration.

News CDC: Three contacts monitored after Missouri’s first H5 bird flu case by: Joey Schneider Posted: Sep 21, 2024 / 02:36 PM CDT Updated: Sep 21, 2024 / 02:37 PM CDT by: Joey Schneider Posted: Sep 21, 2024 / 02:36 PM CDT Updated: Sep 21, 2024 / 02:37 PM CDT SHARE MISSOURI – Health officials identified three contacts, including two healthcare workers, who were closely monitored after a bird flu patient in Missouri was recently hospitalized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shared Friday that two healthcare workers and one household contact were linked to Missouri’s first bird avian influenza A patient. According to the CDC… One healthcare worker developed mild respiratory symptoms, but was not tested for influenza “as the illness had resolved before the investigation began.” One healthcare worker with exposure to Missouri’s first bird flu case “was tested for influenza and was negative.” One household contact became ill on the same day that Missouri’s first bird flu patient was diagnosed, but that contact was not tested and has “since recovered.” The CDC adds that the simultaneous development of symptoms in two contacts “does not support person-to-person spread but suggests a common exposure.” The patient, an adult not identified by name, age, or gender, was hospitalized on Aug. 22. Public health officials sent a specimen from a patient upon hospitalization, then confirmed the first H5 human case in Missouri on Sept. 6. H5 is primarily found in wild birds and poultry, and recently in dairy cows and other animals, and can occasionally infect humans through close contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. However, the CDC determined on Sept. 12 that it was unable to determine if the Missouri case was related to an animal infection. The patient also did not report any known exposure to animals, per Missouri health officials. According to the CDC, the Missouri case was the 15th human case of H5 reported in the U.S. since 2022. Following its latest update, the CDC recommends that people should avoid exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows), if possible.

That’s the focus of this week’s fit and well. According to health experts, getting the flu vaccine can help reduce hospitalizations and death. A 2023 CDC study showed that flu vaccination reduced children’s risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75%. The flu vaccine is recommended for ages six months or older and for specific individuals who are more at risk. Cat Ramos, St. Luke’s immunization program coordinator, discusses why some people might feel sick after getting the flu shot. “What’s really happening is their body is building up some antibodies to help protect for when they actually do come across the flu virus,” Ramos said. “If they are having some symptoms of just general fatigue and achiness and just not feeling well after receiving the flu vaccine, that’s a good thing. That means that your body is building up those antibodies. When you do need them to fight off an actual influenza infection, it will happen. " Different flu vaccines are available for various age groups. The vaccine is widely available; call your local pharmacy to make an appointment. Copyright 2024 KMVT.

Nine birds – including one Iceland gull, three herring gulls and five great black-billed gulls were affected. Other bird species to have earlier been affected by H5N5 in Canada include northern harriers, American crows, northern fulmars and black-legged kittiwakes.Cases of H5N5 in several species of mammals have also been confirmed, including raccoons in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, striped skunks in Prince Edward Island and red foxes in Nova Scotia.No province west of Quebec has had any confirmed H5N5 cases, nor have any of the country’s territories, according to WOAH reports.To date, no commercial poultry flocks in Canada have been affected by the H5N5 strain of the virus, and it has now been seven months since the country has had any cases of H5N1 HPAI – the dominant strain in North American commercial poultry cases – have been confirmed.Wildlife surveillance as well as the Canadian Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) activities for poultry are ongoing in Canada.

GlobalData Thu, Sep 19, 2024, 7:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: ROG.SW Roche has announced positive topline data from the Phase III CENTERSTONE clinical trial of Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil), an antiviral treatment for influenza infection. A single-dose oral treatment, Xofluza is designed to hinder viral replication by stopping the cap-dependent endonuclease protein, to lower the infectiousness and disease duration. The randomised, placebo-controlled, global trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a single-dose oral administration of Xofluza in curbing the spread of flu within households. This study was conducted at 272 sites worldwide, enrolling more than 4,000 participants. It included patients aged five to 64 years who were diagnosed with influenza, referred to as index patients (IPs), and their household contacts (HHCs). The proportion of HHCs who contracted influenza within five days post-treatment with Xofluza or placebo was the trial’s primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of HHCs who tested positive for influenza by day five and also developed symptoms. According to the findings, the antiviral treatment was demonstrated to significantly reduce the transmission of influenza viruses. The study also met its primary endpoint, with a single dose of Xofluza taken by IPs significantly reducing the likelihood of household members contracting the virus. In the trial, Xofluza was found to be well tolerated without any new safety signals detected. Roche global product development head and chief medical officer Levi Garraway said: “Building on Xofluza’s established efficacy in treating and preventing influenza after exposure, this new evidence of transmission reduction represents an important advance that could help improve health outcomes at an individual and community level. “We look forward to discussing these data with regulatory authorities and public health organisations for influenza pandemic preparedness to bring these benefits to patients.” In July, Roche reported positive topline data from the ongoing multi-part Phase I clinical trial of CT-996, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity.

easy to miss the impending arrival of flu season. Of course, you can get sick from the influenza virus at any time of the year, but it is far more likely in the fall and winter. Those colder months are more jarring in northern cities like Chicago and New York, but the flu is no less threatening in the Sunshine State. And the vaccine might not just protect you from the flu. if you have a pre-existing heart condition, getting a flu shot is an important step toward protecting your heart health. Influenza Dangers Fewer than half of U.S. adults get the flu vaccine annually. One of the benefits of this statistic is that it creates a large body of data to help understand the value of vaccinations for the heart. Among the things we have learned: You are 20 percent less likely to die from heart issues if you have been vaccinated. Researchers do not fully understand why, but studies have shown that people are six times more likely to have a heart attack in the week after being diagnosed with the flu. Among the theories is that inflammation related to the flu could be the culprit. Heart attacks can be caused by blockages created when plaque (made of cholesterol and other substances) interferes with the normal flow of blood through your arteries. Inflammation may cause plaque deposits to become unstable and rupture. This makes people with heart disease particularly vulnerable to flu-related complications, including: Bronchitis Heart attack Heart failure Pneumonia Stroke Getting a Flu Shot The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu shots for anyone over the age of 6 months. But that advice is particularly important for anyone with a heart condition – including heart disease, a previous heart attack, heart bypass or heart stents. There are several reasons why people are hesitant to get vaccinated, including a fear of needles. But one of the biggest drivers is a concern about potential side effects – namely the mistaken belief that you can get the flu from the vaccine. It’s true that there can be some uncomfortable side effects, including swelling and redness around the injection site, muscle aches, chills, fever and nausea. But these symptoms tend to be mild and do not mean you have the flu, which hospitalizes up to 800,000 people a year. And going back to the heart connection – half of those hospitalizations are people with heart disease. Some studies even suggest that mildly adverse reactions to the shot may be a sign that your body is developing a stronger immune response. It’s important to remember the vaccine doesn’t guarantee you won’t get the flu. But it will lower your risk and the severity of the illness and its complications. Instead of being hospitalized, for example, you may only experience chills and a fever for a few days. That means your efforts to protect yourself against the flu don’t end with an injection. Other Flu Prevention Tips In addition to getting vaccinated, there are other preventive measures you can take, including: Don’t touch your face. When you touch a surface contaminated with germs and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth, it increases your risk of getting sick. Cover your nose and mouth. Wearing a face covering when you are outside your home can help protect against the flu and other airborne viruses and bacteria. Eat nutritious food. A balanced diet rich in nutrients boosts your immune system and overall health. Exercise. Regular physical activity bolsters your immune system, helps maintain a healthy weight and is good for your heart health. Wash your hands frequently. Thoroughly wash with soap and water after leaving your home, touching contaminated surfaces or coming into close contact with others.

Plymouth - 07/17/19 - Cows in Plymouth leave the barn to graze. Lane Turner/Globe Staff By Eva Levin September 16, 2024 FacebookTwitterEmailEmail... All Massachusetts dairy farms are 100 percent free of bird flu, state officials announced on Monday. At least 14 states across the country since March have herds that have tested positive for avian influenza, the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources said.Massachusetts is the first state to test dairy herds and have 100 percent negative results, the department said in a statement. Officials said they decided to test the herds to “protect public health” and demonstrate the safety of food from Massachusetts farms. In August, inspectors went to all 95 licensed dairy farms in Massachusetts to collect and test milk samples, the statement said.Advertisement:“Massachusetts dairy farmers follow stringent safety protocols and take great pride in producing the highest-quality products,” said Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources Commissioner Ashley Randle. “That hard work protects all of us, and these test results demonstrate how supporting local agriculture and sourcing food from Massachusetts farms can keep our food supply strong and resilient.”When avian influenza, or bird flu, affects a lactating cow, it can result in an “abnormal appearance of milk,” according to the American Veterinary Medicine Association. In some cases, it affects the cow’s appetite and reduces milk production. Some dairy farmers have contracted bird flu by coming into contact with unpasteurized milk from infected cows, state officials said. No human cases have been reported in Massachusetts.Advertisement:“Pasteurization kills the virus and renders it safe for human consumption,” the state’s Department of Agricultural Resources said.David Shepard, President of the Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers said in the statement he was “grateful” for the government assuring the safety and security of the Massachusetts dairy business.

(CDC, NIAID via AP) By Paul Sisson | paul.sisson@sduniontribune.com | The San Diego Union-TribunePUBLISHED: September 16, 2024 at 7:47 PM PSTSan Diego’s wastewater treatment plant in Point Loma is among five statewide that has detected the H5 influenza virus, often called bird flu, since May.San Diego’s positive result came from a sample taken Sept. 1 by WastewaterSCAN, a private monitoring service based at Stanford University. Subsequent samples collected and tested Sept. 2 and Sept. 8 have not shown similar indications.Likewise, a county program that routinely tests dead birds for a range of pathogens, including avian influenza, has not found any evidence of the virus locally.Dr. Erik Berg, interim medical director of the county’s epidemiology and immunization services branch, said Monday afternoon that a public health notification sent out in the early evening Monday was undertaken out of an abundance of caution.While bird flu can be deadly for humans, those who work in agriculture are at much higher risk than the general population.“For the general public, the CDC’s risk assessment is that the threat to the general public is low, and we agree,” Berg said.He said that it would be a mistake to assume that the virus found in local wastewater, which was estimated to be of low concentration, necessarily came from a human. While sanitary sewer systems are designed, built and operated to be self-contained systems, there are ways, such as pipe breaks, that can allow infiltration from the surrounding environment.“We have the closed sewage system, so storm water runoff is not supposed to intermix with the wastewater, but, you know, we all know that’s not perfect,” Berg said, adding that viral genetic material was detected in such a low volume that further testing to determine what type of host may have been infected could not be performed. Kristian Andersen, a virologist at Scripps Research in San Diego, said in an email Monday that it is an open question why H5 flu viruses are showing up sporadically in some municipal wastewater treatment samples.“It could be human infections; however, it could also be people discarding milk that contains the virus itself or genetic material from it,” Andersen said.It is clear that this problem goes far beyond San Diego County.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently characterized the virus as a “public health challenge posed by a multistate outbreak of avian influenza virus … in dairy cows, poultry and other animals.”San Diego County’s public health department notes in its statement that there have been no human cases of bird flu in the region thus far, and dead birds tested for H5 have also come back negative.Why is the county publicizing the finding now, more than two weeks after it occurred? Discussions with the state and notification of local farms, a county official said, were prioritized after local public health officials received notification from SCAN on Sept. 9.While the virus is of particular concern for beef and poultry producers, the virus can be deadly when it crosses into human populations. The CDC indicates that since March 24 it has confirmed 14 human cases among 240 people who have been exposed.The CDC recently detailed a particularly concerning case that popped up in Missouri in a person “without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals.” On Friday, Sept. 13, the CDC noted that the other 13 cases detected since April have all had confirmed exposure to animals.“Four of these cases were associated with exposure to sick dairy cows, and nine were associated with exposure to avian influenza A (H5N1) virus-infected poultry,” a CDC statement said.In addition to San Diego, wastewater bird flu detections in California included west Contra Costa County on June 10, Turlock on Sept. 4, southeast San Francisco on June 18 and June 26 and Palo Alto on July 4, July 9 and June 19.

As we barrel towards the thick of winter, there are things you can do to keep you and your family healthy. Dr. David Dobrzynski, an infectious disease expert with UR Medicine, answers your questions about vaccines, symptoms, and more. Can I get all three vaccines at the same time? If you’re eligible for all three vaccines—COVID, flu, and RSV—you may wonder whether to get them all at once or space them out. The answer depends on you! Are you interested in participating in our clinical trial? The University of Rochester Medical Center's RSV Clinical Trial aims to evaluate the combined use of two FDA-approved drugs to optimize RSV prevention in infants. This study is open to pregnant individuals aged 18 to 45, with visits lasting over 14 months. Participation is at no cost, and compensation is provided for study visits. Join today to contribute to necessary research that could potentially help protect infants from RSV. While it is safe to do so, some people might feel unwell after receiving more than one vaccine at once. Dr. Dobrzynski recommends speaking to your primary care doctor about whether to get more than one vaccine at once. Does the flu shot cover RSV? No. Each vaccine only protects against its respective virus. A flu shot will not protect against COVID-19 or RSV; and so on. For the best protection, get each vaccine or booster you're eligible for. Who should get the flu vaccine?Everyone should get the flu vaccine to protect themselves and others during the fall or winter. Is it ever too late to get your annual flu shot? It’s never too late to get your flu shot. “We strongly encourage people to get annual flu shots, COVID boosters, and the RSV vaccine if eligible. Despite potential feelings of vaccine fatigue, our community members should resume normal practices of getting flu vaccines every year,” said Infectious Disease specialist Angela Branche, MD. Who should get the COVID vaccine? Everyone should strongly consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine to protect themselves and others from severe disease. The vaccines were recently updated to include the recently circulating variant to help provide better protection.Updated versions of the COVID-19 vaccine are available. Infectious disease experts Angela Branche, MD, Ann Falsey, MD, and Ed Walsh, MD, joined WXXI to discuss vaccine efficacy and virus mutations. Read the latest Who should get the RSV vaccine?Currently, the RSV vaccine is recommended for people over 60 years of age with an increased risk of disease (those with heart and lung disease or immunocompromised) and everyone over 75 years of age. "We also recommend pregnant patients receive the vaccine during weeks 32-36 of pregnancy from Sept-Jan," said Dr. Dobrzynski. While you can get the RSV vaccine at any time of the year, late summer/early fall is best. Do babies need the RSV vaccine? In 2023, a new RSV immunization called nirsevimab was made available for infants. The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that the vaccine is given during the first 8 months of life to protect infants. Nirsevimab is given to all infants born in the hospital during respiratory virus season, running from October to March. Parents of children 0-8 months who have not received the vaccine can also ask their pediatrician for availability.

The symptoms of all three illnesses are quite similar, making many ask: Is it COVID, flu, or RSV? While symptoms vary from person to person, some symptoms are much more common in one virus or another. If you come down with symptoms of flu, COVID-19, or RSV, the most important thing to remember is to avoid close contact with others and stay away from gatherings. Can you be sick with all three illnesses at once? Talk about uninvited…Is it possible to have influenza, COVID-19, and RSV all at the same time? While getting two or three of all three respiratory viruses at the same time is fairly rare, it is technically possible. In general, people only come down with one at a time. Do we still need to worry about COVID? Cases of COVID-19 continue to circulate throughout our community. We've seen increasing COVID-19 cases locally throughout the past summer months, and expect to continue to see local increases across the country throughout the winter.Be sure to get boosted for COVID-19 if you are due. If you recently had COVID-19, the CDC says to consider waiting three months before getting the COVID booster. If you are feeling ill from COVID-19, there are options for symptom relief. “Call your primary care physician to discuss Paxlovid or molnupiravir. Both medications are more widely available than they once were,” said Dr. Branche.If you have additional questions, reach out to your primary care physician or chat with a provider via Virtual Urgent Care.

The CDC says the risk of H5N1 to the general population remains low. BSIP/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Images CNN — A third close contact of a patient in Missouri who was hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu has reported that they also experienced symptoms, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The person, a health care worker, was not tested because their symptoms resolved before the investigation into the illnesses began, according to the CDC. Scientists say they are concerned that the bird flu virus infecting dairy cows and poultry flocks in the US will have opportunities to become a more dangerous virus over the fall and winter. David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe/Getty Images Related article The US is entering a riskier season for spread of H5N1 bird flu. Here’s why experts are worried This is the second health care worker to report that they developed symptoms after being in contact with the patient. The first was tested for flu, and the results were negative, the CDC said. The agency says the risk of H5N1 to the general population remains low. Normally, health care workers are of high interest to disease detectives because they are often among the first to fall ill in outbreaks. But this is far from a cut-and-dried case. The patient had underlying medical conditions that compromised their lung function, and when tested, the concentration of virus in a sample taken from them was low, which would normally suggest a mild or perhaps waning infection. “At this point, my index of concern is still low,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. He is not involved in the Missouri investigation. He notes that there are plenty of other infections going around that might cause respiratory symptoms. “At the same time, we’ve had tremendous activity with Covid at that very time, as well as RSV, and so you would expect to see potentially several percent of the population having respiratory symptoms not due to influenza,” Osterholm added. In a hospital setting, workers would be even more likely to encounter those bugs. Still, the discovery of additional suspect cases this late into the investigation raises questions. “It’s unclear why this wasn’t reported with the other cases, and moves to identify influenza cases early are needed,” said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine. “We need more details of whether this is influenza infection or another respiratory virus. Serology will be useful in all these cases, as well as other contacts that may not have had symptoms,” said Lakdawala, who studies transmission of the H5N1 virus but also is not involved in the Missouri investigation.

No positive herds have been reported in Missouri. How the Missouri patient caught H5N1 is still a mystery. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has interviewed the person as well as a household contact who got sick the same day but was not tested. They have reported no exposures to sick cows, birds or other animals, and no exposure to raw milk. Both people have recovered from their illnesses. Investigators collected blood samples from them this week. The samples have been sent to the CDC for testing for antibodies to the virus that causes bird flu, which would indicate a previous infection.
