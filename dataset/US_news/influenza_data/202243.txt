Historically, persons from some racial and ethnic minority groups have had higher rates of influenza hospitalization and death and lower influenza vaccination coverage than White persons. What is added by this report? Racial and ethnic disparities in influenza disease severity and vaccination coverage, along with disparities in access to care, have persisted since the 2009–10 and 2010–11 influenza seasons. What are the implications for public health practice? Tailored efforts to increase access to influenza vaccination and improve vaccine confidence among racial and ethnic minority communities, including creating culturally relevant communication campaigns and offering vaccination in nontraditional settings, are critical and might decrease disparities in influenza vaccination and disease severity.

Persons from some racial and ethnic minority groups have historically experienced higher rates of severe influenza and had lower influenza vaccination coverage compared with non-Hispanic White (White) persons. This report examines influenza hospitalization and vaccination rates by race and ethnicity during a 12–13-year period (through the 2021–22 influenza season). Methods: Data from population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in selected states participating in the Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) from the 2009–10 through 2021–22 influenza seasons (excluding 2020–21) and influenza vaccination coverage data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the 2010–11 through 2021–22 influenza seasons were analyzed by race and ethnicity. Results: From 2009–10 through 2021–22, age-adjusted influenza hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 population) were higher among non-Hispanic Black (Black) (rate ratio [RR] = 1.8), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN; RR = 1.3), and Hispanic (RR = 1.2) adults, compared with the rate among White adults. During the 2021–22 season, influenza vaccination coverage was lower among Hispanic (37.9%), AI/AN (40.9%), Black (42.0%), and other/multiple race (42.6%) adults compared with that among White (53.9%) and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (54.2%) adults; coverage has been consistently higher among White and Asian adults compared with that among Black and Hispanic adults since the 2010–11 season. The disparity in vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity was present among those who reported having medical insurance, a personal health care provider, and a routine medical checkup in the past year. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Racial and ethnic disparities in influenza disease severity and influenza vaccination coverage persist. Health care providers should assess patient vaccination status at all medical visits and offer (or provide a referral for) all recommended vaccines. Tailored programmatic efforts to provide influenza vaccination through nontraditional settings, along with national and community-level efforts to improve awareness of the importance of influenza vaccination in preventing illness, hospitalization, and death among racial and ethnic minority communities might help address health care access barriers and improve vaccine confidence, leading to decreases in disparities in influenza vaccination coverage and disease severity. Top Introduction Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that can lead to serious illness, hospitalization, and death. CDC estimates that influenza resulted in 9–41 million illnesses, 140,000–710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–52,000 deaths annually during 2010–2020 (1,2). Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months except when contraindicated (3). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. For example, during the 2019–20 season, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 7.5 million influenza illnesses, 105,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 6,300 influenza-associated deaths (4). Persons from some racial and ethnic minority groups experience higher rates of severe influenza and have lower influenza vaccination coverage rates compared with White persons (5,6). This report presents 1) influenza hospitalization rates by race and ethnicity from the 2009–10 through 2021–22 seasons; 2) trends in influenza vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity from the 2010–11 through 2021–22 seasons; and 3) influenza vaccination coverage stratified by race and ethnicity and health care access variables for the 2021–22 season and possible reasons for observed disparities. Top Methods FluSurv-NET. The Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) has been previously described (5,7). Briefly, FluSurv-NET conducts all-age, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in selected states representing approximately 8%–9% of the U.S. population. Persons met the FluSurv-NET case definition if they resided in the FluSurv-NET catchment area,* were admitted to a hospital during October 1–April 30† and received a positive influenza test result ≤14 days before hospitalization or during hospitalization. Cases in persons aged <18 years and cases from the 2020–21 season were excluded from this analysis because case counts during this season were too low to calculate rates by race and ethnicity. Population denominators used for rate estimation were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics.§ Unadjusted rates, stratified by age group (18–49, 50–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years), race and ethnicity,¶ and influenza season were calculated by dividing the number of hospitalizations by the total catchment population. Unadjusted rates by race, ethnicity, and age group were multiplied by the age distribution of the total FluSurv-NET catchment population to obtain age-adjusted rates; the age groups referenced previously were used for the age adjustment. For rates and rate ratios (RRs), 95% CIs were calculated assuming a simple random sample design and a normal distribution via the SAS STDRATE procedure. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Influenza Vaccination Coverage. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based random-digit–dialed cellular and landline telephone survey that collects information on various health conditions and risk behaviors from one randomly selected adult aged ≥18 years in a household.** BRFSS data for adults aged ≥18 years were analyzed to estimate influenza vaccination coverage for the 2010–11 through 2021–22 influenza seasons. The analysis includes data collected from interviews completed during September–June of each season and vaccine doses received during July–May. Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, and if so, in which month and year. Vaccination coverage estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, as previously described (6). For the 2021–22 season, for which more detailed data stratified by race and ethnicity and access to care variables are presented, vaccination coverage estimates are based on 291,839 completed interviews; 28,007 respondents were excluded from the analysis because there was no information on whether they had received an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months. The median state BRFSS response rate for a complete or partially complete interview was 42.5% for September–December 2021 and 45.4% for January–June 2022. All estimates were weighted and analyzed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International) statistical software to account for the complex survey design. Differences between estimates were determined using t-tests with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. For each data system, activities were reviewed by CDC and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† Sites participating in FluSurv-NET obtained approval from their respective state and local institutional review boards, as applicable. The requirement for informed consent was waived per 45 CFR 46. Top Results From 2009–10 through 2021–22 (excluding 2020–21), age-adjusted influenza-associated hospitalization rates per 100,000 population among adults, by race and ethnicity were as follows: Black, 78.2; AI/AN, 54.6; Hispanic, 50.3; White, 43.0; and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), 34.5 (Figure 1). Compared with age-adjusted rates among White adults, rates were higher among Black (RR = 1.8), AI/AN (RR = 1.3), and Hispanic adults (RR = 1.2) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121713) with some variation by influenza season. During most influenza seasons, age-adjusted hospitalization rates were highest among Black adults, ranging from 1.5 to 2.4 times the rates among White adults. During the 2011–2012 and 2021–22 seasons, the highest influenza-associated hospitalization rates were among AI/AN adults, with age-adjusted rates 2.7 times those in White adults. Age-adjusted hospitalization rates among Hispanic adults were 2.1 times those among White adults in 2009–10 and 2021–22 (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121713). In every season except 2011–12, API adults had the lowest hospitalization rates among all racial and ethnic groups, from 60% to 90% of those among White adults. Overall vaccination coverage in the 2021–22 influenza season was 49.4% among adults aged ≥18 years and varied by race and ethnicity. Coverage was higher among White adults (53.9%) than among AI/AN (40.9%), Hispanic (37.9%), Black (42.0%), and multiracial and adults of other races (42.6%) and was similar to that among Asian adults (54.2%) (Table). From the 2010–11 through 2021–22 seasons, overall adult influenza vaccination coverage increased from 40.5% to 49.4% and increased within all racial and ethnic groups except AI/AN adults (Figure 3). Between the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, coverage decreased among all adults by 0.8 percentage points and among White adults by 1.6 percentage points. In all other racial and ethnic groups, coverage was stable during the 2018–19 through 2021–22 influenza seasons. Since the 2010–11 influenza season, coverage has been consistently higher among White and Asian adults compared with that among Black and Hispanic adults. During the 2021–22 influenza season, vaccination coverage among all racial and ethnic groups was higher among adults aged ≥65 years than among younger adults and among the following groups: those with medical insurance compared with those without medical insurance; those who had a personal health care provider compared with those without a personal health care provider; and those who had had a routine medical checkup in the past year compared with those who had not. However, compared with White adults, Hispanic adults were less likely to have medical insurance, and Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races were less likely to have a personal health care provider and a medical checkup in the past year. In addition, among adults with medical insurance, a personal health care provider, and a routine medical checkup in the past year, and in most age and education strata, influenza vaccination coverage was higher among White adults than among Black, Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races (Table). Top Discussion Racial and ethnic disparities in influenza-associated hospitalizations were consistently observed among Black, AI/AN, and Hispanic adults compared with White adults, with hospitalization rates an average of 1.2 to 1.8 times those in White adults during the past 13 seasons. Similar disparities have been observed for COVID-19 hospitalizations (8). The reasons for these disparities in severe respiratory disease are likely multifactorial. Influenza vaccination coverage continues to be lower among Black, AI/AN, and Hispanic adults compared with coverage among White and Asian adults. Distrust of the medical system, misperceptions about vaccine safety, and higher levels of concern about side effects have contributed to lower coverage (9). Members of racial and ethnic minority groups might face barriers to affordable, quality health care, including access to health insurance, transportation to health providers, and child care; therefore, they might have fewer opportunities for preventive health care and increased vulnerability to chronic medical conditions (10). Higher prevalences of chronic medical conditions have been independently associated with more severe influenza outcomes (11,12), and downstream effects of structural racism have been demonstrated to affect economic stability, housing, and education (10,13,14). In addition, poverty, crowded housing, and community exposure to respiratory diseases are associated with more severe influenza disease (15,16). In contrast to the decline in influenza vaccination observed among children during the COVID-19 pandemic (6), recent coverage among adults has not decreased compared with prepandemic estimates. However, longstanding disparities in coverage by race and ethnicity remain. The finding that adults of some minority racial and ethnic groups were less likely than White adults to have medical insurance and a personal health care provider suggests that access to influenza vaccination likely plays a role in lower coverage among these groups. Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage that were evident early in the COVID-19 vaccination program have decreased or been eliminated over time, likely related to efforts by immunization programs to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination, such as making vaccines available free of charge at varied and nontraditional locations (17,18). However, disparities in COVID-19 booster vaccination are now evident, and differences in influenza vaccination coverage within most socioeconomic and access-to-care strata suggest that in addition to access limitations, other factors contributed to disparities in coverage. A provider recommendation and offer of vaccination is strongly associated with vaccination (19). BRFSS does not collect information on receipt of provider recommendations or offers of vaccination; however, variables such as having a medical checkup in the past year and having a personal health care provider can serve as proxies for these data. Overall, adults who reported having a medical checkup in the past year were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not. Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races were less likely than were White adults to report having a personal health care provider and a routine medical checkup in the past 12 months. Moreover, even among Black, Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races who reported a recent medical checkup, influenza vaccination coverage was <50% and was also lower than coverage among White adults with a recent medical checkup, suggesting that missed opportunities for influenza vaccination occurred during these visits. Following the standards for adult immunization practice, providers should assess patient vaccination status at all medical visits and offer (or provide a referral for) all recommended vaccines (20). Meeting this standard in a culturally responsive manner could help reduce observed disparities in vaccination coverage. Programmatic efforts and communication campaigns, such as Partnering for Vaccine Equity: Equity in Adult vaccination, that have brought COVID-19 vaccines to communities through nontraditional settings (local libraries, local businesses [e.g., barber shops/salons, thrift stores, restaurants, and grocery stores], and school-based events) likely contributed to decreased disparities in COVID-19 vaccination and might also decrease disparities in influenza vaccination.§§ Surveys collected after 2 years of a tailored vaccination campaign¶¶ collaboratively led by the Ad Council, the American Medical Association, and CDC indicated that concerns about influenza vaccine risks or side effects were reduced from 43% to 33% among Black adults and from 41% to 32% among Hispanic adults. The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, because FluSurv-NET surveillance is conducted in selected counties within the United States, findings might not represent the entire U.S. population. Second, influenza-associated hospitalizations reported to FluSurv-NET are identified by clinician-directed testing; hospitalization rates might be underestimated, as they have not been adjusted for testing practices, which differ by surveillance site, age group, and timing during influenza seasons (2) and might also vary by race and ethnicity. Third, within FluSurv-NET data, approximately 17% of persons were missing ethnicity and were classified based only on their reported race; 7% were missing race. Fourth, weighting adjustments for BRFSS survey data used to assess influenza vaccination coverage might not eliminate all possible bias from incomplete sample frame because households with no telephones are excluded. Fifth, survey response rates were low, and influenza vaccination coverage might differ between survey respondents and nonrespondents; survey weighting adjustments might not adequately control for these differences. Sixth, influenza vaccination status was self-reported and subject to recall error and social desirability bias. Finally, errors in BRFSS data from incomplete sample frame, nonresponse, and accuracy of reported influenza vaccination status might change over time, which could lead to inaccurate assessment of trends in vaccination coverage. The findings in this report highlight persistent disparities in influenza disease severity among adults in some racial and ethnic minority groups during 2009–2022, as well as continued disparities in influenza vaccination coverage among adults during the same period. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage among racial and ethnic minorities could reduce disparities in the risk for severe disease. National, state, and community-level efforts to build trust, increase access to vaccination services, and combat misinformation among racial and ethnic minority communities are important actions for increasing vaccination coverage in these groups. Interventions that support and promote partnerships at the community level to effectively reduce racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination include creating and training (or partnering with) a network of local community trusted messengers reflecting the communities served; using trusted messengers to address misinformation and promote accurate, culturally responsive vaccine messages, including through social media; and working with culturally competent health care providers to provide a strong recommendation for influenza vaccination. National, tailored influenza vaccination campaigns can reinforce local efforts to increase awareness of the importance of influenza vaccination among target audiences to encourage increased vaccination coverage among these groups.

Top * Emerging Infections Program sites include selected counties in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee, and FluSurv-NET sites include selected counties in Idaho (2009–10 to 2010–11 only), Iowa (2009–10, 2012–13, 2020–21, and 2021–22 only), Michigan and North Dakota (2009–10 only), Ohio (2010–11 to 2021–22), Oklahoma (2009–10 to 2010–11 only), Rhode Island (2010–11 to 2012–13 only), South Dakota (2009–10 only) and Utah (2010–11 to 2021–22). Across these seasons, approximately 25–29 million persons (8%–9% of the U.S. population) were in the FluSurv-NET catchment area. † Period for the 2009–10 season was April 15, 2009, through April 30, 2010, and the period for 2021–22 was October 1, 2021, through June 11, 2022. § https://www.cdc.govchsvss/bridged_race.htm ¶ For FluSurv-NET data, race and ethnicity were categorized using the National Center for Health Statistics categories as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native. Persons of more than one race or of unknown race were excluded from the FluSurv-NET analysis because population denominators were not available for these groups. Persons of any race (including unknown race) but of Hispanic ethnicity were classified as Hispanic. In 17% of included persons (across all seasons), ethnicity was unknown, but race was known; these persons were assumed to be of non-Hispanic ethnicity. In the 2017–18 season, race and ethnicity were collected on a stratified random sample of hospitalized adult influenza patients aged ≥50 years, so sampling weights were used to calculate the weighted number of hospitalizations by race and ethnicity that season. For BRFSS data, race and ethnicity were categorized similarly in the vaccination coverage analyses with two exceptions: 1) non-Hispanic persons reporting more than one race were categorized along with persons reporting Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and “other” race into a “Non-Hispanic other/multiple race” category; and 2) persons of unknown ethnicity or race were excluded from the analysis (2.8% of BRFSS respondents in the 2021–22 season). ** https://www.cdc.gov/brfss †† 45 CFR. part 46.102[l][2], 21 CFR part 56; 42 USC Sect. 241[d]; 5 USC Sect. 552a; 44 USC Sect. 3501 et seq. §§ https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/health-equity/ ¶¶ https://getmyflushot.org/ TopReferences CDC.

To discover host antiviral restriction factors that may act as suitable targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies, we here conduct a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen with influenza B virus (IBV). A top hit from our screen, beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (B3GAT1), effectively blocks IBV infection. Subsequent studies reveal that B3GAT1 activity prevents cell surface sialic acid expression. Due to this mechanism of action, B3GAT1 expression broadly restricts infection with viruses that require sialic acid for entry, including Victoria and Yamagata lineage IBVs, H1N1/H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAVs), and the unrelated enterovirus D68. To understand the potential utility of B3GAT1 induction as an antiviral strategy in vivo, we specifically express B3GAT1 in the murine respiratory epithelium and find that overexpression is not only well-tolerated, but also protects female mice from a lethal viral challenge with multiple influenza viruses, including a pandemic-like H1N1 IAV. Thus, B3GAT1 may represent a host-directed broad-spectrum antiviral target with utility against clinically relevant respiratory viruses.

Further, the aerosol transmission of respiratory infections has facilitated global pandemics with influenza A viruses (IAVs) and coronaviruses and the threat of future pandemics from a variant of these (or currently unknown) viruses remains a source of concern3,4. While vaccination is generally considered the best strategy to prevent such infections, many known viral strains still lack effective vaccination strategies5,6. Additionally, emerging respiratory viruses with unknown correlates of protection can require significant lead times before protective vaccines can be developed and distributed7. In the absence of safe and efficacious vaccines, broad-spectrum antiviral preventative and therapeutic strategies would likely represent a front-line defense against infection.Current FDA-approved antiviral prophylactic and therapeutic compounds in clinical use against common respiratory-transmitted viruses are predominantly direct-acting antivirals8,9. These small molecules directly bind a viral protein to prevent its functionality and inhibit viral replication. However, as viruses both require and can be restricted by different host proteins, there is emerging interest in modulating the host cell itself to prevent viral replication. While direct-acting antivirals often lead to the development of resistant viral mutants10,11, antiviral strategies targeting the host are thought to potentially offer a higher barrier to resistance9. Another potential benefit of host-directed antiviral strategies is a derivative of the observation that many viruses rely on, or are restricted by, the same host pathways;12,13,14,15,16 this suggests that at least some host-directed therapeutics may have broad activity against unrelated viral strains. A major current limitation of this approach, however, is that the host targets which could be safely modulated and broadly efficacious for restricting viral infection are incompletely defined.The development of high-throughput screening approaches has allowed for rapid discovery of both host dependency factors and viral restriction factors12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32. While many screens have been conducted, a clear candidate for the development of a host-directed antiviral has remained elusive. High-priority candidates would theoretically be broadly required for (or restrictive of) multiple viruses, possess an ability to be safely modulated in vivo, and block an essential step of the virus replication cycle. In order to define such factors, screening with influenza viruses offers an attractive experimental system, as multiple features of the life cycle are highly conserved with other viruses33,34, virus-permissive cell culture models amenable to screening are readily available, and they are among the top causes of severe virus-induced respiratory illness35. Our previous CRISPR/dCas9 activation screening with IAV identified a host factor that displayed strong inhibition of infection, but with activity restricted to a subset of influenza viruses12. In order to find novel and potentially more broadly acting restriction factors with activity against human viral strains, we decided to perform a screen with a strain of influenza B virus (IBV) as IBVs are almost exclusively human pathogens36 and high-throughput IBV screens for viral restriction factors have not been previously reported.Using the B/Yamagata/16/1988 (Yam/88) strain of IBV, our CRISPR activation screen identified the host glycosyltransferase beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (B3GAT1) as a bona fide viral restriction factor. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that B3GAT1 likely prevents viral receptor binding by outcompeting host cell sialyltransferases to prevent cell surface expression of the viral sialic acid receptor. As such, B3GAT1 displayed broad restrictive activity against viruses that require sialic acid for entry. These viruses included IBV strains from both the Victoria and Yamagata lineages, antigenically distinct H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains, and the phylogenetically unrelated endemic enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). We also showed that B3GAT1 can be transiently, and safely, expressed in the murine respiratory tract to confer protection against lethal influenza virus challenges in vivo. These data represent proof-of-concept for the potential efficacy of host-directed antiviral strategies and highlight B3GAT1 as an attractive potential target for the future development of novel antiviral approaches.ResultsA genome-wide CRISPR activation screen identifies restriction factors for influenza B virusTo discover host factors that may broadly restrict human respiratory viruses, we selected a well-characterized isolate of IBV, Yam/88. To conduct the screen, A549 cells expressing dCas9-VP64 were transduced at low MOI with the Calabrese activation library37 of sgRNAs such that each cell received either one or zero sgRNAs. Transduced cells were then selected for antibiotic treatment and passaged for 5 days. Half the library was then collected to determine the input and the remaining cells were infected with Yam/88. After infection, surviving cells were collected and replated. Upon outgrowth, a portion of the cells was collected for sequencing and the remaining library was re-infected with Yam/88. This process was repeated for three rounds of infection until the population became completely resistant to Yam/88 infection. sgRNA libraries were then prepared for sequencing from the genomic DNA isolated from each round of infection and the libraries were sequenced (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: A genome-wide CRISPR activation screen identifies restriction factors for influenza B virus.a Schematic of the CRISPR activation screening approach used. sgRNA = single guide RNA. b sgRNA read counts detected for each round of infection by B/Yamagata/16/1988 (Yam/88) during the screen.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe reasoned that repeated infection would allow enriched genes to compete internally and ultimately the population would be bottlenecked to consist of a small number of genes with the strongest antiviral activity. As expected, the number of detected sgRNAs decreased over each round of infection, and the unique read counts of a select few sgRNAs became increasingly prominent in the population (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Dataset 1). Bioinformatic analysis using the MAGeCK pipeline38 revealed that NXPE4, B3GAT1, B4GALNT2, TGM2, ANXA11, and GPHA2 were the six genes most highly ranked in our output population (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Dataset 2). Some, but not all other known restriction factors were also enriched in our screen (e.g., IFITM2, rank #27) indicating that no conclusions as to the biological activity of a host factor should be drawn based on its “absence” amongst our top hits. To perform validation of our most promising screen hits, we individually cloned the highest enriched sgRNA for the top six hits and transduced A549 dCas9-VP64 cells. Upregulation of gene expression upon sgRNA transduction was variable, ranging from no effect to more than 1000-fold induction (Fig. 1d). We then infected these sgRNA-activated cells with a Yam/88 PB1-mNeon reporter virus39 and quantified cells infected via flow cytometry. As expected from our previous study12, upregulation of B4GALNT2 blocked Yam/88 infection, but in addition, B3GAT1 and NXPE4 also significantly restricted viral infection (Fig. 1e). Since B3GAT1 had not been previously described as a viral restriction factor but had strong restriction activity, we selected B3GAT1 for further characterization.B3GAT1 outcompetes sialyltransferases to prevent cell surface sialic acid expressionWe were interested in determining the mechanism for B3GAT1-mediated IBV restriction. To facilitate these studies, and to rule out any potential off-target effects of CRISPR activation, we cloned the B3GAT1 ORF and generated a stable overexpression A549 cell line (with a corresponding mCherry-expressing line as a control). B3GAT1 overexpression was confirmed via RNA and protein analysis (Fig. 2a, b). We then infected the lines with Yam/88 PB1-mNeon and observed suppression of viral infection in B3GAT1 A549 cells, as expected (Fig. 2c). B3GAT1 is a glycosyltransferase previously reported to mediate the addition of a glucuronic acid (GlcA) during the biosynthesis of human natural killer 1 (HNK-1) glycans in the secretory pathway40 and indeed, we observed a Golgi localization consistent of the protein with that activity (Fig. 2d). To investigate specifically how B3GAT1 activity would alter surface glycan species when ectopically overexpressed, we released total N-linked glycans from mCherry and B3GAT1 A549 cells and subjected them to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. We found that while diverse glycans containing sialic acid were abundant in the mCherry A549 cells, many of these species were either not detected or minimally present in B3GAT1 A549 cells (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Dataset 3). Additionally, B3GAT1 A549 cells uniquely contained a variety of glucuronidated (GlcA-containing) glycans, while none of these GlcA-containing glycans were detected in the mCherry A549 sample (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Dataset 3). This trend was also observable on the monosaccharide level as resolved via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); B3GAT1 A549 cells contained relatively less Neu5Ac and more GlcA compared to mCherry A549 cells (Supplementary Fig 1).Fig. 2: B3GAT1 outcompetes sialyltransferases to prevent cell surface sialic acid expression.a qRT-PCR to measure B3GAT1 expression in mCherry control and B3GAT1 transduced A549 cells (mean with SEM, N = 4 experiments, *p = 0.0286). b Western blot of B3GAT1 protein levels in control or B3GAT1 A549s.

All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. * indicates p < 0.05. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThese data suggested that inhibition of Yam/88 infection was likely due to the replacement of the sialic acid viral receptor with GlcA. We decided to test this hypothesis with fluorescently labeled lectins specific for different terminal sugars. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) broadly binds sialic acids and indeed, staining was reduced in B3GAT1 overexpression cells (Fig. 2g). Since different sialic acid linkages (α2,3 vs α2,6) can both serve as receptors for influenza viruses41,42, we stained with Maackia amurensis lectin I (MAL I) and Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) to show that B3GAT1 expression reduced both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acid expression on the surface of cells, respectively (Fig. 2g). Conversely, an antibody that can recognize a terminal GlcA sugar as part of the HNK-1 epitope failed to stain wild-type A549 cells but did so in the context of B3GAT1 overexpression (Fig. 2g). Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL), which detects the mannose sugars in the glycan, stained both cell lines, as expected (Fig. 2g). Finally, to resolve any potential nonuniform effects of B3GAT1 activity on the small amount of remaining α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids, we subjected per-O-methylated, sialylated, N-linked glycans released from mCherry and B3GAT1 A549 cells to tandem mass spectrometry43. These data indicated a slightly higher proportion of α2,6-linked sialic acid in the remaining sialic acid fraction on B3GAT1 A549 cells compared to mCherry A549 cells (Supplementary Fig 2), suggesting B3GAT1 may differentially affect sialic-acid containing glycans. Taken together, however, the data indicate that sialic acids, irrespective of linkages, are broadly reduced in B3GAT1-overexpressing A549 cells (Fig. 2e, f, g, Supplementary Fig 1), likely due to B3GAT1 outcompeting sialyltransferases for immature glycan substrates. This may be partially explained by the apparent localization of overexpressed B3GAT1 throughout Golgi compartments (Fig. 2d), while sialylation of N-linked glycans is generally thought to be a late glycosylation event completed by sialyltransferases localized to the trans Golgi and even to post-Golgi compartments44,45.Upon observing that B3GAT1 expression reduces surface sialic acid expression, we hypothesized that the binding of influenza virions to host cells would be impaired and that lack of receptor binding was ultimately responsible for the inhibition of infection. To directly test this, we fluorescently labeled Yam/88 virions then incubated the fluorescent virus with either B3GAT1 or mCherry A549 cells and quantified virus binding to the cell surface via flow cytometry; overexpression of B3GAT1 indeed reduced the ability of Yam/88 to bind to cells (Fig. 2h,i). From these data, we propose a model in which B3GAT1 uniquely outcompetes host sialyltransferases to prevent cell surface expression of sialic acid, which precludes IBV binding and subsequent cell entry (Fig. 2j).B3GAT1 broadly restricts viruses that require sialic acid for cell entrySialic acid is required for entry into the host cell by many viruses33, including the vast majority of influenza viruses. We, therefore, hypothesized that B3GAT1 would restrict any viruses that require sialic acid for entry. To test this, we assembled a panel of diverse influenza viruses representing Yamagata/Victoria-lineage IBVs and H1N1/H3N2 subtype IAVs isolated from 1933 to 2019. We first performed an experiment to understand the range of sialic acids that the selected viruses utilized as receptors. To do this, we treated A549 cells with an α2,3-specific sialidase and then infected with each virus individually. As expected, we observed highly differential abilities of the viruses to cause infection after removal of α2,3-linked sialic acids. (Supplementary Fig 3). We interpreted these data to mean that the affected viruses were mostly dependent on α2,3-linked sialic acids for entry, and those that were largely unaffected were predominantly using α2,6-linked sialic acids (or other glycans) for entry.We next performed single-cycle infections with each virus in the panel in both mCherry and B3GAT1 A549 cells. Strikingly, B3GAT1 overexpression significantly reduced infection by all tested influenza viruses (Fig. 3a, b). We then selected two viruses from the panel, a contemporary IBV and a lab strain of IAV, and performed multi-cycle growth curves in MDCK cells overexpressing human B3GAT1 (Supplementary Fig 4). We observed delayed replication kinetics and reduced endpoint titers for both viruses in B3GAT1-expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 3c, d). To confirm that our findings would translate beyond cancerous cell culture lines, we overexpressed B3GAT1 in NL20 cells, which are non-tumor human lung cells, and again observed suppression of infection with IBV (Supplementary Fig 4). Finally, we sought to determine if B3GAT1-mediated viral restriction could be overwhelmed. To test this, we infected cells across a range of multiplicities of infection (MOIs) and found that while higher MOIs resulted in more total B3GAT1 cells infected, B3GAT1 still restricted infection with respect to control at all MOIs tested (Supplementary Fig. 5).Fig. 3: B3GAT1 broadly restricts viruses that require sialic acid for cell entry.a Single cycle infections (24 HPI) of control and B3GAT1 A549s with a panel of influenza viruses (mean with SEM, N = 4 experiments, *p = 0.0286 for all virus strains).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageA respiratory virus unrelated to the influenza viruses that also requires sialic acid for attachment and/or entry is enterovirus D68 (EV-D68)46. EV-D68 circulates primarily in children causing mild to severe respiratory disease and, in some cases, acute flaccid myelitis47. As there are no currently available vaccines or antivirals for EV-D68, we tested if EV-D68 would be susceptible to B3GAT1 overexpression. Upon infection of B3GAT1 A549 cells with two clinical isolates of EV-D68, we observed a significant reduction in infection as measured by positive double-stranded RNA staining (Fig. 3e, f). In contrast, infection with a different enterovirus, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which utilizes the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor protein for entry48, was unaffected (Fig. 3e, f). Further, EV-D68 infection of B3GAT1-expressing cells resulted in a ~100-fold reduction in viral infection as determined by TCID50 (Fig. 3g). Finally, to verify that EV-D68 infection was blocked at the binding and entry stage, we transfected genomic RNA and did not detect an observable difference in levels of viral replication in mCherry- and B3GAT1-overexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).B3GAT1 can be safely expressed in vivo to protect against lethal influenza virus infectionSince B3GAT1 overexpression induced strong and broad protection from viral infection, we next wanted to evaluate the potential of B3GAT1 expression as an antiviral strategy. We, therefore, expanded our analysis to primary, differentiated respiratory epithelial cells by generating air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures from murine tracheas (Fig. 4a). Staining for ciliated cells confirmed that the ALI cultures were differentiated at the time of transduction (Supplementary Fig 7). Utilizing serotype 6 adeno-associated viral (AAV6) gene transfer vectors, we then delivered human B3GAT1 to the ALI cultures and observed an ~10,000 fold increase in B3GAT1 RNA compared to GFP-transduced ALI cultures (Fig. 4a, b). B3GAT1 overexpression in these AAV-transduced ALI cultures reduced the infection and productive titer of both the IBV strain B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (Mal/04) (Fig. 4c–e) and the IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) (Fig. 4f–h).Fig. 4: B3GAT1 can be safely expressed in vivo to protect against lethal influenza virus infection.a Schematic depicting the generation and transduction of murine tracheal epithelial cell cultures at air–liquid interface (ALI).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAs B3GAT1 overexpression had provided protection in all tested cell culturing systems, we next wanted to determine if we could utilize this strategy to protect from influenza disease progression in vivo. AAV6 vectors were used to deliver human B3GAT1 (which is highly conserved between humans and mice) or GFP to female C57BL/6J mice via intranasal inoculation (Fig. 4i). Delivery of transgenes to the respiratory epithelium using this method was confirmed via qRT-PCR for B3GAT1 mRNA in mouse lung homogenates and microscopy of lung sections (Fig. 4j, Supplementary Fig 8) and mice transduced with B3GAT1 did not exhibit any detectable clinical symptoms, suggesting that transient upregulation of B3GAT1 is well-tolerated in vivo (Fig. 4k). As a first test of the potential of B3GAT1 expression as an antiviral strategy in vivo, we infected mice with Mal/04 (a mouse-adapted IBV) and found that exogenous B3GAT1 expression in the respiratory tract greatly improved infection outcome (Fig. 4l). We next wanted to test a broader range of B3GAT1 antiviral activity; we therefore infected with a highly mouse-adapted H1N1 IAV (PR8) and A/Hawaii/70/2019 (HI/2019), a contemporary non-mouse adapted pandemic-like H1N1 IAV. We found that while both viruses caused severe, lethal disease in our GFP-transduced control mice, mice transduced with B3GAT1 displayed only minimal bodyweight loss after infection and 100% of the animals survived the challenge (Fig. 4m, n). Finally, quantifying lung viral titers after PR8 infection also showed a small reduction in titer in B3GAT1-transduced mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). These data together provide proof-of-concept that B3GAT1 upregulation has practical utility not only in vitro, but as an in vivo antiviral strategy as well.DiscussionIn this work, we describe a genome-wide CRISPR activation screen with an IBV and identify B3GAT1 as a potent restriction factor. Mechanistic studies determined that overexpression of B3GAT1 limits the amount of sialic acid available on the surface of cells by adding terminal GlcA moieties, thereby restricting IBV entry. We further show that B3GAT1-mediated sialic acid replacement broadly restricts viruses that require sialic acid for entry, including IAVs, IBVs, and EV-D68. Expression of B3GAT1 in primary respiratory epithelial cultures as well as in mice effectively restricted influenza disease, demonstrating that the B3GAT1 phenotype is not limited to cell culture systems. Inducing the expression of B3GAT1 may therefore represent an attractive candidate for the development of broadly acting host-directed antiviral therapeutics.In previous work, host-directed antiviral prophylactics and therapeutics have relied on small-molecule inhibitors or treatment with recombinant proteins to non-specifically activate the immune system9. This report demonstrates that the transient overexpression of a delivered host factor is capable of functioning as a broad-spectrum, prophylactic, antiviral strategy in vivo. Despite this advancement, numerous challenges to translate this observation into clinical use remain. Perhaps the most obvious is the mechanism of B3GAT1 induction. While we have utilized AAV vectors to deliver B3GAT1, this approach is tailored more appropriately to gene therapy applications and their clinical use for the prevention and treatment of an acute infectious disease is unlikely. This is in no small part due to the length of time required for maximal expression of the transgene and the potential immune responses against the vector itself49,50,51,52. To overcome this limitation, emerging state-of-the-art genetic technologies such as mRNA-based gene delivery and CRISPR-mediated gene upregulation may provide a practical path forward53,54,55,56.Irrespective of the gene delivery or modulation approaches, the parameters of in vivo gene expression must also be more completely defined. For example, future studies will be needed to determine the minimal proportion of cells in the respiratory tract that need to express B3GAT1 to confer protection against viral infection. Additionally, the magnitude of B3GAT1 upregulation and the time required for the targeted cells to be sufficiently depleted of sialic acid in vivo also remain unknown. It is also important to note that the targeted induction of a specific host factor like B3GAT1 is not mutually exclusive with other proposed antiviral strategies. Perhaps the most relevant to the current study is DAS181, a bacterial sialidase in clinical trials that specifically cleaves sialic acid in the respiratory tract to treat influenza virus infection57. We anticipate that DAS181 treatment could be especially effective in combination with B3GAT1 and potentially speed up the time necessary for turnover of surface sialylated glycans after initiation of B3GAT1 overexpression. Another example is the mRNA delivery of Cas13a-based therapeutics to target the viral genome directly53,58, which could be multiplexed with host gene modulation approaches. Even further, targeting multiple host restriction or dependency factors simultaneously may allow for more complete protection from infection.Another important consideration of this and other potential host-directed therapeutic strategies is the likelihood of toxicity in the host. While we did not observe any obvious morbidities resulting from B3GAT1 overexpression in mice during our treatment period, it remains unknown if B3GAT1 overexpression or the resulting depletion in sialic acid has any effect on lung function. Indeed, sialic acid is hypothesized to promote lung hydration and epithelial barrier integrity by generating an anionic shield in the respiratory epithelium59 and can even serve an antiviral role when added to secreted mucins60. Further, in basal conditions, B3GAT1 is exclusively expressed in subsets of cells in the nervous system and in mature natural killer cells61,62. Since B3GAT1 is not normally expressed in respiratory tissues, the effects of GlcA/HNK-1 glycan surface expression in the lungs remain to be determined. Finally, the overexpression of B3GAT1 may have different effects in mice compared to other mammalian systems. Thus, future studies to evaluate the effects of B3GAT1 overexpression on global lung physiology and/or the immune system in multiple pre-clinical models are important next steps.In summary, we identified B3GAT1 as a broadly acting viral restriction factor amenable to targeted host-directed antiviral strategies. Our data show that infection with IBVs and IAVs is significantly hindered by B3GAT1 both in vitro and in vivo, and that viral restriction occurred irrespective of when the virus was isolated or the specifics of its receptor preferences. Further, our experiments with EV-D68 suggest that the entry of many, if not all, viruses that require sialic acid for entry would also be inhibited. Other viruses not specifically tested in this study but which we predict could be susceptible to B3GAT1 activity include important human pathogens such as the human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU-163, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 364,65 and Mumps virus66. While much work remains before the clinical use of host-directed antiviral therapies, these data suggest that continued research in this area may eventually lead to novel and potentially truly broad-spectrum antivirals.MethodsEthics statementAll procedures involving laboratory mice were approved by the Duke University IACUC under the protocol numbers A189-18-08 and A142-21-07. Mice were housed with up to five mice per cage and the ambient room conditions ranged from 70–74 °F and 30–70% humidity with a 12-hour dark/light cycle. Animals were assessed daily after infection and a 75% starting bodyweight cutoff was used as a humane endpoint. Primary euthanasia was typically performed via CO2 asphyxiation, followed by bilateral thoracotemy as the secondary method.VirusesInfluenza virus strains were obtained from BEI Resources, the International Reagent Resource, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), or were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Palese. For A/Philippines/2/1982, a reassortment virus with HA/NA segments from A/Philippines/2/1982 and the 6 internal segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was used. B/Yamagata/16/1988 PB1-mNeon was generated as described previously39,67. Influenza virus was propagated either on MDCK cells or in embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C (IAV) or 33 °C (IBV) for 48–72 h. To verify each strain, viral RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596026) and ~1 kb of segments 4, 6, and either 3 or 5 were amplified using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen 12574-035) and sequenced. Reference sequences were unable to be located for A/Scotland/840/1974. For A/Scotland/840/1974, BLAST analysis identified the closest matching reference sequences to be A/Albany/20/1974 for segment 4 (CY021093.1), segment 5 (CY021096.1), and segment 6 (CY021095.1). In addition to influenza virus, experiments were performed with coxsackievirus B3-RD (CVB3) and two enterovirus D68 isolates (USA/MD/2009-23229 and USA/CO/2018-23087). CVB3 was provided by Jeffrey Bergelson and originally obtained by the ATCC. Enterovirus D68 isolates were provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These viral strains were propagated in HeLa cells and purified by ultracentrifugation over a 30% sucrose cushion, as described previously68. Purity of viral stocks was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of VP1 using enterovirus-specific primers, as described previously69.PlasmidsTo generate a CRISPR activation cell line, lenti dCAS9-VP64_Blast (Addgene 61425) was used to package dCas9-VP64 for lentiviral overexpression. For hit validation, individual sgRNAs for B4GALNT2 (CAGGTGCAGGACGCTTGGGA), B3GAT1 (GGACCCGAGCTGCTAATGGT), NXPE4 (TTATTAGCTCAAGCAGAGGT), TGM2 (CCCAGGGGACCGGAGCCCGA), ANXA11 (GAGCAGCAGCCTTCCGGCTG), GPHA2 (AAGAGCAAGATCCCCCAGGT), or a non-targeting sgRNA (AAAACAGGACGATGTGCGGC) were cloned into the pXPR_502 vector (Addgene 96923). To generate cell lines that ectopically overexpress B3GAT1, B3GAT1 full-length ORF cDNA was obtained from transOMIC (transOMIC DQ893324) and cloned into the pLEX vector for lentiviral overexpression. The AAV packaging plasmids pTRs-eGFP, pXX6-80, and pXR6 were kind gifts from Dr. Aravind Asokan. To generate AAVs for B3GAT1 overexpression, the human B3GAT1 ORF was cloned into the pTRs AAV genomic plasmid.Cell linesA549, HEK 293T, MDCK, and NL20 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. A549 and HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 5–10% FBS, GlutaMAX, and penicillin/streptomycin. MDCK cells were grown in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) with 5% FBS, GlutaMAX, sodium bicarbonate, HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin. A549, HEK 293T, and MDCK media were supplemented with 2.5 µg/mL Plasmocin. NL20 cells were grown in Ham’s F-12 medium with 4% FBS, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2.7 g/L glucose, MEM nonessential amino acids, 0.005 mg/mL insulin, 10 ng/mL EGF, 0.001 mg/mL transferrin, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, and penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells (clone 7B, derived from parental line HeLa S3, ATCC) were provided by Jeffrey Bergelson, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, and cultured in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS, non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin. Lentiviruses were packaged as described previously12 and cell lines were transduced in complete media containing 0.001% DEAE dextran. Post-transduction, cells were selected for in puromycin (A549s = 1 µg/mL, MDCKs = 5 µg/mL, NL20s = 0.3–0.5 µg/mL) or blasticidin (A549s = 1.6 µg/mL).Murine tracheal epithelial cell cultures at air–liquid interface (ALI)Tracheas were collected from female wild-type C57BL/6J mice and tracheal epithelial cells were harvested, then differentiated following a previously published protocol70 with slight modifications. Briefly, tracheas were digested in pronase (Roche) and washed to collect epithelial cells. Washes were passed through a 70 µm strainer and the collected cells were treated with DNase I (Sigma). Fibroblasts were eliminated by incubating cells in mTEC basic media with 10% FBS on Primaria plates (Corning) for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were collected and seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2 onto transwell inserts (Corning 3470) pre-coated with rat tail collagen I (Corning). Cells were grown in mTEC/Plus media freshly supplemented with 50 nM retinoic acid (Sigma R2625) and 10 µM Y-27632 (Tocris 1254) for 3 days. To differentiate cultures, media was removed from the apical chamber to establish an air–liquid interface, and media in the basal chamber was replaced with mTEC/SF supplemented with 50 nM retinoic acid. Cultures were differentiated for at least 2 weeks before use in experiments. To make mTEC basic medium, a 1:1 vol/vol mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F-12 was prepared and supplemented with 15 mM HEPES, 4 mM GlutaMAX, 3.6 mM sodium bicarbonate, and penicillin/streptomycin. mTEC/Plus and mTEC/SF were prepared from mTEC basic media as previously described70. For all ALI experiments, n refers to cultures independently generated from genetically distinct mice.CRISPR activation screenCells transduced with dCas9-VP64 (A549-dCas9 VP64) were selected and isolated to generate a stable clonal cell line. Two replicates each containing 5 × 107 A549-dCas9 VP64 cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding the Calabrese sgRNA library set A (Addgene 92379) at an MOI of 0.5. After transduction, cells were expanded and selected with puromycin and blasticidin for 5 days. Half the library was then collected for each replicate, cells were lysed with DNA/RNA shield (Zymo R1100) and lysates were stored at −80 °C. The remaining ~1 × 108 cells per replicate were infected with B/Yamagata/16/1988 at an MOI of 5 and incubated for 24 h in post-infection media (OptiMEM, 0.4% BSA, 0.01% FBS) supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin (Thermo 20233) at a concentration of 0.2 µg/mL to facilitate multi-cycle infection. Media was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, GlutaMAX, and penicillin/streptomycin and cells were incubated at 33 °C for 48 h to allow sufficient cytopathic effect from infection. Cells were then trypsinized, replated to remove dead cells, and allowed to outgrow at 33 °C. Upon outgrowth (~1 × 108 cellseplicate), half of the cells were pelleted and lysed for gDNA collection with DNA/RNA shield and the remaining cells (~5 × 107 cellseplicate) were infected again with B/Yamagata/16/1988 at an MOI of 5. This process of outgrowth, gDNA collection, and re-infection was repeated an additional time for three total rounds of infection until both replicate populations did not exhibit obvious cytopathic effects following infection. Genomic DNA was then isolated using QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (QIAGEN 51194). 18.5 µg of genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR using Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara RR001). PCR products were resolved using electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel and extracted using the GeneJet gel extraction kit (Thermo K0692). Library quality was assessed and PCR products were quantified on a bioanalyzer using the Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent 5067-1504). Libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. After sequencing, fastq files were extracted, raw reads were mapped and normalized, and genes were ranked using the MAGeCK pipeline38. Raw sequencing data from the screen will be made available upon publication.Influenza virus infectionsFor IAV and IBV infections in A549, MDCK, and NL20 cell lines, samples were incubated with virus diluted in PBS/BSA infection media (PBS, 0.4% BSA, Mg2+/Ca2+, penicillin/streptomycin) for 30 min (NL20) or 1 h (A549, MDCK) at 37 °C (IAV) or 33 °C (IBV) unless otherwise noted. Virus was then removed and replaced with either complete growth media (single cycle) or post-infection media (OptiMEM, 0.35% BSA, 0.01% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin (Thermo 20233) at a concentration of 0.2 µg/mL (A549s) or 1 µg/mL (MDCKs) (multicycle). For single-cycle infections using the multi-strain influenza virus panel, the IAVs A/WSN/1933 and A/Scotland/840/1974 were incubated at 33 °C to facilitate high-throughput reading of the panel plates. To evaluate sialic acid receptor preference, wild-type A549s were treated with 50 mU/mL sialidase S (Agilent GK80021) or no sialidase in A549 growth medium for 2.5 h at 37 °C, then washed twice with PBS to remove all sialidase S enzyme prior to infection. For infection of murine tracheal epithelial ALI cultures, membranes were washed with PBS to clear away mucus, then apically infected with virus diluted in PBS/BSA for 1 h at 37 °C (IAV) or 33 °C (IBV). Cells were washed basally and apically with PBS three times to clear the unbound virus. Fresh mTEC/SF was added to the basal chamber, and cultures were returned to incubate at air–liquid interface overnight. To determine viral titer from ALI cultures, apically released virus was collected at the indicated time points by incubating in 200 µL PBS for 1 h at 37 °C or 33 °C for analysis via plaque assay.Enterovirus infectionsB3GAT1 and mCherry A549 cells were seeded on poly-lysine treated eight-well chamber slides (Sigma S6815) for confocal microscopy or 24 well plates for high-content image quantification. The following day, cells were infected with the indicated viruses, incubated at 33 °C (EV-D68) or 37 °C (CVB-3) for 24 h, then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. For TCID50 assays, B3GAT1 and mCherry A549 cells seeded in 96-well plates were infected with serial dilutions of the indicated viral stocks, with the 10−2 dilution equivalent to ~106 PFUs. Cells were infected at 33 °C (EV-D68) or 37 °C (CVB3) for 48 h and then stained with crystal violet. For viral RNA transfections, viral RNA was isolated from infected HeLa cells 12 h following infection with the indicated virus. Cells were lysed and total RNA was prepared using the Sigma GenElute total mammalian RNA miniprep kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. B3GAT1 or mCherry A549 cells were reverse transfected with 1 μg of viral RNA using Dharmafect-1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Flow cytometryAll cells were resuspended in PBS+ 1% BSA prior to analysis. Infected NL20 cells and cells incubated with fluorescent infectious virus were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for at least 10 min at room temperature prior to flow analysis. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD Biosciences FACS Canto II Flow Cytometry System and BD FACSDiva software. When necessary, compensation was calculated and applied to eliminate signal bleed-through. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Gating strategies for quantification of flow cytometry experiments in Figs. 1e, 2c, i, and Supplementary Fig 4c are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig 9.Immunofluorescence microscopyTo visualize B3GAT1 subcellular localization, indicated cell lines were labeled with CellLight Golgi GFP BacMam 2.0 reagent (Fisher C10592). 48 h after plating, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Saponin in PBS for 15 min at room temperature then blocked in PBS + 5% BSA + 0.1% Saponin + 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were stained overnight with anti-B3GAT1 primary antibody (Sigma HPA069468, 1:100) in PBS + 0.5% BSA + 0.1% Saponin + 0.1% Tween-20. Samples were then stained with Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) in PBS + 0.5% BSA + 0.1% Saponin + 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed to remove secondary antibody, then incubated with Hoechst 33342 to stain nuclei. Slides were mounted using Prolong Diamond antifade mountant and imaged on a Zeiss 780 Upright Confocal microscope. For cells infected with influenza virus that were read via high-content imaging, fixed cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.1% PBS-Triton) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells infected with the IAV/IBV panel were stained with CR9114 anti-HA antibody (Creative Biolabs, PABX-119, 1 µg/mL) overnight at 4 °C followed by anti-human Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1% PBS-Triton + 0.5% BSA. For the overwhelming B3GAT1 experiment, cells infected with B/Yamagata/16/1988 were stained with CR9114 as above. Cells infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 were stained with sera collected from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934-infected mice (1:500) followed by anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1% PBS-Triton +0.5% BSA. Nuclei were stained for 20 min using Hoescht 33342 (1:2500) diluted in PBS, and cells were imaged on the CX5-Cell Insight plate reader. Murine ALI cultures were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, after which membranes were extracted from transwells, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (0.2% PBS-Triton) for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Cells were stained for AcTub (clone EPR16772, Abcam ab179484, 1:1000), ZO-1 (Invitrogen 61-7300, 1:25), and for viral protein using sera collected from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 or B/Malaysia/2506/2004 infected mice (1:250). Membranes were washed with 0.2% PBS-Triton, then stained with Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies (1:1000) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing again with 0.2% PBS-Triton, nuclei were stained with 1:2000 Hoechst 33342 dye for 20 min at room temperature. Membranes were mounted on slides with Prolong Diamond antifade mountant and pressed with small magnets for at least 16 h prior to imaging on a Zeiss 780 Upright Confocal microscope. For enterovirus infections, cells were fixed in 4% PFA, then incubated in 0.25% Triton X-100 to permeabilize cell membranes for a minimum of 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (at a 1:200–1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing three times in PBS. A recombinant α-dsRNA antibody ( J2, provided by Abraham Brass, University of Massachusetts, Kerafast ES2001)71 was used to visualize viral RNA (1:100). To visualize the enterovirus VP1 protein, a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for EV-D68 (Genetex GTX132313) was used (1:1000). Cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies. Samples on slides for confocal microscopy were washed, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and imaged on a Zeiss 780 Upright Confocal microscope. For quantification of enterovirus infection, stained samples on 24 well plates were incubated with DAPI solution to stain nuclei and cells were imaged on the CX5-Cell Insight plate reader.Image quantificationFor high-content imaging on the CX5 CellInsight, 27 unbiased images were captured across 3 wells for each condition and percent infection was averaged. For imaging ALI membranes, 3 images were captured for each membrane. Total fluorescent infected area was determined in FIJI by setting thresholds and using the analyze particles function. The three quantified images were then averaged for the relevant conditions to determine percent infected area for each independently generated ALI culture.Fluorescent staining of cell surface glycansIndicated cell lines were seeded on glass coverslips coated with poly-lysine solution and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Samples were stained with 20 µg/mL WGA (Vector Laboratories, FL-1021-5), MAL I (Vector Laboratories, FL-1311), SNA (Vector Laboratories, FL-1301), or GNL (Vector Laboratories, FL-1241) fluorescent lectins in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For staining of HNK-1/GlcA, cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS + 5% BSA, then incubated with anti-HNK-1 primary antibody (Sigma C6680, 1:250) overnight at 4 °C in PBS + 0.5% BSA. Cells were washed and incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. All samples were washed and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo H3570) to visualize nuclei, then mounted using Prolong Diamond Antifade (Thermo P36965).Hemagglutination and plaque assaysFor hemagglutination assays, serial 1:2 dilutions of virus were prepared in cold PBS in a V-bottom 96-well plate. An equivalent volume of 1:40 diluted chicken or turkey blood was added to the diluted virus, and plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight before analysis. Results are expressed in HA units, defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which hemagglutination occurs. If there was no apparent hemagglutination, samples were assigned a value of 0.5 HAU. For plaque assays, confluent MDCK cells were infected with tenfold virus dilutions in a six-well plate at 37 °C (IAVs) or 33 °C (IBVs) for 1 h. Virus was then removed and an agar overlay (MEM, GlutaMAX, sodium bicarbonate, HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin, BSA, DEAE dextran, 0.5% Oxoid agar (Thermo LP0028)) with 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Thermo 20233) was poured over cells before returning plates to the incubator. When plaques were visible (48–72 h post infection), cells were fixed by applying 4% formaldehyde in PBS to the top of the agar overlay for at least 3 h at room temperature. The agar overlay was removed, and cells were stained with 1:2000 primary antibody either overnight at 4 °C or for 2–3 h at room temperature. A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was stained using sera from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 infected mice, while B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 were stained using sera from B/Malaysia/2506/2004 infected mice. Cells were then incubated with secondary anti-mouse HRP (VWR NXA931V, 1:4000) for at least 1 h at room temperature, and stained plaques were visualized with KPL TrueBlue substrate. Antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20.Viral binding assayApproximately 80 mL of B/Yamagata/16/1988 virus in egg allantoic fluid was fluorescently labeled with 80 µL of VybrantTM DiO Cell-Labeling Solution (ThermoFisher, V22886) for at least 1 h at room temperature. Virus was then concentrated using ultracentrifugation with a 30% sucrose cushion for 1 h at 110,405 xg on the Sorvall TH-641 swinging bucket rotor to remove residual DiO labeling reagent. Viral pellets were resuspended in 1 mL PBS and saved at 4 °C until use. Indicated cell lines were trypsinized, neutralized with DMEM + 5% FBS to create a cell suspension, and divided into at least two technical replicates for each experiment. Cells were then washed once with PBS + 1% BSA and incubated with fluorescent B/Yamagata/16/1988 virus in PBS/BSA infection media for 1 h on ice. Following incubation, cells were pelleted, viral inoculum was decanted, and cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS + 1 % BSA and analyzed via flow cytometry.qRT-PCRRNA was extracted from cultured cells using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (NEB T2010). For RNA prepared from mouse lung homogenate, whole mouse lungs were collected and homogenized in PBS. Total lung RNA was then extracted from 100 uL of homogenate using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596026). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the EXPRESS One-Step Superscript qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen 11781200) on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System. mRNA was detected using commercial TaqMan probes for B3GAT1 (Hs01024500_m1), B4GALNT2 (Hs00963127_m1), NXPE4 (Hs00916016_m1), TGM2 (Hs01096680_m1), ANXA11, (Hs01012624_g1) or GPHA2 (Hs00369982_g1) and normalized to endogenous 18S RNA (Applied Biosystems 4318839).Western blottingIndicated cell lines were lysed by pelleting 3 × 106 cells, resuspending in 200 µL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. Supernatant was combined with Laemmli sample buffer and 5% 2-beta mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Lysate was then loaded onto a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Gel (Bio-Rad). After running samples, stain-free gels were imaged on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Imaging System, and protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (GE 10600002) for 60 min at 60 V. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (0.1% PBS-T) for 1–2 h at 4 °C, then incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-B3GAT1 antibody (Sigma AMAB91575, 1:1000) diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed with 0.1% PBS-T, incubated in goat anti-mouse HRP secondary (Invitrogen A16072, 1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again with 0.1% PBS-T. To develop blots, membranes were incubated in Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and exposed to film.Release of N-linked glycansApproximately 5 × 107 of both B3GAT1 and mCherry A549 cells were washed with PBS and collected via scaping, pelleted, and frozen. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and passed ten times through a 23-gauge syringe to homogenize. Cells were lysed by sonication for 2 min and 30 s at 15 s intervals, and lysate was heated at 95–100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then denatured by adding 10 µL denaturing buffer (NEB PNGaseF kit, P0709) and incubating at 50 °C for 30 min. To desalt, samples were added to 10 kDa cutoff spin filters pre-washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. After washing with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, samples were removed from the spin filters and resuspended in 500 µL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. To release N-linked glycans, samples were treated with PNGaseF (NEB, P0709) for 20 h at 37 °C. Released N-linked glycans were centrifuged in pre-washed 10 kDa cutoff spin filters, purified by passage through a C18 cartridge, and lyophilized prior to further analysis.MALDI-TOF analysis of N-linked glycansLyophilized samples were permethylated by reconstituting in DMSO and treating with methyl iodide on DMSO/NaOH mixture. After quenching the reaction with water, dichloromethane was used to extract the reaction mixture. Permethylated glycans were dried and reconstituted in 20 µL methanol, and 2 µL of reconstituted sample was combined with 2 µL DHB matrix. This mixture was spotted on a MALDI plate and analyzed on the AB Sciex TOF/TOF 5800 System Mass Spectrometer using a laser intensity of 6400, reflector mode, and positive ion mode. Mass spectra diagrams were generated using AB Sciex Data Explorer v4.5. Clusters of evenly spaced peaks differing by 32 Da were noted for all peaks corresponding to masses of glycans containing glucuronic acid. This Δ−32Da mass shift was assumed to be the loss of a methoxy group located on the 4th carbon of the per-O-methylated glucuronic acid, a reaction that is known to occur due to exposure of the uronic acid ethers to basic conditions72. In each cluster, the peaks spaced 32 Da apart from one another were considered to originate from the same glycan. MALDI-TOF glycan spectra were confirmed using MS/MS. Percent composition was determined by comparing the intensity peak for each glycan mass. For glycan masses containing glucuronic acid, relative compositions were determined assuming that (1) the Δ−32Da mass shifts correspond to the loss of a methoxy group and (2) the summation of each of the peaks in each cluster series can be taken to represent the theoretical intensity of the original peak without any degradation.Monosaccharide composition analysisMonosaccharide composition analysis was performed by combined GC-MS of the per-O-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glycosides produced from the sample by acidic methanolysis as described previously73. Briefly, released N-linked glycans were heated with methanolic HCl in a sealed screw-top glass test tube for 18 h at 80 °C. After cooling and removal of the solvent under a stream of nitrogen, the samples were re-N-acetylated at room temperature using methanol: pyridine: acetic anhydride (2:1:1) and dried again. The sample was then derivatized with Tri-Sil® (Pierce) at 80 °C for 20 min. GC/MS analysis of the TMS methyl glycosides was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC interfaced to a 5975 C MSD, using an Supelco Equity-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID). Inositol was added to the samples as an internal standard prior to data collection.Sialic acid linkage analysisTandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to characterize the sialic acid linkages of N-linked glycans, according to previously published protocols43. Briefly, lyophilized permethylated, sialylated, N-linked glycans were reconstituted in 200 µL of a 50:50 MeOH:H2O mixture with 1 mM Li2CO3 and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer using ion trap mode. Fragment ions diagnostic of specific linkages were annotated based on previously published methods43.Adeno-associated virus (AAV) productionProduction and purification of AAVs were adapted from refs. 74,75,76. Briefly, AAVs were produced by transfecting HEK 293 T cells with pXX6–80, pTRs-B3GAT1 or pTRs-eGFP, and pXR6 in a 2:1:1 ratio (by µg amount). Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 96 h to allow AAVs to assemble. To harvest AAVs, media was removed and cells were collected using a cell scraper. AAVs in the media were harvested via precipitation in 0.5 M NaCl/8% PEG-8000 at 4 °C overnight. Intracellular AAVs were extracted by thermal lysis of the harvested cells followed by chemical lysis using 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Cell lysates were clarified and passed through 0.22 µm filters. AAVs were purified by applying clarified cell lysates to heparin columns (Cytiva 17040701). Eluted AAVs were transferred to 100,000 MWCO dialysis tubing (Millipore Z726060) and dialyzed against pharmaceutical-grade PBS overnight at 4 °C. AAV stocks were concentrated using Amicon centrifugal concentration units (Millipore UFC901024). The titer of each AAV stock was determined via qPCR, as previously demonstrated77. Additionally, transduction efficiencies of each AAV stock were validated by transducing A549 cells followed by detection of either sialic acids via fluorescein-labeled WGA (Vector Laboratories FL-1021) or HNK-1 via immunostaining (Sigma C6680).AAV transductionsDifferentiated murine ALI cultures were washed with PBS to clear mucus, then simultaneously transduced on the apical and basal side with GFP AAV6 or B3GAT1 AAV6. Apical cells were incubated in 50 µL AAVs in mTEC basic (MOI = 100,000) for 8 h at 37 °C, while basal cells were incubated in 500 µL AAVs in mTEC/SF (MOI = 100,000) for 48 h at 37 °C. After 7 days, cells were transduced a second time following the same protocol. Experiments were performed 7–8 days after the second transduction. For AAV deliveries in vivo, 9–13-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with 80 µL of ketamine/xylazine mixture. GFP AAV6 and B3GAT1 AAV6 were diluted in pharmaceutical-grade PBS and delivered intranasally at a dose of 1011 viral genome equivalents/mouse. Mice were positioned upright with their mouths held closed to increase efficiency of the delivery78. Mice were transduced twice to maximize transgene expression79, with 7 days between deliveries, and all influenza virus infections occurred 14 days after the second transduction. Mice were monitored after transduction to assess the effects of B3GAT1 AAV6 and GFP AAV6 on animal health. To confirm transduction efficiency, mice 21 days post transduction were perfused intracardially with 12 mL of PBS and lungs were inflated intratracheally with 1 mL of a 1:1 mix of OCT compound and 8% formaldehyde in PBS. Inflated lungs were collected and fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. The following day, lungs were transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS and incubated at least 24 h at 4 °C before cryosectioning. 8 µm cryosections were taken, adhered to glass slides, dried, and outlined with a hydrophobic pen to facilitate staining. Re-hydrated sections were stained with Hoechst 33342 and mounted under a glass coverslip using Prolong Diamond Antifade mountant. Images were captured on a Zeiss 780 Upright Confocal microscope.Mouse infections with influenza virusAAV-transduced mice were anesthetized with 80 µL of ketamine/xylazine mixture prior to infection. B/Malaysia/2506/2004, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, and A/Hawaii/70/2019 were diluted in pharmaceutical grade PBS and administered intranasally in 40 µL total volume. After infection, bodyweights were obtained daily and mice were euthanized upon reaching the humane threshold as detailed in the ethics statement. Percent starting bodyweights were rounded to the nearest whole percent to determine if a mouse reached the humane threshold. For lung viral titering, whole mouse lungs were homogenized in PBS and lung titer was determined via plaque assay.Statistics and reproducibilityStatistical tests used to determine significance are indicated in the figure legends. For all null hypothesis testing with the Mann-Whitney U test, a confidence interval of 95% was used to assess significance. Values not detected due to technical limitations of an assay were excluded from subsequent statistical analyses. Error bars represent standard error of the mean for all graphs. Unless otherwise noted, a minimum of three technical replicates were conducted for each independently conducted experiment. Technical replicates were not conducted for experiments using genetically distinct mice or independently generated ALI cultures. Statistical analyses and graphs were generated using Prism 9 software. All experiments depicted by representative images were performed independently at least twice with similar results.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The study “Influenza vaccination coverage among an urban pediatric asthma population: Implications for population health,” published Oct. 21 in the open access journal PLOS ONE, found that less than one-third of children with asthma seen in pediatric emergency departments had received an influenza vaccine. Of those who were vaccinated, most vaccines were administered in a primary care setting and with no out-of-pocket costs. Children ages 5 to 11 years old had the lowest influenza vaccination rate. From left are Sarah Parker, M.P.H., and Julie Gleason-Comstock, Ph.D. Influenza vaccination status was associated with race (African American children less likely to be vaccinated than non-Hispanic white children) and insurance type (children with no insurance or public insurance less likely to be vaccinated than children with private insurance). The vaccination rate varied by census tract across Detroit. “Asthma is a common disease in children that places them at higher risk for complications from influenza, though little research has explored the vaccination rate in this population,” Parker said. Parker received her degree in 2021, the same year her presentation of the work won the Graduate Student Research Award at the 2021 23rd annual Michigan Family Medicine Research Day. The published study is the culmination of a completed Master of Public Health in Public Health Practice project, led by Department of Family Medicine and Public Health Sciences Assistant Professor of Population Health Sciences Julie Gleason-Comstock, Ph.D., who is a Public Health researcher and educator, and master certified public health education specialist. The article’s co-authors are Amy DeLaroche, M.B.B.S., and Rajan Arora, M.D., physicians in the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, at Children’s Hospital of Michigan; and Alex Hill, of the WSU Department of Urban Studies and Planning. “Our M.P.H. student and faculty advisor publishing their research together is a wonderful accomplishment,” said Jinping Xu, M.D., interim chair of the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health Sciences. “It is especially impactful when the research relates to an important public health topic, such as vaccination, right in our city.” Using geospatial analysis techniques, findings from this study highlighted Detroit census tracts with low vaccination coverage. “The research results suggest the role of education and advocacy for influenza vaccination needs to be further explored in areas where children may lack traditional health care access at primary care offices,” Dr. Gleason-Comstock said. “Public health professionals with this information can develop initiatives to improve vaccination rates in these higher-risk communities.” Subscribe to Today@Wayne Direct to your inbox each week Name Email Address Related articles Wayne State University plays pivotal role in Detroit achieving HEARTSafe Community designation from Citizen CPR Foundation November 8, 2024 NIH awards Wayne State Physiology researcher $1.68 million to study genetic mechanisms of exercise in fighting heart disease, cancer and more November 7, 2024 NIH funds project to investigate genetic variants related to racial differences in HER2+ breast cancer therapies November 6, 2024 Global Health Research Collaborative is recruiting Global Health volunteers November 1, 2024 facebook twitter instagram School of Medicine Scott Hall Public Affairs, Room 1320 540 E.

The new research, led by the U.S. Geological Survey, can help improve estimates of when and where the virus could spread in the environment and to other birds. There is a current outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in numerous wild and commercial bird species across North America. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is different than low pathogenic in that it can be fatal to poultry. The researchers did not know the bird—a lesser scaup in the Chesapeake Bay area of Maryland—was infected with avian influenza when they released it back into the wild. The bird did not show signs of infection during observation and was not originally captured for avian influenza research. A swab test taken as an adjunct to the main research came back more than a week later indicating that the bird was infected. Sources/Usage: Public Domain. View Media Details A male lesser scaup at the USGS Eastern Ecological Science Center in Maryland. This bird was not part of this new research. Photograph taken in 2017. Credit: Jeffrey Sullivan, USGS. The scientists found the movement patterns of the infected lesser scaup were noticeably different from noninfected birds, moving shorter distances in similar timeframes. Officials can use these findings as they develop disease mitigation strategies such as surveillance programs to track wild birds and the occurrence of avian influenza. The USGS worked with the University of Delaware, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, University of Georgia and Ducks Unlimited, leveraging their ongoing avian ecology research. In the current outbreak, which began in December 2021, wild birds across more than 40 states have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, with different species experiencing varying reactions from no symptoms to mortality. The outbreak is affecting domestic poultry as well, with confirmed cases in commercial and backyard flocks across 43 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While the current outbreak is ongoing and the economic and ecological effects are still unknown, an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry facilities from 2014 to 2015 resulted in the loss of 50 million chickens and turkeys and cost the economy approximately $879 million dollars, according to previous research. Although avian influenza viruses usually do not infect people, there have been some rare cases of human infection, including a single case in the U.S. linked to the current outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “This study provides insight on how movement patterns can change when a bird becomes infected, and that information is critical to understanding wild bird transmission of avian influenza,” said USGS research wildlife ecologist Diann Prosser, who is an author of this study. “Analysis of movement data showed that the infected bird’s maximum and average hourly movements were reduced when compared to noninfected birds.” USGS scientists also identified four instances when the infected bird had close contact with noninfected birds being tracked at the same time. This indicates that despite reduced movements, there were still opportunities for potential transmission either from bird to bird or potentially from the environment the bird used. “While there have been several lab studies, there is limited knowledge on how highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses affect birds in the wild since it is more difficult to gather data in natural environments,” said Prosser. "Even though the infected bird died three days after release with cause of mortality not confirmed, we were able to acquire real-world data and make direct comparisons to noninfected birds released the same day.” Transmission of avian influenza viruses commonly occur through direct interaction or fecal contaminated water. USGS research has shown that these viruses can remain infectious in settings such as wetlands for several months depending on environmental conditions. Sources/Usage: Public Domain.

Movement was recorded January 23 to 26, 2022. The black dot identifies where the birds were captured and released in Maryland. Scientists did not know the one bird was infected with avian influenza when it was released back into the wild. The infected bird in this newly published research was one of 25 lesser scaup being studied by the University of Delaware and Maryland Department of Natural Resources for a separate ecology project. The USGS asked that all the birds in that project be tested for avian influenza since they were already in the care of scientists. Only one bird tested positive for an active infection while the others tested negative. The collaboration was an opportunity to leverage resources and acquire more data for several research purposes. While large scale mortality events of lesser scaup have not been observed in the Chesapeake Bay region, a mortality event occurred in Florida early in the current outbreak. Lesser scaup are a type of diving duck and known carrier of avian influenza viruses, as supported by previous research co-authored by the USGS. The USGS has completed and is currently involved in several other research projects to better understand the spread of avian influenza. Learn more by visiting the USGS avian influenza website.

Here's whyOctober 24, 2022Gabrielle EmanuelfacebookEmailA bottle of influenza vaccine is seen in the MinuteClinic at the CVS/pharmacy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Flu season has officially begun. While there are warnings about COVID and influenza causing a “twindemic” (maybe even a "tripledemic" with the respiratory virus R.S.V.), or the occasional dual infection some have dubbed "flurona,"experts say nobody knows exactly what is in store.In Massachusetts, health officials have started publishing the weekly flu report. So far, they declare the severity “low.” Visits to doctors' offices for "flu-like illness" are higher now than at this point in the past three seasons, but they remain lower than what is typical for a non-flu season.Across the country, most states have reported increases in flu activity, with the highest levels in southern states.Despite the uncertainty about what lies ahead, here's a look at the best guesses for this flu season, why it’s so hard to predict the flu, and why some researchers are optimistic about new flu vaccines.What health experts expect this flu seasonExperts worry we're in for a worse-than-normal flu season. There are two main reasons for this concern.First, the past several flu seasons have been particularly mild. Without the immunity that comes from recent infections, “more people may be more susceptible than usual to the flu this year,” explained Larry Madoff, medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.Less immunity — and less mask-wearing — could be a recipe for a bad flu season.Second, experts often look at the Southern Hemisphere, which is just wrapping up its flu season, as an indicator of what might happen in the Northern Hemisphere. In Australia in particular, things didn’t go well.“They had a very bad flu season, a severe flu season with about three times their normal level of flu,” Madoff said. “So there's reason to think it could be a worse flu season than typical [here].”AdvertisementBrian Chow, an infectious diseases physician at Tufts Medical Center, has also been looking at the data from Australia. However, he finds reason for cautious optimism. “They got hit early and hard, and cases have dropped substantially, which is encouraging for the Northern Hemisphere,” he said.The one thing experts agree on: Nobody know what the flu season will look like until it happens.“We really can't predict it very well. Every flu season is different, and especially now [with COVID],” said Madoff. “All I can say is that we are seeing a lot of unusual patterns in respiratory illness these days.”Why flu is so hard to predictThere are a few reasons why the severity of flu season is challenging to forecast.The influenza virus is constantly evolving. That makes it difficult to know which strains will be circulating from year to year. Some strains are slightly more transmissible; others are slightly less so. “Those small changes can make a large difference in a large population,” said Chow.Dr. Jennifer Wang, a professor of infectious diseases at UMass Chan Medical School, said researchers think about how the virus is changing in terms of "drift" and "shift.""Drift" is when there are small, subtle changes in the genome of the virus. She said this can make for a mismatch between the vaccine and the virus that's circulating, which means many vaccinated people will not be as good at fighting if off."Shift" is when big chunks of the virus's genome change. "And that's when there's mixing with animals," Wang said, pointing to two well-known examples: swine flu and avian flu. In both cases, the magnitude of the change meant few people had encountered a similar virus before. “Then our immune systems are very unprepared,” Wang said.Another hard-to-predict factor in flu season is the weather. Changes in temperature and humidity impact how long the virus is able to survive outside the body.“We know the cold, dry weather promotes transmission of influenza and also pushes people indoors into crowded spaces,” Madoff said.Chow added that “global warming makes it even harder to predict” because weather patterns in both hemispheres are shifting and becoming more difficult to forecast.Finally, a big new unknown is how flu interacts with COVID.While each flu season may vary, the past two flu seasons have been particularly atypical. In 2020-21, there was almost no flu activity. In 2021-22, there was an early spike and a late spike, but a big drop in cases when flu usually peaks.Experts attribute some of this to pandemic precautions: good hand hygiene, people wearing masks and many people staying home and avoiding crowds. But Wang thinks something else was likely happening, too.She said there were a lot fewer co-infections — where a person has flu and COVID at the same time — than experts expected to see.“In the beginning of the pandemic,” Wang said, “I remember thinking, ‘We're going to see a lot of dual infections.’ We didn't see that. In fact, COVID took over. And this happened again last winter.” As Omicron took off, infectious disease experts like Wang noticed flu infections plummeted.While it is possible to get both viruses at the same time — and studies suggest it may lead to more severe illness — it seems to be rare. Wang’s guess is that “it probably had to do with how our bodies respond to COVID infection. And that may be providing a hostile environment for the flu.”Other experts say it’s too early to be certain how the viruses interact, and that makes it even harder to predict what flu season will look like.Hope for the future?Wang is part of a team that’s working to create a new flu vaccine using mRNA, the building block for some of the COVID vaccines.“This may be a game changer for how we treat flu in the future,” she said.In standard flu vaccines, inactivated flu virus is injected into the body to trigger an immune response. The mRNA flu vaccine contains what are essentially cellular blueprints that spur the body to make flu proteins — or pieces of them — and then the immune system kicks into gear.In most years, the standard flu vaccine is around 40% effective in preventing infection, and at its best, it’s been 60% effective, said Wang. She’s leading the Massachusetts site testing the new mRNA flu vaccine — which is produced by Pfizer — against the standard flu vaccine.She's hopeful the mRNA flu vaccine will be more effective. And, she said, an mRNA vaccine is well-suited to a situation where there’s a mismatch between the vaccine and the strains of flu going around because it can be updated swiftly.“These mRNA vaccines can be altered so quickly in the laboratory,” she said. “They can be adjusted as needed to match with what viruses are actually circulating in the population.”Wang is hopeful that results from the national flu vaccine trial will be available before next year’s flu season. As for this year, experts recommend getting the standard flu vaccine by the end of October.Related:How to time your flu shot for best protectionWhat the 1918 flu pandemic reveals about how pandemics endGabrielle Emanuel Senior Health and Science ReporterGabrielle Emanuel was a senior health and science reporter for WBUR.More…AdvertisementMore from WBURAdvertisementResumeListen LiveLoading...CloseWBUR | NPRContact Us(617) 353-0909info@wbur.org890 Commonwealth Ave.Boston, MA 02215More ways to get in touch.About WBURWho We AreInside WBURDiversity, Equity And InclusionBoard Of DirectorsCommunity Advisory BoardCPB TransparencyCareersWBUR StaffEthics GuideLicensing WBUR ContentSupport WBURVolunteerMember ServicesBecome A MemberDonate Your CarJoin The Murrow SocietyBecome A SponsorMake A DonationFollowfacebook Facebook Instagram YouTube Linkedin© Copyright WBUR 2024WBUR Privacy PolicySyndicationFCC ApplicationsFCC Public FileWBUR EEO ReportsPublic File AssistanceThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Coinfection by influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus produces hybrid virus particles | Nature Microbiology Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

To identify and characterize virus–virus interactions at the cellular level, we coinfected human lung cells with influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography revealed extracellular and membrane-associated filamentous structures consistent with hybrid viral particles (HVPs). We found that HVPs harbour surface glycoproteins and ribonucleoproteins of IAV and RSV. HVPs use the RSV fusion glycoprotein to evade anti-IAV neutralizing antibodies and infect and spread among cells lacking IAV receptors. Finally, we show that IAV and RSV coinfection in primary cells of the bronchial epithelium results in viral proteins from both viruses co-localizing at the apical cell surface. Our observations define a previously unknown interaction between respiratory viruses that might affect virus pathogenesis by expanding virus tropism and enabling immune evasion.

As multiple viruses exhibit the same tropism, cells and tissues are susceptible to infection by a community of taxonomically diverse viruses. From this perspective, a tissue or body compartment constitutes an ecological niche in which members of a virus community co-exist. Coinfections by more than one virus represent between ~10–30% of all respiratory viral infections and are common among children1,2. The clinical impact of viral coinfections is unclear: while some studies indicate that coinfections do not alter the outcome of disease3,4,5, others report increased incidence of viral pneumonia6,7.At the cellular level, the interactions that determine the outcome of coinfections are unclear. Direct interactions between viruses within coinfected cells can result in changes to viral progeny, including, but not limited to, pseudotyping (incorporation of surface proteins from a different virus)8,9,10 or genomic rearrangements, which may generate novel strains with pandemic potential such as SARS-CoV-2 and pandemic influenza A viruses11,12.Here we examined interactions between two commonly co-circulating viruses of clinical importance: IAV and RSV. IAV causes over five million hospitalizations each year13 and RSV is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children under five years of age14,15. To study virus–virus interactions during coinfection, we infected a cell line derived from human lung (A549)16, with a mixed inoculum of IAV and RSV, or individual viruses as controls.ResultsViral replication during coinfection of lung cellsInfections were performed at high MOI to facilitate coinfection and recapitulate high MOIs, which are produced in advanced stages of infection (when IAV and RSV foci may come into contact). We compared viral replication in single infections and coinfections. Single IAV infections resulted in robust replication, peaking between 24–48 hours post-infection (hpi). In coinfections, IAV replication was similar to that observed in coinfection or at some timepoints marginally increased (Fig. 1a, top left). As RSV titres peaked in single infections at a later timepoint than IAV (72 hpi, Fig. 1a, top right), further infections were performed to determine optimal conditions for coinfections by using a reduced IAV MOI (tenfold reduction relative to RSV). The reduced IAV input did not affect IAV replication, which still replicated to higher titres in coinfections (Fig. 1a, bottom left). By contrast, RSV titres were significantly reduced, by over 400-fold at 72 hpi, in the presence of IAV both at equivalent MOI (Fig. 1a, top right) and when IAV MOI was reduced relative to RSV (Fig. 1a, bottom right). These results are consistent with published studies that show that RSV is adversely impacted by coinfection, while IAV replication is not17,18.Fig. 1: Replication kinetics and cellular infection during IAV and RSV coinfections.a, Left, IAV replication kinetics in single infection (magenta bars) and mixed infection with RSV (teal bars). Right, RSV replication kinetics in single infection (green bars) and mixed infection with IAV (blue bars).

Data were collected from n = 3 biologically independent experiments, bars represent the mean and data points represent biological replicates.Source dataFull size imageLocalization of viral proteins during coinfectionTo assess if coinfection affected localization of key viral proteins or the proportion of infected cells, single and coinfections were performed as described above and cells were fixed at 24 hpi. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that cells infected with either RSV or IAV displayed features typical of the replicative cycle of each virus, such as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing RSV nucleoprotein (N), or diffuse IAV nucleoprotein (NP) staining within the cytoplasm (Fig. 1b, left column). Similar features were observed in coinfected cells (Fig. 1b, boxed area) suggesting that coinfection did not affect the intracellular localization of viral proteins. We counted the number of infected cells in single infections alongside the number of single-infected and coinfected cells in the coinfection condition. We observed a high proportion of coinfected cells at 24 hpi when cells were infected with equivalent amounts of virus as well as when IAV input MOI was reduced tenfold relative to RSV (Fig. 1c), suggesting that superinfection exclusion does not prevent coinfection. Paradoxically, a higher number of RSV-positive cells were detected in coinfections than in RSV single-infected samples, contrasting with the observed reduction in RSV titre in coinfections.IAV and RSV are enveloped viruses that target lipid rafts for assembly and budding19,20. We therefore stained cells for the major glycoproteins of IAV and RSV: haemagglutinin (HA) and RSV fusion (F), respectively (Fig. 1b, right column) and examined their localization at plasma membranes. IAV HA diffusely coated the plasma membrane of infected cells in both single virus infections and coinfections, while RSV F was localized to regions containing filamentous structures extending from the cell surface, corresponding to budding RSV virions. In coinfected cells, HA was not excluded from RSV budding sites (Fig. 1b, right column, boxed area).Filaments containing both IAV and RSV proteins are produced during coinfectionWe hypothesized that mixing of glycoproteins within cell surface regions may result in incorporation of both IAV and RSV components to budding viral particles. To test this, we applied super-resolution confocal microscopy to image virions immunolabelled for HA and F at high resolution. We observed dual-positive fluorescence suggesting the presence of budding viral filaments possessing both IAV and RSV glycoproteins during coinfection (Fig. 2a,b). Strikingly, minimal colocalization between the two glycoproteins was observed. Instead, glycoproteins were incorporated in distinct regions along the filament, with most dual-positive filaments positive for IAV HA at the distal end (Extended Data Fig. 1). Of coinfected cells, 56 ± 9.1% (mean ± SD) displayed cell-associated, dual-positive filaments. Many of these cells showed extensive production of dual-positive filaments, with no obvious indication of cell damage (Fig. 2c,d). We also observed dual-positive filaments distant from coinfected cells, suggesting they remained intact upon budding (Fig. 2b). Nested among dual-positive filaments (both cell-associated and released), we identified filaments corresponding to IAV and RSV virions (identified by HA or F only staining) (Fig. 2a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1). This indicates that regions in which dual-positive filaments form may contain both IAV and RSV budding sites.Fig. 2: Filaments containing both IAV and RSV proteins extend from coinfected cells.a,b, Cell-associated viral filaments positive for IAV HA (magenta on merged image) and RSV F (green on merged image) that are cell associated (a) or released (b) from coinfected cells, imaged by super-resolution microscopy.

IAV and RSV particles are indicated by yellow and blue arrows, respectively. Red arrow and magnified region highlight particles that contain structural features of both IAV and RSV. Scale bars indicate 1 µm.Full size imageWe performed microscopy on live cells to visualize the native organization of the filaments budding from coinfected cells. Consistent with our previous observations, we detected bundles of filaments protruding from the cell surface that incorporated F along the length of the filament with HA localized at the distal end (Fig. 2e). To obtain better resolution of these budding viruses, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM). IAV single infection revealed a pleomorphic population of membrane-associated structures consistent with spherical, bacilliform and filamentous particles, whereas RSV single infection resulted in dense clusters of budding RSV filaments (Extended Data Fig. 2). In coinfected cells we identified RSV-like filaments with structures branching from the distal ends resembling smaller bacilliform IAV-like virions (Fig. 2f).Ultra-structure of hybrid viral particles determined by cryo-ETTo determine the structural details of IAV or RSV filamentous structures budding from coinfected cells, we performed cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and observed structures consistent with hybrid viral particles containing elements of both IAV and RSV. We repeatedly observed two classes of hybrid particle with some virions exhibiting features of both classes: in 11 cryo-tomograms we observed true hybrid virus particles (HVPs, Fig. 3), and in 16 cryo-tomograms we observed pseudotyped viruses (PVs, Extended Data Fig. 3). Pleomorphic IAV particles and RSV filaments were also identified (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).Fig. 3: Hybrid viral particles contain IAV- and RSV-like structural regions.Viral particles produced from coinfected A549 cells were frozen at 24 hpi and imaged by cryo-ET. a, Cryo-tomogram showing an example of a hybrid viral particle.

Scale bars indicate 50 nm (c–e) or 100 nm (f).Full size imageHVPs exhibited distinct IAV-like and RSV-like structural regions: the wider part of the filament resembled RSV and extended continuously towards the distal end to one or more narrow, IAV-like regions (Fig. 3a,b, Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Density consistent with both IAV and RSV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) could be visualized and seemed confined within their respective structural regions of the filaments21,22 (Fig. 3a,b,d). Glycoproteins consistent in size, shape and density with IAV or RSV glycoproteins decorated the respective IAV- or RSV-like regions of the particles (Fig. 3c,e). In some virions, the junction between IAV and RSV regions had a clear lumen (Extended Data Fig. 4c, Supplementary Video 2), while other particles exhibited a much narrower join, with pinching off membranes between IAV and RSV areas (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Video 1, Extended Data Fig. 4a). Matrix layers were observed in IAV and RSV regions but were absent from the membrane bridging the two regions (Fig. 3f).We also identified virions consistent with RSV filaments containing RSV RNPs that had a different glycoprotein ordering than expected (Extended Data Fig. 3). The glycoproteins differed in shape when compared to those present on RSV virions and had a triangular arrangement which resembled IAV glycoproteins (Extended Data Fig. 3c), rather than ring shaped density more consistent with RSV glycoproteins (Extended Data Fig. 3e). They also lacked the long-range helical ordering typical of RSV glycoproteins (Extended Data Fig. 3c,e)23. We designated these structures ‘pseudotyped viruses’ (Extended Data Fig. 3a,c,d, Supplementary Video 3). Some HVPs with distinct IAV- and RSV-like structural regions also exhibited pseudotyping within the RSV region (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Notably, we did not observe IAV virions or IAV-like regions in hybrid particles that were pseudotyped with RSV glycoproteins.To quantify differences in glycoprotein arrangement, we determined the inter-spike distance on IAV, RSV and PVs. RSV exhibited a mean (±SD) inter-spike spacing of 12.9 (±2.32) nm, while IAV had a spacing of 8.71 (±1.18) nm. PVs had an average spike distance ranging from 8.31–9.56 nm, similar to IAV but significantly different to RSV (P < 0.0001, unpaired t-test; Extended Data Fig. 5). These results confirm that coinfections can result in the formation of two classes of hybrid viral particles structurally distinct from either parental virus.Antigenicity of hybrid virus particlesAs surface glycoproteins determine antigenicity and tropism, and HVPs incorporate glycoproteins of both IAV and RSV, we hypothesized that HVPs would display altered antigenicity. To test this, we first compared the neutralization efficiency of anti-IAV HA antibodies against viruses collected from cells infected with IAV alone, or coinfected with IAV and RSV. As RSV is predominantly cell-associated, we performed neutralization assays using supernatant and cell-associated fractions (Methods). Viruses were also back-titrated to determine infectious titre of the inoculum (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Viruses collected from coinfected cells displayed reduced IAV neutralization compared to those collected from single IAV infections (Extended Data Fig. 6c). While the observed differences were not statistically significant, the decrease in neutralization efficiency was more marked in the cell-associated fraction of the coinfected cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c) where only 33% (±27%; mean [±SD]) of IAV was neutralized, suggesting that two-thirds of IAV within this fraction was able to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (Extended Data Fig. 6c).In an analogous experiment, we compared the neutralization efficiency of anti-RSV F antibodies (palivizumab) against viruses collected from cells infected with RSV alone or coinfected. RSV harvested from both single and mixed infections was efficiently neutralized (Extended Data Fig. 6d). This suggests that, in contrast with IAV, RSV cannot utilize IAV glycoproteins to facilitate viral entry. Further, in the context of PVs, RSV infectivity may be determined by the ratio of incorporated IAV and RSV glycoproteins, where fully pseudotyped RSV filaments may be non-infectious, as they are unable to utilize IAV HA.Receptor tropism of hybrid virus particlesTo determine if the incorporation of RSV glycoproteins could result in an expansion of IAV receptor tropism, we treated cells with neuraminidase (NA) to remove sialic acids (the cellular receptor for IAV; Extended Data Fig. 7a). Sialic acid removal was confirmed by lectin staining (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Virus was harvested from IAV or RSV single infections or coinfections as described for neutralization assays and subsequently used to inoculate IAV-receptor-deficient (NA-treated) or control cells (Fig. 4a), as well as being back-titrated to determine the IAV titre in the inoculum (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Cells were fixed at 12 hpi, immunostained for IAV NP or RSV N and infected cells quantified. IAV entry was blocked in NA-treated cells when inoculated with the released virus of single IAV-infected cells, whereas entry of cell-associated IAV collected from single IAV infections was reduced by 90% (Fig. 4a). When NA-treated cells were inoculated with released or cell-associated virus harvested from mixed infections, IAV entry was significantly increased compared to IAV-only infection (Fig. 4a). The increase in IAV entry was higher in the cell-associated fraction, and IAV entry in receptor-deficient cells was restored to 63% (±10%) (mean [±SD]) of the level of control cells (Fig. 4a). As RSV does not use sialic acids as receptors, no differences in RSV entry between NA-treated or control cells were detected (Extended Data Fig. 7d).Fig. 4: Hybrid viruses enable IAV infection in sialic acid-depleted cells.NA-treated or control A549 cells were infected with virus harvested from coinfection or IAV single infection, fixed and immunostained at 12 hpi and the number of IAV-infected cells was quantified using an automated image-based cell counter. a, Ratio of IAV entry into NA-treated cells versus control cells when harvested from single infection (magenta bars) or mixed infection (teal bars). IAV entry to NA-treated cells was calculated as a percentage of the IAV-positive cell count in the matched untreated control.

Bars represent the mean and data points represent biological replicates. Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. *P < 0.05; ns, P > 0.05.Source dataFull size imageTo determine if extracellular association between free IAV and RSV virions was contributing to IAV entry into NA-treated cells, IAV and RSV were mixed and incubated prior to infecting NA-treated or control cells. No significant differences were observed in IAV or RSV entry into receptor-deficient cells compared with control cells when the viruses had been pre-mixed (Extended Data Fig. 7e), compared with each virus alone, suggesting that IAV and RSV do not associate upon extracellular mixing or that association does not impact viral entry. Overall, our findings suggest that the increase in IAV entry to sialic acid-deficient cells was a result of hybrid particle formation and indicates that HVPs represent a subpopulation of infectious virus particles with expanded receptor tropism. To determine whether the expansion of IAV tropism was mediated by the RSV F glycoprotein, virus harvested from mixed infections was incubated with palivizumab. We observed a significant reduction in entry of both released and cell-associated IAV into NA-treated cells in the presence of palivizumab (Fig. 4b,c), suggesting that RSV F facilitates IAV infection via hybrid particles that enable IAV to enter cells that would otherwise be refractory to infection. We measured IAV entry into untreated control cells (that is cells with normal expression of sialic acids) in the presence or absence of palivizumab. We observed that in the presence of palivizumab, entry of IAV harvested from the cell-associated fraction of coinfections was reduced by approximately half, compared with the palivizumab-free control (Fig. 4d). This suggests that there is a population of IAV that is dependent on RSV F to gain entry to cells, which in turn suggests that RSV F is the functional glycoprotein of IAV/RSV HVPs.Infectivity of hybrid virusesOur cryo-ET data showed that HVPs contain IAV and RSV genomes. To determine if they possess infectivity for both viruses, we infected NA-treated cells with virus harvested from single or mixed infections. At 12 hpi, cells were fixed and stained for IAV HA and RSV F and imaged by confocal microscopy. The presence of coinfected cells suggested that both genomes were delivered into the cells simultaneously, likely by HVPs (Fig. 5a,b). This conclusion is based on the facts that 12 hours is not a sufficiently long time to allow extensive cell-to-cell spread by IAV and RSV that may result in coinfection, and because the probability of coinfection by chance was low as the MOI for each virus was approximately 0.01 (based on back-titrations of harvested virus). Examination of coinfected cells using super-resolution microscopy revealed viral IAV HA and RSV F double-positive filaments (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the HVPs can be maintained over virus passage. To establish if HVPs could spread IAV from cell to cell within a population of cells refractory to IAV infection, we infected NA-treated or control cells with virus harvested from IAV single infections or from the cell-associated fraction of mixed infections (the fraction with enriched HVPs). We then applied an overlay to prevent virion diffusion and incubated the cells for 48 hours. As expected, in single IAV infections, abundant IAV-positive cells were observed in non-treated cells (Fig. 5c, top row). In the NA-treated cells, no infection by IAV from single infections was observed (Fig. 5c, middle row), whereas IAV foci consisting of multiple distinct infected cells were observed in NA-treated cells infected with virus from mixed infections (Fig. 5c, bottom row). Notably, IAV-positive foci colocalized with RSV-positive foci (Fig. 5c, bottom row). These results suggests that HVPs can mediate the spread of IAV within a refractory cell population.Fig. 5: Hybrid viral particles enable spread of IAV in a refractory cell population.a, A549 cells were infected with cell-associated virus from a coinfection and incubated for 12 hpi, before staining for IAV HA (magenta) and RSV F (green) and imaging by standard confocal microscopy. b, Super-resolution confocal imaging of coinfected cells shows formation of dual-positive filamentous structures, indicating hybrid particle formation is maintained upon passage. c, Virus harvested from IAV single infection (top and middle rows) or coinfection (bottom row) was incubated on untreated control wells (top row) or NA-treated wells (middle and bottom rows) with an overlay for 48 hours. Foci of infection were immunostained for IAV HA (magenta) and RSV N (green) and imaged by confocal microscopy. Infection was observed by IAV from single infection in untreated control cells, but not NA-treated cells. Virus harvested from coinfection formed large foci and IAV foci colocalized with RSV foci. Images shown in a–c are representative of n = 2 biologically independent experiments. Scale bars: 100 µm (a), 1 µm (b) and 200 µm (c).Full size imageCellular coinfection occurs in primary differentiated airway cellsTo determine the potential for HVP formation in a more biologically relevant system, we coinfected differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs). We observed no difference in IAV replication kinetics between single-infected and coinfected cultures (Fig. 6a). In coinfections, RSV titres were variable, but the average titres over experimental replicates were lower than in single infections (Fig. 6b). Trends in replication kinetics between single and mixed infections matched the trends observed in A549 cells, providing confidence that viral interactions are conserved between the two systems. To examine the spread of IAV and RSV in hBECs, we fixed and paraffin-embedded infected or mock-infected cultures (culture morphologies shown in Fig. 6c), and performed immunostaining using antibodies targeting IAV HA, IAV NP and a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole RSV virion. We observed diffuse staining for IAV HA and RSV across the apical layer of cells in single infections, whereas in coinfected cultures there was a high degree of individual cells infected by each virus as well as evidence of coinfected cells (Fig. 6d). Analysis of individual coinfected cells revealed dual staining for both IAV and RSV antigens both at the apical surface of coinfected cells and within the cytoplasm (Fig. 6e,f), providing an opportunity for interactions between IAV and RSV and the formation of HVPs.Fig. 6: Coinfection occurs in primary cells.a, IAV replication kinetics in hBEC cultures in single infection (magenta bars) and mixed infection with RSV (teal bars).

Although there is increasing evidence that interactions among viruses play an important role in virus dynamics and transmission, most of what is known about virus biology and pathogenesis is based on a tractable but reductionist research approach, whereby each virus is studied in isolation. Recent work provided evidence that interactions among respiratory viruses occur and have measurable outcomes at multiple levels, from populations, to individuals and tissues24,25,26,27,28. However, studies characterizing direct virus–virus interactions within cells are scarce. Here we report previously unknown interactions between IAV and RSV, two clinically important respiratory viruses that belong to different taxonomical families.We show that in coinfections, IAV replicates to equivalent or marginally higher titres compared to single IAV infections, whereas RSV replication is reduced. The consistency in IAV replication kinetics in the presence or absence of RSV contrasts with the inhibition of IAV replication in coinfections with rhinovirus26. This indicates that the consequences of coinfections are highly dependent on the viruses involved as they trigger virus-specific cellular responses.We also show compelling evidence that coinfections can generate infectious HVPs composed of structural, genomic and functional components of both parental viruses. As HVPs can evade IAV-targeted neutralization and infect cells lacking IAV receptors suggests that coinfections can generate viruses with altered antigenicity and expanded tropism. Using palivizumab, we showed that RSV F mediates HVP entry, indicating that in the context of a hybrid particle, IAV can use the glycoprotein of an unrelated virus as its functional envelope protein. This property may facilitate within-host dissemination to areas of the respiratory tract that are refractory to infection by one of the parental viruses, which is likely to impact pathogenesis and disease outcome. For example, IAV predominantly infects the upper and middle respiratory tract causing uncomplicated influenza, while RSV spreads more readily to the middle and lower respiratory tract (LRT)29,30. HVPs could enable IAV to escape mucosal antibodies while spreading to the LRT, with subsequent potential complications, including viral pneumonia30. In addition, as IAVs exhibit high mutation rates, LRT infections by HVPs might favour the selection of IAVs with increased tropism for the LRT and, therefore, result in selection of more pathogenic viruses.In recent years, a conceptual framework that incorporates social evolution theory has been developed to explain how virus–virus interactions can have a substantial effect on virus function and fitness31. We show that HVP formation is maintained over multiple rounds of infection, and that HVPs facilitate the spread of IAV within a population of refractory cells. This observation aligns with the concept that, like other pathogens and organisms, viruses can engage in social-like traits that are beneficial to virus fitness and function.Using a lung-derived human cell line, we show that the generation of HVPs by coinfection is biologically feasible. The fact that IAV and RSV cocirculate in winter in the same populations1, have a shared tropism for ciliated epithelial cells32,33, bud from the apical cellular surface22,33,34 and coinfect cells within the respiratory epithelium (this work) suggest that HVPs have the potential to be generated in vivo. The likelihood of a cell becoming coinfected during natural infection remains unknown but will vary depending on the timing of infection and the localization of infectious foci within the respiratory tract. Estimates of viral bursts show that as viral load increases, the effective MOI to susceptible cells surrounding an infectious focus increases35, enhancing the probability of cellular coinfection and therefore the potential generation of HVPs.The formation of HVPs raises questions about fundamental rules that govern viral assembly and budding. These processes, which are thought to be highly regulated, involve selective recruitment, trafficking36,37 and multimerization of viral proteins19,38,39,40 within specific compartments of the cell. While we described the formation of HVPs as a consequence of coinfection by IAV and RSV, we hypothesize that coinfections involving other pleomorphic enveloped viruses are also likely to generate HVPs. However, we posit that formation of infectious HVPs requires more than structural compatibility, and includes similar tropism, absence of superinfection exclusion or interference, as well as seasonal and geographical co-circulation. RSV is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a broad tropism for different regions of the respiratory tract and is frequently observed in co-infections in winter41,42,43, therefore RSV is a good candidate to form HVPs with other respiratory viruses. This might explain some of the mechanisms that lead to viral pneumonia44.One limitation of this study is that experiments were carried out in cell culture systems. While primary differentiated human airway cells provide the closest human-derived model of the upper respiratory tract available, they cannot fully capture the spatial and physiological complexity of the whole respiratory tract. Therefore, further in vivo studies are required to determine the frequency of coinfection within respiratory tissues and the potential for HVP formation. Additionally, further studies will be required to address which virus combinations can generate infectious HVPs; which viral properties favour their formation; and how they impact on pathogenesis and virus transmission.MethodsCellsHuman lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CCL-185), Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC, CCL-34) and HEp-2 (ATCC, CCL-23) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Minimum Essential Media (DMEM), high glucose, GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEp-2 cells were not authenticated before use in this study as these were used only for the propagation and titration of RSV, not coinfection experiments.The hBECs were cultured and differentiated at the air–liquid interface as described previously24. Briefly, hBECs (Epithelix) were cultured in Epithelix human airway epithelial cell medium (Epithelix; EP09AM) 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were cultured in tissue culture flasks until 80% confluent. After this point, cells were trypsinized and seeded at 2 × 104 cells per transwell onto transwell inserts for 24-well plate with 0.4 µm pore size with a pore density of 1.6 × 106 pores per cm2 (Falcon, 734–0036). When cells were fully confluent on transwell membranes, apical media was removed to initiated air–liquid interface (ALI). Basal media was replaced with Pneumacult-ALI media (STEMCELL Technologies, 05001). Basal media was replenished every 2–3 days. When cultures began producing mucus (approximately 20 days post ALI initiation), the apical surface of cultures was washed twice weekly with serum free DMEM.VirusesH1N1 influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 was rescued as previously described45 and virus stocks were grown in MDCK cells. RSV strain A2 (ATCC, VR-1540) was grown in HEp-2 cells.AntibodiesThe following primary antibodies were used at optimized concentrations: RSV fusion glycoprotein (Abcam, UK, AB24011, 1/1,000), RSV nucleoprotein (Abcam, UK, AB22501, 1/1,500), antisera to influenza A H1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34, 1/1,000; NIBSC, UK, 03/242), influenza A virus nucleoprotein (European Veterinary Society, EVS238, 1/1,000), mouse monoclonal anti-IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) HA (Sinobiological, 11684-MM03, 1/500), polyclonal anti-IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) nucleoprotein kindly provided by P. Digard, goat polyclonal anti-RSV (Abcam, AB20745, 1/500). Secondary antibodies: rabbit anti-mouse IgG alexafluor 488 conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, SAB4600056, 1/1,000), donkey anti-mouse 594 conjugate (Abcam, UK, ab150108, 1/1,000) donkey anti-sheep alexafluor 594 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA, A-11016, 1/1,000), goat anti-rabbit alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen, A11034).Virus growth curvesA549 cells were infected with IAV, RSV or synchronously infected with a mixed inoculum of IAV and RSV, diluted in DMEM, with 2% FBS and 1 µg ml–1 trypsin TPCK. Infections were carried out with RSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 4 and IAV at an MOI of 4 or 0.4. A549 cells were inoculated in 48-well plates and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 90 minutes, before the inoculum was removed and replaced with DMEM, with 2% FBS and 1 µg ml–1 trypsin TPCK. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and supernatant from each infection was collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection and stored at −80 °C prior to titration by plaque assay.The hBEC cultures were infected no earlier than 35 days after ALI initiation. The apical surface of cultures was washed with DMEM 24 hours prior to infection by applying pre-warmed DMEM to the apical surface of cultures and incubating at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 20 minutes, followed by removal. This washing step was repeated immediately before infection. Inoculum containing 105 pfu of IAV, RSV or a mixed inoculum of both viruses (105 pfu of each virus) was prepared in DMEM. Cultures were incubated with inoculum for 2 hours at 37 °C 5% CO2, after which the inoculum was removed and cultures were washed once with DMEM as described. Inoculum was back titrated by plaque assay to confirm virus input and served as the zero hours timepoint for growth curves. Two cultures were infected per infection condition and experimental timepoint. Samples were collected from the apical surface of cultures at 24, 48 and 72 hpi, by incubating with DMEM for 30 minutes. Samples were then removed and stored at −80 °C, prior to titration by IAV or RSV plaque assay. Transwells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 1 hour. After fixation, HBEC cultures were embedded in paraffin blocks, cut to sections of 2–3 µm thickness and mounted on glass slides. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to determine morphology.Infectious titre was determined by plaque assay in MDCK cells or HEp-2 cells for IAV and RSV, respectively. Validation was carried out prior to these experiments to ensure specific detection of IAV or RSV plaques in the respective cell type. While IAV and RSV are capable of infecting both cell lines, each cell line is only permissive to plaque formation by one virus, that is, IAV forms plaques in MDCK but not HEp-2cells, while RSV forms plaques in HEp-2 but not MDCK cells. Viruses were titrated in tenfold serial dilutions in duplicate and incubated on confluent cell monolayers for 90 minutes. For IAV plaque assays, overlay containing DMEM, 1 µg ml–1 trypsin TPCK and 0.6% Avicel was used and plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours. For RSV plaque assays, overlay containing DMEM, 5% FBS and 0.6% Avicel was applied and plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4–5 days. Plates were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Plaques were counted and titre determined as plaque forming units per ml (pfu ml–1). Experiments were carried out in technical (n = 3) and biological triplicate (n = 3 independent experiments).Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopyCells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells ml–1 on 13 mm glass coverslips or 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MATTEK Corporation Inc, USA) prior to infection. Infections were incubated for 24 hours prior to fixation with 4% fomaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% triton X100 for 10 minutes at room temperature. Samples were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 minutes. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by four washes with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold mounting media with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen, USA, P36392), and samples in dishes were stained with 2 µg ml–1 Hoescht 33342 solution for 10 minutes. For combining mouse primary antibodies, samples were blocked in rabbit serum (Gentex, USA, GTX73221), then stained with primary antibody and rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody, followed by secondary blocking in donkey serum (Gentex, USA, GTX73205), then stained with primary antibody and donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody. For live-cell imaging, cells were incubated with 2 µg ml–1 Hoescht 33342 solution in cell culture media, for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with cold PBS, followed by incubation with primary antibody diluted in 2% BSA in PBS for 5 minutes on ice. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with secondary antibody diluted in 2% BSA in PBS for 5 minutes on ice. Cells were stored in PBS and imaged immediately following staining.For immunofluorescence staining of culture sections, sections were dewaxed by heating in an oven at 60 °C for 1 hour. Next, slides were washed four times with xylene, each for 10 minutes. Following this, sections were rehydrated via washes with 1:1 (v/v) xylene:isopropanol mixture, then 100%, 90%, 70% and 50% isopropyl alcohol solution each for five minutes. Sections were washed thoroughly with distilled H2O and PBS. For antigen retrieval, sections were treated with proteinase K solution (Dako, S3020) for 15 minutes.Sections were mounted into humid chambers for immunostaining. Sections were permeablized with 1% triton X100 for 10 minutes, followed by three washes with PBS. Sections were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA solution and applied to sections for two hours at room temperature, followed by washing with PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA solution and applied to sections for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature, followed washing with PBS and distilled H2O. Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold mounting media containing DAPI (Invitrogen, P36392).Confocal microscopy was carried out using Zeiss LSM880 AxioObserver microscope (ZEISS, Germany). Standard images were collected using GaAsP detector with 405 nm, 488 nm and 598 nm excitation lasers, using 40×/1.4 or 63×/1.4 plan-apochromat oil DIC M27 objectives. Super-resolution imaging was collected using the Airyscan detector with 405 nm, 488 nm and 594 nm excitation lasers, using plan-apochromat 63×/1.4 oil DIC M27 objective. Z-stacks were collected using a z-interval of 100 nm. For determining proportions of infection and focus assay on NA-treated cells, fields of view were imaged using 3 × 3 tile scans at 40×/1.4 oil DIC M27 objective. Image processing and analysis was carried out in ImageJ software (v2.0.0-rc-56/1.52g; NIH, USA) and Zeiss Zen lite (Blue edition) version 2.6. Single or coinfected cells were counted manually, using cell counter plugin on ImageJ. Experiments were carried out in technical (n = 3) and biological triplicate (n = 3 independent experiments).Scanning electron microscopyCells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells ml–1 on 13 mm glass coverslips prior to infection at MOI of 4 with IAV, RSV or coinfection for 24 hours. Cells were fixed with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (SC) buffer for 1 hour and washed three times for 5 minutes each with 0.1 M SC buffer before incubation with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hour. Samples were then stained with aqueous 0.5% uranyl acetate for 1 h and further dehydrated through an ethanol series and subjected to critical point drying using an Autosamdri-815 Critical Point Dryer (Tousimis, USA) before mounting and coating in 20 nm gold/palladium using a Quorum Q150T ES high vacuum coating system (Quorum Technologies, UK). Images were collected using JEOL IT100 SEM at 20 kV, with InTouch Scope software, version 1.05 (JEOL USA Inc, USA). Infections and imaging were carried out in two independent experiments, with duplicate samples per experiment.Cryo-electron tomography and computational analysisCells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells ml–1 on laminin-coated (Roche) 200-mesh gold R2/2 London finder Quantifoil grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MATTEK Corporation Inc, USA). Cells were infected with IAV MOI 1 and RSV MOI 4 and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C. Cryo-ET imaging experiments of coinfected cells were carried out in three independent experiments, with duplicate grids imaged per experiment. Immediately before plunge-freezing 3 µl colloidal solution of 20 nm gold fiducials (Sigma-Aldrich) pretreated with BSA was added to each grid. The gold served as fiducial markers for cryo-tomogram reconstruction. Grids were blotted from the backside of the grid and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using the FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) or Leica EM GP 2 (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Plunge-frozen grids were subsequently loaded into a JEOL CRYO ARM 300 (JEOL Ltd, Japan) equipped with an energy-filter and DE64 detector (Direct Electron, USA). To identify the presence of virus budding sites near electron transparent cellular edges low-magnification grid maps were generated using serialEM46. Next, polygon maps at 3,000× magnification were collected at areas of interest and virus budding sites were identified. Tilt-series of virus budding sites were then recorded using SerialEM at either 30,000× (1.921 Å per pixel) or 50,000x (1.499 Å per pixel) magnification. Each tilt-series was collected from −60° to +60° at an increment of 2° or 3° at 5- to 8-µm underfocus (30,000×) and 2- to 5-µm underfocus (50,000×). The cumulative dose of one tilt-series was between 80 and 120 e− Å–2. Tilt-series were collected using a dose-symmetric scheme starting at 0° implemented in SerialEM47 and were collected in ‘movie mode’. For the 30,000× magnification tilt-series movie frames were aligned using alignframes module in IMOD46. For the 50,000× magnification tilt-series movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 with 6 by 6 patches48. Once tilt-series sub-frames were aligned and binned eightfold, they were reconstructed into 3D tomograms using weighted back projection with IMOD. To aid interpretation and visualization, noise reduction was applied using Topaz49. Figures and supplementary videos were prepared using IMOD, ImageJ and Quicktime. Segmentation and isosurface rendering were performed manually using the thresholding tool in Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).Glycoprotein-distance was measured and calculated using the imodinfo module in IMOD. Denoised tomograms were averaged between 5–10 slices to improve contrast and glycoproteins were viewed from top down. Distances were measured between the centres of pairs of adjacent glycoproteins. For IAV and RSV controls, spike measurements were collected from 11 individual tomograms for each virus (n = 326 for IAV, n = 236 for RSV). For pseudotyped virus, spike measurements were collected from each particle, from four individual tomograms (n = 50 measurements per tomogram).Neutralization assaysA549 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates prior to infection with IAV MOI 1, RSV MOI 4 or mixed infection. Infected cells were incubated for 24 hours before released virus was harvested from supernatant and cell associated virus was collected by scraping and vortexing infected cells. Virus stocks were back titrated in MDCK or HEp-2 cells to determine pfu per well in the neutralization assays. For IAV neutralization assay, IAV from single infection or mixed infection was incubated with polyclonal anti-serum targeting A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1 (NIBSC, UK, 03/242) at 1/200 dilution in DMEM or a serum-free control. For the RSV neutralization assay, RSV from single infection or mixed infection was incubated with Palivizumab (Evidentic, Germany) at 10 µg per well concentration diluted in DMEM, or a serum-free control. Virus (neat or at a 1/10 dilution in DMEM) was incubated with serum for 1 hour at 37 °C before transfer to A549 cells that had been seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well in 96-well plates 48 hours prior to infection. Infections were incubated for 12 hours at 37 °C and following this, cells were fixed in 4% fomaldehyde. Plates were immunofluorescence stained for IAV or RSV nucleoprotein and infected cells were quantified using the Celigo automated cytometer (Nexcelom Bioscience, USA), using two target expression analysis. Neutralization was calculated from the positive cell count in each technical replicate of the serum containing wells as a percentage of the average positive cell count in the serum-free control. Experiments were carried out in biological triplicate (n = 3 independent experiments).Neuraminidase assayTo prepare fresh virus stocks for the NA assay, A549 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates prior to infection with IAV MOI 1, RSV MOI 4 or mixed infection. Infected cells were incubated for 24 hours before released virus was harvested from supernatant and cell-associated virus was collected by scraping and vortexing infected cells. Virus stocks were back titrated in MDCK or HEp-2 cells to determine pfu per well in the neutralization assays. For the NA assay, cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well in 96-well plates, prior to treatment with 1mU µl–1 NA from clostridium perfringens (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, N2876) for 2 hours. To confirm removal of sialic acids, NA treated and control cells were stained with biotinylated Maackia Amurensis Lectin II (MAL II; Vector Laboratories, UK, B-1265-1), followed by fluorescein conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, UK, SA-5001-1) or Erythrina Cristagalli Lectin conjugated to fluorescein (Vector Laboratories, UK, FL-1141-5). Neat virus stocks were transferred directly onto NA treated or untreated cells in 96-well plates or on 13 mm glass coverslips and incubated for 12 hours. Virus harvested from coinfection was also incubated with 10 µg per well palivizumab for 1 hour at 37 °C, before transfer to NA-treated or untreated control wells and incubated for 12 hours. Cells were fixed and 96-well plates stained for IAV or RSV nucleoprotein, followed by rabbit anti-mouse 488 (Sigma Aldrich, USA, SABA4600056) secondary antibody. Infected cells were counted using Celigo automated cytometer (Nexcelom Bioscience, USA), using two target expression analysis. Viral entry ratio was calculated from the positive cell count in each technical replicate of the NA-treated wells as a percentage of the average positive cell count in the untreated control wells. Fixed coverslips were immunostained for IAV HA or RSV F and imaged by confocal microscopy using Zeiss LSM880 with or without Airyscan detector. Experiments were carried out in biological triplicate (n = 3 independent experiments).For the focus assay, cells were seeded onto 13 mm glass coverslips at 1 × 105 cells per well. Cells were treated with 1 mU µl–1 NA for 2 hours, before infection with fresh virus stocks harvested from IAV single infection or coinfection or infection of untreated control cells. Infections were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.6% Avicel, 2% FBS and 1 µg ml–1 trypsin TPCK and incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. Following this, coverslips were fixed and immunostained for RSV N and IAV HA. Samples were imaged by confocal microscopy using Zeiss LSM880.Statistical analysis and data visualizationStatistical tests were carried out using Graphpad Prism, version 9.1.0. No assumptions about data normality were made and a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test was used to determine statistical significance in growth kinetic experiments, neutralization assays and NA assays. For inter-spike measurements on tomograms, normal distribution was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test and statistical difference between groups was determined by a two-tailed unpaired t-test. Data were visualized with RStudio version 1.3.105650 using GGPlot2 package51. Statistical significance is indicated in figures as ns P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(b) White arrows and filament numbering correspond to fluorescence intensity profiles displayed in (c). Minimal colocalisation was observed in the fluorescence intensity profiles (c) for IAV HA (magenta line) and RSV F (green line) signal along filaments numbered 1–15. IAV (filament 3, magenta star) and RSV (filament 7, green star) filaments were also identified among dual positive filaments.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 2 Scanning electron microscopy shows clear differences between IAV and RSV virion structure.Scanning electron micrographs of IAV, RSV, coinfected or mock infected cells imaged at 1000x (top row), 10,000x (middle row) and 20,000x (bottom row), region of magnification is denoted by the white box. Scale bars represent 10 µm at 1000x and 1 µm at 10,000x and 20,000x magnification. Micrographs representative of n = 2 biologically independent experiments.Extended Data Fig. 3 Coinfection generates RSV filaments that are pseudotyped with IAV envelope proteins.(a) Tomogram shows a pseudotyped RSV filament, indicated by red ‘PV’ label, near to RSV filaments, one example indicated by blue ‘RSV’ label. Scale bar indicates 200 nm. (b) Magnified cross-section of end of pseudotyped filament, showing RSV RNP contained within virion. (c) Surface of psuedotyped filament shows irregular arrangement of glycoproteins, with many displaying characteristic triangular shape of HA trimers, shown in magnified inset image. (d) Magnified cross-section of end of RSV filament, showing RSV RNP contained within virion and ultra-structure consistent with the pseudotyped virion. (e) Surface of the RSV filament shows helical arrangement of glycoproteins, with ring-shaped density of glycoproteins highlighted in magnified insert. Scale bars in panels (c-e) indicate 50 nm. Micrographs shown in (a-e) representative of n = 3 biologically independent experiments.Extended Data Fig. 4 Further examples of hybrid particles.(a and b) show two z-positions through the same hybrid particle, which also displays pseudotyping in RSV-like region. (a) IAV-like regions extend from the top of the filament and ring-shaped densities corresponding to RSV genome, indicated by green arrows and highlighted in magnified inset image, are present within the virion. (b) The surface of the virion is covered in glycoproteins that are consistent in shape and arrangement with IAV glycoproteins, highlighted in magnified inset. Scale bars indicate 200 nm. (c) Tomogram shows a further example of a hybrid particle with two IAV-like regions which are joined to the RSV-like region by a continuous membrane. Black and green arrows indicate IAV and RSV RNP respectively, contained with in their associated structural regions. Scale bar indicates 200 nm. There is a clear shared lumen which continues between RSV and IAV regions, highlighted within magnified inset which corresponds to region marked by white dashed box. Scale bar indicates 50 nm. Micrographs shown in (a-c) representative of n = 3 biologically independent experiments.Extended Data Fig. 5 Inter-spike distance measurements reveal that pseudotyped viruses are decorated with IAV glycoproteins.To determine the glycoprotein arrangement on pseudotyped viruses, inter-spike distances were measured between glycoprotein pairs. Representative examples are shown for IAV (a), RSV (b) and pseudotyped virions (c) with red lines indicating example distances measured. Pink, green and blue dashed lines indicate the edges of IAV, RSV and psuedotyped filaments respectively. Scale bars indicate 200 nm. (d) Tomography data was collected from n = 2 biologically independent experiments. Control measurements were collected from 11 tomograms for IAV (measurements n = 326) and 11 tomograms for RSV (measurements n = 236). Measurements of pseudotyped virions were collected from 4 individual tomograms (n = 50 measurements per tomogram). Average inter-spike distances were 8.71 nm for IAV, 12.9 nm for RSV and a range of 8.31–9.56 nm for pseudotypes. Statistical significance was determined by two tailed unpaired t-test analysis, **** p < 0.0001. Box plot shows interquartile range (25th percentile, median, 75th percentile), whiskers represent minimum and maximum values and black points represent outliers.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 6 Hybrid viral particles evade neutralizing antibodies against IAV, but not RSV.Virus harvested from coinfection or single infections was pre-incubated with serum targeting IAV HA, RSV F or a serum-free control, and then used to infect A549 cells. Infections were fixed and immunostained at 12 hpi and the number of IAV infected cells was quantified using an automated image-based cell counter. The same virus stocks were back titrated to determine infectious viral input. (a) Back titration of IAV in single infection (magenta bars) or coinfection (teal bars) by IAV plaque assay. (b) Back titration of RSV in single infection (green bars) or coinfection (dark blue bars) by RSV plaque assay. (c) Neutralisation of IAV by polyclonal antisera targeting IAV HA when virus was harvested from the supernatant or cell pellet fractions of a single IAV infection (magenta bars) or a coinfection (teal bars).

PEER REVIEWED On This Page AbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgmentsAuthor InformationReferencesTablesAppendix Summary What is already known on this topic? Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce cardiovascular illness and death, and routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What is added by this report? We found marginal improvement in influenza vaccination during the past decade among adults with cardiovascular disease, lagging far behind the Healthy People 2020 goal. Vaccination prevalence is influenced by social determinants of health such as race and ethnicity, access to preventive services, and geographic location. What are the implications for public health practice? We can achieve Healthy People 2030 goals for vaccine-preventable disease only if we prioritize socially vulnerable populations and look beyond clinical settings as a place of vaccination. Abstract Introduction Influenza vaccination can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US. However, differences in state-level trends in CVD and sociodemographic and health care characteristics of adults with CVD have not yet been studied. Methods In this repeated cross-sectional study, we extracted 476,227 records of adults with a self-reported history of CVD from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from January 2011 through December 2020. We calculated the prevalence and likelihood of annual influenza vaccination by sociodemographic characteristics, health care characteristics, and CVD risk factors. Additionally, we examined annual trends of influenza vaccination by geographic location. Results The annual age-adjusted influenza vaccination rate among adults with CVD increased from 38.6% (2011) to 44.3% (2020), with an annual average percentage change of 1.1%. Adults who were aged 18 to 44 years, male, non-Hispanic Black/African American, or Hispanic, or had less than a high school diploma, annual household income less than $50,000, and no health insurance had a lower prevalence of vaccination. The odds of vaccination were lower among non-Hispanic Black/African American (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70–0.77) and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98) compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Only 16 states achieved a vaccination rate of 50%; no state achieved the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70%. Nonmedical settings (supermarkets, drug stores) gained popularity (19.2% in 2011 to 28.5% in 2018) as a vaccination setting. Conclusion Influenza vaccination among adults with CVD improved marginally during the past decade but is far behind the targeted national goals. Addressing existing disparities requires attention to the role of social determinants of health in determining access to vaccination, particularly among young people, racial and ethnic minority populations, people who lack health insurance, and people with comorbidities. TopIntroduction During the past 2 decades, annual influenza vaccination has been a cornerstone of national efforts such as Healthy People to achieve a target vaccination rate of 70% and protect against influenza (1). The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend influenza vaccination for secondary prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), reflecting growing evidence of the protective role of vaccination (Class I, Level of Evidence B) (1,2). A recent study reported an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 7 days of contracting infection with influenza A and influenza B virus (3). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased risk of CVD, including immune complex deposition in atherosclerotic plaques and subsequent thrombosis and elevated macrophage circulation in arteries (4,5). Current evidence suggests that such adverse outcomes may be prevented with influenza vaccination (3,6,7). The efficacy of influenza vaccination in preventing AMI has been estimated at 15% to 45%, which is comparable to the documented efficacy of traditional CVD prevention measures such as smoking cessation (32%–43%), statins (19%–30%), and antihypertensive therapy (17%–25%) (6). However, there is a paucity of data on influenza vaccination rates and related sociodemographic differences among adults with CVD. Furthermore, little is known about potential state-level differences in vaccination coverage. To address this gap, we sought to evaluate the national and regional trends of influenza vaccination among adults with CVD. We also examined patterns and predictors of annual influenza vaccination among adults with CVD by key sociodemographic and health care characteristics considered to be social determinants of health. TopMethods Data source and study design We abstracted data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide annual telephonic health survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years or older living in the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and US territories on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services (8). BRFSS is a collaborative project between US states and territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State health departments manage BRFSS field operations with technical assistance from CDC. The structured survey questionnaire is designed and approved by a working group of BRFSS state coordinators and CDC staff members before the beginning of each calendar year. BRFSS conducts surveys via landlines and cellular telephones by using trained survey administrators and random-digit–dialing methods to identify respondents and computer-assisted telephone interview systems to perform structured scripted interviews. For landline telephone sampling, BRFSS divides telephone numbers into 2 strata, high density and medium density, which are determined by the number of listed household numbers in a set of 100 telephone numbers with the same area code, prefix, and first 2 digits of the suffix and all possible combinations of the last 2 digits. For cellular telephone sampling, a commercially available frame is used, whereby the system can call random samples of cellular telephone numbers. The study was determined to be exempt from review by the institutional review board at George Mason University. We included in our analysis adults aged 18 years or older surveyed from January 2011 through December 2020 with a history of heart attack/myocardial infarction, angina/coronary heart disease (CHD), or stroke. Approximately 6.4% of respondents with CVD were missing information on influenza vaccination and were excluded from our analytic sample. The final sample comprised 476,227 adults with CVD and accounted for 8.5% of the BRFSS survey sample conducted from 2011 through 2020. Median survey responses ranged from 45.1% to 49.9% for the study period. Study variables Annual influenza vaccination was defined as receipt of an influenza vaccination within 12 months before the interview date. Sociodemographic covariates include age (categorized as 18–44, 45–64 years, and ≥65 years), sex (male, female), race and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black/African American, non-Hispanic Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic other), education level (some high school or less, high school graduate, some college or technical school, college graduate), annual household income (<$50,000 or ≥$50,000), marital status (married; unmarried; divorced, widowed, or separated), and US Census–defined geographic region (New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, Pacific, US Islands). Health care characteristics were having any health insurance (yeso), having a personal doctor or health care provider (hereinafter, personal health care provider) (yeso), and time since the most recent visit to the personal health care provider for a routine checkup. Primary risk factors for CVD included diabetes, obesity (body mass index >30.0), and smoking status (never, former, and current). Statistical analysis The survey procedures (svyset) in Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC) were used to account for the complex sampling design and BRFSS survey weights and to determine national and state-level population estimates. To compute direct age-adjusted estimates, we used 2010 US Census population proportions for groups aged 18 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and 65 years or older. We first performed a descriptive analysis of sociodemographic characteristics, health care characteristics, and CVD risk factors, and we used a χ2 test to compare the distribution of these characteristics among participants with and without a history of CVD. For our primary analysis, we examined the age-adjusted frequency distribution (% prevalence and 95% CI) of annual influenza vaccination coverage among adults with CVD each year from 2011 through 2020. We used Joinpoint trend analysis software version 4.9.1.0 (National Cancer Institute) (9) to analyze temporal trends in age-adjusted prevalence of influenza vaccination by years across all characteristics. The Joinpoint regression fits trend data from start to end years and identifies trend segments with significant changes in trend. For each trend segment in the selected model, the annual percentage change (APC) is calculated to characterize trends over time per segment. The average APC (AAPC) for all years (2011–2020) was obtained as a weighted APC. In our trend analysis, with 10 years of data points, the modeling was restricted to a maximum of 2 joinpoints. Modeling selection was based on the permutation test and evaluated if a change occurred in any segment; a P value of <.05 was considered significant. In a secondary analysis, we examined various places for vaccination among participants who reported receiving the vaccine in the past 12 months. BRFSS has the following response options: doctor’s office or health maintenance organization (HMO); health department; another type of clinic or health center (a community health center); senior, recreation, or community center; store (supermarket, drug store); hospital (inpatient); emergency room; workplace; some other kind of place; school; received vaccination in Canada/Mexico; don’t knowot sure; and refused. We combined categories into the following: doctor’s office (including HMO), other health care facility (health department, another type of clinic or health center, and community health center), hospital/emergency room, store, workplace, and other (senior or recreation center, some other kind of place, school, outside US, and don’t knowot sureefused). This analysis was performed by using the core questionnaire module for the years 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2018. Because of limited years of data for place of vaccination, we did not perform trend analysis and reported only age-adjusted prevalence. Multivariate logistic regression models were weighted to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% CIs of influenza vaccination associated with each sociodemographic characteristic, health care characteristic, and CVD risk factor. Furthermore, to account for possible state-level differences and temporal trends in vaccination rates, we generated year and state fixed-effects logistic regression models. A 2-sided P value of .05 was used to determine significance. TopResults Adults with CVD were more likely than adults without CVD to be aged 65 years or older (51.2% vs 16.9%), male (55.4% vs 47.8%), non-Hispanic White (71.5% vs 64.3%), and a high school graduate or less (52.0% vs 40.3%), and have an annual household income of less than $50,000 (69.4% vs 50.4%) (Supplemental Table 1 in Appendix). The prevalence of diabetes (31.7% vs 9.7%), obesity (38.0% vs 28.8%), and current smoking (20.4% vs 16.5%) was greater among adults with CVD than among adults without CVD. Most adults with CVD had health insurance (91.8%), had a personal health care provider (91.0%), and had a visit with the personal health care provider within the past year (85.8%); the prevalence of each of these characteristics was higher among adults with CVD than among adults without CVD (85.7%, 76.6%, and 69.7%, respectively). The influenza vaccination rate was consistently higher among adults with CVD than among adults without CVD (Supplemental Figure in Appendix); however, the gap in prevalence decreased from 2011 through 2020. Among adults with CVD, the age-adjusted prevalence of influenza vaccination increased from 38.6% in 2011 to 44.3% in 2020 (Supplemental Table 2 in Appendix) with an average APC of 1.1% (Table 1). The APC in influenza vaccination changed from a 4.5% decrease per year during 2015 through 2018 to a 14.1% increase per year during 2018 through 2020. By type of CVD, vaccination rates were highest among adults with a history of angina/CHD (46.9%) and lowest among adults with a history of myocardial infarction (40.1%) in 2020. Influenza vaccination rates were consistently lower among adults aged 18 to 44 years (vs adults aged 45–64 and ≥65 years) and men (vs women). Among racial and ethnic minority groups in 2020, Asian adults had the highest vaccination rate (50.4%), while American Indian/Alaska Native (40.3%), non-Hispanic Black/African American (43.3%), and Hispanic (36.8%) adults had lower rates. Although the AAPC in influenza vaccination prevalence among adults aged 45 to 64 years with CVD was a nonsignificant 1.4%, the prevalence increased significantly during 2018 through 2020 (APC, 12.6%) (Table 1). The overall prevalence of influenza vaccination increased among both men and women, with a greater increase during the last trend segment (2018–2020). The AAPC was 2.9% among college graduates, with prevalence ranging from 46.2% in 2011 to 59.1% in 2020. Although the prevalence of influenza vaccination was higher among adults with diabetes than among adults without diabetes, the prevalence increased significantly among adults without diabetes during 2011 through 2020 (AAPC, 1.9%). Among never and former smokers, influenza vaccination increased at a significant AAPC of 1.9%, with a greater increase during 2018 through 2020 among never smokers (APC, 14.1%) and former smokers (APC, 15.1%). Adults with a personal health care provider had consistently higher vaccination rates than adults without one (42.1% vs 23.5% in 2011; 47.9% vs 26.1% in 2020); the AAPC was 1.8% for both groups, and the largest increase for both groups was during 2018 through 2020 (has a personal health care provider, 13.2%; does not have a personal health care provider, 19.2%). The AAPC in the prevalence of influenza vaccination was 1.7% (42.7% in 2011 to 48.8% in 2020) among adults with a visit to a personal health care provider within the past 1 year, −0.1% (30.7% in 2011 to 29.4% in 2020) among adults reporting 1 or 2 years since their most recent visit, and −2.3% (25.8% in 2011 to 20.1% in 2020) among adults reporting more than 2 years since their most recent visit. In 2020, the age-adjusted influenza vaccination rate among adults with CVD ranged from 22.6% in Puerto Rico to 64.0% in South Dakota (Figure 1). From 2011 to 2020, the vaccination rate showed a significant positive linear trend in 9 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington) and Puerto Rico. A negative linear trend was observed in 3 states (Louisiana, South Carolina, West Virginia). Overall, West North Central region states performed well in influenza vaccination rates during the study period. Only 16 states achieved a vaccination rate of 50%, and no state achieved the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70%. Figure 1.

Linear and quadratic trends were calculated by using adjusted regression models with survey years modeled as orthogonal polynomials. Abbreviation: NA, not available. [A tabular version of this figure is available.] Doctors’ offices remained the most common place for annual influenza vaccination among US adults with CVD, despite consistently declining vaccination rates from 2011 (49.4%) to 2018 (47.3%); we observed similar declines for other health care facilities. In contrast, the preference for stores such as supermarkets or drug stores as vaccination sites steadily increased from 19.2% in 2011 to 28.5% in 2018 (Figure 2). Figure 2. Common places for receiving an annual influenza vaccination among US adults with cardiovascular disease, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2011–2020. “Other health care facility” includes health department, another type of clinic or health center, and a community health center. Store includes supermarkets or drug stores. “Other place” includes senior or recreation center, some other kind of place, school, received outside US, and don’t knowot sureefused. [A tabular version of this figure is available.] Compared with adults with CVD aged 18 to 44 years, adults aged 45 to 64 years (AOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.41–1.61) and adults aged 65 years or older (AOR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.40–2.76) had greater odds of getting an influenza vaccination (Table 2). Women had marginally higher odds (AOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.10) of getting the influenza vaccination than men. Compared with non-Hispanic White adults with CVD, Hispanic adults with CVD had 23% lower odds of getting the annual influenza vaccination (AOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.72–0.82) with year-fixed effects, which was not significant when state effects were added. Odds of getting an influenza vaccination were 27% and 14% lower, respectively, among non-Hispanic Black/African American adults (AOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70–0.77) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75- 0.98) adults with CVD compared with non-Hispanic White adults with CVD. The odds of getting an influenza vaccination increased consistently as level of education increased. Adults with CVD and diabetes were 29% more likely to get an influenza vaccination (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25–1.33) than adults with CVD and no diabetes. Compared with nonsmoking adults with CVD, former smokers with CVD were 15% more likely to get an influenza vaccination (AOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11–1.19). In contrast, current smokers with CVD were 21% less likely to get an annual influenza vaccination (AOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76–0.83) than nonsmoking adults with CVD. Having health insurance (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.63–1.89) and a personal health care provider (AOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.60–1.83) increased the likelihood of influenza vaccination. The odds of getting an annual influenza vaccination decreased as time increased since the most recent visit to a personal health care provider for a routine checkup. The likelihood of receiving an annual influenza vaccination differed by type of CVD. The odds of receiving an annual influenza vaccination were significantly greater among adults with a history of angina/CHD (AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15−1.22; P < .001) than among adults without a history of angina/CHD. In contrast, odds were marginally lower among adults with a history of stroke (AOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.97; P < .001) compared with adults with no history of stroke (Figure 3). Figure 3.

[A tabular version of this figure is available.] TopDiscussion This study found a slight improvement in influenza vaccination coverage among adults with CVD during the past decade; however, vaccination rates remained consistently below national goals (1). We found that young adults had lower vaccination rates than middle-aged and older adults, and rates among young adults did not improve during the study period. This lack of improvement may be attributed to a lower perceived risk of influenza in this population (10). The prevalence of influenza vaccination was consistently lower among middle-aged adults, supporting findings from a previous study that reported lower rates among this age group compared with adults aged 65 years or older (11). By race and ethnicity, only non-Hispanic White adults showed improvements in influenza vaccination rates. Furthermore, we found that non-Hispanic Black/African American and American Indian/Alaska Native adults were consistently less likely than non-Hispanic White adults to get annual influenza vaccinations, which may reflect persistent racial disparities in the use of preventive services and mistrust of clinical research activities (12,13). Our findings may also be attributed to various social determinants of health, including access to preventive care and treatment; such missed opportunities for preventive care and treatment among racial and ethnic minority populations merit further study (10,14). Adults with CVD and without health insurance, without a personal health care provider, and without a recent visit to a personal health care provider for a routine checkup had lower vaccination rates than adults with health insurance, a personal health care provider, and a visit. The influence of such modifiable social determinants of health on vaccination rates highlights the underlying structural barriers, such as access to routine care, to adherence to preventive health guidelines (14). Moreover, the popularity of nonmedical settings such as workplaces, supermarkets, and drug stores as vaccination sites provides an opportunity to extend vaccination efforts beyond traditional medical settings to achieve the Healthy People 2030 target for influenza vaccination. In this study, among adults with CVD, we found a consistently lower prevalence of influenza vaccination among current smokers than among never and former smokers. Current smoking was also identified in regression analyses as significantly lowering the odds of influenza vaccination. In contrast, among adults with CVD, former smokers (compared with never smokers) and adults with diabetes (compared with adults without diabetes) had a greater likelihood of influenza vaccination, consistent with previous literature on the general population (15,16). Smoking has contributed to nearly 25% of hospitalizations attributable to influenza, which could be prevented with vaccination (17). In 2020, 44.3% of adults with CVD received an influenza vaccination in the US, and more than half of states are above this national average, which was the highest in any year during the study period. This relatively high prevalence was likely due to the surge in influenza vaccination uptake as protection against COVID-19 (18). During the past decade, influenza vaccination rates among adults with CVD varied significantly by state, and all states fell below the national target of 70%. Rates were comparatively higher in New England and the West North Central region and lower in the East South Central and Pacific regions. State-level differences may have been driven by preexisting social determinants of health such as economic burden, lack of transportation, lower rate of insurance coverage, vaccination mandates for certain populations, and allowed exemptions (15,19–23). Also, the discrepancy between state vaccination rates and the national goal underscores the need to further analyze data to understand the needs of states according to the unique demographic characteristics of each state. Future efforts should focus on identifying both personal and system-level barriers to uptake of influenza vaccination, including issues related to individual perceptions, resource allocation, and the infrastructure for delivering preventive care (22,24). Our findings have important implications for state and national COVID-19 vaccination goals. The current administration has taken an active role in administering and distributing COVID-19 vaccinations. However, rollout responsibilities have still largely been borne by states, and our findings demonstrate that much work must be done to address the issue of vaccination acceptance among diverse population groups, especially among racial and ethnic minority populations, people with low socioeconomic status, people who lack health insurance, and people with comorbidities. Strengths and limitations The primary strength of our study is that, to our knowledge, it is the largest and most current survey to report the national prevalence of influenza vaccination with validated survey questions on vaccination receipt (25). Moreover, the BRFSS methodology has been used and evaluated by CDC and participating states for more than 4 decades (8). In addition, our study is the first to report age-adjusted trends, by state, among adults with CVD with various sociodemographic and health care characteristics. Nonetheless, the strength of association in our findings should be interpreted with caution. The large study sample size may render weak associations significant. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of the survey precludes causal inferences. In addition, the telephonic survey data are self-reported, so recall bias and some misclassification cannot be ruled out. However, previous studies showed that self-reported BRFSS data on influenza vaccination status and chronic conditions had better validity than self-reported data from other surveys (26–28). Although BRFSS has been conducted in all 50 states, New Jersey was not included in the 2019 survey year; furthermore, among US territories, only Guam and Puerto Rico collected data for all years, and the Virgin Islands collected data for the 2016 survey year only. We noted an approximate 6% decrease from 2017 to 2018 and then an 8 percentage-point increase in influenza coverage in 2019, similar to findings from a CDC report on vaccination coverage (29). Although the reason for the decrease in 2018 is not clear, the estimates in 2019 were consistent with other national surveillance data on influenza vaccination as reported by CDC (29,30). Also, we were not able to evaluate reasons for state-specific differences in influenza vaccination prevalence, and the reasons for opting in or opting out of vaccination. Although the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions in data collection for many national surveys, BRFSS was unlikely to be affected because of its use of state-of-the-art telephonic data collection methods; the response rate was 47.9% in 2020. Conclusion These findings highlight significant disparities in influenza vaccination rates among adults with CVD and underline the relevance of social determinants of health toward achieving target vaccination rates (2), particularly among young people, racial and ethnic minority populations, people with comorbidities, and people who lack health insurance and a regular source of care. Our results have implications for policies on vaccine-preventable diseases, such as COVID-19, which should prioritize socially vulnerable populations and look beyond clinical settings as a place of vaccination to achieve Healthy People 2030 goals.

By Katie Cadiao, County of San Diego Communications OfficeOct. 27, 2022 | 10:37 AMOct. 27, 2022 | 11:25 AM Reading Time: 3 minutesA 55-year-old man from the North Central region of the county is the first influenza death reported in San Diego this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today. The man died on Oct. 15. He had underlying medical conditions and had not been vaccinated against the flu. He tested negative for COVID-19. New influenza cases also continued to increase last week. The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 856 lab-confirmed flu cases for the week ending Oct. 22. That’s an almost 45% increase when compared to the previous week, when 591 new infections were reported. The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths. For the week ending Oct. 22, 2022, the report shows the following: Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 6% of all visits (compared with 5% the previous week) Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 856 (compared to 591 the previous week) Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 2,528 (compared to 232 at the same time last season and a 196 prior 5-year average during the same week) “Every flu death is tragic and our condolences go out to the man’s family and friends,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Unfortunately, we see influenza deaths every fall and winter and I encourage San Diegans to do their part to stop the spread of illnesses and prevent deaths.” Get Vaccinated The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest public health center location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego. “Vaccination is the best defense we have against the flu,” Wooten said. “It is still early in the flu season and we are already seeing cases spike, so we have reason to believe that the flu could be extremely disruptive this year. Protect yourself and your family now and get the flu shot as soon as you can.” It takes about two weeks after immunization until immunity develops. In addition to getting vaccinated, Wooten recommends that people, especially those who are at a higher risk of severe outcomes, recommit themselves to the following precautions this fall and winter: Wash hands thoroughly and often; Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands; Stay away from sick people; Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; Clean commonly touched surfaces; and If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others. Flu Symptoms The flu and COVID-19 are both spread from person-to-person, especially indoors and in crowded places. Symptoms for both viruses include fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain, as well as a sore throat and coughing. Since symptoms for both the flu and COVID are similar, but treatment varies, COVID testing, which is still widely available across the region, is a good first step to help sick individuals determine a plan of action. It is recommended that San Diegans who develop flu-like symptoms get tested for COVID-19, especially if you have an underlying condition that puts you at an increased risk of severe outcomes from the flu or COVID. High-risk individuals include: People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control; Pregnant women; People aged 65 years and older; and People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk. During the 2021-2022 flu season, 4,192 flu cases were reported and eight San Diegans died from influenza. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, and two San Diegans died from the flu.

Image courtesy of Margaret Mullin and Joanne Haney, University of Glasgow Many respiratory viral infections involve more than one type of virus, but the cellular dynamics of these coinfections and their effects on human health are often unclear. Now, a team has shown that two common respiratory viruses—influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—can fuse to form a hybrid that better evades certain antibodies in vitro. The findings were published yesterday (October 24) in Nature Microbiology.“This was an unexpected but very exciting discovery that challenges what we know about how viral particles are formed within a cell,” study coauthor Pablo Murcia of the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research says in a press statement. To understand the effects of coinfection in vitro, the team infected human lung cells with IAV and RSV simultaneously. Using microscopy and live-cell imaging, the researchers found that viruses combined to form filamentous structures containing some bits from IAV and some bits from RSV, and that these hybrid virus particles could spread to other cells.Our paper is out!????Describing novel interactions that result from coinfection with Flu and RSV.

The hybrid simply used its RSV proteins to infect cells instead. “Influenza is using hybrid viral particles as a Trojan horse,” Murcia tells The Guardian. The same was not true for RSV: antibodies against this virus did effectively stop the hybrid’s spread. “This suggests that, in contrast with IAV, RSV cannot utilize IAV glycoproteins to facilitate viral entry,” the authors write in their paper.Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the work, tells the Guardian that hybridization with RSV could potentially increase the severity of influenza infections. “RSV tends to go lower down into the lung than the seasonal flu virus, and you’re more likely to get more severe disease the further down the infection goes,” he says. He adds that this sort of viral hybridization event hasn’t been observed in people, so more research is needed to establish whether it has any effect on human health. “Our next steps are to find out if hybrid particles are formed in patients with coinfections, and to identify which virus combinations can generate hybrid particles,” Murcia says in the statement.

One child, the CDC said, has died.Get more newsLiveonOct. 28, 2022, 3:01 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsFlu-related hospitalizations nationwide have risen dramatically in recent weeks, reaching levels historically not seen until much later in flu season, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."We haven't seen this level of activity this early before," said Lynnette Brammer, team lead of the domestic influenza surveillance team at the CDC. Typical flu seasons usually don't pick up steam until December.Flu hospitalizations are rising across all age groups, especially children. The increase comes as other respiratory viruses, including RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, are also spiking in kids. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 76% of pediatric hospital beds nationwide are full. "We realize the potential implications of the co-circulating viruses all at once," Brammer said. "We're taking it very seriously."Doctors are not required to report each positive flu test to public health officials, so the CDC and others monitor likely flu activity by looking at "influenza-like illnesses": a fever of at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough and/or sore throat without any other known cause.Also Friday, the CDC reported the first flu-related death in a child so far this season. The CDC did not provide any details about the child, however KVEO, the NBC affiliate in Brownsville, Texas, recently reported that a 3-year-old girl had died after testing positive for the flu.While the flu and similar viral illnesses are rising nationwide, they're notably high across the Southeast and Eastern Seaboard — from Texas to Georgia, and South Carolina up to Virginia and New Jersey, according to the new report.As of Oct. 22, "influenza-like illness," or ILI, activity, which includes the flu, was increasing dramatically across the Southeast and Eastern Seaboard.CDCDoctors also warn that other infections can follow severe cases of the flu, including bacterial infections like pneumococcal pneumonia. Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, worries that this season could be bad for these post-viral infections.Dr. Shannon Martinello, a pediatrician in private practice in New Haven, Connecticut, is already seeing an uptick in post-viral bacterial illness. "The more mucus they have, and the more congested they are, it increases their risk of ear infections," she said. "I always tell parents when their kids have flu, it's going to be a rough week, and they're going to get better," Martinello said. But if a child who has recovered from the flu starts to feel sick again a week or 10 days later, she advises parents to take the child back to the doctor. "I want to re-listen to his lungs and re-check his ears and make sure that something else hasn't happened as a secondary issue." There are early signs that this year's flu shot appears to work well at keeping people out of the hospital. A report on Chile's flu season, released Thursday by the CDC, found the vaccine was 49% protective against flu-related hospitalizations. That might seem low, but from 2015 to 2020, flu shot effectiveness in the U.S. ranged from 29% to 48%.A patients is moved between wings at the Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital on Feb. 25, 2022, in New York. Luiz C. Ribeiro / TNS via Getty ImagesIt's unclear whether this year's flu shots in the U.S. will be as effective as was found during Chile's flu season. But the shots used in both countries have one of the same targets: the H3N2 flu strain, which accounts for a majority of flu cases currently detected in the U.S.H3N2 is an influenza A virus and is often associated with increased hospitalizations. Kids under age 5 may be at particular risk.The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu shot. Children up through 8 years old may need two shots this year, the agency said, especially if they've never had the flu vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics has the same recommendation, adding that kids should get their flu shots by the end of October. But the early start to the flu season has left many Americans vulnerable. Only about half of the population gets an annual flu shot, typically. Many who do often wait until October to get it."I cannot stress enough how important it is to go ahead and get that vaccine now," Brammer said.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."Reynolds Lewis contributed.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoYou Can Give Blood after Getting Flu Shot and COVID-19 Vaccine Menu Hi, Account Summary Donation History Monthly Giving Personal Information Sign Out Sign In Español Your Local Red Cross Based on Zip Code Change Visit local site Find other locations Shop the Red Cross Store Donate Ways to Donate Money Donate Online Make a Monthly Gift Mail, Text or Phone Make a Major Gift Clara Barton Society Where Your Money Goes Other Ways to Donate Give by Will or Other Plan Stock and Wire Transfer Donor Advised Funds IRA Distribution Donate a Vehicle Charity Livestreaming Fundraise for the Red Cross Companies & Foundations Get Started Partnership Opportunities Our Corporate Partners Cause Marketing Other Ways to Give Partners: Why We Give Donate Now » Give Blood How to Donate Find a Blood Drive Eligibility Requirements Types of Blood Donations How Blood Donations Help Common Concerns Blood Donation Process Donation Process Overview What to do Before, During and After What Happens to Donated Blood First Time Blood Donors Learn About Hosting Why Host a Blood Drive?

Receiving a flu shot or a COVID-19 vaccine or booster is a great way to protect your own health. It causes no wait period and does not affect blood donation eligibility, as long as you are healthy, feeling well and symptom free at the time of donation. While the need for blood and platelet donations is constant, a severe cold and flu season can result in fewer donations if many become sick and need to postpone a blood donation until they are well. According to health officials, both influenza and COVID-19 cases are expected to surge simultaneously this winter. They warn 100 million Americans – equivalent to nearly a third of the country’s population – could get COVID-19 infections in the coming fall and winter. That number could be even higher if a new variant enters the scene. With an increase in flu cases already being seen in some communities, more healthy individuals will be needed to roll up a sleeve to donate. “It’s particularly important during the fall and winter months, when we see an increase in cold and flu cases, that those who are in good health share their good health by giving blood,” said Dr. Baia Lasky for the American Red Cross. For those that have the flu or COVID-19, it is important to wait until they no longer exhibit symptoms, have recovered completely and feel well before attempting to donate. The Red Cross urges blood donors of all types and those who have never given before to book a time to give blood or platelets now and help keep the blood supply strong for hospital patients. The Red Cross follows a high standard of safety and infection control. While donors are no longer required to wear a mask, individuals may choose to continue to do so. Those who would like to share their good health by giving blood can find a blood drive and schedule a donation appointment by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). About the American Red Cross: The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides comfort to victims of disasters; supplies about 40% of the nation’s blood; teaches skills that save lives; distributes international humanitarian aid; and supports veterans, military members and their families.

Cold & FluNewsFlu Season Looks to Be Off to an Early and Robust StartFlu season is beginning a month early this year, with a number of states already reporting high levels of flu activity and several high schools in California and Virginia experiencing massive suspected outbreaks.ByDon RaufFact CheckedUpdated on October 24, 2022Sneezing into a tissue is one way to help prevent the spread of flu.Javier Díez/StocksyEditor’s NoteThis story has been updated to reflect the latest news.Although we don’t know exactly what to expect as the flu returns this year, many public health authorities are bracing for an especially bad season.As of October 14, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that influenza activity is currently low overall but rising in most of the country. The federal health agency notes that the South East and South Central United States are reporting the highest levels of flu activity, including Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington, DC.But significant spread of the virus hasn’t been isolated to those regions.The New York State Department of Health said earlier this month that influenza is already considered widespread across the area. Since September, cases have been increasing in the state. For the week ending October 1, 596 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were reported in 44 of the state’s 62 counties.Flu season usually runs from October through May, and typically peaks between December and February. This year public health agencies began reporting cases in higher than usual numbers in September, and cases of laboratory-confirmed flu are increasing week over week.“Influenza is starting about a month early this year, making it likely that this winter’s flu season will be severe,” says William Schaffner, MD, an infectious-disease specialist and a professor of preventive medicine and health policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “The past two very mild flu seasons have spoiled us. This year we’ve taken off our masks; we’re traveling, visiting friends and relatives, attending religious services, and our children are back in school. All these activities provide an opportunity for the flu virus to spread easily.”The CDC also notes that the most frequently recorded type of influenza last week was influenza A (H3N2), which is known to cause more-serious illness than other strains of the virus.Potential Outbreaks in California and Virginia Schools Raise ConcernsFlu spreads more easily when people gather, and as the colder weather kicks in during the fall and winter, more are congregating indoors in office buildings, homes, childcare centers, and schools.Schools can often be prime zones from transmission. San Diego County Public Health Services is currently investigating a large suspected outbreak of respiratory and flu-like symptoms among students at Patrick Henry High School.According to the local ABC News affiliate, ABC 10 News San Diego, starting October 10, the high school had about 1,100 absences out of 2,600 students.Another San Diego school, Del Norte High School, had an estimated 884 absences out of 2,517 students.Health officials in the area have already noticed a rapid and early start to flu season, and a major children’s hospital in the region has seen a recent uptick in emergency room visits due to flu.“Unfortunately, we anticipated this would be a rough influenza season, and alongside COVID-19, other respiratory viruses are making a rapid comeback. If you haven’t already, now is the time to get your flu and COVID-19 shots to gain the extra protections afforded by the vaccines,” said Cameron Kaiser, MD, the county’s deputy public health officer, in a statement to the county news center.In another potential outbreak, around 1,000 students at Stafford High School in Fredericksburg, Virginia — about half the total enrollment — were absent last week due to flu-like or gastrointestinal symptoms, CNN reports. The school is working with the local health department to identify the root cause of the illness.Federal Health Officials Are Bracing for a ‘Significant’ Flu SeasonFederal health officials, who are trying to get a better idea of what to expect, look to the southern hemisphere: The flu season there is just wrapping up, and it typically mirrors what’s to come in the north.“Given what we’ve seen in Australia this summer — our summer, their winter — it’s reasonable to expect we’re going to see a significant flu season this year,” said the White House coronavirus response coordinator, Ashish Jha, MD, in a press briefing on October 11. “So we have some challenges ahead as we plan and as we look at the winter in front of us.”Americans are being urged to get flu vaccines as soon as they can, earlier than perhaps they typically would. Dr. Jha is advising Americans to get vaccinated as soon as possible so they can more safely enjoy the holiday season with family and friends.“The challenge with holiday seasons every year is it’s also a time where contagious respiratory viruses — like influenza, RSV, and, again this year, COVID — spread much more quickly,” said Jha. “So, my message today from this briefing room is very simple: Don’t wait. Get your new flu shot and get your new COVID shot today. If Americans did that, we could save hundreds of lives each day this winter.”Check out Vaccines.gov to find out where to get a flu or COVID-19 shot near you.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkDon RaufAuthorDon Rauf has been a freelance health writer for over 12 years and his writing has been featured in HealthDay, CBS News, WebMD, U.S. News & World Report, Mental Floss, United Press International (UPI), Health, and MedicineNet.

First to Uganda, where WHO had been supporting the government to respond to an outbreak of Ebola disease that was declared 37 days ago. We are concerned by rising cases in new geographical areas, including urban centres like Kampala. So far, there are 109 confirmed cases and 31 confirmed deaths, with an additional 20 deaths that were likely caused by Ebola. 34 people have recovered. Of these, 15 infections occurred among health care workers, 4 of whom have died. This is a stark reminder that infection prevention and control in health care facilities is critical. That means that training, protective equipment, and water, sanitation and hygiene facilities need to be in place in health facilities before crises hit. Health facilities must be places of cure, not where infection is spread. WHO and partners are supporting the scale up of contact tracing, delivering early care and community engagement, which is critical for timely care and treatment, contact tracing, safe burials, and in the vaccine trials recently announced by the Uganda Ministry of Health. WHO is ready to deploy more experts to Uganda, both to help contain the outbreak and to prevent it from spreading in more regions and countries. ==== Now to cholera. Around the world, 29 countries have reported outbreaks this year, including 13 countries that did not have outbreaks last year. Last week, we announced a temporary suspension of the two-dose strategy for cholera vaccines, due to the limited global supply and the overwhelming demand, which is still increasing. 29 countries with cholera, in 2022. We should not be in this situation in the first place. This is a disease that can kill within a day. But it is also easily treatable. Rapid access to treatment is critical. And we know that even better than curing a disease is stopping it from occurring in the first place. Excellencies, dear colleagues and friends, cholera is an old-time killer, but it is also one we can put an end to. Remember, it was not so very long ago that it was found in big cities throughout the world. We know how to stop cholera before it starts: with safe water, and well-maintained sanitation and hygiene. Cholera is a perfect example of why we must go beyond the health sector to address the root causes of disease. In 2022, nobody should die from cholera. ==== Moving to monkeypox. More than 76 000 cases in 109 countries have now been reported to WHO, with 36 deaths. We continue to work with countries around the world to get vital information to those most at-risk, along with increasing surveillance, testing and diagnostic capacities, supporting immunization and medical care. On the monkeypox situation, the good news is that it is globally on the decline, but we still should not give room to complacency. === We are turning a corner on the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is not over. More than two million, six hundred thousand new cases were reported in the last week, with 8 562 new deaths. The end of this pandemic is in sight, but inequity continues to hobble our response. Nearly one-third of the world’s population has not yet received a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, including over half of health workers and about two-thirds of older people in low-income countries. This vaccination gap imperils the global recovery and puts us all at risk. The danger of new, more dangerous variants that can evade our vaccines is real. We must not become complacent. === Of course, the world has long faced pandemics, and none more deadly in modern times than influenza. Which is why we joined together as a global community to put in place detection and response measures to keep us all safer. This is global, scientific solidarity in action, and it works. Today we will be hearing from Dr Wenqing Zhang and Dr Joshua Mott on our preparedness work for the upcoming influenza season, along with an update on the expansion of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, GISRS. With social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza circulation dropped significantly. But during the second half of 2021, influenza epidemics have resurfaced. And in fact, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, zoonotic influenza outbreaks were detected. Fortunately, all of them were sporadic infections and none had sustained human-to-human transmission. So far, we have been lucky. But another influenza pandemic is a near certainty - the only question is when. That is why global preparedness efforts for an influenza pandemic must never slow down. Our pandemic influenza infrastructure has also played an important role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, through bolstering laboratory diagnostic capacity in countries, and using our global mechanisms to support the development of vaccines for COVID-19. Let me list a few other highlights: 115 countries integrated COVID-19 surveillance into their influenza sentinel systems; more than 90% of national influenza centres served as COVID-19 reference labs; and 177 countries developed COVID-19 plans based on approaches used in influenza plans. More than 72 low- and lower-middle income countries strengthened their influenza preparedness systems thanks to PIP, The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework partnership. The process is now ongoing to integrate other respiratory viruses into the influenza surveillance system - a GISRS Plus - which would both reduce costs and improve efficiency in detecting, monitoring and responding to potential global threats. Excellencies, dear colleagues and friends, the influenza season will soon arrive in the Northern Hemisphere. WHO urges those at higher risk to get their influenza vaccinations, including healthcare workers, older adults, pregnant women, those who have underlying medical conditions, and children. === I would like to close with a special word of thanks to President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre of Norway for their leadership of the ACT-A Facilitation Council these past two years. The Council will go on standby after its 12th meeting this Friday - tomorrow - to consider the ACT-A Transition Plan and the Council’s External Evaluation. All Member States are invited to join. === As always, we are grateful for your engagement with today’s presentations, and we look forward to your questions, comments and guidance. I thank you.

Hopefully you’re doing everything you can to fend off harmful viruses this year, from getting your annual flu shot to wearing a mask in public to washing your hands well and often. No one wants to ride out a hellish fever and cold sweats at home eating soup for days (the “it sucks but will be okay” scenario) or develop one of the many flu complications that can make the illness even worse (the potentially serious scenario).In many cases, people will catch the flu, feel like crud for a week, and still be fine. In other cases, the virus attacks the body so fiercely that other health problems arise—some so severe they can send a person to the hospital. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that, out of the millions of Americans who came down with the flu between 2010 and 2020, anywhere between 140,000 to 710,000 were hospitalized annually, while 12,000 to 52,000 died from it each year.“We all experience varying degrees of illness when we get a viral infection,” Khalilah Latrece Gates, MD, an associate professor of pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern Medicine, tells SELF. “On the one hand, you have the mild illness where you just have something similar to a really bad cold. And then you have the more severe flu,” she explains, which largely depends on how the influenza virus spreads within your body and how your immune system responds to it.Depending on how your body handles the virus, as well as your personal health history, you may also end up with a complication of the flu. “A ‘complication’ is when another condition or disease manifests due to the fact that the person’s body is not at its most optimal state,” Darvin Smith, MD, the chief of infectious diseases and geographic medicine at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, tells SELF.In other words, when your body is super occupied trying to fight off the flu, it’s more susceptible to other infections. Influenza can also worsen symptoms of underlying conditions you already have, adds Dr. Smith.Here are common flu complications to be aware of, who typically faces the highest risk, and what you can do to stay safe.1. BronchitisIn mild cases of the flu, the virus enters your body via the nose or mouth and infects the upper respiratory tract: the nasal cavity, sinuses, throat, and larynx. But sometimes it can spread to the airways that lead to the lungs, the trachea and the bronchi, which sets the stage for bronchitis.If you develop this condition, you may find yourself coughing up mucus, feeling short of breath, and maybe even wheezing when you breathe. The intense bronchitis cough can be persistent, sometimes lingering for up to three weeks.How it’s treated: Bronchodilators (inhalers) and cough suppressants (either prescription or sold over the counter) can help you manage discomfort and breathe easier while you ride it out.2. PneumoniaPneumonia develops when an infection—which can be bacterial, fungal, or viral—inflames the air sacs in your lungs and causes them to fill up with fluid. When your body has a hard time fighting off the flu and the influenza virus is able to spread deeper into your airways, it can directly lead to this complication, Dr. Smith says. Even though the flu is a virus, research shows it’s common to develop a secondary infection of bacterial pneumonia too.Symptoms of pneumonia can include coughing up yellow or green mucus, fever, chest pain when coughing or breathing, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Its signature respiratory symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea in some people. Mild pneumonia symptoms can be almost indistinguishable from your run-of-the-mill flu symptoms; severe pneumonia, however, can make it difficult to breathe (sometimes requiring breathing assistance via a ventilator) and other dangerous side effects like fluid buildup around the lungs or an abscess in the lungs. Pneumonia can also leave you feeling fatigued for weeks, even after you kick the bug.How it’s treated: “[Bacterial] pneumonia would be treated with an antibiotic as the flu is being treated with an antiviral,” Dr. Smith says. If the pneumonia is viral, antibiotics won’t work. In this case, things like cough suppressants and fever reducers can help you manage your symptoms until the virus clears up. Of course, you’ll also need to take it easy and get plenty of rest as your body tries to recover.3. Sinus or ear infectionsLike pneumonia, sinus and ear infections can happen when bacteria take advantage of your weakened immune system. Sinus infections may be the more obvious complication, since those hollow cavities beneath the face are connected to your nose. When these get inflamed, you might experience post-nasal drip, a stuffy nose, yellow or green snot, coughing, and uncomfortable facial pressure.But you might be surprised to learn that your ears are also connected to your throat via what’s called the eustachian tube. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, ear infections are more common in children in part because their eustachian tubes are shorter, and when they get swollen they aren’t as efficient at draining potentially microbe-filled fluid. This can lead to ear pain, loss of balance, and temporary hearing loss, per the Mayo Clinic.How it’s treated: This depends on whether the infection is bacterial or viral. Your doc may prescribe a combination of antibiotics or an antiviral depending on the type of invaders you’re dealing with. Drinking lots of fluids and taking over-the-counter pain relievers to ease any discomfort and fever will help too.4. Severe dehydrationOne reason why it’s so important to drink your fluids when the flu hits: Having a fever dehydrates you—and vomiting and diarrhea can make it worse. This dehydration can reach a level in which “people lose their sense of thirst and become so weak that they lose the capability to drink,” says Dr. Smith. “It can be severe and progress quickly.”How it’s treated: “Drinking extra fluids [even when you aren’t thirsty] is important to prevent dehydration; this can be accomplished by taking in more liquids in the form of soups or oral rehydration solutions,” says Dr. Smith. Water, fruit juice, sports drinks, and other electrolyte beverages are all fair game; find what’s easiest for you to keep down and sip away as you rest.Dehydration is considered an emergency if you’re feeling really weak, dizzy, confused, or seeing a large amount of blood in your mucus or vomit. At that point, drinking enough fluids to make up the difference may be tough if not impossible, according to Dr. Smith, so the best solution is to go to the emergency room and receive IV fluids ASAP.5. Worsening of chronic conditionsOne of the ways your body fights pesky viruses is through inflammation, which, in short, is your immune system’s way of trying to protect you against infection or injury. When a bug, like the flu virus, makes its rude entrance into your system, certain immune cells activate to fend it off and minimize its spread, Dr. Gates explains. This inflammatory response is what fuels fever, chills, fatigue, and other signs of illness—you know, those core symptoms that most viral and bacterial infections have in common.While this immune response can be effective, it can potentially worsen chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, Dr. Gates says. For example, the strain the flu puts on the heart can be life-threatening for people with cardiovascular disease. “Asthma causes the narrowing of the airways, and the flu can make breathing even harder” and even trigger asthma attacks, Dr. Gates says. As for diabetes, viral infections encourage the body to release higher levels of certain hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which can counter your cells’ ability to use insulin and can ultimately lead to ketoacidosis, a dangerous complication in which high levels of acids called ketones build up in the blood.On the other hand, having a chronic condition can make recovering from the flu even tougher, adds Dr. Smith. If a person has a neuromuscular disorder that makes it difficult for them to cough, for example, their condition “would prevent them from being able to clear the viral mucus from the lungs,” he says.How it’s treated: This largely depends on the underlying condition, but generally if you have a chronic condition and notice flu symptoms coming on, it’s important to seek advice from a physician as soon as you can, according to Dr. Gates.6. Neurological IssuesIn rare but severe cases, the flu virus can trigger inflammation in the brain, known as encephalitis, which may affect your ability to be awake, think, concentrate, remember, and even control certain muscles, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. It may even lead to seizures. Unfortunately, sometimes these complications can lead to permanent brain damage and disability. (It’s a scary possibility, we know.)Neurological issues from the flu are rare, and children with underlying chronic neurological conditions (like epilepsy and cerebral palsy) tend to be the most vulnerable.How it’s treated: Physicians treat neurological issues based on the root cause, which could mean prescribing an antiviral to help with the flu. In the case of seizures, MDs may also suggest using anticonvulsants.Who’s the most susceptible to flu complications?While anyone can develop a flu complication, people who fall into the below categories generally face the highest risk:Toddlers and infants: “Those who are very young do not have fully established immune systems” will have a harder time fighting off the flu virus, Dr. Gates says.Adults aged 65 and older: Due to aging, seniors’ immune systems tend to be less responsive when they encounter harmful pathogens, according to Dr. Smith.Adults with chronic conditions: Asthma, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, blood disorders, neurologic conditions, and chronic kidney disease are just some of the chronic conditions that can put you at risk of having serious flu complications, the CDC notes.People who are immunocompromised: The medications they are using and/or the condition itself can prevent their immune systems from responding appropriately to the virus, says Dr. Gates. Pregnancy also changes the immune system in a way that makes you more susceptible to severe flu and complications.If you do end up getting the flu this season and you are otherwise healthy, your symptoms are generally mild, and you don’t fall into one of those high-risk groups, doctors recommend staying home and resting, drinking lots of fluids, and managing your symptoms with over-the-counter meds. If your symptoms aren’t improving within 48 to 72 hours of taking it easy, Dr. Gates recommends calling your doctor.If you get the flu and are in one of the high-risk groups, get evaluated by a doctor ASAP. “The most important thing is to test to see if you have the flu and get an answer sooner rather than later, preferably in the first 48 to 72 hours,” says Dr. Gates, “because that's when the anti-influenza medications would be most helpful.” Early intervention—and, ultimately, getting your annual flu vaccine—can make a huge difference in warding off potential complications so that you can get better sooner.Related:COVID-19 May Cause These Long-Term Heart ComplicationsHow to Prep for Cold and Flu Season Right Now, Before You Get SickHow to Actually Wash Your Hands the Right WayAdele is a health and fitness writer, certified movement coach, and energy healer based in Oakland, California.

However, biophysical constraints that govern the evolutionary trajectories of NA remain largely elusive. Here, we show that among 70 natural mutations that are present in the NA of a recent human H3N2 strain, >10% are deleterious for an ancestral strain. By mapping the permissive mutations using combinatorial mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing, an extensive epistatic network is revealed. Biophysical and structural analyses further demonstrate that certain epistatic interactions can be explained by non-additive stability effect, which in turn modulates membrane trafficking and enzymatic activity of NA. Additionally, our results suggest that other biophysical mechanisms also contribute to epistasis in NA evolution. Overall, these findings not only provide mechanistic insights into the evolution of human influenza NA and elucidate its sequence-structure-function relationship, but also have important implications for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines.

Influenza A virus has two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that act as the major antigens. Because of the need to constantly escape from herd immunity, both HA and NA of human influenza A virus evolve rapidly. Most studies on the evolution of human influenza A virus focus on HA, due to its dominant role in vaccine development2. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that NA immunity also contributes to protection against influenza infection3,4,5,6. These findings suggest that NA can be an effective vaccine target7. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the evolutionary biology of NA.NA is a type II transmembrane protein that forms a homotetramer. The natural function of NA is to cleave the sialic acids from cellular receptors to facilitate virus release and from newly synthesized HA to prevent virion aggregation8. After entering the human population in 1968, H3N2 has accumulated around 75 amino acid mutations in NA, which account for 16% of the entire protein9. Such an extensive evolution of NA can at least be partly attributed to epistasis, where the fitness of a mutation depends on the genetic background. For example, our recent study indicates that the emergence of mutations in an antigenic region of human H3N2 NA is contingent on the evolution of other parts of the sequence9. Similarly, the emergence of oseltamivir resistance in seasonal H1N1 virus is contingent on permissive mutations10,11,12. Although epistasis is central to the understanding of evolutionary trajectories13,14, the prevalence of epistasis in the evolution of human influenza NA remains elusive.Mechanisms of epistasis can be categorized into two classes, specific and non-specific15. Specific epistasis, which describes a nonlinear mapping from sequence to physical property, typically involves mutations that are spatially proximal on the protein structure and physically interacting with each other. In contrast, non-specific epistasis, which describes a nonlinear mapping from physical property to phenotype, depends less on the spatial distance between mutations. Both types of epistasis are involved in the natural evolution of human influenza virus. For example, specific epistasis is observed in a network of HA mutations that coordinately modulate the evolution of receptor-binding mode16,17. On the other hand, non-specific epistasis is observed in the evolution of influenza nucleoprotein (NP), in which the emergence of destabilizing mutations is contingent on the presence of stabilizing mutations to maintain a melting temperature of at least 43 °C for optimum transcriptional activity18. As a result, characterization of epistasis can provide mechanistic insights into the biophysical constraints that govern the evolutionary trajectories of influenza proteins.In this study, we systematically identified natural mutations in human H3N2 NA that were unfit in an ancestral strain but subsequently emerge. We further mapped an epistatic network among natural mutations in human H3N2 NA using combinatorial mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing. Microscopy and flow cytometry analyses showed that membrane trafficking efficiency and enzymatic activity contribute to epistasis between NA mutations. Using biophysical assays and X-ray crystallography, we also demonstrated that non-additive stability effect led to specific epistasis in NA evolution. Overall, this study represents an in-depth analysis of epistasis in the natural evolution of human H3N2 NA as well as the underlying mechanisms.ResultsPrevalence of evolutionary contingency in human H3N2 NAPositive epistasis can lead to evolutionary contingency, where a deleterious mutation in an ancestral strain becomes neutral and emerges after one or more permissive mutations arise15. To probe the prevalence of evolutionary contingency in human H3N2 NA, we constructed 70 single mutants of A/Hong Kong/1968 (HK68) NA, each representing an amino-acid mutation from HK68 to A/Victoria/361/2011 (Vic11) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The fitness effects of these HK68 NA mutants were then measured by a virus rescue experiment (Fig. 1a). Eight out of the 70 (11%) mutants had at least two-log drop in titer compared to the wild type (WT), indicating the presence of evolutionary contingency. Except H155Y, which located at the protomer interface, the other seven mutations were all far away from the protomer interface and were solvent exposed (Fig. 1b). For our downstream experiments, we focused on two mutations with the most extreme phenotypes, namely N336H and N387K, both of which did not yield any detectable titer in the virus rescue experiment. These mutational fitness effects were unlikely due to the difference in HA, as replacing HK68 HA with Vic11 HA did not affect the WT virus titer (Supplementary Fig. 2a).Fig. 1: Virus rescue experiments of natural mutations.a The amino acid sequences of HK68 NA and Vic11 NA differed by 70 amino acid substitutions. These 70 mutations were individually introduced into HK68 NA. Their replication fitness was examined by a virus rescue experiment. Virus titer was measured by 50% cell culture infectious dose (TCID50). Each bar represents the mean of two independent biological replicates. Each datapoint represents one biological replicate. b The locations of the eight mutations that showed at least two-log decrease in virus titer compared to the wild type (WT) are shown as spheres on one protomer of NA that is in white cartoon representation, while the other three protomers are shown as semitransparent black surface (PDB 3TIA)21. Sialic acid in the active site is shown as yellow sticks. Locations of the two mutations that did not yield any detectable titer, namely N336H and N387K, are in orange. The other six mutations are in blue. c, d Fitness effects of c N387K and d N/Y336H on different strains were examined by a virus rescue experiment. While the WTs of HK68 and Bil69 had an Asn at residue 336, the WTs of Bil71, Alb76, Bk79, Bei89, and SD93 had a Tyr at residue 336. Virus titer was measured by TCID50. Each bar represents the mean of three independent biological replicates. Each datapoint represents one biological replicate. The green dashed line represents the lower detection limit.

While N387K was neutral in Wy03, it attenuated Mos99 and reduced the virus titer of Bk79, Bei89, and SD93 to below the detection limit (Fig. 1c). This observation indicates that the permissive mutations for N387K emerged between 1993 and 2003. Similarly, our result implies that the permissive mutations for N336H emerged between 1969 and 1971, since mutating residue 336 to His was neutral in Bil71 and Alb76 but reduced the virus titer of Bil69 to below the detection limit (Fig. 1d). Consistently, mutating NA residue 336 to His was neutral in the authentic H3N2 A/Udorn/1972, whereas N387K did not yield any detectable titer (Supplementary Fig. 2b).K385N is a permissive mutation for N387KNext, we aimed to identify the permissive mutations for N387K. Since N387K decreased the titer of Mos99 by around two-log but was neutral in Wy03, we postulated that the difference in the NA sequences between Mos99 and Wy03 should include at least one permissive mutation for N387K. The NA head domains of Mos99 and Wy03 differed by five mutations (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1b). One of these mutations, K385N (Lys in Mos99 and Asn in Wy03), was adjacent to N387K. In fact, the double mutant K385N/N387K in Mos99 yielded a WT-like titer (Fig. 2b), demonstrating that K385N was a permissive mutation for N387K. Of note, K385N alone was neutral to the Mos99 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, mutating residue 385 to Asn could not restore the fitness of N387K in earlier strains, including HK68, Bk79, Bei89, and SD93 (Fig. 2b), suggesting that additional permissive mutations were required for the natural emergence of N387K.Fig. 2: Permissive mutations for NA N387K in Mos99 and SD93.a Locations of natural mutations from Mos99 to Wy03 are shown as blue spheres on one protomer of NA that is in white cartoon representation, while the other three protomers are shown as semitransparent black surface (PDB 3TIA)21. Location of N387K is shown as an orange sphere. Sialic acid in the active site is shown as yellow sticks. b The compensatory effects of mutating residue 385 to Asn in different chimeric H3N2 strains were examined by a virus rescue experiment. c Locations of natural mutations from SD93 to Mos99 are shown as blue or white spheres on one protomer of NA that is in white cartoon representation, while the other three protomers are shown as semitransparent black surface (PDB 3TIA)21. Blue spheres represent the mutations that were included in the SD93 combinatorial mutant library. d High-throughput identification of permissive mutations for N387K in SD93.

Each datapoint represents one biological replicate. Virus titer was measured by TCID50. The green dashed line represents the lower detection limit. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageMapping additional permissive mutations for N387KAlthough N387K decreased the fitness of Mos99, it reduced the titer of SD93 to below the detection limit (Fig. 1c). As a result, the difference in the NA sequences between SD93 and Mos99 should include additional permissive mutations for N387K. The NA head domains of SD93 and Mos99 differed by 18 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Since multiple mutations may be required simultaneously to restore the fitness of N387K in SD93, we decided to use a high-throughput approach that coupled combinatorial mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing9,16,17 to identify permissive mutations for N387K. Briefly, we constructed a mutant library for SD93 that contained all possible combinations of 10 mutations (n = 210 = 1024 variants), namely E248G, R249K, I265T, Y336H, R338L, N339D, K344E, S346G, E369K, and G381E (Fig. 2c), in the genetic background of N387K. Those 10 mutations were selected based on their distances to N387K in the protein structure and the primary sequence. The viral mutant library was then rescued and passaged once in MDCK-SIAT1 cells, which could minimize the emergence of cell-adaptive mutation19.Mutations E248G, R249K, Y336N, K344E, and E369K were enriched among variants with a frequency of >0.1% in the post-passaged mutant libraries of both biological replicates (Fig. 2d), suggesting that they could restore the fitness of N387K in SD93. Of note, Y336N was not included in the construction of the mutant library, and hence was a de novo mutation that emerged during viral passaging. Interestingly, Y336N represented a reversion to the ancestral stains, including HK68 and Bil69 (Supplementary Figs. 1a and 1d). While the fitness of each mutant in a mutant library could typically be estimated from its frequency change between the input mutant library and the post-passaged mutant library (i.e., frequency enrichment)16, the absence of Y336N in the input mutant library prevented the use of frequency enrichment for fitness measurement.To validate the findings from our high-throughput screening, we performed a series of virus rescue experiments with individually constructed SD93 mutants (Fig. 2e). The pentamutant E248G/R249K/Y336N/K344E/E369K was indeed able to partially restore the virus titer of N387K. The virus titer of E248G/R249K/Y336N/K344E/E369K/N387K could be further increased by the addition of K385N. Of note, in the absence of N387K, these mutation combinations had a higher virus replication fitness than the WT (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In addition, there seemed to be a synergistic effect among these permissive mutations because none of E248G/R249K, Y336N, K344E, E369K, and K385N alone could restore the virus titer of N387K to a detectable level (Fig. 2b and e). As mentioned above, Y336N represented a reversion in the natural evolution of human H3N2 NA (e.g., reverting from Bil71 to Bil69, Supplementary Fig. 1d). In contrast, Y336H was the forward mutation in the natural evolution of human H3N2 NA (e.g., mutating from SD93 to Mos99, Supplementary Fig. 1c). Since both Y336N and Y336H enabled SD93 to mutate away from Tyr at residue 336, we also tested whether Y336H could act as a permissive mutation for N387K. However, both Y336H alone and the pentamutant E248G/R249K/Y336H/K344E/E369K could not restore the fitness of N387K (Fig. 2e). Nonetheless, although K385N could not restore the virus titer of N387K in the background of WT SD93 (Fig. 2b), it could partially do so in the background of E248G/R249K/Y336H/K344E/E369K (see mutant 9 in Fig. 2e). This observation shows that the combination of E248G/R249K/Y336H/K344E/E369K potentiates the ability of K385N to compensate the fitness defect of N387K. Together, our results demonstrate the complexity of epistatic networks that led to the natural emergence of N387K in human H3N2 NA.N356D is a permissive mutation for N336HBesides N387K, N336H was another highly deleterious mutation in earlier strains (Fig. 1d), and yet emerged during the evolution of human H3N2 NA. Mutations between the NA head domains of Bil69 and Bil71 were identified as candidate permissive mutations for N336H (Supplementary Fig. 1d), since these two strains had drastically different compatibility with His336 (Fig. 1d). We focused on eight mutations that were spatially proximal to residue 336, namely R249K, D286G, I302V, M307V, D329N, K334S, N356D, and L370S (Fig. 3a). To identify which of these eight mutations were permissive mutations for N336H, we used the same high-throughput approach that was described above. Our Bil69 mutant library contained all possible combinations of the eight mutations of interest (n = 28 = 256 variants), in the background of N336H. Among variants that were enriched by at least 2-fold in the post-passaged mutant libraries of both biological replicates, N356D was highly conserved (Fig. 3b). Our virus rescue experiment further validated that N356D was a permissive mutation for N336H and was neutral when being introduced alone (Fig. 3c). While N336H represented a mutation from HK68 to Vic11, Bil71 had a Tyr at residue 336 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Same as N336H, N336Y also reduced the titer of Bil69 to below the detection limit and the addition of N356D could restore it to the WT level (Fig. 3c). These results show that N356D is a permissive mutation for the natural evolution of residue 336, which in turn participates in a more extensive epistatic network that involves N387K (Fig. 2d and e).Fig. 3: Permissive mutations for NA N336Y in Bil69.a Locations of natural substitutions from Bil69 to Bil71 are shown as blue spheres on one protomer of NA that is in white cartoon representation, while the other three protomers are shown as semitransparent black surface (PDB 3TIA)21. The location of N336Y is shown as an orange sphere. Sialic acid in the active site is shown as yellow sticks. b High-throughput identification of permissive mutations for N336Y in Bil69.

Each bar represents the mean of three independent biological replicates. Each datapoint represents one biological replicate. Virus titer was measured by TCID50. The green dashed line represents the lower detection limit. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageEnzymatic activities of H3N2 NA mutantsTo understand the mechanisms of epistasis that involved N336H/Y and N387K, we first measured the NA activity on the surface of cells that were transiently transfected with different NA mutants. N387K drastically reduced the cell surface NA activity of Mos99 and SD93 (Fig. 4a, b), whereas both N336H and N336Y abolished the cell surface NA activity of Bil69 (Fig. 4c). The reduced cell surface NA activity of N387K in Mos99 and SD93 could be partially restored by K385N and E248G/R249K/Y336N/K344E/E369K, respectively (Fig. 4a, b). Similarly, the reduced cell surface NA activity of N336H and N336Y in Bil69 could be fully restored by N356D (Fig. 4c). Therefore, the cell surface NA activity of different mutants was largely consistent with their effects on virus replication fitness (Figs. 2b, e and 3c).Fig. 4: Functional characterization of different NA mutants.a–c Relative cell surface NA activity of a Mos99 mutants, b SD93 mutants, and c Bil69 mutants. d–f Relative NA activity of recombinant proteins of d Mos99 mutants, e SD93 mutants, and f Bil69 mutants. Each bar represents the mean of three independent biological replicates. Each datapoint represents one biological replicate. Relative NA activity of the mutants was normalized to that of their corresponding WT. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageWe further measured the NA activity of different mutants using recombinant proteins (Fig. 4d–f). While the NA activity of recombinant proteins showed an overall similar pattern as cell surface NA activity, there were two notable differences. First, although N387K almost completely abolished the cell surface NA activity of Mos99, it still retained around 40% NA activity as a recombinant protein. Similarly, although N336H and N336Y completely abolished the cell surface NA activity of Bil69, they still retained around 75% and 40% NA activity, respectively, as recombinant proteins. These results indicate that protein enzymatic activity can only partly explain the epistasis among natural mutations in human H3N2 NA.N387K lowers the membrane trafficking efficiency of NASince a high cell surface NA activity would require efficient membrane trafficking of NA, we hypothesized that membrane trafficking also played a role in the epistasis among NA mutations. Flow cytometry analysis showed that N387K decreased the cell surface expression of Mos99 NA, while the addition of K385N restored it (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Microscopy analysis further illustrated that the correlation between the signals of Calnexin, which is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) maker, and NA was higher in N387K (r = 0.84) than WT (r = 0.43) and K385N/N387K (r = 0.67), indicating that N387K increased the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of Mos99 NA (Fig. 5b). In contrast, none of Mos99 NA WT, N387K, and K385N/N387K displayed strong Golgi localization (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 4b). These results demonstrate that membrane trafficking efficiency also contributes to the epistasis in the evolution of human H3N2 NA.Fig. 5: Cell surface protein expression and intracellular localization of NA Mos99 mutants.a Cell surface expression of HA-tagged Mos99 mutants was analyzed by flow cytometry. b Confocal microscopy result of HA-tagged Mos99 mutants. Blue (DAPI), Green (Calnexin, ER), Magenta (NA). The orange box highlights the zoomed in region. Scale bar for the large image is 5 µm and for zoomed in image is 2 µm. Below each micrograph is a cytofluorogram, in which each datapoint represents a pixel. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the green intensity (Calenxin, ER) and magenta intensity (NA) across all pixels in each image is indicated. The result of a representative experiment out of two independent replicates is shown.Full size imageSpecific epistasis due to non-additive effects on protein stabilityTo dissect the biophysical basis of epistasis, we quantified the protein stability of different NA mutants by measuring their melting temperatures (Tm) using thermal shift assay. Our results showed that N387K reduced the Tm of Mos99 NA and SD93 NA by around 5 °C (Fig. 6a). The destabilizing effect of N387K could be partially compensated by K385N. However, K385N alone was not stabilizing, suggesting that the epistasis between K385N and N387K was specific. These results suggest that the defect of N387K in trafficking and enzymatic activity can be attributed to the decrease in protein stability.Fig. 6: Structure and stability of H3N2 neuraminidase.a The effects of different Mos99, SD93, and Bil69 NA mutants on protein melting temperature (Tm) were measured by thermal shift assay. Each bar represents the mean of six independent biological replicates. Each datapoint represents one biological replicate. Jittering was added to avoid overlap of datapoints. b The locations of the residues of interest on Mos99 NA are shown. c–e The local structure around residue 387 of Mos99 NA (white) is compared with that of c Bil69 NA (gray) and SD93 NA (wheat), d H3N2 A/Perth/16/2009 (Perth09) NA (pink, PDB 6BR5)22, and e H3N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010 (Tan10) NA (blue, PDB 4GZO)23. f Natural occurrence frequencies of the amino acid variants that have a natural occurrence at >50% in any given year at the residues of interest are shown. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageIn contrast to N387K, N336H did not reduce the Tm of Bil69 NA. However, the first differential curve of the thermal shift assay for Bil69 N336H had an atypical shape (Supplementary Fig. 6). Similarly, the first differential curve for Bil69 N336Y showed two peaks. These results indicate the presence of multiple oligomeric states, hence protein aggregates20. The shapes of their first differential curves returned to WT-like when N356D was introduced. As a result, the biophysical basis of epistasis between K385N and N387K is different from that between N336H/Y and N356D.To further examine the structural mechanism of epistasis between K385N and N387K, we determined the crystal structure of NAs from Bil69, SD93, and Mos99 to 1.54 Å, 1.65 Å, and 1.40 Å, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Of note, the structure of SD93 NA was determined in complex with zanamivir. Asn387 in Mos99 NA is sandwiched by two positively charged residues, Lys385 and Lys389 (Fig. 6b). Consequently, the positively charged mutation N387K would result in an unfavorable electrostatic interaction with Lys385 and Lys389, which explains the destabilizing effect of N387K in Mos99 NA. The backbone conformation of the loop that contains residues 385 to 389 is highly conserved between NAs from Bil69, SD93, and Mos99 (Fig. 6c)21. However, the backbone of this loop has a ~3 Å shift in the NAs of more recent human H3N2 strains, namely A/Perth/16/2009 (Perth09) and A/Tanzania/205/2010 (Tan10) (Fig. 6d, e)22,23. This shift can be explained by the double mutant N387K/K385N, which is naturally present in Perth09 NA and Tan10 NA. K385N alone is unlikely to cause a change in backbone conformation, since Bil69 NA and Mos99 NA carry different amino acids at residue 385 and yet have the same backbone conformation in this region. Nevertheless, K385N removes a positively charged side chain, which enables Lys387 to adapt a different backbone conformation and point away from Lys389 to minimize unfavorable electrostatic interaction. Therefore, our structural analysis explains why K385N is a permissive mutation for N387K and exemplifies how specific epistasis in the natural evolution of human H3N2 NA modulates its structural conformation.Natural relevance of the epistatic networkAt the end, we analyzed the natural evolution of residues in the epistatic network (Fig. 6f). One immediate observation was that N336Y and N387K arose shortly after the emergence of their corresponding permissive mutations. Specifically, N336Y emerged and reached a high occurrence frequency (31%) in 1971, which was only one year after its permissive mutation N356D reached fixation in 1970. Similarly, the occurrence frequency of N387K increased from 3% to 76% during the 2006–2007 influenza season, shortly after its permissive mutation K385N reached fixation in 2005. We also noticed that mutation K369T emerged in 2009–2010 influenza season, which was within 2 years after the fixation of N387K. N387K added a positively charged residue on the NA surface, whereas K369T did the opposite. As a result, it is possible that N387K promoted the emergence of K369T due to charge balancing9.Several residues in the epistatic network are within or immediately adjacent to known antigenic regions. For example, residues 336 and 369 are at antigenic regions I and III24,25, respectively, whereas residues 248 and 249 are immediately adjacent to a recently identified epitope26. Moreover, mutations at residue 344, which locates at antigenic region II, can lead to antibody escape24,27. These observations substantiate the involvement of epistasis in NA antigenic drift, which corroborates with our recent study on a seven-residue antigenic region that contains residues 344 and 3699.DiscussionEpistatic interaction between mutations is a key determinant of adaptability and evolutionary trajectory13,15,28. Through a systematic analysis, this study described the prevalence of epistasis in the evolution of human H3N2 NA and identified an extensive epistatic network that contains residues 248, 249, 336, 344, 356, 369, 385, 387. In-depth characterization of the epistatic network further revealed the underlying mechanisms. The complexity of epistasis in human H3N2 NA evolution is demonstrated by the number of mutations in the epistatic network, their widespread locations on the protein, as well as the diverse biophysical mechanisms.Our recent study shows that charge balancing gives rise to epistasis in the antigenic evolution of NA9. Such result is highly parallel to the specific epistasis between K385N and N387K in the present study, which is governed by non-additive stability effect due to electrostatic interaction. Nevertheless, the epistasis between N336H/Y and N356D has a clearly different mechanism from that between K385N and N387K. Furthermore, wild-type strains with very different NA stability can have similar virus replication fitness (Figs. 1c and 6a), suggesting that protein stability is only one of the biophysical determinants of NA for virus replication fitness. As a result, the biophysical constraints of NA evolution and antigenic drift remain to be fully comprehended.An interesting observation in this study is that while SD93 NA K385N/N387K mutant has a WT-like thermostability, which indicates proper folding of the protomer, its enzymatic activity is minimal. Since tetramerization of NA is required for enzymatic activity8,29, it is possible that the head domain of the SD93 NA K385N/N387K mutant failed to form a proper tetramer, despite all recombinant NA proteins in this study being fused to a tetramerization domain and purified as a tetramer by size exclusion chromatography. Consistently, our preliminary analysis on SD93 NA using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy indicates that the conformations of N387K and K385N/N387K are different from WT and the two mutants with WT-like enzymatic activity (Supplementary Fig. 7). Because the surface loop that contains residues 385 and 387 is distal from the tetramerization interface, future studies are needed to explore whether mutations on the NA surface can modulate the tetramerization process through long-range interaction.Understanding the biophysical constraints of NA evolution not only provides mechanistic insights into influenza antigenic drift, but also facilitates next-generation immunogen design. Development of NA-based immunogens has largely focused on the tetramerization domain30,31,32. In contrast, immunogen designs for other viruses, such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2, mainly focus on introducing mutations to the antigen to increase its stability and expression yield33,34,35,36,37. The feasibility of incorporating stabilizing mutations into NA-based immunogen design is demonstrated by a mutation in the center of an N9 NA that improves tetramerization38. As NA is an emerging target for the development of a universal influenza vaccine7,39,40, knowledge of the sequence-structure-function relationship for NA is becoming more important than ever.MethodsVirus rescue experimentsExcept A/Udorn/1972 (Udorn72), all H3N2 viruses in this study were generated using the influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) eight-plasmid reverse genetics system41. Chimeric 6:2 reassortments were employed with six internal segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from A/WSN/33. For HA, the ectodomain was from HK68, whereas the non-coding region, N-terminal secretion signal, C-terminal transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail were from A/WSN/3316. For NA, the entire coding region was from the H3N2 strain of interest, whereas the non-coding region of NA was from A/WSN/3316. Transfection was performed in a co-culture of HEK 293T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells (ratio of 6:1) at 60% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cell culture medium was replaced with OPTI-MEM medium supplemented with 0.8 μg mL−1 TPCK-trypsin. Virus was harvested at 72 h post-transfection. To measure virus titer by TCID50 assay, MDCK-SIAT1 cells were washed with PBS before the addition of virus in OPTI-MEM medium supplemented with 0.8 μg mL−1 TPCK-trypsin.For the rescue of the authentic Udorn72, a 12-plasmid reverse genetics system was used. The Udorn72 reverse genetics plasmids were gifts from Kanta Subbarao (Doherty Institute). The Udorn72 HA segment-encoding plasmids used were found to have the following mutations: A81G (N18D), C129T (H34Y), G1103T (silent), T1486A (F486Y), and A1614G (N529D) relative to the Udorn72 HA reference sequence (GenBank: AX350190). The Udorn72 NA segment-encoding plasmids used were found to have the following mutations: G992A (A325P) and C1216G (D399E) relative to the Udorn72 NA reference sequence (GenBank: CY009638). Viruses were rescued by transfecting HEK 293T cells using JetPrime (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with viral growth medium (MEM, 1 mM HEPES, 1 μg mL−1 of TPCK-trypsin, and 50 μg mL−1 of gentamicin) containing 2 × 105 MDCK cells. Transfection supernatants were collected at 24 h after medium change. Transfection supernatants were titered by plaque assay in MDCK cells.Construction of the SD93 NA combinatorial mutant libraryThe SD93 NA-encoding plasmid from the influenza eight plasmid reverse genetics system was used as the template for insert and vector PCRs. Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 2. To generate the insert, two independent PCRs were performed. The first PCR used SD93lib-I265T-F and SD93lib-336-346-5mut-R as primers. The second PCR used SD93lib-336-346-5mut-F and SD93lib-E369K-R as primers. The products of these two PCRs were mixed and used as templates for an overlapping PCR with SD93lib-E248G-R249K-F and SD93lib-G381E-R as primers. The product of the overlapping PCR was the complete insert. To generate the vector, SD93lib-N387K-VF and SD93lib-VR were used as primers. All PCRs were performed using PrimeSTAR Max polymerase (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR products were purified using Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs). Both the vector and the complete insert were digested by BsmBI (New England Biolabs) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The ligated product was transformed into MegaX DH10B T1R cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At least half million colonies were collected. The plasmid mutant library was purified from the bacteria colonies using PureLink HiPure Expi Plasmid Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Construction of the Bil69 NA combinatorial mutant libraryThe Bil69 NA-encoding plasmid from the influenza eight plasmid reverse genetics system was used as the template for insert and vector PCRs. Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3. To generate the insert, three independent PCRs were performed. The first PCR (PCR #1) used Bil69lib-R249K-F and Bil69lib-D286G-R as primers. The second PCR (PCR #2) used Bil69lib-I302V-M307V-F as the forward primer and a mixture of Bil69lib-D329N-K334S-1-R and Bil69lib-D329N-K334S-2-R at equal molar ratio as the reverse primer. The third PCR (PCR #3) used a mixture of Bil69lib-D329N-K334S-1-F and Bil69lib-D329N-K334S-2-F at equal molar ratio as the forward primer, and Bil69lib-N356D-R as the reverse primer. The product of PCR #1 was used as a template for another PCR (PCR #4) using Bil69lib-R249K-F and Bil69lib-I302V-M307V-R as primers. The products of PCRs #2, #3, and #4 were mixed and used as templates for an overlapping PCR with Bil69lib-R249K-F and Bil69lib-L370S-R as primers. The product of the overlapping PCR was the complete insert. To generate the vector, Bil69lib-VF and Bil69lib-VR were used as primers. All PCRs were performed using PrimeSTAR Max polymerase (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR products were purified using Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs). Both the vector and the complete insert were digested by BsmBI (New England Biolabs) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The ligated product was transformed into MegaX DH10B T1R cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At least half million colonies were collected. The plasmid mutant library was purified from the bacteria colonies using PureLink HiPure Expi Plasmid Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Characterizing the fitness of individual variants in the mutant librariesVirus mutant libraries were rescued in a co-culture of HEK 293T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells (ratio of 6:1) at 60% confluence in a T75 flask (75 cm2) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and cell culture medium was replaced with OPTI-MEM medium supplemented with 0.8 μg mL−1 TPCK-trypsin. Virus mutant libraries were harvested at 72 h post-transfection. Virus mutant libraries were titered by TCID50 assay using MDCK-SIAT1 cells and stored at −80 °C until used. To passage the virus mutant libraries, MDCK-SIAT1 cells in a T75 flask were washed twice with PBS and infected with half of the virus stock in OPTI-MEM medium supplemented with 0.8 μg mL−1 TPCK-trypsin. At 2 h post-infection, infected cells were washed twice with PBS and fresh OPTI-MEM medium supplemented with 0.8 μg mL−1 TPCK-trypsin was added to the cells. At 24 h post-infection, supernatant was harvested. Each replicate was transfected and passaged independently. Viral RNA was then extracted from the supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The plasmid mutant libraries and the cDNA from the post-infection viral mutant libraries were amplified by PCR to add part of the adapter sequence required for Illumina sequencing. For SD93 mutant library, SD93lib-recover-F and SD93lib-recover-R were used as primers (Supplementary Table 2). For Bil69 mutant library, Bil69lib-recover-F and Bil69lib-recover-R were used as primers (Supplementary Table 3). A second PCR was carried out to add the rest of the adapter sequence and index to the amplicon using primers: 5′-AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC ACT CTT TCC CTA CAC GAC GCT-3′ and 5′-CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT XXX XXX GTG ACT GGA GTT CAG ACG TGT GCT-3′. Positions annotated by an “X” represented the nucleotides for the index sequence. The final PCR products were submitted for the next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq PE250.Sequencing data analysisSequencing data were obtained in FASTQ format. Forward and reverse reads were merged by PEAR42. Using the SeqIO module in BioPython43, primer sequences were trimmed from the merged reads. If the length of a given trimmed read did not match with that of the reference nucleotide sequence, the read would be discarded. The trimmed reads were then translated to amino acid sequences. Amino acid mutations were called by comparing the translated reads to the translated reference sequence. For Bil69 mutant library, frequency of mutant \(i\) in sample \(s\) was computed for each replicate as follows:$${{{{{{{\rm{frequency}}}}}}}}_{i,s}=\,\frac{{{{{{{{\rm{read}}}}}}}\,{{{{{{\rm{count}}}}}}}}_{\,i,s}\,+\,1}{\mathop{\sum}\limits_{k\,\in \,s}{{{{{{{\rm{read}}}}}}}\,{{{{{{\rm{count}}}}}}}}_{\,k,s}}$$ (1) A pseudocount of 1 was added to the read counts to avoid division by zero in subsequent steps. Subsequently, the enrichment of mutant \(i\) was computed for each replicate as follows:$${{{{{{{\rm{enrichment}}}}}}}}_{i}=\,\frac{{{{{{{{\rm{frequency}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{post}}}}}}}-{{{{{{\rm{passaged}}}}}}}\,{{{{{{\rm{library}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\rm{frequency}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{plasmid}}}}}}}\,{{{{{{\rm{mutant}}}}}}}\,{{{{{{\rm{library}}}}}}}}}$$ (2) Bil69 mutants with a read count of less than 10 in the plasmid mutant library were discarded. For SD93 mutant library, the frequency of each mutant was calculated without the addition of pseudocount.Protein expression and purificationThe NA head domains, which contained residues 82 to 469, were fused to an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide, 6\(\times\)His-tag, a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) tetramerization domain, and a thrombin cleavage site. Recombinant bacmid DNA that carried the NA ectodomain from the strain of interest was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Baculovirus was generated by transfecting the purified bacmid DNA into adherent Sf9 cells using Cellfectin reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The baculovirus was further amplified by passaging in adherent Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Recombinant NA head domains were expressed by infecting 1 L of suspension Sf9 cells at an MOI of 1. On day 3 post-infection, Sf9 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 \(\times\) g for 25 min, and soluble recombinant NA was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using Ni Sepharose excel resin (Cytiva) and then size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/100 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Cytiva) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl2. For crystallography, recombinant NA was further digested by thrombin (MilliporeSigma) for three weeks in 4 °C using 15 U thrombin per mg of recombinant NA. The thrombin-digested recombinant NA was incubated with TALON metal affinity resin (Takara) for 2 h. The thrombin-digested recombinant NA in the flow-through and 10 mM imidazole wash was purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/100 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Cytiva) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl2.Cell surface NA activity assayNA from the strain of interest was cloned into the phCMV3 vector. phCMV3-NA was transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 200 μL PBS. Cells were then mixed with 800 μM fluorogenic substrate methylumbelliferyl-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) (MilliporeSigma) in PBS that contained 33 mM MES pH 6.5 and 4.0 mM CaCl2. The sample was then transferred to a 96-well half area plate (Corning). NA enzymatic kinetics at 37 °C were measured by a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with an excitation at 365 nm and an emission at 450 nm. Fluorescence was recorded for 50 min at 30 s interval. NA activity was quantified by the rate of increase in fluorescence signal. Background signal, which was determined by untransfected cells, was subtracted. NA activity was normalized to the cell concentration, which was determined by a Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Recombinant NA activity assayIn a 96-well half area plate (Corning), 2.5 ng of recombinant NA was incubated with 100 μM MUNANA in PBS that contained 33 mM MES pH 6.5 and 4 mM CaCl2. NA enzymatic kinetics at 37 °C were measured by a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with an excitation at 365 nm and an emission at 450 nm. Fluorescence was recorded for 30 min at 30 s interval. NA activity was quantified by the rate of increase in fluorescence signal. Background signal, which was determined in the absence of recombinant NA, was subtracted.Flow cytometry analysis of NA expression4 \(\times\) 105 HEK 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of phCMV3 plasmids encoding the C-terminal HA-tagged NA from the strain of interest using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, medium was discarded, and cells were washed once with PBS. Cells were subsequently detached with versene (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended in fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS) buffer (50 mM EDTA, 2% v/v FBS in DMEM with high glucose and HEPES, without phenol red). Cells were then pelleted via centrifugation at 300 \(\times\) g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was aspirated. In the subsequent steps, cells and all reagents were kept on ice.For surface staining, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL FACS buffer. Cells were incubated with 1 μg mL−1 PE anti-HA.11 (BioLegend, catalog #: 901518) at 4 °C with rocking for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were pelleted via centrifugation at 300 \(\times\) g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was aspirated. Cells were washed with 1 mL FACS buffer, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 mL FACS buffer before flow cytometry analysis.For intracellular staining, cell pellets were fixed in 300 μL of 1% v/v paraformaldehyde (in PBS) and incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 30 min. Cells were pelleted, washed with 1 mL FACS buffer, permeabilized in 300 μL of 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 (in PBS) and incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 30 min. Cells were pelleted, washed with 1 mL FACS buffer and incubated with 1 μg mL−1 PE anti-HA.11 (BioLegend, catalog #: 901518) at 4 °C with rocking for 1 h. Then, cells were pelleted, washed with 1 mL FACS buffer, and resuspended in 1 mL FACS buffer before flow cytometry analysis.For flow cytometry analysis, cells were analyzed using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with a 488 nm laser and a 585/40 bandpass filter. Data were collected using Accuri C6 software. 104 singlets were collected for each sample. Data were analyzed using FCS Express 6 software (De Novo Software).Confocal microscopy7.5 \(\times\) 104 HeLa cells were seeded on 12 mm #1.5 glass cover slips in 24-well plates and grown overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Then, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, medium was discarded and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with ice-cold 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 20 min at 4 °C and subsequently washed with PBS. Cells were blocked with 5% v/v normal donkey serum (in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibody, namely mouse anti-HA tag (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog #: 26183) 1:500, rabbit anti-calnexin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog #: PA5-34754) 1:500, or rabbit anti-GM130 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog #: 11308-1-AP) 1:200, and then washed with PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody, namely Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, catalog #: ab150073) 1:200 or Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog #: A-31570) 1:500, as well as DAPI (to a final concentration of 1 μg ml−1), and then washed with PBS. All primary antibodies, secondary antibodies, and DAPI were diluted in 5% v/v normal donkey serum (Abcam). Cover slips were mounted on slides with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sealed with nail polish.Images were captured on an LSM 700 microscope and a Plan Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil DIC objective using Zen software (Zeiss). Excitation laser lines 405 nm, 488 nm, and 555 nm were used for acquiring images stained with DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 555, respectively. Individual channels of each image were linearly adjusted using Zen software. Transfected cells were manually outlined as regions of interest in Fiji. Cytofluorogram data and Pearson correlation coefficients of transfected cells were calculated with fluorescence intensity thresholds automatically adjusted using the JACoP plug-in44.Thermal shift assay5 µg protein was mixed with 5\(\times\) SYPRO orange (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl2 at a final volume of 25 µL. The sample mixture was then transferred into an optically-clear PCR tube (VWR). SYPRO orange fluorescence data in relative fluorescence unit (RFU) was collected from 10 °C to 95 °C using a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The temperature corresponding to the lowest point of the first derivative −d(RFU)/dT was determined to be the Tm.Crystallization and structural determinationCrystallization screening was performed using the JCSG Core Suites I-IV (Rigaku) with thrombin-digested NA at 7 mg mL−1. Sitting drop for crystallization screening was set up by equal volume of precipitant and protein solution using the Crystal Gryphon (Art Robbins Instruments). Crystallization screens were incubated at 18 °C. Initial hits were further optimized using the sitting drop method at 18 °C, with 350 µL reservoir solution and 1:1 ratio of precipitant and protein solution. The crystallization conditions were as follows:Mos99 WT: 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M acetate pH 4.6SD93 WT + zanamivir: 8% PEG-8000, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5Bil69 WT: 10% PEG-6000, 5% MPD, 0.1 M HEPES pH 6.5Crystals were soaked in precipitant solution containing the cryoprotectant prior to vitrification in liquid nitrogen. The cryoprotectants were as follows:Mos99 WT: 15% ethylene glycolSD93 WT + zanamivir: 25% PEG 200Bil69 WT: 20% ethylene glycolData were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory via the Life Science Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) at beamlines 21-ID-D, 21-ID-G, and 21-ID-F. Initial diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using autoPROC45. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser-MR included in the Phenix suite46, using PDB 2AEP as the replacement model47. The structures were further refined using REFMAC548 and were manually built in COOT49. Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MolProbity50.Fluorescent emission spectroscopyThe steady-state tryptophan emission spectra were measured using a fluorometer (FP8300, JASCO). Samples for the emission spectra measurements were prepared by diluting the protein stock in SEC buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2) to an OD280 = 0.32 as measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-1800, Shimadzu). The Trp residues in the protein samples were excited at 295 nm and the emission spectra were collected from 290 to 450 nm with 2.5 nm bandwidths. The emission spectra data were then normalized to a range of 0 to 1 and plotted for analysis.Statistics and reproducibilityNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. All observations reported in this manuscript were made in at least two independent experiments, typically with biological triplicates. No data were excluded from the analyses. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Get more newsLiveonOct. 24, 2022, 9:43 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsAn unseasonal early surge of respiratory viruses among babies and toddlers has caught doctors off guard and worried about the coming months. Pediatricians and children's hospitals were prepared for a bad flu season. They were not ready for a multitude of viruses to come all at once and earlier than expected."There is no one virus that's causing pediatric respiratory viruses this fall," said Dr. Deanna Behrens, a pediatric critical care physician at Advocate Children's Hospital in suburban Chicago. "Unfortunately, it's all of them."Babies and preschool-aged children are coming down with the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in ways never before imagined, Behrens and other infectious diseases experts said."We see kids where, when we do the nasal swab, not only do they test positive for influenza, but they may have RSV or enterovirus or adenovirus at the same time," said Dr. Mark Kline, the physician-in-chief at Children's Hospital New Orleans. "We've seen kids where we've gotten two or three viruses at once." A third of hospitalizations for the flu are in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NBC News in a statement. A third of those hospitalizations are in kids under age 5.Babies and toddlers are most at risk for severe respiratory illness. Their tiny airways and infantile immune systems have trouble clearing the buildup of mucus that comes with colds and other respiratory illnesses. The CDC data come from FluSurv-NET, which covers counties in 14 states, representing about 9% of the U.S. population.The flu is spreading at an especially high rate in Georgia, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, D.C., according to the latest flu report from the CDC. Of the children hospitalized for flu, 80%, according to FluSurv-NET, are in Georgia. As of Oct. 15, "influenza-like illness," which includes the flu, was increasing across the Southeast and in New York.CDCWhile RSV is inundating many children's hospitals, the number of pediatric flu cases is also increasing. "We've seen numbers doubling on a weekly basis," said Dr. Sarah Combs, an emergency medicine physician at Children's National in Washington, D.C. Why are RSV, other viruses on the rise? Viruses thrive in populations that have never experienced them. It's why small children are most vulnerable now to respiratory viruses. When the pandemic hit in 2020, those children were mostly home for their first few years of life, cocooned from viruses that, in general, strengthen their infantile immune systems. When they weren't exposed, they were left vulnerable. "What we lacked is a couple of years of little kids developing the immunity that's needed to keep these colds at bay," said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. "We may be in for a rough six or seven weeks with influenza and RSV."Indeed, "reduced population immunity to circulating respiratory illnesses, particularly among young children who may never have had exposure or been vaccinated, could bring about a robust return of flu and other respiratory viruses, like RSV," Lynnette Brammer, team lead of the Domestic Influenza Surveillance Team at the CDC, wrote in an email.The viruses are also popping up earlier than what would normally be expected. Even though the flu typically peaks between December and February, cases are rising steadily, especially in the Southeast. "I don't know that we're all quite emotionally ready for RSV and flu season," Creech said. "We knew this was going to be a half-marathon style of a race. Now it looks like it may be even longer. Maybe it's a whole marathon."The fast, severe rise in pediatric cases is contributing to pressure on hospitals. In 17 states, pediatric hospital bed occupancy is at 80% or greater, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. Nationwide, nearly 75% of the country's estimated 40,000 pediatric beds are full — months before their anticipated winter peak. Most kids with the flu, Kline said, have typical symptoms: fever, sore throat, cough, body aches and fatigue. But the fact that kids are testing positive for multiple respiratory viruses at once can blur the signs of any one virus. RSV can cause symptoms similar to the flu. Indeed, RSV "has hit earlier and harder," said Dr. Sarah Combs, an emergency medicine physician at Children's National in Washington, D.C. Combs said her staff is in the midst of a surge in RSV cases."We normally expect to see that in the November-December time frame," she said. In addition to RSV, Combs expects the number of pediatric flu illnesses to double in the coming weeks. In 2021, Children's National treated eight flu cases in kids between July and October. In 2022 so far, Combs and her colleagues have treated 80 such children. It's a tenfold increase over last year. The early surge in pediatric viral illness has caught many clinicians "off guard," said Callie Dobbins, a nurse and facility executive at Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina."We just stabilized from the pandemic, and now we're engulfed with children who need us," she said. Other viruses, too, are affecting children. Creech said his team continues to see croup, which is caused by parainfluenza virus. And just last month, the CDC issued an advisory about a particular type of enterovirus, called EV-D68."Our enterovirus numbers are not ideal right now. They're still very high," Creech said. Although it primarily causes acute respiratory illness, EV-D68 has been associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare polio-like condition that can cause limb weakness and other problems within the nervous system.It's flu, however, that's most concerning for pediatricians, for now, at least. "What we're planning for is a more severe flu season, specifically for children," Dobbins said, "We expect this challenge that we're experiencing now to continue through flu season."Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoAAFP releases clinical guidance sheet, resources to help PCPs prep for flu season News News CME CME Clinical Guidance Clinical Guidance Community Community Account Account Anonymous User Log In Log In Log Out Log Out News News CME CME Clinical Guidance Clinical Guidance Community Community Specialties Choose a specialty All Specialties Allergy/Asthma Cardiology Dermatology Endocrinology Gastroenterology Hematology/Oncology Hepatology Infectious Disease Nephrology Neurology Ophthalmology Optometry Orthopedics Pediatrics Primary Care Psychiatry Pulmonology Rheumatology Women's Health & OB/GYN Home Headline News Meeting News Podcasts Blogs & Columns Job Opportunities Resources Menu Close Specialties All Specialties Allergy/Asthma Cardiology Dermatology Endocrinology Gastroenterology Hematology/Oncology Hepatology Infectious Disease Nephrology Neurology Ophthalmology Optometry Orthopedics Pediatrics Primary Care Psychiatry Pulmonology Rheumatology Women's Health & OB/GYN Home Headline News Primary Care Subspecialties Addiction Adolescent Medicine Allergy/Asthma Alternative Medicine Cardiology Critical Care Dermatology Diabetes Gastroenterology Geriatric Medicine Gynecology/Obstetrics Hospice and Palliative Care Hospital Medicine Infection Control Infectious Diseases Men's Health Nephrology Neurology Nutrition and Fitness Obesity Oncology Ophthalmology Pain Management Pediatrics Pharmacology Practice Management Preventive Medicine Psychiatry Pulmonology Respiratory Medicine Rheumatology Sleep Medicine Sports Medicine Vaccination Women’s Health Meeting News Podcasts Blogs & Columns Job Opportunities Resources Account Account Log In Log In Log Out Log Out Account Account Anonymous User Close Searchbar Healio News Primary Care Infectious Diseases ByEmma Bascom Fact checked byShenaz Bagha Read more October 26, 2022 2 min read Save AAFP releases clinical guidance sheet, resources to help PCPs prep for flu season ByEmma Bascom Fact checked byShenaz Bagha Add topic to email alerts Receive an email when new articles are posted on Please provide your email address to receive an email when new articles are posted on .

Back to Healio The American Academy of Family Physicians has released new, free resources to help primary care physicians navigate the upcoming influenza season. The resources — a clinical guidance sheet, COVID-19 and influenza patient action plan and medical history form for patients aged 65 years and older — aim to prepare physicians for the combination of COVID-19 and a influenza season that is projected to be severe. The AAFP has released new, free resources to help primary care physicians navigate the upcoming influenza season. Source: Adobe Stock “Nearly every family physician is likely to care for patients exposed to or ill with the flu or COVID, and we know that older adults are among those that face higher rates of severe complications and death from these diseases,” Julie Wood, MD, MPH, the AAFP’s senior vice president for Research, Science and Health of the Public, said in a press release. The clinical guidance sheet, which can be found here, is broken down into three sections: vaccinating patients, diagnosing and testing patients and treating patients. Vaccinating patients, according to the release, comes with “detailed recommendations” for influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, advice on co-administering the vaccines and more. It also encourages primary care providers “to strongly recommend all eligible recommended vaccinations during routine or preventive office visits.” The section on diagnosing and testing patients provides information on influenza and COVID-19 symptoms, discusses infection prevention and control measures, addresses the use of telehealth for certain patients and reminds physicians that patients can be infected with both influenza and COVID-19 at the same time, “and that testing for both viruses is needed to exclude one or the other.” The treatment section offers resources on antiviral medications and clinical considerations for outpatient COVID-19 treatment. Rounding out the guidance sheet are the patient action plan and medical history form, which are both designed for older patients. “Family physicians are well positioned to provide care for older adults in many different settings,” Wood said in the release. “Our goal is primary prevention with vaccines and other preventive measures, but it is also important for the patient or their caregiver to be aware of testing and treatment options, ideally before they become ill. The new guidance documents the AAFP has developed facilitate family physicians getting those action plans in place for their practices and patients.” Earlier this year, Healio launched a COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy discussion guide, which includes clear and accurate answers to common questions concerning the COVID-19 vaccines that are authorized in the U.S. Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Press Release Disclosures: Wood is senior vice president for Research, Science and Health of the Public at AAFP.

Influenza, or flu, is a serious respiratory illness that can easily spread when someone infected coughs or sneezes. It can affect anyone, though children younger than 5 and children with asthma or certain chronic health conditions may be at higher risk of developing serious complications. Among flu-related pediatric deaths, around 80% were in children not fully vaccinated against flu. This is why it is so important for children 6 months and older to get vaccinated each year.“As we bring down protections that were in place during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as masking and social distancing, and we head into winter, it is imperative that every child gets a flu shot,” said American Lung Association National Volunteer Spokesperson Dr. Juanita Mora. “We have to remember that flu infects millions and kills 35,000-45,000 people each year. It is projected that we will have one of the worst flu seasons in the last 3 years. I highly encourage parents to prioritize having their healthcare provider give their children the flu vaccination this, and every year.”As cold and flu season is upon us, community spread of infectious respiratory diseases continue to increase. We’ve already begun to see influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases on the rise. The single most effective thing you can do for your child to help them avoid the flu is to have them vaccinated every year. While it doesn’t guarantee your child won’t get the flu, vaccination also helps reduce how sick your child feels and how long they remain ill.Does my child need a flu shot every year?Yes. The past two flu seasons we’ve seen historically low rates of flu circulating in the United States. This likely has led to low population immunity and some of the youngest children will likely be exposed to influenza viruses for the first time. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, so flu vaccines may be updated every year to match the most common Influenza A and Influenza B strains. In addition, vaccination protection from your flu shot declines over time. A yearly flu shot is needed for the best available protection. “A 2022 study showed the flu shot reduced children’s risk of life-threatening influenza by 75%. All the more reason to get your children protected,” Dr. Mora said.When should my child get the flu shot?“The best time to get the flu shot is now!” Most doctors agree that the earlier in the season, the more likely you are to have complete protection before the winter comes and community spread becomes more prevalent.Some children 6 months through 8 years old will need two doses of flu vaccine. This applies to:Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated against flu for the first timeChildren in this age group who have previously only received one dose of flu vaccineThe two-dose series should be given 4 weeks apart. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider to determine if your child needs two doses.What are the side effects?The most common side effects from the flu shot are muscle pain or soreness, soreness at the injection site, or fever. However, all these symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours. If you have any concerns, talk to your healthcare provider.Do we need both the COVID-19 and flu shot?Yes. The flu and COVID-19 are different diseases, so you need both vaccines to be protected from each one. Both children and adults can safely get the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot at the same time, and they should. Getting the flu shot will not counteract the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.Talk to your healthcare provider about keeping or bringing your children up to date with their vaccinations.

Tresca Updated on October 23, 2022 Medically reviewed by Shadi Hamdeh, MD Print Close People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be at an increased risk for complications from the flu (influenza). That's because IBD affects the immune system, and medications used to treat IBD—like Humira—weaken the immune system. For many people, the flu is a manageable illness, but for people who are immunocompromised, it can be serious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), deaths from the flu vary widely every year because of the variation in flu seasons. Since 1976, flu death totals in the US have ranged from 3,000 and 49,000 a year. Most of the fatalities are people over the age of 65. Blend Images / Getty Images Complications From the Flu The flu can lead to complications, which can be life threatening. Common complications from the flu can include: Bronchitis: Bronchitis is an infection of the bronchial tubes (airway) that can cause a cough, wheezing and fatigue. It may go away on its own in a few weeks, but it might also need treatment to resolve, especially if it's caused by a bacteria that can be treated with antibiotics. Ear infections: An infection inside the ear, which is also called otitis media, can occur as a complication of the flu. Some of the symptoms include fever, ear pain, and dizziness or balance problems. Pneumonia: Pneumonia is a lung infection that can occur after a cold or the flu. It can cause pain when breathing, cough with sputum, and fever. Pneumonia can be especially dangerous for the very young and the very old. Sinus infections (sinusitis): The sinuses, which are located around the eyes, can commonly become infected along with the flu or after the flu. Sinusitis can cause a headache or facial pain, fever, and sinus congestion. A sinus infection may need treatment, or it may resolve on its own. IBD Drugs That Are Immunosuppressants Because IBD is an immune-mediated condition, medications that suppress the immune system are sometimes given as a treatment. This is thought to keep the inflammation from IBD in check. However, this also means that the body is less able to fight off infections, such as those that are caused by bacteria or viruses, including the flu (which is a virus). Immunosuppressive drugs are commonly used to treat IBD, and people taking these types of medications are considered to be at higher risk for developing complications from the flu. There are a few categories of medications for IBD that may have immunosuppressant effects; immunomodulators, steroids, biologics, and small molecules. Some immunomodulator drugs include: Imuran (azathioprine)Neoral, Sandimmune (cyclosporine)Purinethol, 6-MP (mercaptopurine)MethotrexatePrograf (tacrolimus) Some corticosteroid medications include: Prednisone Some biologics include: Humira (adalimumab) Remicade (infliximab) Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) Simponi (golimumab) Entyvio (vedolizumab) Stelara (ustekinumab) Tysabri (natalizumab) Some small molecules include: Xeljanz (tofacitinib)Zeposia (ozanimod)Rinvoq (upadacitinib) When to Get a Flu Shot Since the timing of the onset, peak, and end of flu season changes from year to year and cannot be predicted, it is difficult to pinpoint the best time for getting vaccinated. For people taking medications that suppress the immune system, the optimum time to receive a flu shot is from October to mid-November. Flu shots are generally available in early September. The flu shot should be scheduled well before the flu season starts because it can take one to two weeks for the shot to take effect. Flu activity usually peaks between December and February, with some activity as late as May. Therefore, you can have your vaccination later, if necessary, because receiving a shot late is better than not getting one at all. IBD drugs should not prevent someone with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis from getting the flu shot. Differences Between Shot and Nasal Vaccine The inactivated flu shot contains dead viruses and will not give the recipient the flu. The nasal-spray flu vaccine is a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) that contains a live, weakened flu virus. The virus can potentially make a person sick with the flu. People taking immunosuppressive drugs should get the flu shot, LAIV is not recommended for anyone who has a chronic disease, including IBD., or for people taking immunosuppressive medications. Is the Flu Shot a Live Virus? What to Know About the Flu Shot A Word From Verywell A flu shot is an important part of care for anyone who has IBD. Getting vaccinated helps protect against the flu and related complications. While it's never "too late" to get a flu shot, it's recommended that vaccination take place starting in October. The flu season spikes at different times across the country, and while it is somewhat predictable, it's best to get vaccinated early to have the best possible chance of avoiding the flu. 2 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Photograph: David Davies/PAInfectious diseases This article is more than 2 years oldImmune system-evading hybrid virus observed for first time This article is more than 2 years oldResearchers found the RSV and influenza viruses fused together to form a new type of virus pathogenLinda Geddes Science correspondentMon 24 Oct 2022 16.55 BSTLast modified on Mon 24 Oct 2022 20.49 BSTShareTwo common respiratory viruses can fuse to form a hybrid virus capable of evading the human immune system, and infecting lung cells – the first time such viral cooperation has ever been observed.Researchers believe the findings could help to explain why co-infections can lead to significantly worse disease for some patients, including hard-to-treat viral pneumonia.Each year, about 5 million people around the world are hospitalised with influenza A, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children under five years old, and can cause severe illness in some children and older adults.Although co-infections – where a person is infected with both viruses at the same time – are thought to be relatively common, it was unclear how these viruses would respond if they found themselves inside the same cell.“Respiratory viruses exist as part of a community of many viruses that all target the same region of the body, like an ecological niche,” said Dr Joanne Haney from the MRC-University of Glasgow centre for virus research, who led the study.“We need to understand how these infections occur within the context of one another to gain a fuller picture of the biology of each individual virus.”Autumn Covid numbers peak at lower levels – but flu cases are on the upRead moreTo investigate, Haney and her colleagues deliberately infected human lung cells with both viruses and found that, rather than competing with one another as some other viruses are known to do, they fused together to form a palm tree-shaped hybrid virus – with RSV forming the trunk, and influenza the leaves.“This kind of hybrid virus has never been described before,” said Prof Pablo Murcia, who supervised the research, published in Nature Microbiology. “We are talking about viruses from two completely different families combining together with the genomes and the external proteins of both viruses. It is a new type of virus pathogen.”Once formed, the hybrid virus was also able to infect neighbouring cells – even in the presence of antibodies against influenza that would usually block infection. Although the antibodies still stuck to influenza proteins on the hybrid virus’s surface, the virus merely used neighbouring RSV proteins to infect lung cells instead. Murcia said: “Influenza is using hybrid viral particles as a Trojan horse.”As well as helping the viruses evade the immune system, joining forces may also enable them to access a wider range of lung cells. Whereas influenza usually infects cells in the nose, throat and windpipe, RSV tends to prefer windpipe and lung cells – although there is some overlap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although he cautioned that more research was needed to prove that hybrid viruses are implicated in human disease. “RSV tends to go lower down into the lung than the seasonal flu virus, and you’re more likely to get more severe disease the further down the infection goes,” he said.“It is another reason to avoid getting infected with multiple viruses, because this [hybridisation] is likely to happen all the more if we don’t take precautions to protect our health.”Significantly, the team showed that the hybrid viruses could infect cultured layers of cells, as well as individual respiratory cells. “This is important because the cells are stuck to one another in an authentic way, and the virus particles will have to go in and out in the right way,” said Griffin.The next step is to confirm whether hybrid viruses can form in patients with co-infections, and if so, which ones. “We need to know if this happens only with influenza and RSV, or does it extend to other virus combinations as well,” said Murcia. “My guess is that it does. And, I would hypothesise that it extends to animal [viruses] as well. This is just the start of what I think will be a long journey, of hopefully very interesting discoveries.”Explore more on these topicsInfectious diseasesFluMedical researchMicrobiologyBiologyHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBotanists vote to remove racist reference from plants’ scientific names20 Jul 2024Digested week: my child’s flu has plunged us into a full Ayckbourn farce9 Dec 2022Forensic spray using jellyfish protein could speed up fingerprint detection3 Mar 2024Race to control ‘tripledemic’ as cases of RSV in children sweep US and Europe9 Dec 2022Flu and other viruses pile pressure on NHS as waiting lists hit new high8 Dec 2022Humans can tell by chickens’ calls if they are happy or frustrated, research finds3 Jan 2024‘A mega-mechanism for bonding’: why singing together does us good15 Dec 2023Health experts in conundrum over best way to avoid winter ‘tripledemic’ 7 Dec 2022Germany faces ‘catastrophic’ paediatric bed shortage as RSV cases soar1 Dec 2022‘Wobbly spacetime’ may help resolve contradictory physics theories 4 Dec 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldUS elections 2024UKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Armstrong Roberts/Classicstock/Getty ImagesDylan Scott is a senior correspondent and editor for Vox’s Future Perfect, covering global health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.It’s not just you or your kids: Cold and flu season is off to a particularly nasty start across the United States.With the country stepping down from the pandemic footing of the past few years, the various viruses that cause coughs, runny noses, and sore throats are now on the rebound. Cases of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory bug that can occasionally turn serious for infants and older adults, had been held down in 2020 and 2021 because people were wearing masks and taking other precautions to avoid Covid-19. But almost all official pandemic policies have lapsed, most Americans have returned to some or all of their pre-pandemic activities, and immunity to other common viruses may have waned after two years of largely avoiding them.That has brought RSV in particular roaring back; the flu is showing signs of an early surge as well. In 2020, the United States as a whole was reporting just a handful of confirmed RSV cases in late October; in 2021, about 400. In 2022, the official number is about 600. Those numbers are much lower than the actual number of cases, because an RSV diagnosis is not typically confirmed via a laboratory test. But they show a clear trend.Flu is also off to a fast start, particularly in the South. The percentage of outpatient visits that are for respiratory illness, one of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s measures of flu activity, is already well above where it was at this time in the past five years. Doctors on the ground also say that they are seeing meaningfully more cases of RSV, flu, and other similar pathogens (such as adenoviruses, parainfluenza, croup, etc.) than they typically would this early in the cold-weather season.For hospitals that have spent the past two years struggling to maintain capacity in the face of surging Covid-19 cases, this year has not brought any relief. The opposite, in fact.“We are very busy,” Kristina Bryant, an epidemiologist at Norton Children’s Hospital in Louisville, told me. “It’s different this year. ... It’s not even Halloween, and many children’s hospitals are operating at or above capacity.”CDCBryant’s hospital is already contemplating spilling over into beds in the adult hospital across the street, which is connected by a pedestrian walkway. She said she’s spoken to peers in other hospitals that have already put their emergency command structures into place. Connecticut Children’s Hospital in Hartford has reportedly held talks with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Guard about setting up a tent outside their building for overflow beds.Some experts in infectious diseases have even adopted a moniker for the conflation of influenza, RSV, and Covid-19 that is already threatening hospital capacity in some parts of the United States: the “tri-demic.”“We used to worry about a twin-demic. Now some people are worried about a tri-demic: influenza, Covid, and RSV,” William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told me. “Although we worried about this in the past few seasons, people are really anticipating this may be the one where these viruses really gang up on us and together may strain the health care system.”The next few months are expected to be rough, with different viruses becoming dominant at different times. Hospitals may continue to be stretched thin. The severity of any winter Covid-19 surge and the possibility of a second wave of flu later in the season are two X-factors that will dictate how bad the situation ultimately becomes.But the experts I spoke to offered a small glimmer of hope: This is — probably — not the new normal. The US is suffering a shock after the past two years. The population is more vulnerable to various respiratory illnesses now, but it won’t stay that vulnerable forever. People will get sick and develop immunity, and that will put constraints back on these viruses.Several of them said they expected a year, maybe two, of such unusual early and severe cold-and-flu seasons, followed by a return to relative normal. That progress could be sped along by the development of pan-coronavirus and RSV vaccines.“I anticipate that as people get infected with these things again, it will settle down to what was around before the Covid pandemic,” said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee.Why RSV and influenza are surging unusually early this yearCovid-19 has thrown the viral ecosystem out of whack. Other viruses have been behaving strangely for the past few years. Bryant said her hospital saw an unusual amount of enterovirus d68, which generally causes cold-like symptoms but in rare cases can lead to limb weakness similar to polio, over the summer.RSV usually shows up in midwinter, but the hospital also saw an early, ferocious spike in RSV cases in August and now, she said, their case volume is substantially higher than they have seen in years.“Before the pandemic, we could predict when we were going to have RSV cases,” said Bryant, who also works on infectious disease issues for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “What has happened this year is it’s come early. ... The pandemic has created disruptions in previously pretty predictable seasonal patterns.”RSV generally starts as a runny nose or a cough. For a small number of children, it may develop into pneumonia or bronchitis, which can require hospitalization. As with Covid, which is also typically milder in children, the sheer number of infections means hospitals can be overwhelmed even if only a small share of those cases require kids to be admitted to the hospital.The flu also started about a month earlier than usual, Schaffner said, particularly in the southern United States. It’s been following the pattern seen in the Southern Hemisphere this summer (which is winter in that part of the world), when countries including Australia and Chile saw early and busy flu seasons.So what explains the early surge? From a biological perspective, these viruses are finding more susceptible hosts in the population. The reasons flu and RSV typically thrive in the winter are that the humidity is lower, temperatures are down, and people are more likely to crowd together indoors.After the past two years, people have less robust immunity, or perhaps no immunity at all, making it easier for the virus to spread outside of those ideal conditions.Every child will catch RSV multiple times, most before they turn 2, and eventually build up immunity to it. But the problem right now is a lot of kids, even 3- or 4-year-olds, have no existing immunity after two years of mitigation measures and are getting infected for the first time.“The virus has an even more abundant playing field in which to work,” Schaffner told me. “There are many more susceptible [people] that this virus can infect for the first or second time and cause illness.”Kids especially play a critical role in the spread of disease — as Schaffner said, “Children are thought to have the distribution franchise for the influenza virus.”First, they spread it among themselves. And, because once infected they shed much more virus than adults and for a longer period of time, they are very efficient at spreading the virus to other people they encounter.“They become vectors. They become little transmitters. They come home and give it to their parents, grandparents, Aunt Suzi, the neighbors,” Schaffner said. “With kids in school, with people traveling, visiting friends and relatives, doing that with enthusiasm, returning to a new normal activity, it’s setting us up for the spread of these respiratory viruses.”Meanwhile, we are still awaiting the expected Covid-19 winter surge. Case numbers appear to be in a bit of a lull right now — though the rise of at-home testing makes official data much more difficult to follow — but given the pattern of the past two years, experts expect an increase before long. It shouldn’t get as bad as it did in 2020 or 2021, Schaffner said. But it will still add strain to the health system.Why a “tri-demic” will — hopefully — not be the new normalSo the next few months may be rough. A second surge of flu activity in the new year, if another strain emerges and becomes dominant, would make it worse. But the lingering question is whether this is a short-term shock to the system after the pandemic or the start of a new normal.The unpredictability of the past two years should disabuse us of being too confident about the future. But the experts I spoke to thought that the former was more likely. This cold-and-flu season will be nasty. Next year may be as well. But, eventually, these viruses will start to settle into their old pattern.“I’ve been thinking of this as a transition year, back to the new normal. Or maybe a transitional two years,” Schaffner said. “The viruses are working their way back to a more normal activity.”As more people get infected and build their immunity back up (or up for the first time, in the case of kids), the viruses will find it harder to spread outside of their usual sweet spot when the weather is cold and people stay inside, Webby said. We saw the same life cycle with H1N1 during and after the 2009 outbreak. At first, that virus would emerge at unusual times outside of flu season. But after a couple of years, as people gained immunity, it became more predictable.“It forces the virus to survive only in its sweet spot for transmission, which happens to be winter,” Webby said.New vaccines could also help soften the burden of RSV in the future. The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline released clinical trial results recently showing a large reduction in severe disease for older adults who were given an RSV vaccine that the company has developed. Development of an RSV vaccine for children had been stagnant, but a recent uptick in R&D signals a possibility of progress in the coming years.We already have effective vaccines for flu and Covid-19, too. They substantially reduce the likelihood of severe illness and death. The challenge is getting people to take them. Few Americans have gotten the new omicron-targeted Covid-19 vaccine, and people’s intentions about getting the flu vaccine have also been lagging.“We’re concerned the population is so Covid and vaccine fatigued that it’s not taking advantage of these vaccines,” Schaffner said. “I think there are still many people who say ‘I’ve had enough of this.’ The interventions we have are at the moment not being optimally utilized.”Biology should help make cold and flu season in the years to come more tolerable. We also have the tools to lighten the burden even more — not only the vaccines, but washing hands, wearing masks, staying home when sick — if only we avail ourselves of them.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Armstrong Roberts/Classicstock/Getty ImagesDylan Scott is a senior correspondent and editor for Vox’s Future Perfect, covering global health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.It’s not just you or your kids: Cold and flu season is off to a particularly nasty start across the United States.With the country stepping down from the pandemic footing of the past few years, the various viruses that cause coughs, runny noses, and sore throats are now on the rebound. Cases of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory bug that can occasionally turn serious for infants and older adults, had been held down in 2020 and 2021 because people were wearing masks and taking other precautions to avoid Covid-19. But almost all official pandemic policies have lapsed, most Americans have returned to some or all of their pre-pandemic activities, and immunity to other common viruses may have waned after two years of largely avoiding them.That has brought RSV in particular roaring back; the flu is showing signs of an early surge as well. In 2020, the United States as a whole was reporting just a handful of confirmed RSV cases in late October; in 2021, about 400. In 2022, the official number is about 600. Those numbers are much lower than the actual number of cases, because an RSV diagnosis is not typically confirmed via a laboratory test. But they show a clear trend.Flu is also off to a fast start, particularly in the South. The percentage of outpatient visits that are for respiratory illness, one of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s measures of flu activity, is already well above where it was at this time in the past five years. Doctors on the ground also say that they are seeing meaningfully more cases of RSV, flu, and other similar pathogens (such as adenoviruses, parainfluenza, croup, etc.) than they typically would this early in the cold-weather season.For hospitals that have spent the past two years struggling to maintain capacity in the face of surging Covid-19 cases, this year has not brought any relief. The opposite, in fact.“We are very busy,” Kristina Bryant, an epidemiologist at Norton Children’s Hospital in Louisville, told me. “It’s different this year. ... It’s not even Halloween, and many children’s hospitals are operating at or above capacity.”CDCBryant’s hospital is already contemplating spilling over into beds in the adult hospital across the street, which is connected by a pedestrian walkway. She said she’s spoken to peers in other hospitals that have already put their emergency command structures into place. Connecticut Children’s Hospital in Hartford has reportedly held talks with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Guard about setting up a tent outside their building for overflow beds.Some experts in infectious diseases have even adopted a moniker for the conflation of influenza, RSV, and Covid-19 that is already threatening hospital capacity in some parts of the United States: the “tri-demic.”“We used to worry about a twin-demic.

Getting your flu shot can also keep you from having to visit a hospital, which keep nurses and doctors available to care for patients with other illnesses. There are a couple of things you can do to avoid getting sick, like washing your hands. If you're not sure how to wash your hands the right way (and there IS a right way), we've got some great handwashing tips! But one thing that can really help is getting your flu shot. But how exactly does the flu shot work? What is the flu shot? (Sasi Ponchaisang/123RF) The flu shot is a vaccine — that's a substance that helps to create an immunity to certain diseases and illnesses in people. Once you are immune to a disease, you can’t catch it. The flu shot is a vaccine that helps to prevent you from getting the influenza virus, which causes the flu. This is not the same virus that causes COVID-19, which there is a different vaccine for. These vaccines are given through a shot, which is a needle that injects the vaccine into your body, usually through your arm. How does the flu shot work? You are looking at a microscopic view of the influenza virus particle, or a "viron." (Cynthia Goldsmith/Wikimedia/Public Domain) The flu shot works by introducing your body to tiny little parts of different flu viruses. This triggers a reaction from your immune system — the processes in your body that fight off infection. Your immune system realizes these virus fragments shouldn’t be in your body, and figures out how to destroy them. In the process, it learns and remembers how to fight off viruses like this in the future. What if I get the flu virus again? You can usually get your flu shot at your local pharmacy. (© Spiderplay/Canva) Don't worry. If you’re exposed to that kind of virus again, your body already knows how to take care of it. It can destroy the virus before you actually get sick. This is how vaccines work. They give your body a virus or bacteria that is either dead or otherwise deactivated. That way, the virus or bacteria can’t actually get you sick, but your body can still recognize it and learn how to fight it. Can I still get sick after getting the flu shot? (© baona/Canva) It's possible. Every year, scientists develop a new flu shot. This is because the flu virus is constantly mutating — that means it changes all the time. That makes it impossible to know which strains are going to spread the most during any given flu season. Scientists make a vaccine using strains that they think are most likely to get people sick. But sometimes a strain they didn’t consider spreads more and people still get sick. I hear the flu shot doesn't work (© RODNAE Productions/Canva) It's complicated. The influenza virus isn’t the only virus that creates similar symptoms. You might get a flu shot and still get a common cold, which can feel a lot like the flu. Because of this, some people think the flu shot didn’t work, even though it did. It’s important to remember that no medicine is 100 per cent effective, 100 per cent of the time. That said, you’re much less likely to get the flu if you get the flu shot. Are there any side effects? (© SDI Productions/Canva) Just like with any medicine you take, the flu shot does have some potential side effects. Most of them are fairly minor like soreness around where you got the needle and some flu-like symptoms (yep, you can get flu symptoms from the flu shot). Although it might sound crazy, feeling a little flush actually means the vaccine is working! Those light symptoms are just your body figuring out how to deal with the virus. More serious side effects can include allergic reactions, but they are really rare. That said, if you experience an allergic reaction, call a doctor immediately. More cool posts!

Infants, children <2 years of age with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease, premature infants <35 weeks gestation at birth, children who have neuromuscular disorders, the elderly, immunocompromised persons, and adults with chronic heart or lung disease are at highest risk for severe RSV-related illness. In addition to RSV, rhinoviruses/enteroviruses continue to circulate at higher seasonal levels in the City. While influenza detections remain low in Philadelphia, states in the southeast and south-central US are currently experiencing high levels of influenza activity. In Philadelphia, influenza activity is expected to rapidly increase in the coming weeks. For seasonal influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance updates from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH), visit https://hip.phila.gov. Respiratory Virus Surveillance and Reporting: As part of respiratory virus surveillance activities in Philadelphia, healthcare providers or infection preventionists should report the following cases to PDPH by phone at 215-685-6741 or fax at 215-238-6947 using the newly consolidated severe respiratory virus case report form (https://hip.phila.gov/document/2993/SevereRespiratoryVirusCRF_FinalFillable_2223.pdf/). Hospitals may also submit reports electronically. Hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza or COVID-19 (including rapid antigen tests) Patients admitted to the ICU with laboratory-confirmed influenza, COVID-19, or other respiratory virus infections (RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, or enterovirus) Fatal cases of influenza, COVID-19, or other respiratory virus infections Institutional outbreaks of respiratory illness, including those occurring in long-term care facilities, schools, childcare centers, and shelters. Outbreaks are defined as 1 laboratory-confirmed case or ≥2 persons with influenza-like illness (temperature ≥100°F and cough and/or sore throat) in a facility. Suspect novel influenza A cases including detection of non-subtypeable influenza A virus or influenza-like illness without a known etiology and an exposure of concern (i.e., contact with swine, live poultry, etc.). Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections: Ensuring your patients receive influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine this season remains the optimal way to prevent complications from these respiratory virus infections. For prevention of severe RSV infections, select high-risk children <24 months may benefit from palivizumab, the RSV monoclonal antibody preparation given monthly during RSV season. Also advise patients to: Stay home from work, school, and childcare when sick with cold symptoms Cough or sneeze into a tissue or their upper sleeve Perform hand hygiene often with soap and warm water or alcohol-based hand rub Avoid close contact with people who are sick Disinfect commonly touched surfaces including doorknobs and toys Adhere to masking recommendations at healthcare facilities (staff, patients, and visitors) Encourage ill persons particularly infants and children to consume enough fluids to prevent dehydration Related Posts No results found.

They have been found to elicit enhanced, long-lived B cell responses. The basis for improved efficacy of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines remains unresolved, including whether recruitment of CD4 T cells specific for the ferritin component of these vaccines contributes to cognate help in the B cell response. Using influenza HA-ferritin nanoparticles as a prototype, we have performed an unbiased assessment of the CD4 T cell epitope composition of the ferritin particles relative to that contributed by influenza HA using mouse models that express distinct constellations of MHC class II molecules. The role that these CD4 T cells play in the B cell responses was assessed by quantifying follicular helper cells (TFH), germinal center (GC) B cells, and antibody secreting cells. When mice were immunized with equimolar quantities of soluble HA-trimers and HA-Fe nanoparticles, HA-nanoparticle immunized mice had an increased overall abundance of TFH that were found to be largely ferritin-specific. HA-nanoparticle immunized mice had an increased abundance of HA-specific isotype-switched GC B cells and HA-specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) relative to mice immunized with soluble HA-trimers. Further, there was a strong, positive correlation between CD4 TFH abundance and GC B cell abundance. Thus, availability of helper CD4 T cell epitopes may be a key additional mechanism that underlies the enhanced immunogenicity of ferritin-based HA-Fe-nanoparticle vaccines.

While administration of vaccines targeting HA is our best available current tool to prevent severe illness, effectiveness of conventional seasonal split and subunit multivalent influenza vaccines ranges between 10% to 60% according to CDC estimates8. New strategies in rational vaccine design aim to address limitations of current influenza vaccine approaches and include the addition of adjuvants, novel delivery methods, and recombinant protein-based vaccines to enhance broadly reactive immunity. Next-generation influenza vaccine development efforts focus on novel immunogens that can increase the breadth of immune reactivity to antigenically distinct viruses. A number of target immunogens have been explored, including HA stem9,10,11, neuraminidase12,13, and internal viral proteins14,15,16. Many next-generation influenza vaccine candidates are designed to engage both the humoral and cellular immune responses, resulting in enhanced durability and breadth of immunity17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.A recombinant HA vaccine platform has been developed that uses a sophisticated structure-based approach, consisting of 8 trimeric HA molecules on the surface of a self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle26. The nanoparticle core is comprised of the non-haem ferritin molecule from H. pylori, a 24-part self-assembling spherical nanoparticle. Immunization with these HA-Fe nanoparticles elicited 10-fold higher antibody titers than standard inactivated influenza vaccine formulations, and elicited antibodies targeting the conserved stem and receptor binding domain (RBD) regions of HA26. Further structure-based vaccine design yielded an HA stem-only influenza vaccine candidate that focused the antibody response on the conserved HA stem region and induced protective heterosubtypic humoral immunity in the context of a lethal avian influenza virus challenge11.Ferritin-based nanoparticle vaccines have demonstrated increased immunogenicity relative to soluble antigen in diverse infectious disease vaccines including HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and EBV, but the factors that underlie the enhanced immunogenicity of the ferritin-based vaccine constructs are incompletely understood27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Increased efficacy of nanoparticle vaccines relative to soluble antigens has been attributed to its multimeric state, allowing extensive immunoglobulin (Ig) crosslinking, enhanced antigen handling, and trafficking of nano-scale antigens to lymphoid tissues, with potent innate immune activation all culminating in enhanced formation of germinal centers35,36,37. While much attention has been paid to the B cell response and patterns of antigen handling following HA-nanoparticle immunization, the contribution of the CD4 T cell response to these vaccine responses remains largely uncharacterized. Given that elicitation of durable high-affinity antibody responses to HA are dependent on CD4 T cell help38,39,40,41,42,43 and that there is an increasing use of the ferritin core in the design of vaccine constructs for multimeric antigens, we reasoned that it was critical to determine antigen specificity and relative abundance of CD4 T cells that could potentiate vaccine responses using HA-Fe nanoparticles as a prototype.Here, we have studied this issue in a comprehensive manner, empirically and quantitatively examining the ferritin-specific CD4 T cell epitope composition using the HA-ferritin constructs in several inbred strains of mice expressing alternate MHC class II molecules, thus enabling a broad MHC class II-based epitope selection. We speculated that the contribution of CD4 T cells specific for the ferritin component of the HA-Fe nanoparticle fusion protein could play a deterministic role in the helper CD4 T cell repertoire available for cognate help to the B cell response to vaccination. When comparing the responses of the HA-Fe nanoparticle vaccine to trimerized HA vaccine, we found that the HA-Fe nanoparticle immunized mice had a dramatically increased overall abundance of TFH, most of which were ferritin-specific, and that the TFH response correlated with the abundance of GC B cells. These data suggest that differences in the availability of helper CD4 T cell epitopes may be a key element that underlies the enhanced immunogenicity of ferritin-based HA-nanoparticle vaccines.ResultsDefining the CD4 T cell immunodominance hierarchy to HA-Fe nanoparticle vaccines in pre-clinical mouse models of vaccinationPrevious studies11,26,44 in both animals and humans45,46, demonstrated that HA-Fe-nanoparticles elicit antibody responses of significantly enhanced breadth and magnitude relative to currently licensed inactivated influenza vaccines. However, the antigen specificity and magnitude of the CD4 T cell response to HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunization remains poorly understood. We sought to empirically determine the relative CD4 T cell immunodominance hierarchy of the ferritin vs. HA components of the HA-Fe-nanoparticles. To investigate the primary CD4 T cell response to HA-nanoparticle immunization, two mouse stains (BALB/c and CBA/J) were chosen based on their expression of 4 alternate MHC class II proteins of two distinct allelic forms of I-E and I-A, to recruit as diverse a CD4 T cell repertoire as possible. Mice were immunized once with HA-Fe-nanoparticle via a subcutaneous route in the presence of Sigma Adjuvant System® that elicits both IL-2 and IFNγ producing CD4 T cells47. CD4 T cell responses were quantified 10 days post immunization by peptide-stimulated cytokine ELISpot assays. To determine the epitope specificity of the CD4 T cell response at the level of single peptides, a peptide library of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 residues covering the sequence of H. pylori ferritin (Table 1) was used. To test CD4 T cell reactivity directed against HA, we tested an array of major peptide epitopes from A/New/Caledonia/99 HA that had been previously defined by overlapping peptide matrices spanning the full sequence of HA in mouse strains expressing different MHC class II haplotypes (Table 2)48,49,50,51,52.Table 1 MHC Class II-restricted H. pylori ferritin epitopes in H-2d, H-2K, HLA-DR1, and HLA-DR4 mice.Full size tableTable 2 MHC Class II-restricted A/New Caledonia/99 hemagglutinin epitopes in H-2d, H-2K, HLA-DR1, and HLA-DR4 mice.Full size tableThe relative CD4 T cell immunodominance hierarchy of ferritin and HA in these experiments was scored by using a cutoff of 25 spots per million CD4 T cells as a criterion to define reproducible CD4 T cell specificities, indicated by a horizontal dotted line in Fig. 1. In BALB/c mice, expressing the MHC class II molecules I-Ad and I-Ed, the elicited CD4 T cells exhibited a striking immunodominance bias for ferritin-derived peptides, as measured by IL-2 (Fig. 1A) and IFNγ ELISpot assays (Fig. 1B). When assessing IL-2 production in response to peptide stimulation, ferritin peptides FE49, FE53, FE101, and FE105 elicited robust responses of greater than 100 IL-2 spots per million CD4 T cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast only 4 of the 13 HA-derived peptides, HA120, HA126, HA180, and HA209, elicited a response of greater than 25 spots per million CD4 T cells (Fig. 1A). When assessing IFNγ production in HA-nanoparticle immunized mice, ferritin peptides FE49, FE53, FE101, and FE105 again elicited responses of several hundred IFNγ spots per million CD4 T cells (Fig. 1B). None of the HA peptides tested elicited responses greater than 25 spots (Fig. 1B). In CBA/J mice expressing the MHC class II molecules I-Ak and I-Ek, HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunization elicited a CD4 T cell response that was biased towards the ferritin nanoparticle core, with HA-derived peptides being sub-dominant as measured by IL-2 (Fig. 1C) and IFNγ ELISpot assays (Fig. 1D). CD4 T cells stimulated with ferritin peptides FE37, FE41, FE45, FE101, FE141, FE145, and FE149 each elicited robust responses (Fig. 1C). Of the 8 HA-derived peptides tested, only peptides HA120, HA304, HA358, and HA398 elicited responses of greater than 25 spots per million IL-2 producing CD4 T cells (Fig. 1C), similar to the immunodominance observed when IFNγ producing cells were quantified. Ferritin peptides FE37, FE41, and FE45 elicited responses of greater than 1000 spots per million CD4 T cells, and responses of greater than 25 spots per million for peptides FE101, FE141, FE145, and FE149 (Fig. 1D). None of the HA peptides elicited IFNγ responses of greater than 25 spots per million CD4 T cells (Fig. 1D).Fig. 1: Defining immunodominance of the CD4 T cell repertoire in BALB/c and CBA/J mice expressing diverse I-A and I-E alleles.Identification of immunodominant ferritin epitopes was performed by IL-2 and IFNγ cytokine ELISpot following immunization with full length HA-ferritin nanoparticles. Purified CD4 T cells were restimulated with peptides spanning the sequence of H. pylori ferritin and major HA peptides. Experiments were conducted in A, B BALB/C mice (MHC II I-Ad/Ed) and C, D CBA mice (MHC II I-Ak/Ek). The fraction of the cytokine-producing CD4 T cell response specific for ferritin (black) or HA (white) is shown for E BALB/c and F CBA/J mice, respectively. Data are shown as the mean and SD of two independent experiments of five pooled mice per group.Full size imageWhen assessing summed responses by antigen specificity, 85% of the IL-2 response and 98% of the IFNγ response in BALB/c mice were directed against ferritin-derived peptides (Fig. 1E). In contrast, only 15% of the IL-2 response and 2% of the IFNγ response in BALB/c mice were directed against HA (Fig. 1E). When the relative magnitudes of the responses were assessed for CBA/J mice, 88% of the IL-2 response and 99% of the IFNγ response were directed against ferritin-derived peptides (Fig. 1F), while only 12% of the IL-2 response and 1% of the IFNγ response were directed against HA (Fig. 1F). Given the nature of the overlapping peptide library used to define reactivity against H. pylori ferritin, it is possible that adjacent peptides tested by ELISpot represent a single peptide specificity. The peptides tested, listed in Table 1 and Table 2, were overlaid on the sequence of HA-Fe nanoparticles in Supplementary Fig. 1. For both BALB/c and CBA/J mice, regions of overlap between adjacent major peptides, potentially representative of the core binding motif, are underlined.To confirm that CD4 T cell reactivity to H. pylori ferritin was due to HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunization and not murine Helicobacter infection, splenocytes of naïve CBA/J mice were tested for reactivity to immunodominant ferritin peptides by cytokine ELISpot and compared to HA-nanoparticle immunized controls. Reactivity to ferritin peptides, as measured by IL-2 and IFNγ production, was only observed in HA-nanoparticle immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, all animals used in these studies were housed in a Helicobacter negative space where mice routinely tested negative for murine Helicobacter by PCR. Thus, the ferritin reactivity detected by ELISpot was due to elicitation of the CD4 T cells after the vaccination.Assessing HLA-DR restricted CD4 T cell responses to HA-nanoparticle vaccination and ferritin-specific CD4 T cell responses in healthy human donorsGiven the unexpected immunodominance of ferritin-specific CD4 T cells in two common laboratory mouse strains with distinct MHC class II molecules expressed, we next sought to determine the immunodominance hierarchies of ferritin and HA in the context of human MHC class II molecules. Transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR4, class II molecules commonly expressed in humans, were immunized with HA-Fe-nanoparticles, and CD4 T cell responses were assayed using cytokine ELISpot assays. Cells were stimulated with overlapping peptides spanning the sequence of H. pylori ferritin or previously defined major peptide epitopes from A/New/Caledonia/99 HA48. Even in HLA-DR1 transgenic mice, where we previously discovered an exceptionally high number of CD4 T cell epitopes in HA51, strong reactivity to ferritin-derived peptides was observed, where ferritin peptides FE1, FE5, and FE97 elicited readily detectable responses (Fig. 2A). Reactivity of CD4 T cells post vaccination was also observed against HA peptides HA162, HA203, and HA440 (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that ferritin maintains its CD4 T cell immunodominance even in the context of a robust HA-specific response in HLA-DR1 mice. In HLA-DR4 transgenic mice, robust CD4 T cell reactivity in the primary responses was observed in response to stimulation with ferritin peptides FE12, FE25, FE29, FE37-FE41, FE97-FE105, FE141, and FE149 (Fig. 2B). Responses to defined HA peptides HA203 and HA328 were modest (Fig. 2B) indicating that the HLA-DR4 restricted CD4 T cell response is highly biased towards ferritin. When ELISpot results were summed by antigen specificity across the murine MHC class II and the human MHC class II alleles sampled, a consistent pattern of ferritin-biased immunodominance is readily apparent (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2: Defining immunodominance of the CD4 T cell repertoire in human MHC-II haplotypes.Identification of immunodominant ferritin epitopes was performed by IL-2 cytokine ELISpot following immunization with full length HA-ferritin nanoparticles. Purified CD4 T cells were restimulated with peptides spanning the sequence of H. pylori ferritin and major HA peptides. Experiments were conducted in transgenic mouse models expressing A HLA-DR1 and B HLA-DR4 human MHC class II alleles. Data are shown as the mean and SEM of three independent experiments of five pooled mice per group. C Summed cytokine response by antigen specificity across murine and human MHC class II molecules used in Figs. 1 and 2. D PBMC from 36 healthy human donors with unknown history of H. pylori infection were stimulated with a peptide pool spanning the entire sequence of H. pylori ferritin and plated in IL-2 and IFNγ cytokine ELISpot. Information about human donors is presented in Table 3. Data are shown as the mean and SD of the subjects assayed.Full size imageWe then extended our analysis to sample healthy human donors that express a diverse array of HLA class II molecules. Because humans can be exposed to H. pylori antigens via infection53,54, we asked whether circulating CD4 T cells displayed detectable reactivity to ferritin-derived epitopes that could theoretically be called into the response to immunization with vaccine constructs containing H. pylori ferritin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from human donors (Table 3) with unknown exposure to Helicobacter were depleted of CD8 + cells and CD56 + cells, and PBMCs were stimulated with pooled ferritin peptides spanning the sequence of H. pylori ferritin in IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays (Tables 1 and 2). These experiments revealed that for both IL-2 and IFNγ, responses of greater than 25 spots per million depleted PBMC are detectable in approximately 15% of the human donors assayed (Fig. 2D). This reactivity to H. pylori ferritin, likely due to previous infection with Helicobacter, supports the hypothesis that a subset of human donors has H. pylori ferritin-specific CD4 T cells that have the potential to be recalled in response to immunization with ferritin-based vaccine constructs. We observed intra-donor variability in the relative production of IL-2 and IFNγ in response to ferritin epitopes. This may be due to heterogeneity in the responding CD4 T cell phenotypes, where H. pylori infection has been described to elicit Th1, Th17, and regulatory CD4 T cells53,54. These data suggest that both murine and diverse human MHC class II molecules select for and present H. pylori ferritin-derived peptides to ferritin-specific CD4 T cells.Table 3 Demographics and characteristics of subjects in study.Full size tableFerritin-specific CD4 T cells participate in the germinal center response to HA-nanoparticle immunizationIn the context of limiting CD4 T cell help, such as vaccination during the primary response lacking CD4 T cell helper memory cells or after vaccination with proteins with low abundance of CD4 T cell epitopes, we hypothesized that the direct linkage of ferritin to HA could contribute to anti-HA B cell responses. To test this hypothesis, BALB/c and CBA/J mice were immunized with HA-Fe-nanoparticles via a subcutaneous route, as before, and CD4 T cell and B cell responses were sampled 15 days post primary vaccination in the draining popliteal lymph node (LN). In these studies, we compared the responses to parallel vaccination of a separate cohort of mice with an early-generation vaccine construct consisting of an HA trimer stabilized with a fold-on domain55 that lacked the ferritin core. Post-vaccination, CD4 T cells were stimulated in IL-2 ELISpot assays with peptide pools spanning the complete sequence of HA or FE in order to broadly capture the responding cells. Robust cytokine producing cells were detected in response to stimulation with ferritin peptides in both BALB/c and CBA/J (Fig. 3A, B), in agreement with our earlier data. When the abundance of TFH (Supplementary Fig. 3A, defined as CD4+ CD44++ PD1++ CXCR5++) was assessed, HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunized mice had a significantly increased abundance of TFH per LN relative to HA-trimer immunized mice (Fig. 3C, D). BALB/c and CBA/J mice immunized with HA-FE-nanoparticles had 3.0 and 4.9-fold increases, respectively, in absolute TFH abundance relative to HA-trimer immunized mice (Fig. 3C, D). To determine the antigen-specificity of the TFH from the draining LN, cells were stimulated with HA or FE peptide pools and a non-cytokine dependent method to quantify the antigen-reactive CD4 T cells was utilized. Activation Induced Marker (AIM) assays that track upregulation of the markers CD154 (CD40L) and CD69 (Supplementary Fig. 3B) were used as readouts of antigen-dependent CD4 T cell activation56,57,58. These analyses revealed ferritin-specific TFH to be the most abundant subset in HA-nanoparticle immunized BALB/c and CBA/J mice (Fig. 3E, F). As a fraction of activated TFH detected by the AIM assay, ferritin-specific CD4 TFH represented 85% of the responding cells in BALB/c and 87% of responding cells in CBA/J (Fig. 3G-H). While activation of HA-specific TFH was detectable, the immunodominance of ferritin was maintained in the TFH repertoire (Fig. 3E–H). Given that non-TFH can also provide help to B cells through CD40L signals41,59, the specificity of the antigen-experienced CD44 high CD4 T cell repertoire was assessed. These studies indicated that the immunodominance of ferritin among CD44 high CD4 T cell is preserved both in terms of absolute abundance and fraction of the antigen-specific responses (Fig. 3I–L). Collectively, these data on CD4 T cell reactivity and specificity indicate that the immunodominance of ferritin is maintained among cytokine-producing cells (Fig. 1), CD4 TFH repertoire (Fig. 3C–H), and antigen-experienced CD4 T cells with the potential to upregulate the essential co-stimulatory molecule CD40L (Fig. 3I–L)60.Fig. 3: Ferritin-specific CD4 T cells participate in the germinal center response to HA-nanoparticle immunization.BALB/c and CBA/J mice were immunized with equimolar quantities of HA in the form of soluble HA trimers or HA-nanoparticles. Draining lymph nodes were harvested D15 post immunization. Antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses were quantified by IL-2 ELISpot for A BALB/c mice and B CBA/J mice following stimulation with total HA or total ferritin peptide pools. Absolute numbers of CD4 TFH per lymph node were quantified for C BALB/c and D CBA/J. Antigen specificity of the TFH response was quantified by activation induced marker (AIM) assay by scoring upregulation of CD154 and CD69 in response to peptide stimulation for E BALB/c and F CBA/J. The fraction of the AIM+ TFH specific for ferritin (black) or HA (white) is shown for G BALB/c and H CBA/J. Quantification of antigen experienced non-TFH that upregulate CD154 and CD69 in response to peptide stimulation for I BALB/c and J CBA/J. The fraction of the AIM+ antigen experienced CD4 T cell responses specific for ferritin (black) or HA (white) is shown for K BALB/c and L CBA/J. Data are shown as the mean and SD three individual mice per group from three independent experiments, for a total of 9 individual mice per group. In A, B, E, F, I, J, significant differences between HA-trimer and HA-nanoparticle immunized mice were determined by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. In C, D, significant differences between HA-trimer and HA-nanoparticle immunized mice were determined by unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.Full size imageGiven the dependence of germinal center formation on TFH, we hypothesized that if CD4 T cell help was in fact a limiting element in the B cell response, the HA-Fe-nanoparticle vaccinated mice would display an increased abundance of GC B cells relative to HA-trimer vaccinated mice. We found that in both BALB/c and CBA/J mice, the vaccine-draining LN of the HA-Fe-nanoparticle vaccinated mice had significantly increased overall abundance of GC B cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A, defined as B220+ FAS+ GL7+) relative to that exhibited by the HA-trimer vaccinated mice (Fig. 4A, B), which ranged from 2.8-fold in BALB/c and 4.6-fold in CBA/J mice. Linear regression analyses demonstrated the presence of a strong, positive correlation between the overall abundance of GC B cells and TFH. The slope of the regression line was significantly positive, suggesting that increased TFH recruitment contributes to enhanced GC B cell responses in both BALB/c and CBA/J mice (Fig. 4C, D).Fig. 4: HA-nanoparticle immunization elicits enhanced antigen-specific B cell responses that correlate strongly with abundance of TFH.Total abundance of FAS+ GL7+ germinal center B cells per lymph node was assessed in A BALB/c and B CBA/J mice immunized with equimolar quantities of HA in the form of soluble HA trimers or HA-nanoparticles from the same individual mice shown in Fig. 3. The relationship between germinal center B cell abundance and CD4 TFH abundance was assessed by linear regression analysis for C BALB/c and D CBA/J mice immunized with HA trimers or HA-nanoparticles. When cohorts vaccinated with HA-trimers and HA-Fe-nanoparticles are separately analyzed by linear regression analyses, the same trend is observed. Antigen-specific GC B cell responses were assessed by staining with fluorophore conjugated HA probes, where the B cell population of interest was defined as FAS+ GL7+ IgM- IgD- HA+ for E BALB/c and F CBA/J mice. HA-specific ASCs were assessed by B cell ELISpot. The frequency of HA-specific IgG isotype B cells was assessed for G BALB/c and H CBA/J mice. Data are shown as the mean of three individual mice per group from three independent experiments, for a total of 9 individual mice per group. In (A, B, E, F, G, H), significant differences between HA-trimer and HA-nanoparticle immunized mice were determined by unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.Full size imageIn order to address the issue of antigen specificity in the GC B cells, fluorescently labelled full-length HA probes were used to detect HA-specific B cells55 (Fig. 4E, F). HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunized BALB/c and CBA/J mice have significantly increased overall abundance of HA-specific germinal center B cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A, defined as B220+ FAS+ GL7+ HA-probe+) relative to the HA-trimer immunized cohort (Fig. 4E, F). Increased HA-specific germinal center B cell abundance ranged from 3.7-fold in BALB/c and 3.8-fold in CBA/J (Fig. 4E, F). Finally, we assessed the ASC response elicited by HA-trimer and HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunization with antigen-specific B cell ELISpot. There was a significantly increased frequency of HA-specific IgG isotype ASCs in HA-nanoparticle immunized mice relative to HA-trimer immunized mice, where there was an 11-fold increase in BALB/c and 31-fold increase in CBA/J mice (Fig. 4G, H). Recent studies have demonstrated that a robust isotype switched ASC response is dependent on CD40L signaling from CD4 T cells59, such as those depicted in (Fig. 3E–L), implicating the increased abundance of ferritin-specific helper CD4 T cells in enhanced magnitude of the B cell response.Equivalent vaccine responses to HA-trimers and HA-Fe-nanoparticles in H-2b MHC II haplotype mice lacking major CD4 T cell epitopesAlthough the results above show an enhanced magnitude of B cell and CD4 T cell responses in BALB/c and CBA/J mice immunized with HA-Fe nanoparticles relative to HA-trimers may be attributed to the recruitment of ferritin-specific CD4 T cells, there are other advantages of the HA-Fe-nanoparticle, including the multivalent nature of 8 HA trimers available to engage a broad diversity of HA specific B cells11,35,36,37,61. To address whether the primary advantages of the Fe-nanoparticle based vaccine in the developing germinal center response was related to its multimeric state, we sampled an additional inbred mouse strain C57BL/6 (B6) mice expressing the I-Ab class II molecule. Using a vaccination regimen as described above for BALB/c and CBA/J mice, we found that B6 mice elicited minimal CD4 T cell reactivity to H. pylori ferritin. No epitopes elicited a response of greater than 25 spots per million CD4 T cells in HA-nanoparticle immunized C57BL/6 mice by either IL-2 or IFNγ cytokine ELISpot (Supplementary Fig. 4). Restimulation of cells with complete peptide pools spanning the sequences of HA and ferritin elicited nearly undetectable CD4 T cell responses (Fig. 5A), in line with previous data showing very limited I-Ab restricted CD4 T cell reactivity to A/New Caledonia/20/99 HA62.Fig. 5: Equivalent vaccine responses to HA-trimers and HA-nanoparticles in H-2b MHC II haplotype mice lacking major CD4 T cell epitopes.C57BL/6 mice were immunized with equimolar quantities of HA in the form of soluble HA trimers or HA-nanoparticles. Draining lymph nodes were harvested D15 post immunization. Antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses were quantified by IL-2 ELISpot for A following stimulation with total HA or total ferritin peptide pools. Absolute numbers of CD4 TFH per lymph node were quantified B. Antigen specificity of the TFH response was quantified by activation induced marker (AIM) assay by scoring upregulation of CD154 and CD69 in response to peptide stimulation C. Quantification of antigen experienced non-TFH that upregulate CD154 and CD69 in response to peptide stimulation D. Total abundance of FAS+ GL7+ GC B cells per lymph node was assessed in E mice immunized with equimolar quantities of HA in the form of soluble HA trimers or HA-nanoparticles from the same individual mice shown in Fig. 5. The relationship between GC B cell abundance and CD4 TFH abundance was assessed by linear regression analysis F. Antigen-specific GC B cell responses were assessed by staining with fluorophore conjugated HA probes, where the B cell population of interest was defined as FAS+ GL7+ IgM- IgD- HA+ G. HA-specific ASCs were assessed by B cell ELISpot H. Data are shown as the mean and SD of three individual mice per group from two independent experiments, for a total of 6 individual mice per group. In A, C, D, significant differences between HA-trimer and HA-nanoparticle immunized mice were determined by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. In B, E, G, H, significant differences between HA-trimer and HA-nanoparticle immunized mice were determined by unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.Full size imageWe hypothesized that if the recruitment of Fe-specific CD4 T cells was a key factor in the overall immunogenicity of HA-Fe-nanoparticles, the HA-Fe-nanoparticle and HA-trimer based vaccines should elicit a similar magnitude of HA-specific B cell responses, whereas if the multimeric state was the critical advantage provided by HA-Fe-nanoparticles, this advantage would persist in B6-vaccinated mice. The analyses of CD4 T cells isolated from HA-trimer and HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunized B6 mice contained similar overall numbers of CD4 TFH per draining lymph node (Fig. 5B). Quantification of activated CD4 TFH and antigen-experienced CD4 T cells by AIM assay indicated very modest CD4 T cell responses (Fig. 5C, D). The number of GC B cells per lymph node was not significantly different between HA-trimer and HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunized B6 mice (Fig. 5E). Linear regression analyses showed a weak positive relationship between the abundance of GC B cells and CD4 TFH, but the slope was not significantly different than zero (Fig. 5F). HA-trimer and HA-Fe-nanoparticle immunized mice did not differ in their overall abundance of HA-specific isotype-switched GC B cells (Fig. 5G), nor in their frequency of HA-specific ASCs (Fig. 5H). These results indicate that B6 mice expressing the MHC II molecule I-Ab elicit limited CD4 T cell responses specific for HA or ferritin, and under these conditions, HA-trimer and HA-Fe-nanoparticle vaccine formulations elicited responses of equivalent, albeit lower overall magnitude, likely due to limited CD4 T cell help. Overall, these results suggest that a key component of the enhanced immunogenicity of HA-Fe-nanoparticles and the germinal center response is due to the abundance of CD4 T cells recruited after vaccination and that the Fe core typically contributes substantially to elicitation of the cognate CD4 T cells help needed for the robust germinal center response observed in the analyses of this vaccine platform.DiscussionTo achieve the needed benchmarks of protective efficacy and breadth of protection, universal influenza vaccine approaches will need to facilitate a broadly protective and high affinity B cell response that targets critical sites of virus surface proteins. For influenza vaccine approaches, HA-specific antibody responses are the most prominent target1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Induction of broadly reactive high affinity antibody responses to HA, sustained plasma cell responses, and memory B cell responses require a CD4 T cell-dependent GC response. Achieving high influenza vaccine efficacy with HA-based vaccine candidates will likely require vaccine candidates capable of driving B cell somatic hypermutation and engagement of diverse, but potentially rare, clonotypes with broadly neutralizing potential35. Given that CD4 T cell cognate help for B cells is essential for the formation of GCs, here we considered the potential contribution of the non-viral antigen core of the nanoparticle to recruit CD4 T cells after vaccination. The data presented here revealed the unexpected immunodominance of CD4 T cells specific for the ferritin nanoparticle core of a next-generation influenza vaccine candidate that is used increasingly for many other viral pathogens27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.The immunodominance of ferritin-specific CD4 T cells in the primary response to vaccination, along with the fusion protein design of the HA-Fe-nanoparticle, raises the potential that HA-Fe-nanoparticles may recruit both HA and ferritin-specific CD4 T cells to provide intramolecular help for HA-specific GC B cell responses. Increased abundance of potentially limiting helper CD4 T cell epitopes through fusion to ferritin, along with an arrayed display of native HA trimers may underlie enhanced antibody responses relative to vaccine formulations comprised solely of HA through provision of help to GC B cells. We speculate that the increased CD4 T cell epitope abundance of the HA-ferritin fusion protein constructs may influence the GC B cell response through provision of additional T cell help for cognate B cells. We, and others, have shown that several limited regions within the H1 HA molecule contained the immunodominant CD4 T cell epitopes in both inbred mice and human donors expressing diverse MHC class II alleles48,63. Previous studies in pre-clinical animal models indicated that when the antigen-specificity of the TFH repertoire was assessed by AIM assay with HA head and HA stem-derived peptide pools, the HA head was significantly enriched for antigen-specific TFH relative to the HA stem domain64. This trend was observed in two common inbred mouse models, C57BL/6 and BALB/c, implicating availability of T cell help as a potentially limiting factor for HA-specific antibody responses. Recruitment of CD4 T cell help may be particularly critical when immunization is performed with HA stem-alone constructs or similar constructs recruiting a narrowed repertoire, constructs containing few T cell epitopes, or contexts where immune memory is limited, such as those involving emerging pathogens.In support of the concept of limiting T cell help, conjugation of HA stem to the carrier protein Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH), a highly immunogenic T-cell dependent antigen, enhanced the magnitude of B cell responses directed towards the HA stem from nearly undetectable levels37,65. Interestingly, conjugation of HA stem protein to KLH or fusion of HA stem to H. pylori ferritin both served to increase the magnitude of the HA stem antibody response. Our data suggest that MHC class II genetics may have an influence on determining the magnitude of the response to HA-nanoparticle vaccination. Mice expressing H-2d and H-2k MHC II haplotypes elicited robust CD4 T cell responses largely specific for H. pylori ferritin and displayed increased magnitudes of B and CD4 T cell responses following HA-nanoparticle vaccination relative to HA-trimer immunized controls. Conversely, H-2b MHC II haplotype mice elicit relatively few vaccine antigen-specific CD4 T cells and respond equivalently to HA-trimer or HA-nanoparticle vaccination. Others have shown that C57BL/6 mice expressing only I-Ab had similar proportions of TFH cells when mice were immunized with another H1 vaccine formulation comprised of either HA-Fe-nanoparticles or soluble HA37. Activation of TFH by the AIM assay was only observed in response to stimulation with HA peptides, but not ferritin peptides, in support of the idea of MHC class II restricted epitope selection in H-2b mice37. Decreased CD4 T cell epitope abundance may underlie modest TFH induction and limited evidence for B cell somatic hypermutation early during the response37. Differences in TFH abundance and specificity were also observed when comparing C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice in a HA stem-nanoparticle vaccine model64. The analyses show that mice expressing diverse MHC class II molecules, including human HLA-DR molecules, each recruit abundant Fe-specific CD4 T cells. This suggests that CD4 T cell immunogenicity of Fe is the most dominant pattern of response and that increased helper CD4 T cell recruitment of Fe-reactive cells can potentiate HA-specific B cell responses. This feature may represent a key mechanism underlying increased efficacy of ferritin-based vaccine constructs.Data from a pre-clinical vaccine model emphasized the importance of understanding the role of antigen-specific CD4 TFH in shaping the GC response. In the context of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), another highly variable viral surface glycoprotein, quantitative and qualitative features of the CD4 TFH response correlated with the magnitude of the broadly neutralizing GC B cell response to vaccination66. In the primary response to Env vaccination, there was a strong quantitative correlation between GC B cell and GC TFH frequencies. In response to subsequent booster immunizations, qualitative features of the CD4 TFH response correlated more strongly with GC B cell activity than numerical abundance. NHPs with the highest neutralizing antibody titers had GC TFH enriched for expression of the critical helper T cell molecules IL-21, CD40L, and ICOS (which supports production of IL-21 through interaction with ICOSL on cognate B cells) relative to individuals with low neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting these TFH may be more supportive of GC B cells on a per cell basis66. Quantitative and qualitative features of the CD4 TFH repertoire that participate in vaccine responses may likely influence the GC B cell response to vaccination and resulting breadth of the antibodies elicited.Our findings indicate that immunodominance of the ferritin core of the HA-Fe-nanoparticle vaccines may have broad implications for vaccine design. H. pylori ferritin nanoparticles have been used as the core of a number of pre-clinical and clinical vaccine platforms. Ferritin-based vaccines have shown promise in providing protective immunity against Epstein-Barr virus, COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial virus, HIV, Lyme disease, and Hepatitis C Virus27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 in pre-clinical models. The role of ferritin-specific CD4 T cells in these diverse contexts remains unknown. It will also be critical to understand the contribution of CD4 T cells to serological responses and memory B cell responses following ferritin nanoparticle vaccination, as our studies focused on antigen-specific GC B cell and ASC responses. Our data using HA-Fe-nanoparticle as a model system suggest that ferritin-specific CD4 T cells may serve to enhance the immunogenicity of these constructs. Ferritin-based HA vaccines have shown promise in completed45,46 and on-going (NCT04645147, NCT04784767, NCT03814720, NCT04579250) Phase I clinical trials in humans. While complex human immune memory may complicate a direct dissection of the role for ferritin-specific CD4 T cells in vaccine responses, it will be important to understand their relative immunodominance and functional potential of the responding CD4 T cells in humans. In addition, the potential for the recall of Helicobacter-specific immune memory into vaccine responses is unknown.The studies presented here have emphasized the importance of understanding antigen-specificity, relative immunodominance, and functional potential of the CD4 T cell repertoire that responds to a given vaccine or broadly-used vaccine platform. Choice of B cell antigen, such as mosaic HA nanoparticles or HA stem nanoparticles, may help increase the breadth of the B cell repertoire drawn into the vaccine response11,67. Next generation influenza vaccine strategies should also consider the quantitative and qualitative features of the CD4 T cell repertoire that respond to vaccination, and how they may shape the germinal center response. Existing data suggest that increased protective efficacy of HA-Fe-nanoparticle relative to trimeric HA is likely to be a cumulative effect of multiple variables including multimeric antigen organization, glycosylation-dependent antigen handling, antigen deposition to follicular dendritic cells and germinal centers, and potential for activation of germline B cells from broadly neutralizing lineages11,36,37,61,68. Our data also implicate increased recruitment of helper CD4 T cells specific for the immunodominant ferritin core of the nanoparticle as an additional mechanism underlying enhanced immunogenicity of these constructs.MethodsAnimalsFemale BALB/cAnNCrl, CBA/J, and C57BL/6NCrl mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute and the Jackson Laboratory.

Cells were grown in Freestyle 293 expression medium (Invitrogen) and cell culture supernatants were collected 4 days post-transfection. Supernatants were buffer exchanged to Tris buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 nM NaCl, pH 7.5) prior to purification by affinity chromatography using Erythrina cristagalli agglutinin (ECA, coral tree lectin, EY Laboratories Inc.). HA-ferritin and HA-trimers underwent further purification by size exclusion chromatography using Superose 6 PG XK 16/70 column (GE Healthcare). Protein purity and size were verified by SDS-PAGE.ImmunizationsSubcutaneous immunizations were performed in the rear footpad with 3 μg of HA-ferritin nanoparticles or an equimolar concentration (2.2 μg) of HA-trimer in the presence of Sigma Adjuvant System® (S6322-1VL) at a 1:1 ratio by volume in sterile PBS.Tissue processing and cell isolationPopliteal lymph nodes from both hind legs and spleen were excised from euthanized mice.

Cells from draining LN of vaccinated mice were isolated and cultured in U-bottom 96 well plates (7.5 × 105 cells/well). Cells were stimulated under three conditions with 1 μM peptide pools spanning the entire sequence of A/New/Caledonia/99 HA, H. pylori ferritin, or 0.5% DMSO. Stimulation was performed for 8–10 h in the presence of 0.1 μg of CD154 antibody per well at 37 °C. Cells were washed and surface stained as described below.Flow cytometryFor surface staining experiments, 2 × 106 cells were added to a U-bottom plate. Cells were washed twice with PBS, then incubated with fixable live/dead aqua (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 4 °C according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were subsequently washed twice with FC stain buffer (PBS plus 2% heat-inactivated FBS and 0.01% sodium azide) and resuspended in anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (FC block 2.4G2, BD Biosciences #553142) for 20 min at 4 °C. Without washing, cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with the following antibodies: CD4 (RM4-5, 1/200 dilution, BD Biosciences #563151), CD4 (RM4-5, 1/200 dilution, Invitrogen #46-0042-82), CD44 (IM7, 1/200 dilution, Biolegend #103027), PD1 (J43, 1/100 dilution, BD Biosciences #562584), CD154 (SA047C3, 0.1 μgest, Biolegend #157005), CXCR5 (2G8, 1/25 dilution, BD Biosciences #551959), CD3 (145-2C11, 1/200 dilution, Biolegend #100309), CD69 (H1.2F3, 1/200 dilution, Biolegend #104511), B220 (Ra3-6B2, 1/200 dilution, Biolegend #103209), CD38 (90, 1/200 dilution, Invitrogen #56-0381-82), CD138 (281-2, 1/200 dilution, Biolegend #142519), GL7 (GL7, 1/200 dilution, BD Biosciences #562080), FAS (Jo2, 1/200 dilution, BD Biosciences #557653), IgD (11–26 c.2a, 1/200 dilution, BD Biosciences #560869), and IgM (RMM-1, 1/50 dilution, Biolegend #406511). Cells were washed twice with FC stain buffer prior to fixation with 0.5% PFA. Data were acquired using a Cytek Aurora, configured with 355 nm, 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm lasers.

Animals Emmanuel the emu does not have the avian flu, but is likely stressed out, owner says October 26, 20224:16 AM ET By Ayana Archie Enlarge this image Taylor Blake is helping Emmanuel with physical therapy in a homemade sling. @hiitaylorblake/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption @hiitaylorblake/Screenshot by NPR Taylor Blake is helping Emmanuel with physical therapy in a homemade sling. @hiitaylorblake/Screenshot by NPR Emmanuel the emu does not have the avian flu as was suspected, but instead has been experiencing high levels of stress after a strain struck dozens of fellow birds on the farm, his owner has said. "Emmanuel Todd Lopez tested negative for avian influenza at 2 separate labs, swab, fecal and blood." Taylor Blake, the owner of Knuckle Bump Farms in South Florida, said last Saturday. "He does not have the virus, and is not actively shedding the virus." Sponsor Message Emmanuel Todd Lopez tested negative for Avian Influenza at 2 separate labs, swab, fecal and blood. He does not have the virus, and is not actively shedding the virus🙏🏻 God is good! Thank you for the prayers, the kind words, and the support. Always trust your intuition!— eco sister (@hiitaylorblake) October 22, 2022 She continued, "We believe this all stemmed from stress. Emus are highly susceptible to stress. He was incredibly overwhelmed by the state coming in and euthanizing our flock." Emmanuel became a viral sensation for his behavior interrupting Blake's TikTok videos and attacking the phone while Blake was filming. In A Pinch For this TikTok star, cooking from the spirit is much more than a recipe A wave of avian flu killed more than 50 birds in just three days. Only two birds survived, Blake said Many of the birds had to be euthanized, and Emmanuel did not eat for days afterward. What food he did eat later, Blake had to give him, as he has not been able to eat food on his own. He later collapsed from weakness due to a lack of nutrition and had been "thrashing on the ground for hours, trying to get himself up," Blake said. I’m getting stronger each day, friends! I am now able to lift myself up and reposition myself on my own. This is a BIG step, because before, I would just fall over. My neck is starting to straighten out and I am drinking lots of water on my own! Thank you for the prayers🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/PP6g1yiQ7g— eco sister (@hiitaylorblake) October 24, 2022 Though, in the most recent tweet on Blake's account, she said Emmanuel is now able to reposition himself and drink water on his own. "I've dedicated the past 10 days to saving my best friend's life, and it's working," she said. "He's fighting. He's getting stronger. I could've listened to the negative comments and given up, but I didn't, and I'm proud of myself. I trusted myself.

The major outbreak of bird flu this winter and spring has lead to serious shortages of chicks for the new production cycle.Foie gras organisation, CIFOG, has warned that there is probably going to be a lot less of the delicacy around Christmas, when most of it is eaten. The organisation has also asked the government for urgent support to prevent many producers from having to quit the industry.The most widespread outbreakAlthough France has been hit by bird flu in 2 of the 3 previous winters, the 2021-22 outbreak was the most widespread in its history. Over 1,600 poultry producers in total have been hit and more than 16 million animals culled, mostly to prevent further spread around infected premises.But unlike the previous outbreaks, this time it was not only the southwest of the country (mainly the Landes and Ger regions) that were badly hit, but the epidemic also hit the Pays de la Loire department and the Vendée area further north along the coast.In the southwest, several hundred duck and geese holders were infected, often for the second or third time in a few years. But in the more northern region, which was spared from infections in previous outbreaks apart from individual cases in wild birds, it was mostly in the parent farms that produce the chicks that bird flu was detected.As the rule requires, all animals on infected premises must be culled while all buildings must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected and left empty for 4 weeks – the vide sanitaire – before any new production cycle may get started.In related news… Production of foie gras falls for 3rd consecutive year France considering vaccination against bird fluShortageSo, although many growers in the duck-intensive regions of the southwest were allowed to re-start and fill their houses again some time ago, many struggled to find new chicks to do that.“This enormous shortage is linked to the unprecedented impact of this epidemic on the hatching sector, particularly in Pays de la Loire, the region representing 100% of the global genetics and over 70% of the French reproduction potential for the mullard duck. Almost 90% of the reproducers have been hit and it will take many months before that resource can be built up again,” said the organisation for the foie gras industry, Comité interprofessionnel des palmipèdes à foie gras (CIFOG), in a letter to the government.“Despite the intensive efforts of the integrators to restart their flocks, the professionals estimate that the growers will be able to provide less than 50% of the necessary animals to restart the sector. We don’t expect to see any return to a more normal situation before the second quarter of 2023,” CIFOG added.Urgent supportCIFOG has therefore asked Marc Fesneau, the minister for agriculture and the food sovereignty, for urgent support. “We want to alert the minister to the extreme seriousness of the situation in the sector, both for the growers and for all professionals who all urgently need further financial support. Although producers in the southwest, Pays de la Loire and Périgord regions are allowed to restart production, they are seriously hindered by the severe shortage of chicks. Most are not able to get what they’ve ordered and there is no compensation. Something which is creating a catastrophic situation for the whole sector,” CIFOG stated.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

(Shutterstock)LOS ANGELES, CA — Influenza season has started early in Southern California where a single outbreak kept more than 1,000 students at a San Diego high school home and caused flu deaths early in the season compared to previous years, according to the California Department of Public Health. Though uncommon, CDPH officials said it is not unprecedented to see deaths occur during the fall. However, flu hospitalizations and deaths typically happen during winter months. "While it is still too early to know exactly what this year’s flu season will look like in California, there are indications that flu activity might start earlier than usual this year," CDPH said. "It is likely that seasonal influenza (flu) viruses, COVID-19 virus and other viruses that cause respiratory infections will circulate this fall and winter."Find out what's happening in Palos Verdeswith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeThe 2022-2023 flu season coincides with spikes in respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, and COVID-19 cases, which has health officials across the country warning of a possible "tripledemic." Local hospitals are experiencing an uncharacteristically high rate of hospitalizations this season, straining capacity as more patients wait for beds. Public Health officials in San Diego County raised alarm about the spike of flu virus cases, worrying that all three of the viruses could further tax the region's hospitals. Find out what's happening in Palos Verdeswith free, real-time updates from Patch.Subscribe"As we see a sharp increase of flu and RSV cases, I am urging San Diegans to do their part to prevent the spread of illnesses," said Dr. Wilma J. Wooten, county public health officer. The good news is the strains in this year's flu vaccine closely match the strains that seem to be active and were detected in the country this fall, according to the CDPH. With cases of flu trending up in the state, health officials stressed the importance of getting vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus.So far, Influenza A (H3N2) is the predominant virus circulating this season the CDPH said. This strain can cause serious illness in people of any age but is especially likely to affect older adults according to early data collected by the CDPH. California Department of Public Health "Getting vaccinated against the flu is the best way to prevent serious illness and reduce the spread to others," CDPH said. "Persons who are at high risk for severe influenza and COVID-19 should consult their health care providers regarding information on testing and potential treatments."Nationally, federal health officials reported this season's flu cases are higher in the U.S. than they've been at this time of year in more than a decade. Influenza, RSV and COVID-19 tend to peak seasonally, and The three illnesses have similar symptoms. According to the CDC, flu symptoms include: Fever or feeling feverish/chills (though not everyone with flu will have a fever)CoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigueSome people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. There are no inoculations against RSV as there are for both the flu and COVID-19, but a couple of pharmaceutical companies are working to develop vaccines. The CDPH said if someone is unsure whether they have the flu, RSV or COVID-19 they should: Get rest and stay hydrated as well as take over-the-counter medicines to help feel better.Stay in touch with a doctor and call before getting medical care. People should get care if they are having trouble breathing, have emergency warning signs or believe it is an emergency.Reduce the spread of disease by staying home if possible, wearing a mask, washing hands frequently and taking other steps to prevent spreading the disease to others.

Please help us by doing your part to help stop the spread of respiratory illnesses.A surge in flu cases is often correlated with Thanksgiving and the approaching holiday season, so it’s important that everyone 6 months and older get the flu vaccine now. Along with a spike in RSV cases, North Texas is currently a hotspot for flu activity.“The influenza vaccine is a very safe and effective way to avoid getting sick with the flu,” said Mary Suzanne Whitworth, M.D. “One quick shot can potentially prevent a week of fever and feeling miserable. This is a no brainer.”Parents and caregivers can remind their children to continue the healthy habits learned in the pandemic, including hand hygiene, coughing into a tissue or your elbow and staying home if you or your child feel sick. Face masks add increased protection, especially in public spaces. Be sure that you and your family are updated on your COVID vaccines. As flu cases increase due to the holidays and travel, COVID cases often go up as well. Patients are still experiencing COVID. On Oct. 18, the rolling 7-day average was 2.3% positivity rate.Why should I get the flu vaccine in response to the spike in RSV cases?Our goal is for our community, our patients and our patient families to stay as healthy as possible. Our Emergency Department and Urgent Care Centers are currently overwhelmed with patients and resulting in extremely long wait times.Vaccination against the flu helps prevent infection and can prevent serious outcomes in people who are vaccinated but still get sick with the flu. The vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization.Our emergency department is seeing more than 500 children each day. Our Urgent Cares are seeing nearly 800 children each day. This is the equivalent of a child being checked in to see a provider every 2 minutes and is resulting in extraordinarily long wait times for those who are not severely ill.Additionally, Cook Children’s pediatric ICU remains near capacity with about half of patients diagnosed with RSV.Parents should not go to Cook Children’s Urgent Care Centers or Emergency Department for only a flu or a COVID test. See your pediatrician, who can test for flu, RSV, strep throat and COVID. You can also use at-home COVID tests or tests from a pharmacy.What are flu cases like now?At Cook Children’s, flu cases are increasing earlier this year; the flu numbers we are currently seeing are equal to what we saw near the end of November 2021. There were 47 cases of Influenza A and one case of Influenza B at Cook Children’s Health Care System during the week of Oct. 9 – Oct 15.RSV cases at Cook Children’s Health Care System:Oct. 2 – Oct 8: 210 cases(24% positivity rate)Oct. 9 – Oct. 15: 288 cases(29% positivity rate)Oct. 16 – Oct. 22: 246 cases(24% positivity rate)Influenza A cases at Cook Children’s Health Care System:Oct. 9 – Oct. 15: 47 casesOct. 16 – Oct. 22: 75 casesMost of the United States is seeing an early increase in seasonal flu activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The southeast region and south-central region, which includes Texas, are reporting the highest levels of flu activity, the CDC said.Everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine. The flu vaccine is the best way to protect your child and family from potentially serious complications from flu.Texas is at a high activity level for respiratory illness, including fever plus a cough or sore throat. The map shows ILI (influenza-like illness), which includes patient visits due to other pathogens that cause similar symptoms. The cases reflected in the map are not all confirmed flu cases.RELATED: Prepare Now for Flu Season with Vaccine ProtectionGet Immunized for a Healthy School Year (checkupnewsroom.com)Does My Kid Have Allergies, COVID, a Cold or the Flu? (checkupnewsroom.com) There’s no guaranteed way to avoid the flu. But getting the vaccine every year can help. At Cook Children’s, we believe that flu vaccinations are the safest, easiest way to protect everyone age 6 months and older from serious flu symptoms. And a flu vaccination during pregnancy helps protect your newborn baby from flu for several months after birth.Immunizations and other services are available at Cook Children’s neighborhood clinics and primary care sites across Fort Worth and beyond.

Cold & Flu11 Foods and Drinks to Help Soothe Flu SymptomsWhile nothing is a cure-all for the flu, what you include in your diet when you’re sick may help you feel better and potentially speed recovery.ByAshley WelchMedically ReviewedbyJustin Laube, MDPublished on October 24, 2022Vitamin-C rich foods like fruit, wholesome dishes like chicken soup, and soothing ingredients like honey can help you feel better when facing the flu.Adobe Stock (3); CanvaFrequent hand-washing and getting vaccinated are two important things you can do to keep yourself safe from the flu. If you do become ill, you’ll want to stay home and rest to support recovery and prevent spreading the virus to others.Should you get sick, here's another tool to add to your flu-fighting arsenal: whole, nutritious foods and drinks. That's because research suggests food and drink choices may help or hinder flu symptoms.“The studies that we have are small and somewhat limited in quality,” says Neha Vyas, MD, a family medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, “but even still, we can make some general assumptions as to what is good to eat and drink when you're sick.”Flu symptoms include fever, sore throat, cough, congestion or runny nose, and body aches, notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In some cases, flu may cause diarrhea and vomiting, too.Read on to learn which foods and drinks to consider including in your diet to help ease the effects of the flu and potentially get back to feeling like your normal self sooner.1510Warm, Plain BrothAdobe StockYou’ve likely heard the advice to get plenty of fluids when you’re sick, and this common belief indeed holds true, Dr. Vyas says. Symptoms of the flu, including fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, can lead to rapid loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time, leading to dehydration, according to Mayo Clinic.“When you're dehydrated, you need to drink lots and lots of fluids to compensate for that,” Vyas says.It’s generally believed that warm liquids work better than cold liquids to ease symptoms of the flu, and some scientific evidence backs up that conventional wisdom. In one study, researchers compared the effects of both hot and room-temperature drinks in 30 people facing the cold or flu. “The hot drink provided immediate and sustained relief from symptoms of runny nose, cough, sneezing, sore throat, chilliness, and tiredness, whereas the same drink at room temperature only provided relief from symptoms of runny nose, cough, and sneezing,” the researchers state. The benefits may be a result of the hot liquids promoting salivation and airway mucus secretions to lubricate and soothe the upper airways, they concluded.Broth is a great option when you’re sick with the flu, as it's rich in nutrients and the heat can soothe a sore throat, Vayas notes.Whether it’s chicken, vegetable, or bone broth, the benefits likely remain the same, says Lori Dror, RD, with Northwell Health in Long Island, New York. But she recommends opting for a low-sodium variety. “When we are already feeling run-down, we want to avoid high-sodium foods, which can lead to swelling and increased fatigue,” she says.1511Chicken SoupAdobe StockDepending on your symptoms, liquid broth may be all you can handle, but for more sustenance, add some healthy ingredients to make a soup.Chicken soup is a classic homemade remedy for illnesses like the flu, and you likely have memories of eating a heaping bowl as a child when you weren’t feeling well. And it turns out mom knows best. One study found that the ingredients in chicken soup together can reduce inflammation and support the immune system as it fights the influenza infection.When it comes to preparing a soup, Dror recommends aiming for a balanced bowl for optimal nutrition — something your body needs now more than ever as it recovers.“Opt for soups that contain protein, nonstarchy vegetables, and carbohydrates,” she says. “For a quick, balanced option, toss some frozen veggies and shredded rotisserie chicken into a low-sodium broth. Bean soups contain protein and fiber, so they’re also an excellent option.”1512Sugar-Free Ice PopsAdobe StockWhile warm fluids provide more relief from flu symptoms, some people find cold foods can help numb the pain of a sore throat, Vyas notes. Ice pops can be a great option, but you’ll want to make sure they’re not loaded with sugar.If you’re feeling up to it, you can avoid added sugar and artificial ingredients by making your own ice pops at home. “Blend then freeze fresh fruit for a delicious, healthy alternative,” Dror recommends. “Berries are a great option because they are low in sugar, high in fiber, and contain antioxidants.”If you don’t have the energy (or can’t convince a loved one to whip these up for you), a store-bought brand without added sugar can work, too, Vyas says.1513GarlicMara Zemgaliete/Adobe StockGarlic has a long history of being used for medicinal purposes in cultures around the world. In ancient China and India, for example, garlic was used to treat respiratory and digestive issues, while in the Middle Ages, some people viewed it as a remedy for arthritis, toothaches, chronic cough, and insect bites, according to a research paper on the topic.Today, some research suggests garlic may be useful in helping fight off the flu. While data is limited, one study concluded that taking garlic supplements may enhance immune cell function and reduce the severity of flu symptoms. If you don’t want to take garlic supplements, you can try to get the same benefits from raw or cooked garlic, Vyas suggests, though no robust scientific evidence supports this yet.1514Orange Juice and Other Sources of Vitamin CLiliya Trott/Adobe StockVitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that plays an important role in fighting infections, according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Some research suggests vitamin C can help decrease the severity and length of the common cold, which shares some symptoms with the flu.As Harvard notes, many fruits and vegetable offer vitamin C, including:Citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruitsKiwiPotatoesPeppersBroccoliBrussels sproutsStrawberriesTomatoesCantaloupe1515Leafy GreensAdobe StockAnother type of veggie that offers immune-bolstering, inflammation-fighting vitamin C: leafy greens. Examples include spinach, cabbage, and kale, which also offer iron, Vyas notes.Research shows iron is essential for the production of immune cells, particularly white blood cells, which help the body fight infections.But don’t worry if you’re not in the mood for a salad. Dror recommends adding these veggies to soup to add bulk and a nutritional boost, or enjoying them in other ways. “If raw vegetables are not appealing, try roasting, steaming, or sautéing them,” she says. “When our energy is low, frozen vegetables are a great way to increase our intake with minimal effort.”1516HoneyAdobe StockHoney is a common at-home remedy for soothing a sore throat. Research suggests that’s a smart move if you’re facing the flu in particular, as the natural sweetener may help play a role in fighting off respiratory infections. A review published in August 2020 in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine suggests that honey may be more effective in treating symptoms of cold and flu-like illnesses than over-the-counter medicines.The review included 14 studies that analyzed nearly 1,800 people with upper respiratory infections being treated with either honey or conventional remedies like antihistamines and cough suppressants. The authors concluded that honey appeared to be superior in treating symptoms of these infections. While researchers don’t know exactly why honey helps with cold and flu symptoms, studies show it has antimicrobial properties. Honey also coats the throat and can soothe irritation, per Cleveland Clinic.1517Hot TeaAdobe StockOne of the best ways to enjoy honey is to add a teaspoon to hot tea. This warm beverage is itself soothing to a sore throat and the steam can help clear a stuffy throat, Vyas notes.Tea contains a group of antioxidants called polyphenols, which research shows are protective against chronic illnesses. Chamomile has been found to have antibacterial properties in studies, while research has shown peppermint tea can help soothe digestive symptoms. Green tea contains a type of polyphenol called catechins, which studies suggest can increase the number of regulatory T cells, which help control the immune system.While there are many types of tea to choose from, Vyas suggests staying away from any that contain caffeine, such as black tea, which can contribute to dehydration.1518Spices Like Ginger and TurmericAdobe StockWhile research is limited, some data suggests certain spices and herbs may be beneficial when you’re sick with the flu. In studies, researchers have found that ginger extract offers antimicrobial properties, while curcumin, a naturally occurring compound in turmeric, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, research suggests.Vyas doesn’t recommend counting on these spices as a cure for the flu, but they may be helpful to add to teas, soups, or other dishes when you’re sick.Ginger and curcumin are also available in supplement form. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), ginger supplementation is considered safe but may cause side effects, including abdominal discomfort, heartburn, diarrhea, and mouth and throat irritation, if taken in large doses. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consult with their doctor before taking ginger supplements, the organization states.Due to its anticoagulant activity, curcumin supplements may cause excessive bleeding if taken with blood thinners like aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), or warfarin, according to a research paper on its safety and health effects. Little is known about the safety of curcumin supplementation during pregnancy or breastfeeding, NCCIH reports.1519Lean ProteinsAdobe StockEven when we’re not sick, protein is essential for keeping our bodies strong. That strength is important for fighting off infections like the flu, Dror says.“Protein helps us to maintain our lean body mass, which includes muscle,” she says. “We want to ensure we are getting adequate protein when we are ill, to prevent muscle wasting, keep us feeling full, promote healing, and promote blood sugar control.”Eating foods that are high in fat can slow gastric emptying time, so there is more of a chance the foods can cause GI distress, she notes. “The flu can already cause an upset stomach, so we want to aim for low fat or lean options when it comes to protein,” Dror says.Good sources of lean protein, which are low in fat, include skinless poultry, fish, beans, and tofu, Dror says.1520Greek YogurtAdobe StockThe flu can come with some pesky gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting, Dror notes, and probiotics can be useful to restore the healthy bacteria that live in our intestinal tract and improve our health, research shows. Certain foods naturally contain probiotics, including yogurt, kombucha, and tempeh, per Cleveland Clinic. Probiotics are also available in supplement form, though researchers do not yet know how effective they are at improving health.To add probiotics to your diet when you’re not feeling well, Dror says Greek yogurt is an excellent option.“Greek yogurt has double the protein of regular yogurt and less lactose, so it’s easier on the digestive system,” she says. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a typical 150-gram (g) container of plain Greek yogurt contains 15 g of protein, while the same amount of plain whole milk yogurt contains about 6 g of protein.Dror recommends sticking to yogurts that are light or low-fat and low in total sugar, ideally 10 g or less per package or serving.What to Avoid When Recovering From the FluWhile a number of foods and beverages can help with the flu, others may exacerbate symptoms. When you’re not feeling well, try to stay away from the following:Caffeinated Drinks A diuretic, caffeine can exacerbate dehydration, so you’ll want to limit or avoid beverages like coffee, black tea, and soda while you’re sick with the flu, Vyas says.Alcoholic Beverages Research suggests alcohol weakens the immune system, which can make it more difficult to fight off an influenza infection. Additionally, like caffeine, alcohol can further dehydrate you, Vyas notes.Dairy Products Foods containing dairy like milk, cheese, and ice cream are known to thicken mucus, per the Cleveland Clinic. “If you're congested and have a lot of respiratory symptoms, dairy might be something you want to stay away from,” Vyas says. Thanks to its probiotics, Greek yogurt is one exception to this rule. If you want to completely steer clear of dairy, consider trying healthy, nondairy probiotic sources such as low-sugar kombucha.Processed Foods These eats tend to be high in sodium and saturated fat, which studies show can lead to inflammation in the body, Dror notes. “Sticking to whole foods, which contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals is optimal for our health,” she says.Ultimately, there is no one food or drink that will make you feel better when you have the flu, but certain choices may help or hinder your recovery.Once you’re feeling better, try to stick to a healthy diet for optimal health. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans (PDF) recommends focusing on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, protein, and fat-free or low-fat dairy, while limiting added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol.Sign up for our Healthy Living Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Here’s what experts say By Megan Molteni Oct. 25, 2022 Reprints Adobe Over the past few weeks, cases of flu have begun to creep up across the U.S., with spikes in the southeast and south central part of the country. Flu hospitalizations are also on the rise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influenza tracking team, all signs point to an earlier than usual flu season. At the same time, hospitals across the country are filling up with children who’ve contracted RSV — a virus that causes common cold-like symptoms that can sometimes lead to serious illness, particularly in infants and older adults.advertisement With the third Covid winter approaching, and public health precautions like masking and social distancing all but abandoned, the next few months could see the American health care system pushed to capacity by multiple surges in respiratory disease. That’s why experts are advising that the best thing people can do to protect themselves and prevent their local hospitals from overflowing is to get immunized against the circulating viruses. Pfizer’s experimental RSV vaccine is still in testing, but Covid-19 and flu shots are now available to almost everyone. Experts agree that the best time to get vaccinated is now, before these viral ripples build into waves. But there are other, more subtle questions of timing that scientists are still investigating, including whether time of day or combining vaccines matters. Here’s what we know and don’t know:advertisement Does getting the flu and Covid shots together make either less effective? Probably not. The science is clear that the human immune system is sophisticated enough to handle seeing more than one antigen at a time and responding in a robust way. And there’s a lot of data to support this, including from trials of combination vaccines like the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) and DTap (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) shots, which have been in use in the U.S. for decades. “The immune system is extraordinary at recognizing many things at the same time,” said Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “Right now in your intestine alone, your immune system is dealing with 500,000 potential targets. Adding one more thing to that is usually just like a rain drop falling into the ocean.” Vaccines work primarily by activating two types of adaptive immune cells. The first are B cells, which churn out antibodies that recognize bits of a bacteria or virus — in the case of SARS-CoV-2, its spike protein. The second are T cells, which roam the body and kill any infected cells as well as coordinate the activity of other immune system players.

Browse our upcoming events to see what's on the horizon. Privacy Policy If a person’s body has seen a particular virus before, either in the form of a vaccine or a prior infection, then a booster shot or an annual flu jab serves to activate the pre-existing populations of B cells that already carry the instruction manuals for making antibodies specific to those pathogens. In other words, the vaccines usually aren’t competing for immune resources. The human body also keeps a reserve of B cells capable of creating novel antibodies against any new threats. “Most of the time you can give two vaccines together and it all works fine,” said Crotty. However, some vaccine components meant to boost the immune response, called adjuvants, can interact or interfere with other shots when given in combination. The mRNA Covid vaccines contain an adjuvant in the form of lipid nanoparticles, the flu vaccine doesn’t. Definitive evidence on how co-administering the two shots impacts either’s efficacy is not yet available. That’s why Crotty advises people to get the flu and Covid shots in different appendages — arms for adults and older children, legs for young children. “The immune system certainly has no problem recognizing vaccines if given that way because it’s two different processes happening simultaneously in localized ways,” he said. Related: CDC: Signs point to an early start for flu season, with cases already ticking up in parts of the U.S. While there’s not much data from human studies yet, lab experiments suggest even combined shots don’t decrease efficacy. One study published last year showed that mice and ferrets simultaneously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 influenza produced the same levels of antibodies as animals that received the shots in sequence. When they were later infected with those viruses, both vaccination strategies protected the animals from severe disease. In fact, some researchers are already investigating whether the two vaccines might be combined into a single shot. This summer, scientists in China reported that their combination SARS-CoV-2/influenza mRNA vaccine protected mice from co-infection with H1N1 and the Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. The only reason to space them out, say experts, is if you’re someone who tends to experience more intense reactions to immunizations, things like muscle or joint pain, chills, and headache. It’s possible that those reactions can be exacerbated by getting both jabs at once. A CDC study published in JAMA in July found that among 981,000 individuals, getting a simultaneous flu shot and Covid-19 booster was associated with an 8% to 11% increase in such systemic side effects, compared with a Covid-19 booster alone. “It’s important to get both, and to get them now if you haven’t already,” said Kawsar Talaat, a Johns Hopkins infectious disease physician and vaccine researcher. “Whether it’s separate or together, the important thing is just to get them.” Does the time of day I get my shots matter? That the immune system follows a roughly 24-hour rhythm has been known since the early 1960s. But only in the last decade or two have the circadian clocks that control the activity of immune cells become a field of intense study, including by vaccine researchers. Studies in mice have shown that in the morning, T cells turn on genes that make molecules involved in recognizing antigens and cranking out clone armies of T cells that can go patrol the body for more of the foreign invaders. At night, they produce molecules that silence that response. “It seems there’s a whole program in the T cells that makes them very efficient at responding in the day and being less efficient at night,” said Nicolas Cermakian, a chronobiologist at McGill University and the Douglas Research Centre in Montreal. In a 2019 PNAS study, his team showed that vaccines delivered during the day produced more T cell activation than those delivered at night. Data from human studies, at least from the 10 or so that have been conducted so far, painted a more complicated picture. In a Cell Research paper published last year, researchers in China found that among 63 health care workers, those that received a shot of the Sinovac vaccine in the morning produced twice as many antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as workers who got the jab in the afternoon. But another study from the U.K. of 2,784 health care workers inoculated with either Pfizer’s or AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine found that higher antibody levels were observed in people who’d received the shots in the afternoon. Trending Now: What can Trump and RFK Jr. actually do on health care? Perhaps the strongest evidence for an AM jab comes from a 2016 study of influenza conducted in the U.K. — the first large-scale randomized trial of vaccine timing. It found that among 276 older adults, those who received their annual influenza vaccination in the morning had a more than three-fold higher antibody response to one of the influenza strains than those who got the shot in the afternoon. However, it’s still too early and the data too sparse to extract any sort of rules or recommendations. While it’s clear that the immune system responds to vaccines differently at different times of day, whether or not those enhancements translate to better protection against a viral threat remains unknown. And different types of vaccines may have their own biologically optimized timing. Still, said Cermakian, it’s worth studying. Because adjusting the timing of vaccination may be a simple and inexpensive way to get the most out of currently available vaccines, particularly in older adults who tend to have dampened immune responses. “Even a two-fold improvement for older populations could be very beneficial,” he said. “Imagine only needing to get a Covid-19 booster once a year instead of every five or six months. It would make a big difference in terms of cost and in terms of making it easier for people to stay protected for longer.” With SARS-CoV-2 continuing to evolve, and the vaccines most commonly used in the U.S. only offering short-term protection against Covid-19, it’s a strategy vaccine makers and regulators contemplating the future of boosters may need to consider. But for now, said Cermakian, you should worry less about what time of day to make a vaccine appointment, and more about getting a good night’s sleep in the run-up to it. “Sleeping well in the days before a vaccine is one thing people should do to get a better response,” he said. “We know that being well-rested is a big plus.” Will we have to keep getting Covid boosters every six months and flu shots every year forever? No one can predict the future, but public health officials are starting to look ahead to what a long-term vaccination strategy for our multi-respiratory-virus reality might look like. If researchers can pull off the long-elusive universal flu vaccine approach, that would certainly be a game-changer. But Crotty’s latest work suggests that there might be technologically simpler ways to push people’s immune systems to evolve all the antibodies they might ever need. In a paper published last month in Nature, Crotty and his colleagues discovered that if they inoculated rhesus monkeys with a modest amount of HIV protein slowly, over 12 days, that six months later, some of the animals’ B cells were still actively working on building immunity to HIV. In particular, they saw sustained activity of B cells called germinal centers, which are kind of like the body’s antibody evolution engine. These cells were keeping those bits of protein and passing them around, learning from them, and evolving a diverse menagerie of antibody-producing memory B cells in the background. “Mimicking a viral infection by dosing over a longer time frame helps the vaccine engage more of the immune system — it does a much better job at recruiting rare B cells with rare antigen-recognizing properties,” said Crotty. This approach might be overkill for a lot of pathogens that the immune system has a pretty easy time recognizing. But for bugs that cloak their key regions, or mutate very quickly, like HIV, influenza, and to some extent, SARS-CoV-2, then a longer vaccine dose could help overcome that, by giving the body’s immune system more time to come up with more potential ways of seeing the virus. “We wanted to test whether time of exposure mattered or not, and it turns out it can matter a lot,” said Crotty. “For me the take-home message was that we helped reveal a process that we think happens fairly regularly and just hadn’t been realized or observed.” Get your daily dose of health and medicine every weekday with STAT’s free newsletter Morning Rounds.

He does not have the virus, and is not actively shedding the virus,” Blake tweeted on Saturday, Oct. 22. She said he also tested negative for Eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, chlamydia, and salmonella.Instead, Emmanuel’s symptoms, which included “apparent nerve damage” in his right foot, fatigue, lack of appetite, weakness, and a twisted neck, were a result of stress, Blake said.More than 50 birds in Blake’s Florida farm died in just three days following what she believes was the introduction of avian influenza via wild Egyptian geese; any remaining birds in her flock were euthanized by the state, according to her recent tweets. However, it’s unclear whether those birds were ever confirmed to have avian influenza.“Emus are highly susceptible to stress. He was incredibly overwhelmed by the state coming in and euthanizing our flock. (Although it was necessary, it was still very stressful on him). He stopped eating the day they depopulated,” Blake wrote. “Something in my gut just told me that this wasn’t the end for him. So I kept fighting for him, and I don’t regret it. He never once had a single symptom of AI, other than not eating, which is often caused by stress in emus. It was just very coincidental timing.”The news of what could have been the demise of one of TikTok’s favorite birds took the internet by storm. Photos of Blake kissing and cuddling Emmanuel without proper protection concerned virologists and animal handlers who immediately tried to warn the public that those behaviors can not only lead to Blake getting seriously ill, but also give rise to another pandemic.People can contract avian influenza by touching their mouth, eyes, or nose after prolonged, close, and unprotected contact with infected birds’ saliva, feces, or bodily fluids. When a virus jumps from birds to humans, the germ could undergo genetic changes and spread more easily from person to person.Not everyone who gets infected experiences symptoms, but those who do may feel mild illness, such as sore throat, eye redness, runny nose, body aches, headaches, and fatigue. More serious conditions that could require hospitalization, like pneumonia, are possible. Other less common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, or seizures. eco sister @hiitaylorblake I’m getting stronger each day, friends! I am now able to lift myself up and reposition myself on my own. This is a BIG step, because before, I would just fall over. My neck is starting to straighten out and I am drinking lots of water on my own! Thank you for the prayers🙏🏻 03:27 PM - 24 Oct 2022 Reply Retweet Favorite Twitter: @hiitaylorblake After Blake announced Emmanuel’s illness on Oct. 15, people began to accuse her of using the sick bird for attention. Multiple creators pointed out that Blake has attempted to go viral several times over the past 10 years: for playing a “Karen” character in several videos, for keeping a journal of sweet memories to ask out her crush, for a viral video in which she asked a Taco Bell employee to come over for a sleepover, and for appearing on a YouTuber reality show called Reality House.Once clout-chasing allegations surfaced, so did accusations of racism, which were also brought up last time Blake went viral. In 2020, Twitter user @RihIsJamaican shared a thread accusing Blake of downplaying racism by saying it can “only be combated with love.” Recently, others have shared screenshots of racist tweets from 2011, 2012, and 2015 that appeared to be from Blake’s account.People have accused Blake of “rebranding” as a “farm girl” to distract from the allegations. One Twitter user said she felt “duped” by Blake’s pivot to emu content. Blake has continued to provide updates about Emmanuel but has not addressed her past. Ghoulie Andrews 🧛🏻 @JulieMAwesome The whole internet loves Emmanuel the emu and Emu Girl, a lovely duo. *5 seconds later* We regret to inform you the girl is racist. *3 months later* We regret to inform you the emu and girl have now caused a human bird flu pandemic. 06:32 PM - 17 Oct 2022 Reply Retweet Favorite Twitter: @JulieMAwesome Blake has not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment.The timeline of when Emmanuel’s symptoms appeared and when he was tested for bird flu, as well as what tests he received, are also a bit murky.According to Blake’s tweets, Emmanuel “went down” on Oct. 12 following the loss of the majority of her flock over three days. On Oct. 17, Blake’s avian specialist visited her farm to test him for bird flu. Five days later, Blake announced he was negative.Initial avian influenza screening tests can be conducted at any one of the more than 45 laboratories in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network approved by the US Department of Agriculture. In most cases, results will be ready the same day a lab receives a sample.If a test comes back positive for bird flu, samples are sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa — the only lab in the US that can determine the specific strain of the virus. Results typically take about one to two days to come back, but sometimes longer, the USDA says.This is important because bird flu is separated into two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), which causes little to no symptoms in birds, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) — strains that are extremely contagious and deadly to birds, which are likely responsible for the losses at Blake’s farm.HPAI has been spreading in Europe for about a year and recently made its way to Canada. It was detected for the first time in Florida in January and has since been found in several other states, including Kentucky, New York, Virginia, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, and Nebraska.

Ottawa Public Health is encouraging residents to book their annual flu vaccine as soon as possible.Flu vaccines are currently available for older adults and those at higher risk of complications from the flu virus from participating health care providers and pharmacies.Starting November 1, the general public will be eligible to receive their flu vaccine through their health care provider or local participating pharmacy. Vaccine availability may vary by provider.Ottawa Public Health (OPH) will be offering flu vaccine clinics for children aged six months to two years old and their household members. Newcomers and individuals without OHIP who are unable to access a flu vaccine through a primary care provider or pharmacy can also book an appointment in OPH clinics. Starting October 31 at 10 am, individuals in these groups are encouraged to book an appointment at OPH flu vaccine clinics, with appointments available starting November 1. OPH clinics will be operating from Tuesday to Saturday at various locations across the city on a rotating basis. As a precaution, masks are required to be worn in OPH clinical settings at all times.It is safe for individuals aged five and older to receive both the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time. However, individuals aged six months to under five years who received the Moderna Spikevax or the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should not receive another vaccine including the influenza vaccine on the same day or 14 days before or after. This is a precaution to help to determine if a potential side effect is due to the COVID-19 vaccine or another vaccine. If an individual becomes ill with any respiratory illness, they can receive the influenza vaccine as soon as they recover from infection.The flu, or seasonal influenza, is a common contagious infection that affects the nose, throat, and lungs. It is spread through droplets that have been coughed or sneezed by someone who has the flu. You can get the flu by shaking hands with someone who has the flu or by touching surfaces that have come into contact with flu droplets, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.Flu symptoms include a sudden fever as well as a cough and/or a sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, headache or body aches, and chills. You may feel more tired than usual and have a lower appetite. Most people will recover within a week to 10 days, but some people (e.g. children under five years, older adults, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant people) are at greater risk of severe complications such as pneumonia or death. Influenza infection can also worsen certain chronic conditions such as heart disease.We can all continue efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the flu. The best way to protect yourself, those you love and the health care system is through vaccination, wearing a mask, regular hand washing and staying home if you are sick.

The United Kingdom is dealing with its worst ever bird flu outbreak with over 200 cases confirmed across the country in the last 12 months. Under the new plans, the Government will alter the existing bird flu compensation scheme allowing compensation to be paid to farmers from the outset of planned culling rather than at the end. This will allow us to provide swifter payments to help stem any cash flow pressures and give earlier certainty about entitlement to compensation. The payments better reflect the impact of outbreaks on farmers. In consultation with the Food Standards Agency, an easement to marketing rules is also being introduced in England. The measures mean that farmers who breed turkeys, geese or ducks for their meat will have the option to slaughter their flocks early and to freeze these products, which can then be defrosted and sold to consumers between the period 28 November and 31 December 2022. This option will give farmers certainty over business planning. We have a highly resilient food supply chain, producing over 11 million turkeys in the United Kingdom every year, with just under two thirds of these consumed over the Christmas period. Farming Minister Mark Spencer said: Farmers and poultry producers are facing real pressures as a result of this avian flu outbreak, and we know many are concerned about the impact on their flocks We hope the practical solutions announced today will help provide greater financial certainty. We very much appreciate the continued cooperation from the sector as we battle this insidious disease and will continue to keep the situation under close review Last week, the Chief Veterinary Officer introduced a national Avian Influenza Prevention Zone meaning that bird keepers must implement strict biosecurity measures to safeguard their flocks from this highly infectious disease. In addition to this, a regional housing measure remains in place across Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex, where keepers must house their flocks until further notice. All bird keepers (whether they are pet birds, a commercial farm or just a few birds in a backyard flock) must remain vigilant and help prevent avian influenza by: cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control keep records of mortality, movement of poultry and poultry products and any changes in production thoroughly clean and disinfect housing on a continuous basis keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds prevent access by poultry to ponds and watercourses and ensure that birds are kept in fenced or enclosed areas Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find and instead report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77.

It often starts with a headache, body aches, chills and a cough or sore throat. You may also develop a fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, runny nose, and sneezing. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur. With the potential risks posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, limiting the spread of influenza is very important again this year. Getting immunized against the flu is the most effective way to protect yourself, your family and community.

How­ev­er, with the coun­try now in the peak flu sea­son (Oc­to­ber to May in the north­ern hemi­sphere) the Min­istry of Health, for the first time, is in­sti­tut­ing mass vac­ci­na­tion sites to in­oc­u­late the pop­u­la­tion against the dis­ease.These sites will be lo­cat­ed in each Re­gion­al Health Au­thor­i­ty; at the Di­vali Na­gar, the Pad­dock area at the Queen’s Park Sa­van­nah, the San­gre Grande Civic Cen­tre, the Ma­yaro Sports Fa­cil­i­ty, and the Atri­um at Gulf City mall. Ac­cord­ing to the min­istry’s sched­ule, they will be op­er­a­tional from Oc­to­ber 31 to No­vem­ber 6 from 8 am to 3 pm.Speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tu­al press con­fer­ence to launch the vac­ci­na­tion dri­ve on Wednes­day, Min­is­ter of Health Ter­rence Deyals­ingh, said the move to mass sites was in­spired by their suc­cess with COVID-19 vac­ci­na­tions. While these sites come on stream from Mon­day, he said dos­es can be ac­cessed from Fri­day at health cen­tres around the coun­try.“All in all we have about 50 cen­tres which will be gear­ing up from Fri­day. The sched­ule will be pub­lished in the news­pa­pers. It will be on our web­site. It will be on so­cial me­dia,” he said. He said in­di­vid­ual Re­gion­al Health Au­thor­i­ties will al­so be host­ing out­reach ac­tiv­i­ties. File: People wait in line outside the Grand Stand, Queen’s Park Savannah mass vaccination site. July 2021SHIRLEY BAHADURAc­cord­ing to the min­is­ter, T&T re­ceived 75,000 triva­lent dos­es on Tues­day at a cost of $285,000 US. Dr Paras­ram said the dos­es will pro­tect against the H1N1, H3N2 and In­fluen­za B strains of the virus. Deyals­ingh re­mind­ed peo­ple that al­though the symp­toms may be sim­i­lar, the vac­cine pro­tects against in­fluen­za and not the com­mon cold.“Every year peo­ple say when they get the in­fluen­za vac­cine, well I still got the flu. The in­fluen­za vac­cine is to pro­tect you against the dead­ly in­fluen­za A, es­pe­cial­ly, which caus­es the pan­dem­ic, pan­demics around the world, and al­so In­fluen­za B. It is not pro­tec­tive against the nor­mal, gar­den va­ri­ety, com­mon cold,” he said. The min­istry urged those at high risk of an ad­verse out­come from in­fec­tion to avail them­selves of the vac­cine which, over the last 60 years, has proven to be one of the best pro­tec­tions against the virus. Ac­cord­ing to the min­istry, peo­ple in the high-risk group in­clude:Chil­dren aged six months to five years, adults 60 years of age and over, preg­nant women, peo­ple liv­ing with chron­ic ill­ness­es like Di­a­betes, Hy­per­ten­sion, and Heart Dis­ease, peo­ple with com­pro­mised im­mune sys­tems such as those with Lu­pus or Can­cer pa­tients, peo­ple with chron­ic res­pi­ra­to­ry ill­ness­es like Asth­ma and Chron­ic Ob­struc­tive Pul­monary Dis­ease, and health­care work­ers.Ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC), flu symp­toms usu­al­ly come on sud­den­ly. Peo­ple who have flu of­ten feel some or all of the fol­low­ing symp­toms:● fever or feel­ing fever­ish/chills● cough● sore throat● run­ny or stuffy nose● mus­cle or body aches● headaches● fa­tigue (tired­ness)● some peo­ple may have vom­it­ing and di­ar­rhoea, though this is more com­mon in chil­dren than adults.

A 3km Protection Zone and 10km Surveillance Zone are put in place around each premises where a case of avian flu is confirmed. Officers from Lincolnshire Trading Standards visit some properties in the 3km Protection Zones to reassure residents and provide advice to businesses. Other properties may receive a letter with advice and guidance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask. Beware doorstep scammers; officers will be carrying ID, they will not ask for any personal or bank details, and they will not ask to enter the premises. For more information about the current situation, and all the areas affected, please see Defra’s rolling news story. If you own birds A national housing order is now in place across England making it a legal requirement for all bird-keepers to keep all captive birds indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures. If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds you must report it immediately by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. It is vital that everyone who owns birds maintains strong biosecurity to limit the risk of the disease spreading. Additional mandatory restrictions apply in disease control zones in force surrounding infected premises where avian influenza has been confirmed. In the 3km Protection Zone all captive birds must be kept indoors to help limit the spread of the disease. See the avian influenza: cases and disease control zones in England guidance for more information. Find further biosecurity advice on the Animal and Plant Health Agency website. If you have not already, you should register your poultry, even if only kept as pets, so you can be contacted you during an outbreak locally. This is a legal requirement if you have 50 or more birds. Public health The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public’s health is very low. The Food Standards Agency has said that on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Find more advice for members of the public on the Animal and Plant Health Agency website. Wild birds Do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find. If you find dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. Defra will then collect some of these birds and test them to understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. Not all birds will be collected and those that aren’t are the landowner’s responsibility to safely dispose of. Other pets Avian flu primarily effects birds and there is little risk to other pets. There have been no confirmed reports of avian flu spreading to dogs. However, as a precaution, keep your dog away from any dead wild birds you may come across. If you live within a 3km Protection Zone, you are advised to walk your dog on a lead. There have been some cases of avian influenza H5N1 spreading to cats from eating infected wild birds, although these are not widespread. If you live within a 3km Protection Zone, you may want to consider keeping your cat indoors if it is known to catch wild birds. Check if you live within a Protection Zone using the map on the APHA website.
