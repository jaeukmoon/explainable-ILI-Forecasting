- The study discusses the development of an engineered influenza virus for delivering antigens for lung cancer vaccination.
- The researchers used a chimeric antigenic peptide influenza virus (CAP-Flu) system to deliver antigenic peptides to the lung.
- Attenuated influenza viruses were conjugated with an immunostimulatory agent called CpG and administered intranasally to the mouse lung.
- The vaccination with the engineered virus showed increased immune cell infiltration to the tumor, antigen uptake by dendritic cells, a specific immune cell response, increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, regression of lung metastases, and prolonged mouse survival after rechallenge.
- The engineered influenza virus can be equipped with any tumor neoantigen to generate lung cancer vaccines.
