It is caused by specific type A influenza viruses known to infect, cause illness, and spread in dogs. In general, canine influenza viruses are thought to pose a low threat to people. Signs and symptoms Canine influenza, also known as dog flu, is currently caused by an influenza A(H3N2) virus that spreads in dogs. Dog flu likely poses a low threat to people. Canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that commonly spread among people. To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people. There has not been a single reported case of human infection with a canine influenza virus anywhere in the world. In 2016, CDC used the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool to evaluate the potential risk of canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses causing a pandemic and found it to be low. Evolving viruses Influenza viruses are constantly changing. It is possible that a canine influenza A virus could change to gain the ability to infect and spread easily between people. Humans have little immunity against new, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A viruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily among people, it could result in a pandemic. For this reason, the World Health Organization conducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus infections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin (such as avian or swine influenza A viruses). Signs of Illness in Dogs The signs of this illness in dogs include: cough, runny nose, fever, lethary, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. However, not all dogs will show signs of illness. The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death. Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs may develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing signs of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian. Testing is available to confirm canine influenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate. Understanding risk H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States but multiple, localized outbreaks with regional die-outs continue to occur, seeded by repeated re-introductions from Asia. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. If evidence emerges that canine influenza viruses can infect people with the potential for sustained human-to-human spread, CDC has a plan in place. CDC will execute its existing authorities to limit the introduction and/or spread of that pandemic virus into or within the United States. CDC regulations require that dogs be healthy to enter the United States. Dogs may be denied entry or further evaluated if they look like they could be sick with a communicable disease. For dogs that appear sick or are dead upon arrival in the United States, CDC can require a veterinary examination or a necropsy (animal autopsy) at the owner's expense. Multiple agencies may have regulatory authority over pets such as dogs and cats when entering the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services has animal health requirements related to bringing a pet dog to the United States from a foreign country. How it spreads Almost all dogs are susceptible to dog flu infection. Dog flu tends to spread among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. Dog flu is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when infected dogs cough or sneeze. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. What CDC is doing about dog flu‎ Current CDC influenza virus regulations apply only to viruses with pandemic potential in people. However, CDC is doing a number of things to be prepared in the unlikely event that dog flu becomes a threat to humans or to animals other than dogs. CDC continues to conduct year-round surveillance for seasonal and novel influenza A viruses. All human infections with novel influenza A viruses are fully investigated. Human infections with a novel influenza A virus of animal origin are reportable to CDC. CDC has existing collaborative protocols with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services to work together in the event of outbreaks of novel influenza A viruses. These same protocols would be followed in the event of an outbreak of dog flu among people. Third, CDC conducted a risk assessment on the pandemic potential of H3N2 canine influenza viruses using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool. The assessment found the pandemic risk posed by canine influenza viruses to be low. Prevention Vaccines to protect dogs against H3N2 dog flu are available in the United States. Your veterinarian can provide additional information about these vaccines and whether you should consider vaccinating your dog. Dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not expose their dog to other dogs or to cats. After exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease, people should clean and disinfect clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands. Biology Origins of H3N8 Canine Influenza Canine influenza H3N8 viruses originated in horses and spread to dogs. H3N8 equine (horse) influenza (flu) viruses have been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs were reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by equine influenza viruses. Scientists believe that after jumping from horses to dogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads especially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus. In September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as a "newly emerging pathogen in the dog population" in the United States. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. Origins of H3N2 Canine Influenza Canine influenza H3N2 viruses originated in birds and spread to dogs. The first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been reported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been reported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in the United States in April 2015. They have now been found in multiple U.S. states and regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been almost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia. Treatment Treatment for dog flu largely consists of supportive care. In milder cases, supportive care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well hydrated. This helps to keep the dog comfortable and hydrated while its body mounts an immune response. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed by your veterinarian if they suspect a secondary bacterial infection. Dog flu risk‎ A small percentage of dogs die from dog flu. Some dogs have asymptomatic infections (no signs of illness), while some have severe illness. Severe illness is characterized by the onset of pneumonia.

To assess this threat, using the ferret model, we show an H5N1 isolate derived from mink transmits by direct contact to 75% of exposed ferrets and, in airborne transmission studies, the virus transmits to 37.5% of contacts. Sequence analyses show no mutations were associated with transmission. The H5N1 virus also has a low infectious dose and remains virulent at low doses. This isolate carries the adaptive mutation, PB2 T271A, and reversing this mutation reduces mortality and airborne transmission. This is the first report of a H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus exhibiting direct contact and airborne transmissibility in ferrets. These data indicate heightened pandemic potential of the panzootic H5N1 viruses and emphasize the need for continued efforts to control outbreaks and monitor viral evolution.

Human infections with these viruses were first documented in China and Hong Kong in 19971,2,3. Since then, there have been nearly 900 human cases worldwide with 50% mortality4. While these viruses emerged in Asia, they have been carried between continents by migratory birds and caused destructive poultry outbreaks in several countries. In 2021, a new H5N1 variant belonging to the subclade 2.3.4.4b rapidly dominated circulation in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Alarmingly, these viruses became endemic in wild-bird populations and expanded into avian species not typically affected. Their broad host and geographic ranges combined with high virulence led to ecological devastation, including large die-offs5. In late 2021, subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses were first detected in North America. These viruses have now spread throughout North America and into South America where they continue to plague both wild and domestic bird populations. Across affected regions, subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses have spilled over into several mammalian species with infections documented in skunks, foxes, bears, and seals5,6. Moreover, seven human infections with subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses have been documented between January of 2022 and March 20237.To cause a pandemic, an influenza A virus must be able to replicate efficiently in humans and transmit via the airborne route from person-to-person. Owing to similarities to humans in their susceptibility, ferrets are a valuable model in which to evaluate influenza virus transmission and pathogenesis, and ferrets are routinely used to assess pandemic risk. Ferrets possess a similar distribution of viral receptors (i.e.,α 2,6-linked sialic acids) to that observed in humans and, upon infection with human influenza viruses, ferrets develop clinical illness and shed high levels of infectious virus. Also consistent with influenza in humans, ferrets infected with human-adapted strains transmit the virus through the air to contact animals8. To date, no subclade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has exhibited the ability to transmit by the airborne route, a feature thought to be critical in limiting their outbreak potential in humans. However, experimental studies have demonstrated the potential for an ancestral clade 2.1.3.2 H5N1 virus to become airborne transmissible in ferrets9.In October of 2022, an outbreak of highly pathogenic subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus was reported in farmed mink in Spain10. Infected mink developed severe clinical disease that included reduced activity and feeding, bleeding from the snout, and neurological signs (ataxia and tremors). There was also evidence of mink-to-mink viral transmission; however, the mode of transmission could not be defined. To control the outbreak, all the mink on the farm were culled. During these efforts, farm workers were monitored for infection and no cases were detected among them. The use of face masks and other precautions implemented due to outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in mink may have offered protection10. Widespread infection of a mammalian species, and especially transmission among individuals, is concerning as it creates the opportunity for these avian influenza viruses to adapt to mammals, potentially increasing the risk of a pandemic.To assess the risk to humans, we evaluated the potential for an H5N1 isolate from this mink outbreak to infect, cause disease, and transmit in ferrets. As isolates from the mink outbreak could not be readily obtained, we generated recombinant influenza A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022 (H5N1) virus [A/mink (H5N1)] using reverse genetics. Four whole genome sequences for viruses from the mink outbreak had previously been deposited in repositories (i.e., GISAID) and were publicly available. Two viruses shared the same amino acid changes across the genome compared to the closely related viruses of the A/gull/France/22P015977/2022-like genotype, while the remaining two viruses each had unique mutations10. Therefore, we selected one of the two viruses with shared amino acid changes for our analysis. All viruses from this outbreak carried the mammalian-adaptive mutation T271A, and several additional mutations were identified throughout the genome; however, as previously reported, the function of these later mutations is unknown10. Virus rescue or regeneration, and all subsequent experiments were performed following strict biosafety protocols in our biosafety level 3 enhanced facility, and all studies were conducted following all local, state, and federal rules and regulations.ResultsEvaluation of contact and respiratory transmissionTo evaluate direct contact transmission, donor ferrets were inoculated with 106 tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) of the A/mink (H5N1) virus and were allowed to recover for 24 h. Subsequently, each infected donor (DR) ferret and an uninfected direct contact (DC) animal were co-housed in the same cage. To assess airborne transmission, DR ferrets were similarly inoculated and 24 h post-infection, each DR animal was paired with single respiratory contact (RC) animal in a transmission cage. The airborne transmission cage is designed such that the DR and RC ferrets cannot come into direct physical contact, but the animals share the same airspace. For both direct contact and respiratory transmission, nasal wash samples were collected from each animal on alternate days for 13 days to detect replicating virus. At the time of euthanasia, serum was collected and seroconversion against A/mink H5N1 was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.In the direct contact transmission studies, all donors became infected after inoculation and shed high titers of infectious virus in the nasal wash from days 1–7 post-infection (p.i.) (Fig. 1A). From days 1 to 12 p.i., all donor animals lost 20–25% body weight and three ferrets reached humane endpoint and were euthanized (Fig. 1C). Three of four DC ferrets showed evidence of replicating virus in their nasal wash with titers ranging from 102.7–104.45 TCID50/mL (Fig. 1B). DC2 shed virus from days 3 to 9 post-contact (p.c.), DC4 shed virus on days 7 to 11 p.c., and DC1 shed virus on days 9, 11 p.c. (Fig. 1B). DC animals that shed virus also lost 3–25% body weight, and two contact ferrets reached humane endpoint and were euthanized (Fig. 1D). To verify transmission, hemagglutination inhibition assays (HI) were performed on serum collected at the time of euthanasia. All three contacts that shed virus also developed antibodies to A/mink (H5N1), although titers were low for the DC2 and DC4 animals likely due to reaching endpoint shortly after becoming infected. The one contact animal that did not shed virus (i.e., DC3) also did not seroconvert (Table 1).Fig. 1: Direct contact transmission, weight loss, and survival for ferrets infected with A/mink (H5N1).Four donor ferrets were inoculated with A/mink (H5N1) and 24 h later each donor was paired with a contact in the same cage. Nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 13 days, and weight loss and clinical signs were monitored. A, B display viral titers from donor and direct contacts, respectively. C, D show weight loss from donors and direct contacts, respectively. DR and DC denote donors and direct contacts, respectively. Each bar or line represents an individual ferret. Males are DR1, DR2, DC1 and DC2, and females are DR3, DR4, DC3 and DC4. E denotes euthanasia. Ferrets DR1, DR2, and DR4, were euthanized on day 11, 6, and 8, respectively due to pronounced weight loss, diarrhea, and nasal discharge.

We performed two separate studies using the same experimental design with four transmission pairs per study. In the first airborne transmission study, all donor (DR) ferrets became productively infected with high titers of infectious virus detected in nasal wash from days 1–7 p.i. (Fig. 2A). Between days 1 and 9 p.i. the donor animals lost 13–20% body weight (Fig. 2C), and one animal later reached humane endpoint criteria requiring euthanasia. In the paired respiratory contacts (RC), two of four animals showed evidence of replicating virus in the nasal wash (Fig. 2B). RC2 shed virus on days 9 and 11 p.c. with titers greater than 105 TCID50/mL of nasal wash. This ferret also lost weight after day 8 and displayed neurological signs on day 12 p.c. requiring euthanasia (Fig. 2D). Replicating virus was also detected at low levels in nasal wash from the RC1 ferret on days 5 and 13 p.c. In compliance with our approved IACUC protocol nasal wash samples were not collected after day 13 p.c.; however, the RC1 animal lost weight starting on day 10 and exhibited 11.5% body weight loss on day 13 p.c. To confirm infection, we measured antibody titers against the H5N1 virus using serum collected on day 21 p.c. (Table 1). The RC1 animal developed antibodies against the A/mink (H5N1) virus, while the RC3 and RC4 animals did not seroconvert. Seroconversion was not assessed in RC2 as blood could not be collected (due to severe dehydration) prior to euthanasia. All 3 DR animals that survived until the end of the study also seroconverted (Table 1). The combined detection of replicating virus, clinical illness, and seroconversion in the RC1 and RC2 ferrets confirms these animals were infected by the airborne route. Therefore, the A/mink (H5N1) virus transmitted to 50% of respiratory contact animals in the first replicate experiment.Fig. 2: Airborne transmission, weight loss and survival for ferrets infected with A/ mink (H5N1).Two separate airborne transmission studies were performed. In each study, four donor ferrets were inoculated with A/mink (H5N1) and 24 h later each donor (DR) was paired with a single respiratory contact (RC) in a transmission cage. Nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 14 days, and weight loss and clinical signs were monitored. Transmission study 1 is depicted in (A–D), and transmission study 2 is shown in (E–H). Transmission study 1: A, B display viral titers from DR and RCs, respectively. C, D show weight loss from DR and RCs, respectively. Transmission study 2: E, F display viral titers from DR and RCs, respectively. G, H show weight loss from DR and RCs, respectively. Each bar or line represents an individual ferret. Males are DR1, DR2, RC1, and RC2 and females are DR3, DR4, RC3 and RC4. E denotes euthanasia. Study 1: ferret DR3 was euthanized on day 13 due to pronounced weight loss and RC2 was euthanized on day 12 post-contact due to neurological symptoms (hind-limb paralysis). Study 2: ferret DR1, DR3, DR4 were euthanized on days 7, 9, and 8, respectively, due to pronounced weight loss, and RC2 was euthanized on day 13 post-contact due to nasal hemorrhage. Dotted line denotes limit of detection. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageIn the second study, consistent with the prior contact and airborne transmission studies, all donor ferrets became infected and shed high titers of virus from day 1–7 p.i. (Fig. 2E). All DR ferrets lost between 15–25% body weight by day 9 p.i., and three ferrets reached humane endpoint and had to be euthanized (Fig. 2G). One of four respiratory contact ferrets (i.e., RC2) shed virus at day 9, 11 and 13 p.c. (Fig. 2F). This ferret (RC2) lost 15% body weight and reached humane endpoint due to nasal hemorrhage requiring euthanasia (Fig. 2H). However, RC2 did not seroconvert (Table 1), most likely due to rapid progression to endpoint criteria with onset of shedding on day 9 p.c. and euthanasia on day 13 p.c. The measurement of replicating virus in the nasal wash, clinical illness and severe disease confirm that one ferret was infected by the airborne route in our second study. Thus, we report that A/mink (H5N1) transmitted to 25% of respiratory contact animals in the second study, and the combined transmission efficiency from both studies was 37.5%. Interestingly, for each transmission study we used two pairs of male and female ferrets and, of the three RC ferrets that became infected, all were males.Sequence analysis of A/mink (H5N1) viruses transmitted by direct and respiratory contactTo determine if adaptive mutations in the A/mink (H5N1) virus were associated with direct contact or airborne transmission, we performed a deep sequencing analyses of viruses shed in the nasal wash of infected donors and contacts. To enhance the detection of variants, viral RNA was isolated and sequenced from nasal wash samples on the day of peak titer for each animal. We identified more non-synonymous and synonymous single nucleotide variants in the infected direct contact ferrets compared to infected respiratory contacts. However, no synonymous or non-synonymous mutations were shared or consistently identified in either direct or respiratory contact animals, and no mutations consistently became enriched in the contact animals compared to donors (Fig. S1 and Table S1). Collectively, this analysis shows that direct contact and airborne transmission was not linked to changes in the A/mink (H5N1) virus.Assessment of virulence and infectious doseTo evaluate virulence of the A/mink (H5N1) virus, we performed a dose de-escalation study. This approach allows quantification of the median infectious dose and evaluation of disease severity across a range of doses likely to be representative of natural exposures. Groups of ferrets (n = 4/group, equal numbers of male and females/group) were inoculated with 10-fold decreasing doses of virus from 103–100 TCID50. Nasal wash samples were then collected every other day for 9 days and clinical disease was monitored for 14 days. At inoculation doses of 101–103 TCID50, all animals became infected, lost weight, and exhibited severe clinical disease consistent with that observed in farmed mink10 (Fig. 3). Clinical signs included fever, reduced activity, respiratory symptoms, and diarrhea (see Tables S2 and S3 for detailed clinical scoring). Ferrets from groups infected with both low and moderate infectious doses exhibited increases in body temperature indicative of fever (Table S2). One animal exhibited bleeding from the nose, while another animal had bleeding from the anus. Multiple animals also exhibited neurological disease including ataxia and hindlimb paralysis. Except for one animal in the group inoculated with 103 TCID50, all the ferrets inoculated with virus doses of 101–103 TCID50 reached humane endpoints and were euthanized (Fig. 3I–K). In the group of animals infected with 100 TCID50, one animal shed replicating virus in the nasal wash, lost weight, and reached humane endpoint (Fig. 3D, H, L). A second animal also lost weight and developed neurological signs requiring euthanasia but did not shed replicating virus in the nasal wash. This suggests the virus may have been replicating in the lungs and/or other extrapulmonary organs. The remaining two animals did not shed virus or show signs of disease. Importantly, we did not observe differences in mortality or symptom severity between male and females. Based on the criteria that viral shedding was indicative of infection, the 50% median infectious dose (ID50) was 3 TCID50 (Table 2), and if clinical illness was used to determine infection status, the ID50 was reduced to 1 TCID50. Strikingly, the A/mink (H5N1) virus induced severe disease even when applied at a minimal infectious dose.Fig. 3: A/mink (H5N1) virus has a low infectious dose in ferrets and remains virulent at low doses.Groups of ferrets (n = 4/group) were inoculated with 103 (purple), 102 (green), 101 (orange) or 100 (blue) TCID50 of A/mink (H5N1). Nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 9 days and clinical signs were monitored for 14 days. The inoculation dose for each group of ferrets is indicated at the top of the figure. A–D Viral titers in the nasal wash samples at each inoculation dose, E–H weight loss in each ferret after virus inoculation, and I–L percent survival in each group of ferrets. For (A–H), each line represents an individual ferret. Males are F1 and F2 and females are F3 and F4. Nasal wash samples were titrated on MDCK cells and results are expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50). Dotted line denotes limit of detection. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTable 2 Infectious dose 50% for A/mink (H5N1) and two pandemic influenza virusesFull size tableAs median infectious dose is not commonly determined in ferrets, it was difficult to interpret the significance of a low infectious dose. To give a reference for comparison, we therefore determined the ID50 of representative human isolates from the 1968 H3N2 and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemics (A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) [1968 H3N2] and A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) [2009 H1N1] viruses, respectively). Both viruses were generated using reverse genetics and groups of 4 ferrets were inoculated with 10-fold decreasing doses from 102–100 TCID50. Neither pandemic virus caused severe disease in ferrets; however, the ID50 was very low. The 1968 H3N2 and 2009 H1N1 viruses had ID50 values of 5 TCID50 and 1 TCID50, respectively (Table 2). Thus, the ID50 for the A/mink (H5N1) virus is within the range of previous pandemic influenza viruses.Evaluation of the PB2 T271A mutation in virulence and airborne transmissionThe A/mink (H5N1) virus possesses alanine (A) at position 271 of PB2 which differs from the avian consensus sequence PB2 271T for subclade 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated in Europe10. Prior studies have demonstrated that PB2 271A contributes to mammalian adaptation of avian viruses11,12,13. Therefore, we next sought to assess the implications of this amino acid change for the phenotype of A/mink (H5N1). Using site directed mutagenesis we reversed the PB2 271A to 271T. To verify that this change altered polymerase function, we performed mini-genome assays. Introduction of PB2 A271T significantly reduced polymerase activity relative to the wild-type polymerase of the A/mink (H5N1) virus (Fig. 4A) at both 33 and 37 °C. When polymerase activity was expressed relative to wild-type, the PB2 A271T change reduced activity by 75% at 33 °C, and 50% at 37 °C (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4: PB2 A271T exhibits decreased polymerase activity in vitro and decreased mortality in ferrets relative to wild-type A/mink (H5N1).Polymerase activity was determined by performing mini-genome assays in 293T cells at 33 and 37 °C. A Activity of the wild-type polymerase versus the polymerase with the mutation PB2 A271T at 24 h post-transfection. B Activity of the polymerase carrying the PB2 A271T mutation expressed as a percent of the activity of the wild-type polymerase. Data shown are mean ± SD from 1 of 3 representative independent experiments with n = 3 biologically independent samples/experiment. C–E display ferret studies. Four ferrets per group were inoculated with 102 TCID50/mL of either wild-type A/mink (H5N1) (i.e., PB2 271A) or A/mink (H5N1) with PB2 A271T mutation. Nasal wash samples were collected every other day, and weight loss and clinical signs were monitored daily for 14 days. C Displays viral titers as mean ± SD, D shows weight loss for individual animals, and E depicts survival (n = 4/group). Blue and green bars and lines represent wild-type PB2 and PB2 A271T, respectively.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSince we observed a decrease in polymerase activity when the PB2 mutation was reversed, we sought to assess the contribution of this mutation to virulence in ferrets. In the ID50 studies, an inoculation dose of 102 TCID50 of recombinant wild-type A/mink (H5N1) consistently resulted in a productive infection with weight loss and 100% mortality (Fig. 3B, F, J). Therefore, to assess the role of PB2 A271T, groups of ferrets (n = 4/group) were intranasally inoculated with wild-type A/mink (H5N1) or A/mink (H5N1) virus carrying the PB2 A271T mutation at a dose of 102 TCID50. Nasal wash samples were then collected every other day and weight loss, clinical signs, and survival were monitored. Consistent with our initial ID50 studies, all ferrets inoculated with the wild-type A/mink (H5N1) virus shed high titers of virus in their nasal wash and developed severe disease requiring euthanasia. Conversely, while all ferrets became infected with the PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1) virus, mortality was reduced with only one of four ferrets reaching endpoint criteria requiring euthanasia (Fig. 4E). In parallel with reduced mortality, there were non-significant decreases in viral shedding from the nose, peak viral titers, and weight loss in the PB2 A271T group compared to wild-type group (Figs. 4C, D and 6A, C). Thus, introducing the PB2 A271T mutation in the A/mink (H5N1) virus reduced polymerase activity and mortality in the ferret model.Next, we assessed airborne transmission of the A/mink (H5N1) virus with PB2 A271T mutation. Four donor ferrets were intranasally inoculated with 106 TCID50 of this virus, and 24 h post-infection, these animals were paired with RC ferrets in our transmission cages. As observed with wild-type A/mink (H5N1) infection, all DR ferrets became infected and shed high titers of virus (Fig. 5A). However, only one of four donor ferrets infected with PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1) shed virus on day 7 p.i., while all DR ferrets infected with the wild-type virus shed high titers on day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2A, E). One of four DR ferrets infected with PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1) virus lost 25% body weight and was euthanized in accordance with endpoint criteria (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, no RC ferrets shed virus or lost weight. Three RC animals did not seroconvert, while one animal (i.e., RC2) had an HI titer of 1:20. As this animal did not shed virus, the low HI titer suggests the animal was exposed to virus but did not develop a robust infection (Fig. 5B, D and Table 1). To determine if mutations emerged during viral replication of the PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1) virus in DR ferrets, we sequenced viral RNA recovered from the nasal wash at the time of peak shedding in these animals. Consistent with transmission studies using the wild-type A/mink (H5N1) virus, we did not identify any synonymous or non-synonymous mutations that were shared by different donor ferrets, and no mutations were identified at a frequency above 8% (Fig. S1 and Table S1). Last, we compared the peak viral titers and total amount of virus shed from the DR ferrets infected with 106 TCID50 of wild-type A/mink (H5N1) (Fig. 2, DR ferrets) or A/mink (H5N1) with PB2 A271T (Fig. 5, DR ferrets). We did not observe any significant differences in peak titers (Fig. 6B). However, animals infected with the A/mink (H5N1) PB2 A271T virus shed significantly less virus during the course of infection than ferrets infected with the wild-type virus as determined by area under the curve (Fig. 6D). Therefore, the PB2 A271T mutation led to a reduction in airborne transmission, as evidenced by a lack of shedding in the RC ferrets, an outcome which may relate to an overall reduction in viral shedding from donor (DR) ferrets.Fig. 5: Airborne transmission, weight loss and survival for ferrets infected with PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1).Four donor ferrets were inoculated with A/mink (H5N1) PB2 A271T and 24 h later each donor was paired with a single respiratory contact in a transmission cage. Nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 14 days, and weight loss and clinical signs were monitored. A, C, and B, D display viral titers and weight loss from individual donor and respiratory contacts, respectively. DR and RC denote donor and respiratory contact, respectively. Each bar or line represents an individual animal. Males are DR1, DR2, RC1 and RC2 and females are DR3, DR4, RC3 and RC4. E denotes euthanasia. Ferret DR4 was euthanized on day 10 due to pronounced weight loss. Dotted line denotes limit of detection.

A, C show peak titers and total viral shedding, respectively, for ferrets infected at a dose of 102 TCID50 (n = 4/virus) in studies comparing viral shedding, weight loss, and survival (Fig. 4). B, D compared donor ferrets from both airborne transmission study 1 and 2 (combined n = 8) that were inoculated with wild-type A/mink (H5N1) to the donor ferrets for the transmission study with PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1) (n = 4) virus. For all transmission studies, the inoculation dose in donors was 106 TCID50. Total viral shedding was determined via area under the curve (AUC) analyses of viral titers in the nasal wash from days 1–7. Values shown are mean ± SE. Peak titers and AUC values for each virus were compared using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p = 0.039. Blue and green represent wild-type and PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1), respectively, at an inoculation of 102, while red and purple represent the same viruses, respectively, at an inoculation dose of 106. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageDiscussionCollectively, our studies show that the A/mink (H5N1) virus transmitted efficiently by direct contact, with 75% of contact animals infected, and inefficiently via the airborne route with 37.5% of respiratory contact animals developing an infection. Sequence analyses of viruses shed in the nasal wash from infected donor and contact animals did not show evidence of positive selection acting during direct contact or airborne transmission. In dose de-escalation studies, the A/mink (H5N1) virus had a low infectious dose, and the virus was highly virulent across a wide range of doses as all infected animals developed severe disease. Although we observed efficient direct contact transmission, it was delayed relative to that seen previously with pandemic influenza viruses. For pandemic influenza viruses, viral shedding in direct contacts often begins on day 1 p.c. 14,15. Here, the onset of shedding was on day 3 p.c. in one contact, and on days 7 and 9 p.c., respectively, in the others. While airborne transmission was observed, it occurred at lower efficiency than is typical for pandemic influenza viruses. Pandemic influenza viruses transmit to 75–100% of respiratory contact ferrets within 3–5 days after pairing14,16,17,18. By comparison, the A/mink (H5N1) virus transmitted to fewer contacts and with slower kinetics: in the first replicate, we first detected replicating virus in a contact on day 5 p.c., but clear evidence of productive viral replication did not occur until after day 9. In the second replicate, we detected replicating virus on day 9 p.c. and observed higher titers on day 13 p.c. Thus, the transmission observed in our studies is indicative of increased pandemic potential relative to previously characterized strains of highly pathogenic H5N19,19,20,21,22,23,24,25, but the A/mink (H5N1) virus does not exhibit transmission phenotypes consistent with pandemic strains.Previous experimental work assessing the pandemic risk of H5N1 avian influenza viruses did not detect transmission of these viruses through the air. Unlike the A/mink H5N1 virus examined here, most of these studies were performed with isolates from birds or from clades older than 2.3.4.4b9,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. In one partial exception, 3 of 9 clade 2.2.1.2 highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses transmitted to respiratory contact ferrets in 1 or 2 of 2 transmission pairs; however, the transmissibility of these viruses could not be reproduced in subsequent experiments using 4–6 pairs of ferrets24. A recent report also characterized recombinant subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from mink during the same outbreak as the mink isolate examined herein. In these studies, airborne transmission was evaluated using three pairs of ferrets for two isolates: A/mink/Spain/22VIR12774-13_3869-2/2022 (H5N1) and A/mink/Spain/22VIR12774-14_3869-3/2022 (H5N1). Neither isolate transmitted via the airborne route to contact ferrets26. As in our study, donor ferrets were inoculated with 106 infectious units, and thus donor inoculation dose is unlikely to have contributed to differences in transmission. However, comparison of the amino acid sequences for these viruses relative to the A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022 (H5N1) strain used in our studies showed both isolates differed by 3 or more amino acids across the viral genome (Table S4). Changes were identified in the polymerase genes, neuraminidase, non-structural protein 1 and/or nuclear export protein (i.e., NS2), and it is possible these mutations may have contributed to differences in transmission.Two additional risk assessment studies have evaluated the transmissibility of recent clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses isolated in North America27,28. In one, direct contact transmission was evaluated for two viruses: A/American wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021 (H5N1) [Wigeon/SC/21] and A/Bald eagle/Florida/W22-134-OP/2022 [Eagle/FL/22]27. The Wigeon/SC/21 virus is representative of early H5N1 viruses introduced into North America and has a similar genotype to viruses circulating in Eurasia. The Eagle/FL/22 virus carries PB2, PB1, and NP gene segments from North American low pathogenic avian influenza viruses, acquired by reassortment. In direct contact transmission experiments, none of the contact animals became infected or seroconverted; however, a striking difference in disease severity was observed in the donor ferrets. Donors infected with the Wigeon/SC/21 virus had mild disease, while all donors infected with the Eagle/FL/22 virus developed severe disease (i.e., weight loss, lethargy, and neurological signs) requiring euthanasia27. In a separate study, direct contact transmission of four North American lineage clade 2.3.4.4b viruses was evaluated28. In donor ferrets, the A/Red tailed hawk/Ontario/FAV-0473-4/2022 (H5N1) [RT.Hawk/ON/22] and A/Red fox/Ontario/FAV-301-05/2022 (H5N1) viruses caused severe disease and transmitted to 2/2 and 1/2 contacts, respectively. In follow-up studies with the RT.Hawk/ON/22 virus, donor ferrets were housed with both a direct contact and respiratory contact ferret. In this experimental system, 3 of 4 (75%) direct contact ferrets became infected and one respiratory contact had replicating virus recovered from a nasal swab on day 7 post-contact. On day 8 post-contact, all animals were euthanized to collect tissue samples, and replicating virus was not recovered in tissues from the airborne contacts28. During this transmission experiment, severe disease was again observed, with ferrets rapidly progressing to endpoint criteria. The observed 75% direct contact transmission is consistent with that seen here with the A/mink (H5N1) virus. Collectively, experimental data indicate that some clade 2.3.4.4b viruses of both the North American and Eurasian lineages transmit between ferrets that are in direct contact and that these viruses possess potential for limited airborne transmission. These findings emphasize the pandemic potential of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses.Importantly, we previously participated in an international exercise designed to evaluate the reproducibility of airborne influenza virus transmission in independent ferret model systems29. This exercise used a study design in which each donor ferret was paired with a single respiratory contact, and direct contact transmission was not assessed. We reported 100% airborne transmission of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, consistent with 9 of 10 other groups, and we reported 25% airborne transmission of an avian H1N1 virus which was also observed by 2 of 9 other groups. One additional research group in this study reported 75% airborne transmission of the avian H1N1 virus. This study indicates that our experimental system is broadly comparable to other groups; however, it is important to highlight that our transmission studies are conducted in rooms with dedicated humidity and temperature control systems that maintain environmental conditions within narrowly defined parameters. Throughout the experiments reported here, the temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 21 ± 0.1 °C and 36 ± 4%, respectively. As prior studies in guinea pigs have shown these conditions favor airborne transmission of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses, and that increases in either temperature or humidity reduce transmission30,31, our experimental system may have increased sensitivity for detecting airborne transmission.The low median infectious dose observed for A/mink (H5N1) was comparable to the two most recent pandemic influenza viruses, indicating that the ability to infect and replicate in ferrets is not likely limiting transmission. Prior adaptation studies have shown that changes in the HA to reduce the pH of fusion and enhance binding to α2-6-linked sialic acids combined with mutations to enhance polymerase activity in mammalian cells are required for airborne transmission of a highly pathogenic clade 2.3.1.2 H5N1 virus9,32. The A/mink (H5N1) virus does not carry mutations known to reduce the pH of fusion or enhance binding to α2-6-linked sialic acids; however, the virus does carry the PB2 T271A mutation which has been shown to enhance polymerase activity and replication of avian viruses in mammalian cells. Consistent with this observation, we show that reversing the PB2 mutation (i.e., 271T) in A/mink (H5N1) reduced viral polymerase activity in mini-genome assays. Moreover, introducing the PB2 A271T mutation reduced mortality and resulted in a reduction in the number of RC ferrets that shed virus in airborne transmission studies. This was associated with reductions in viral titers in the nasal wash which were not significant at lower inoculation doses used to assess virulence but were significant at high inoculation doses used for transmission studies. These findings indicate the PB2 T271A mutation is enhancing viral replication of the A/mink (H5N1) virus contributing to both virulence and transmission in ferrets. As our studies assessed viral load in the nasal wash, future studies are warranted to assess the impact of the PB2 T271A mutation on viral replication in the lungs and systemic dissemination of the virus. Moreover, evaluating the role of the PB2 T271A mutation in the context of direct contact transmission will yield additional insight on the contribution of this mutation to the overall transmissibility of the virus.An important consideration in interpreting our results with respect to the risk posed to humans is that the ferrets used in these studies have no pre-existing immunity to influenza, whereas the majority of humans have been exposed to H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses. While different influenza A virus subtypes are antigenically distinct, some degree of cross-protection against H5N1 may be conferred by prior exposure to these seasonal strains, especially against the N1 neuraminidase. Indeed, antibodies and T cells against seasonal influenza viruses have been shown to cross-react with H5N1 viruses33,34,35,36,37,38. Future studies are warranted to determine if prior immunity reduces disease severity and/or transmission. In conclusion, this is the first report of both direct contact and limited airborne transmission in a mammalian model of a subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus indicating these viruses pose a significant pandemic threat. Therefore, ongoing risk assessment and enhanced surveillance in wild and domestic animals is warranted to monitor the threat posed by these viruses as they continue to evolve and spillover into mammals, including humans.MethodsEthics statement, biocontainment, and animal care and useAll studies were conducted in compliance with all local, state, and federal rules and regulations. Experiments using the A/mink (H5N1) virus or derivatives were conducted in our Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved high containment biosafety level 3 enhanced laboratory. All experiments were conducted in accordance with Institutional Biosafety Committee Protocol No. 48971 and Institutional Animal Care and Use (IACUC) Protocol No. 201800250.Cell linesMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) Cells, London Line, FR-58, was obtained through the International Reagent Resource, Influenza Division, WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T) (CRL-3216) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM (Cytiva) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Seradigm), 25 mM HEPES buffer, 2 mM L-glutamine (Corning) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco). 293T cells were cultured in the same media without HEPES buffer. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Generation, culture, and titration of virusesGene sequences for A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022 (H5N1) (GISAID Accession# EPI2220590-EPI2220597) were synthesized by Twist Biosciences and cloned into bi-directional reverse genetics plasmids39. For gene sequences missing the complete untranslated region, the missing region was replaced by that from A/mink/Spain/22VIR12774_14_3869-3/2022 (H5N1) (GISAID Accession # EPI2291511–EPI2291518). Reverse genetics plasmids were amplified in stable competent high efficiency E. coli cells (New England BioLabs), purified using a HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi-Prep Kit (Qiagen), and sequenced by Plasmidsaurus (Eugene, OR). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL, Agilent) was performed to generate the PB2 A271T mutant. Primers were as follows: Forward g811a_a813g_aaatatcgttaggagagcaacggtatcagcagacccattgg, Reverse a813g_ g811a_ccaatgggtctgctgata ccgttgctctcctaacgatattt (Integrated DNA Technologies). The virus was rescued by transfecting a MDCK-293T co-culture with all 8 reverse genetics plasmids using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus)40. Subsequently, to generate a virus stock, the virus was passaged twice in MDCK cells cultured in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 ug/mL of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington). The TCID50 of the stock was determined by infecting 24-well plates of MDCK cells with serial dilutions of virus. Plates were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and scored for cytopathic effect. The TCID50 was then calculated using the method of Reed and Muench41. Recombinant A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) [2009 H1N1] and A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) [1968 H3N2] viruses were generated using the same methodology. Viral stock titers for A/mink (H5N1), A/mink (H5N1) PB2 A271T, 2009 H1N1, and 1968 H3N2 were 107.5625, 108.8125, 107.125, and 106.875 TCID50/mL, respectively.Ferret transmission experimentsEqual numbers of male and female ferrets 23 weeks of age were purchased from Triple F Farms (Gillett, PA). Ferret serum was screened by hemagglutination inhibition assay and animals were determined to be seronegative for A/Indiana/02/2020 (H1N1) and A/Tasmania/503/2020 (H3N2) viruses. For the direct contact experiment, ferrets were cohoused in the same cage. Airborne transmission experiments were performed using custom-built ferret transmission cages (Allentown). The cages are designed such that within each transmission chamber an infected donor (DR) ferret is separated from a respiratory contact (RC) ferret by two perforated offset stainless-steel plates with unidirectional airflow from the DR to RC animal. The cages are designed such that the animals cannot physically contact each other, but they share the same airspace. DR ferrets (n = 4, 2 male and 2 female) were sedated with a mixture of ketamine (20 mg/kg), xylazine (2 mg/kg), and atropine (0.05 mg/kg) and intranasally inoculated with 1 × 106 TCID50 of recombinant A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022 (H5N1) or PB2 A271T r.A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022 (H5N1) in a 1-mL volume. After inoculation, sedation was reversed by administration of atipamezole (1 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours later, DR ferrets were sedated, a nasal wash sample was collected using 1-mL of PBS. After the animal recovered, for direct contact studies, an uninfected sex-matched contact ferret was then co-housed with the infected donor, while for airborne transmission studies, a respiratory contact (RC) animal (also sex matched to the DR ferret) was housed adjacently to the infected donor. Nasal wash samples were then collected from the donor and contact ferrets on alternating days for 14 days as previously described18,42.To assess disease severity, ferrets were weighed and scored for clinical signs daily as described by Reuman et al.43. Animals were scored for activity, respiratory disease, weight loss, and other symptoms (e.g., diarrhea or neurological symptoms where a score of 0 denotes no signs and a score of 3 denotes severe symptoms). Ferrets were euthanized if weight loss exceeded 25% of day 0 body weight or 20% body weight loss and observation of another symptom above a score of 2 such as low activity, diarrhea with fecal material embedded in fur around the anus or opaque nasal/ocular discharge. Ferrets were euthanized immediately if neurological symptoms were present such as ataxia or hindlimb paralysis.Infectious dose studiesInfectious dose 50 (ID50) experiments were conducted by intranasally inoculating equal numbers of sedated male and female ferrets with 1 × 103, 1 × 102, 1 × 101 or 1 × 100 TCID50 of A/mink (H5N1) in a 1-mL volume (n = 4/dose). Ferrets were sedated and nasal washed every other day for 9 days. Ferrets were monitored for clinical signs as described above and the ID50 was determined by the method of Reed and Muench41.Evaluation of virulence of the PB2 A271T mutationFour ferrets (n = 4, 2 male, 2 female) per group were inoculated with 102 TCID50/mL wild-type A/mink (H5N1) or PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1) in a 1 mL volume. Ferrets were sedated and nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 14 days. Weight loss and clinical symptoms were monitored daily.Titration of nasal wash samplesNasal wash samples were titrated on MDCK cells using a combination of 24-well and 96-well plates to determine the TCID50/mL of nasal wash. To achieve a low limit of detection, 100 uL of nasal wash sample was incubated on 2 wells of a 24-well plate for 1 h. The nasal wash sample was then removed and replaced with virus culture media consisting of Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 ug/mL of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco). To quantify peak titers in the nasal wash samples, 10-fold serial dilutions of virus were prepared in virus culture media and added to MDCK cells grown in 96-well plates (4 wells per dilution). Plates were then incubated in humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and scored 96 h later for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE). The TCID50/mL was then calculated using the method of Reed and Muench42,44.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI)Serum from donor and contact ferrets was treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE)(Denken Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 37 °C and then heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Serum (25 uL) was then diluted 2-fold in a V-bottom plate (Corning) and mixed with 4 hemagglutination assay units (HAU) of A/mink (H5N1) virus prepared in 25 uL of PBS. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, 50 uL of turkey red blood cells (0.5% solution in normal saline) (Lampire Biological Laboratories) was added to each well. The plate was then incubated for an additional 45 min and scored for hemagglutination inhibition45.Mini-genome assayMini-genome assays were performed using human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK 293T) cells cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with reverse genetics plasmids (1 ug/plasmid mixed with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus)) encoding NP, PA, PB1, and PB2 or PB2 271T, of A/mink (H5N1) to assess the polymerase activity of wild-type PB2 in comparison to the polymerase carrying PB2 A271T. Cells were also transfected with Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) and Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) reporter plasmids (generously provided by Dr. Daniel Perez, University of Georgia, Athens, GA) and then incubated at 33 or 37 °C46. Supernatants were collected at 24 h post-transfection, and luciferase and SEAP activity were assayed using a Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia, Inc.) and a SpectraMax iD3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Polymerase activity was expressed as a ratio of luminescence to SEAP activity for each sample. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate and results were analyzed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test.Analysis of viral genome sequencesRNA was isolated from nasal wash samples collected from donors and respiratory contacts on the day of peak viral shedding using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). vRNA was converted to cDNA using the M-RTPCR protocol47. Briefly, one-step reverse transcription PCR amplification of full viral genomes was achieved using pooled Uni12/Inf-1 and Uni12/Inf-3 forward primers and Uni13/Inf-1 reverse primers and SuperScript III Platinum kit (Thermo Fisher). Following PCR purification (Agencourt AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter) and determining concentration (Qubit dsDNA Quantitation High Sensitivity Assay, Thermo Fisher), cDNA was processed at the Emory National Primate Research Center (ENPRC) Genomics Core for sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Samples were sequenced as 2 × 100 bp paired reads and demultiplexed prior to delivery.Using the FluSAP pipeline developed in the Lowen laboratory (https://github.com/Lowen-Lab/FluSAP), reads were merged and filtered for low average quality (≥30) using BBMerge, then separated according to the segment using BLAT48. The reads were then mapped to their corresponding reference segment using BBMap, with local alignment set to false. From these alignments, we used Python scripts to identify iSNVs. Cutoffs for inclusion of iSNVs were set empirically. First, sites were evaluated based on their total coverage and the average quality and mapping statistics. Only sites with ≥100x coverage were considered. For minor variants at these sites to be included in subsequent analyses, they were required to be present at ≥1% frequency and have an average phred score of ≥35, and the reads that contained the minor allele at any given site also had to have sufficient mapping quality to justify inclusion. Specifically, reads containing the minor allele needed an average mapping quality score of ≥40, the average location of the minor allele needed to be ≥20 bases from the nearest end of a read, and the reads overall needed to have ≤2.0 average mismatch and indel counts relative to the reference sequence.Data and statistical analysesTotal viral shedding was determined by performing area under the curve (AUC) analyses using Prism (GraphPad v10). AUC analysis was restricted to days 1–7 post-infection as no animals reached endpoint criteria during this time. This ensured comparable periods of viral shedding were analyzed. For comparison of polymerase activity (Luciferase/SEAP), peak nasal wash titers, and AUC, values were confirmed to have normal distribution by Shapiro–Wilk test and were then compared using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. Statistical analyses were performed in Prism (GraphPad v10) with p < 0.05 considered significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

We encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information on H5N1. Avian influenza A (H5N1), or bird flu, has killed millions of wild birds, and caused sporadic outbreaks among poultry and an ongoing multistate outbreak among cows in the United States. While there has been no known person-to-person transmission of the virus, there have been 46 reported human cases in the U.S. in 2024. At the end of October, a pig on a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have the virus, raising a new concern, since pigs can be infected with both bird and human flu at the same time and serve as mixing pots, potentially creating a new flu virus that can spread to humans (more on that below). So far, most of the human cases of H5N1 involved people working on farms where they were exposed to sick cows or poultry in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and, most recently, California and Washington. But one person, who was infected in September in Missouri, developed the illness despite reporting no contact with sick animals, which raised questions about how they might have been infected. The people who have been infected with bird flu have reported mild illnesses. A few experienced eye infections, while others reported flu-like symptoms, including chills, coughing, fever, sore throat, and runny nose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Meanwhile, the good news is that H5N1 is not considered a major public health threat in the U.S. at this time. The CDC has categorized the risk to the general public as “low,” and notes that people with exposure to infected animals are at higher risk of infection. “In the short term, there is very little threat,” says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD. “In the long term, in the coming years or decades, however, I’m much more concerned.” He gives two reasons: One is that there has been a mortality (or death) rate of about 50% in the almost 900 people around the world who have been infected with bird flu between 2003 and 2024. However, 50% may be an overestimate, Dr. Roberts says, adding that there may be cases where people have no symptoms, are only mildly symptomatic, or haven’t sought care for their symptoms. He also noted that if the virus did spread in humans, the percentage might be significantly lower if preventive approaches, including a vaccine, and treatments were made widely available. Another reason for concern is that bird flu is now being detected in new animal species. In addition to outbreaks in cows and pigs—both relatively new developments for the bird flu virus— sporadic infections in some wild mammals were first detected in Canada and the U.S. in 2022, and are ongoing. “It’s natural to wonder if it’s only a matter of time before this virus is able to spread among humans,” Dr. Roberts says. Below, Dr. Roberts answers eight common questions people have about bird flu.1. What is H5N1 bird flu, and where did the new wave of infections start?"Avian influenza A (H5N1)," "bird flu," and "H5N1 bird flu" all refer to an illness caused by influenza type A viruses, which primarily affect birds. H5N1 bird flu was first identified in geese in China in 1996 and in people in Hong Kong the following year. Almost 25 years later, in 2020, a new variant of H5N1, referred to as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), was detected in wild birds in Europe; it was first seen in birds in the U.S. and Canada in late 2021, and has since been detected in a variety of wild bird species in all 50 states. (The term “highly pathogenic” relates to how the virus impacts birds, not necessarily humans. There is also a low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] that usually causes mild illness in birds and poultry; however, some LPAI strains can mutate into strains that can cause severe illness and even death in poultry.) In February 2022, the virus began causing sporadic outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in backyard and commercial poultry flocks in the U.S., causing serious illness and death in infected chickens. The number of outbreaks has increased and spread over time—in November 2024, the CDC reported poultry outbreaks in 48 states. In addition, there have been sporadic infections in mammals (including bears, bobcats, minks, mountain lions, raccoons, skunks, and others), according to the CDC. The first reported case of bird flu in humans in the U.S. was reported in April 2022 in Colorado; a person reported mild symptoms after being exposed to poultry. (However, this case may have been a contamination of the nasal passages with the virus as opposed to an actual infection, according to the CDC.) More than two years later, in 2024, there have been 46 more reported cases involving exposures to poultry and cows. At the same time, there is an ongoing multi-state outbreak in dairy cattle. The CDC reported the first of four cow-to-human transmission in April 2024 in a dairy worker in Texas; that case was described in a letter to the editor published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the months that followed, more cases have been reported in other Western and Midwestern states. Officials are still investigating the one case in Missouri in September in which the potential exposure remains unknown. The case was identified through the state’s flu surveillance system. The patient, who was hospitalized, had underlying medical conditions, and was treated with flu and antiviral medications before being discharged. It’s possible that there are more human cases of bird flu than are being reported. This past summer, the CDC took blood samples from more than 115 farm workers in Colorado and Michigan, and found evidence of recent bird flu infection in eight of them, half of whom said they did not notice symptoms.2. Why is there concern about bird flu infecting cows and pigs?Both pigs and dairy cows are “new and unexpected" hosts of the H5N1 virus, and the spread of the virus among cows is a sign that it could mutate in them, making it easier for it to spread to other animals or potentially humans, according to the CDC. Experts have been concerned about the possibility of the virus infecting pigs at some point, because pigs have been infected in the past with both human and animal flu viruses, adds Dr. Roberts. “Then, we have this sort of mixing pot, where you can get a genetic reassortment of different flu strains,” he says. In 2009, the virus H1N1, also known as “swine flu,” was the result of a reassortment of multiple virus strains in pigs; it spread rapidly in people and led to a worldwide pandemic that lasted more than a year. 3. Is anyone at risk for bird flu?While the risk of a bird flu infection is very low for most people in the U.S., “people who work with birds or poultry, own them, or have recreational exposure to them are at higher risk than other people,” Dr. Roberts says. “I would say that anyone who works on a farm in a state that has reported animal infections, where the farmer has identified illness in their animals, should monitor for flu-like symptoms and contact public health officials if any symptoms develop.” The CDC, and state and local health departments, are monitoring people for 10 days after an exposure to infected birds, poultry, dairy cows, or other animals.4. Can I get tested for bird flu?At this point, there is no publicly available H5N1 test, and commercial tests cannot distinguish human influenza A viruses (such as H1N1) from bird flu (H5N1). The CDC says tracking the specimens that test positive for influenza A can be helpful in monitoring for unusual increases in flu activity that may be an early sign of the spread of new influenza A viruses, including H5N1. Dedicated bird flu testing can only be performed at public health laboratories. Any test for bird flu would need to be sent out to public health departments, says Dr. Roberts. “If you are concerned, alert your doctor, and they will need to talk to the state public health department,” he says. “However, at this point, I don't think they would authorize a test unless somebody was a farm worker or was working in an area or on a site where there was known H5N1 infection, since the risk for the general public is so low.”5. The virus has been found in milk—should people worry about the food supply?Bird flu in the milk supply has been a major concern among consumers, but the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has been sampling retail milk and other dairy products, such as cottage cheese and sour cream, as well as powdered milk formula and powdered milk products sold as toddler formula; it reports that although dead byproducts of the virus have been present, it found no live infectious virus, thanks to pasteurization, a food production process of heating liquids for short periods of time to kill harmful bacteria. However, the FDA advises people not to drink, manufacture, or sell raw cow milk and products, such as cheeses, ice cream, and yogurt, made with raw milk. (Raw, unpasteurized milk and milk products are sold legally in most states.) While neither of the two human infections was linked to raw milk, more than half of a resident population of domestic cats on a farm in Texas died after they were fed raw, unpasteurized colostrum (milk produced during the first few days after birth) from H5N1-infected cows, according to a CDC report. There also is no evidence that anyone in the U.S. has gotten bird flu after eating properly handled and cooked poultry products, but the CDC notes that uncooked poultry and poultry products (such as blood) may have caused a small number of H5N1 infections in people in Southeast Asia. Poultry and other animal foods should be safe to eat as long as they are prepared properly, according to the CDC. This includes cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165°F, which can kill viruses, including H5N1. (Use a food thermometer to be sure.) The FDA provides more information on raw milk on its website.6. What are the symptoms of bird flu?They range from no symptoms to mild flu-like illness to severe illness that requires hospitalization. The dairy worker infected in the U.S. in April reported mild illness, with the main symptom being conjunctivitis (irritation or inflammation of the conjunctiva, a clear mucous membrane that protects the eye). Other common symptoms are consistent with influenza, according to the CDC: Cough Fatigue FeverHeadachesMuscle or body achesRunny noseShortness of breath7. Are there vaccines or treatments for bird flu if it were to spread in humans?There are currently no vaccines for bird flu, but the CDC reports that there has been preliminary work toward a targeted vaccine, in case one is needed. (The seasonal flu shot cannot prevent bird flu infection.) If anyone were to become infected with bird flu—or is suspected of having an infection—the CDC recommends treatment as soon as possible with antiviral drugs. There are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs for seasonal flu that can be used for bird flu, such as oseltamivir phosphate (available generically or under the brand name Tamiflu®) and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). Both are oral prescription medications that should be taken as soon as possible, within 48 hours of experiencing symptoms. Antiviral drugs can also be given soon after a person has had unprotected exposure to an infected animal or sick or dead poultry, meaning they did not wear gloves, face masks, eye protection, or other protective gear, according to the CDC.8. What precautions can you take to avoid bird flu?Since bird flu isn’t spreading among humans, most people don’t need to worry about precautions, Dr. Roberts says. But people who are exposed to cows or poultry, especially in states where bird flu has been identified, should consider them, he says. So should hunters who handle wild birds and people who raise chickens at home. One problem is that experts are still learning how bird flu is transmitted. “We understand much less about H5N1 transmission than we do about COVID,” Dr. Roberts says. But most people infected with bird flu get it from unprotected contact with infected birds, according to the CDC. The agency adds that infection also can happen when people inhale the virus in droplets or dust from the infected animals, or touch a contaminated surface. The CDC has a list of recommended precautions, including: Avoid sick or dead birds. Check with your state or local government about their policy for reporting wild birds and other animals that look sick or are dead. Avoid wild birds even if they don’t look sick, since they can have an infection without symptoms.Don’t touch surfaces or materials that could be contaminated. That includes animal litter or feces, mucus, raw milk, or saliva.Avoid poultry farms and bird markets. If you must visit those places, wear a well-fitting face mask and don’t touch the animals. Use the following protective measures if you are unable to avoid contact with wild birds or sick or dead animals: Wear gloves and, after removing them, wash your hands properly. Wear an N95 respirator or a well-fitting mask.Use eye protection, such as goggles. It’s important to throw away your gloves and face mask after any exposure. Check the CDC website for further advice for specific situations and groups, including hunters and people who raise chickens in their backyards. It also offers special advice for people who work with animals on farms. For anyone who wants to keep up with the news about bird flu, the CDC is providing regular updates based on its flu surveillance systems.

Who is at risk? How can you protect yourself and which foods are safe to eat during an outbreak ? Dr Wenqing Zhang explains in Science in 5. Presented by Vismita Gupta-Smith Produced by Department of Communications (DCO) 05:21 Alternative media Related links Fact sheet on influenza Transcript VGS We've been hearing about avian influenza or bird flu. Why is WHO concerned about it? Who is at risk and how can you protect yourself? Here to talk about it is Doctor Wenqing Zhang. Welcome Wenqing, talk to us about avian influenza and how it's affecting humans.WZ Avian influenza or bird flu is a disease in birds caused by a virus. Sometimes the virus makes them sick, but sometimes the birds don't get sick from the disease but act as carriers of the virus. We've also seen this virus in mammals such as foxes, minks, seals and sea lions, and most recently in cows in the US. In rare cases, people have also been infected when in contact with infected birds or mammals or contaminated environments.VGS So Wenqing if human infections are so rare, why is WHO concerned about it?WZ So far, close to 900 human infections have been reported. Although the number may appear not as big as many other outbreaks, we need to bear into mind is that each infection in humans is an attempt of the virus to try to establish itself in human population. Although the chances are slim so far, as long as it succeeds once, just once, it is a start of an influenza pandemic, which can be as mild as the 2009 pandemic, but equally, it could also be devastating, like the 1918 one, also called the Spanish flu. That's why, Vismita, we are concerned about the avian influenza and are watching it very closely.VGS Talk to us about who is at risk of bird flu.WZ Anyone exposed to infected live or dead poultry or infected animals or contaminated environments such as live bird markets is at risk. Slaughtering, de-feathering, handling carcasses and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also risk factors. So if you are a poultry farmer or have chickens in your backyard, you need to be aware that you are at a potential risk of catching bird flu. With avian influenza detected in cows in the US recently, if you are a dairy worker, you'll also need to be aware that you are at a potential risk of catching bird flu.VGS Wenqing we know that this virus is evolving constantly. Talk to us about how WHO is preparing countries for a possible pandemic.WZ The risk of an influenza pandemic is persistent and is being watched closely by a long standing global system called the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, also called GISRS. This system will rapidly detect an influenza pandemic virus once it enters into human population, and from there it will trigger a series of response, including the development of laboratory diagnostics and vaccines. In addition, WHO will rapidly release a series of practical guidance to countries tailored to the specific pandemic response needs. So that's why it's important to keep an eye on the virus to see how it's changing.VGS Tell us in case of an outbreak, which foods are safe to eat?WZ Avoid consuming raw milk, eggs, and meat. Make sure you consume pasteurized or properly boiled milk and thoroughly cooked eggs and meat. If you're handling raw products, make sure you wash your hands before and after, and follow other good food safety practices. This is, in fact, our standing advice, with or without avian influenza, because these practices protect you from many diseases.VGS So tell us what else the public needs to do in case of an outbreak to protect themselves.WZ Be vigilant. Minimize contact with animals in areas affected with avian influenza. Minimize contact with animals in areas affected with avian influenza. Avoid contact with surfaces contaminated with animal faeces. Strictly avoid contact with dead or sick animals, including wild birds. Report dead animals or request their removal by contacting local authorities. And wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, especially after contact with animals and their environments.VGS Thank you Wenqing. There you have it. Science in 5 today. Until next time, then stay safe, stay healthy and stick with science.

It emphasized that current wastewater monitoring through its National Wastewater Surveillance System, which has more than 600 sites, doesn't distinguish the influenza A subtype or determine the source of the virus. Influenza viruses can come from humans, animals, or contaminated products such as milk.In its interactive map, the CDC categorizes current influenza A levels compared to levels seen at the same time during the 2023-2024 season. When levels are at the 80th percentile or higher, the CDC said it works with state and local partners to better understand factors that could be contributing to the levels.Over the 2 most recent weeks, 230 sites from 34 states met the data reporting criteria, and three sites in three states were at the high level: Kansas (Saline County), Florida (Pinellas County), and Illinois (Kane County). Marc Johnson, PhD, a virologist at the University of Missouri who has developed a probe to detect H5 in wastewater, said on X today that the CDC's dashboard is nice and that he's glad they're posting the information."I don't necessarily think that there needs to be a parallel H5 test run on every sample, but testing samples that are suspiciously high for it seems appropriate," he said.Brian Wasik, PhD, a molecular biologist who is a research associate at the Baker Institute for Animal Health at Cornell University in New York, said on X that the CDC's dashboard will help shed light on baselines and longitudinal trends and what targets to explore.H5N1 detected in 4 more dairy herdsIn other developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today reported four more H5N1 detections in dairy herds, raising the total to 46.All are from already affected states. Two are in Michigan, with Texas and Idaho each reporting one more affected herd.Also, APHIS reported three more H5N1 detections involving wild birds, two of them from counties where dairy herds have been affected. Detections in Michigan (Ionia County) and Idaho (Cassia County) involved agency-harvested birds, a rock dove and a black-billed magpie, respectively.The other is a red-tailed hawk found dead in New York's Dutchess County. APHIS said all of the detections involve the Eurasian H5N1 subtype.

EAST LANSING, Mich. — New research from Michigan State University will study the effects of a recent highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) outbreak on dairy cattle reproduction and milk production, as well as transmission of the disease and ways to mitigate it. Support for the new project has been provided through two sources, each covering half of the $168,000 total: Annual capacity funding through MSU AgBioResearch from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Capacity funding through the Michigan Alliance for Animal Agriculture, a partnership among MSU, Michigan animal agriculture industries and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD). The project is co-led by Catalina Picasso, Zelmar Rodriguez and Annette O’Connor, faculty members in the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (LCS). Picasso is a veterinarian and epidemiologist, specializing in transboundary infectious diseases in both livestock and wildlife animal populations. Rodriguez is a dairy health epidemiologist and dairy extension faculty member. O’Connor is a world-renowned veterinarian and expert in the application of quantitative epidemiology to improve policy on food safety, animal health and welfare, and veterinary practices. According to the USDA, as of mid-May, H5N1 infections have been detected in dozens of dairy herds across Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas. The virus, which was first detected in domestic birds in the U.S. in 2022 but not until recently in cattle, has been identified in unpasteurized milk, as well as swabs and tissue samples from sick cattle. Symptoms may include reduced milk production, decreased appetite, and changes in milk color and consistency. “Immediately upon the onset of the H5N1 outbreak in Michigan dairy cattle, MSU AgBioResearch, the College of Veterinary Medicine and MDARD began conversations about research questions that when answered could inform policy and management strategies to help prevent transmission within and across dairy herds,” said James Averill, assistant director of MSU AgBioResearch and leader of the organization’s animal agriculture initiatives. “This research will enable the dairy industry to better understand H5N1 and the impacts on dairy herds over time.” The research team will seek to answer several key questions, such as: Impact: What are the short- and long-term effects of the disease on reproduction and milk production? At the herd level: What factors influence the likelihood of herds becoming infected? At the cow level: What increases or decreases the likelihood of cows becoming infected? Transmission: How is the virus spreading within and between herds? “There’s still an enormous amount of information we don’t know,” O’Connor said. “This outbreak underscored the critical need to understand the dynamics, impact and prevention of H5N1 among the cattle population. We are fortunate to be able to ground this research in on-farm studies, working closely with MDARD to access farms that have had herds test positive for the virus.” The team plans to conduct five studies on farms with H5N1-positive animals. They will study lactating cows, dry cows and calves, collecting blood, nasal swabs and milk samples to be tested. All H5N1 testing is being performed by the MSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, the only laboratory in Michigan approved by the USDA to test for highly pathogenic avian influenza in any species. Additionally, researchers will examine milking equipment for H5N1 presence and compare testing accuracy between pooled and individual samples. Data from Michigan farms will be combined with findings from other universities nationwide for a comprehensive analysis. “We’re trying to understand how long animals are shedding the virus and how long the virus stays active,” O’Connor said. “For example, if we were to find that cattle are often positive on nasal swabs, we might conclude that nose-to-nose contact is a common route of transmission. Likewise, we may see that some samples come back negative quite often and show that those routes are much less likely. The overall goal is to equip our producers with the information needed to make informed decisions on how to best protect their cattle, and by extension, animal safety more broadly.” Michigan State University AgBioResearch scientists discover dynamic solutions for food systems and the environment. More than 300 MSU faculty conduct leading-edge research on a variety of topics, from health and climate to agriculture and natural resources. Originally formed in 1888 as the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, MSU AgBioResearch oversees numerous on-campus research facilities, as well as 15 outlying centers throughout Michigan.

Lucey, MD, MPH, FIDSA 5/17/2024 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email In the May 10 issue of Science magazine, journalist Kai Kupferschmidt described several planned BSL-3 laboratory experiments using H5N1 avian influenza virus to infect cows, including respiratory infections and cow-to-cow transmission studies. There are key differences in these lab studies, which will use the apparently unique genotype B3.13 of the virus found in U.S. cows so far in nine states and 42 herds. These differences include: A) Virologist Jürgen Richt at Kansas State University will study nonlactating cows. Dr. Richt plans to “inoculate the nose and mouth of male and female cows” with H5N1 avian influenza A virus, according to the article. “Then we will look at what’s happening within the animals,” Dr. Richt told the magazine. “We will kill some of them after 4 or 5 days and look where the virus is in the body.” "Others will be watched for weeks to see whether they develop antibodies to H5N1 and how long they shed the virus in various ways,” the article explained. “And 2 days after some of these initial infections, new cows, called sentinels, will be added to the mix to see whether they can catch the virus." B) Martin Beer, a veterinarian at the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health in Reims, Germany, will infect lactating cows using H5N1 avian influenza virus sent by the Cornell University virologist Diego Diel. C) Volker Gerdts, director of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatchewan in Canada, will infect calves with the virus. We should anticipate that additional laboratories, in the U.S and abroad, will undertake more such experiments. Further discussion is likely, before and after experimental results are known.

The viruses cause flu-like signs in those animals, similar to signs and symptoms of seasonal flu in people. Generally, horse flu poses a low risk to people. Background The influenza viruses that cause "horse flu" are "equine influenza viruses" or "EIVs." EIVs originally spread from birds to horses. Historically, EIVs have been type A influenza viruses belonging to two subtypes: H7N7 and H3N8. Evolving viruses The EIV H7N7 subtype was first reported in the 1950s and last reported in the 1970s. It is now considered to be extinct. The EIV H3N8 subtype was first reported in horses in the United States in the 1960s. It still spreads in horses globally today. Another influenza A(H3N8) virus subtype has been reported in dogs, horses, and birds; these viruses are different in each species. Signs and symptoms Signs of illness in horses Horses will generally start to show signs of infection with EIV within one to three days. Horses infected with EIV may show the following signs: Fever (elevated body temperature between 39 and 41ﹾC) Dry cough Wheezing when breathing in severe cases Loss of appetite Fatigue (tiredness) Runny nose These signs may not be present in horses vaccinated with an EIV vaccine, available in the United States. Understanding risk Human risk from horse flu EIVs are currently not well adapted to infect people and are currently believed to pose a low risk to human health. Although it is rare, a few people in contact with infected horses have developed antibodies to equine influenza viruses. Antibodies are a sign of having been infected. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, EIVs have been shown to be able to infect people in experimental settings. However, no people exposed to horse flu have shown signs of illness. What CDC is doing‎ CDC and its animal health partners closely monitor circulating influenza viruses. This kind of surveillance is particularly important for tracking changes in animal influenza viruses that could spread between animals and people. How it spreads Equine influenza viruses are highly contagious among horses. These viruses are thought to spread mainly through droplets when an infected animal coughs or sneezes. Virus can then enter the eyes, nose or mouth or be breathed in by other horses nearby. Infected horses can shed EIV even before they show signs of illness. EIVs also can spread indirectly through objects that have the virus on them, like clothing, equipment, and brushes. If a susceptible horse inhales, absorbs, or ingests virus from an object, it could become infected. EIV also can be found on surfaces where infected animals are housed or transported. Practicing good infection control and hygiene measures in and around horse herds, including cleaning hands and clothing, is important. Ideally, people who are exposed to sick horses should not have contact with healthy horses during an outbreak. However, if that is not possible, sick horses should be taken care of after healthy horses. Once introduced into an area with a susceptible population of animals, horse flu can spread quickly and can cause large outbreaks among horses. Crowding and transportation of horses to new places are factors that make spread among animals more likely. Horse flu and other mammals Equine influenza viruses were first isolated from horses in 1963. Infection can occur from exposure to saliva and mucus from infected animals. In the late 1990s, EIV H3N8 infected and adapted to dogs and started regularly spreading in them as canine influenza A(H3N8) virus. As H3N8 viruses became adapted to each host, the H3N8 viruses in birds, horses, and dogs all became different and distinct from one another. While different H3N8 viruses continue to spread in birds and horses, canine influenza H3N8 viruses are now extinct in dogs. Prevention Vaccines to protect horses against horse flu have been available since the 1970s. They protect against the most commonly spreading equine influenza viruses. Different vaccines include different vaccine viruses. Vaccines are widely used to vaccinate domesticated horses. An expert panel from the World Organization for Animal Health regularly proposes which viruses should be included in vaccines.

Scientists have been monitoring H5N1 infections in wild bird and domesticated poultry populations since the strain popped up in North America in 2021, but they thought that bovines were resistant to influenza A viruses (IAV).“[Cow infection] came as a complete surprise,” said Lars Erik Larsen, a veterinary virologist at the University of Copenhagen. In a preprint posted on bioRxiv, which has not undergone peer review, Larsen and his team measured the distribution of IAV receptors across different cow tissues in search of a mechanistic explanation for how cows contracted the bird flu.1 While their preliminary findings helped explain the symptoms reported in infected cows, they also sparked a new hypothesis on whether cows are potential IAV mixing vessels for the generation of novel flu viruses that could acquire human-to-human transmission. Wild birds are the natural reservoirs for IAV, but mammalian spillovers into pigs, horses, and humans have occurred.2 For example, the IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes originated in wild birds but evolved to routinely circulate in humans on a seasonal basis. However, the news of the virus spreading between cows came out of left field: Cows experience outbreaks of influenza D viruses, but IAV infections are less common, so scientists did not consider them to be susceptible hosts for H5N1.3 Larsen said that one of the most surprising findings coming from the US reports is that huge amounts of virus are found in the milk, but very little nestles in the respiratory tract. “It seems like this virus in bovines behaves completely differently than in other species,” said Larsen. These findings suggested that the virus may enter and replicate inside cells housed in the udder, but no one had looked at IAV receptor expression in these tissues. To transfer their viral genomes, IAV bind to sialic acid (SA) receptors on epithelial cells. One of the main reasons that transmission of IAV from birds to humans is low is that avian viruses prefer to enter cells through the SA-α2,3 receptor types, which are highly expressed in birds but less common in humans.4 In order to jump these host barriers and infect humans, avian viruses must evolve to bind to SA-α2,6 receptors, the dominant type in humans.Larsen, whose research primarily focuses on avian and swine influenza viruses, previously measured the expression of these receptors in the pig nasal mucosa using two different plant lectins that bind to either the α2,6 human receptor or the α2,3 avian receptor.5 With tools for making these measurements already in hand, Larsen and his team analyzed the expression of these receptors in cow brain, respiratory tract, and mammary gland tissues that were archived in the freezers in the pathology department of his university’s veterinary school. Larsen and his team observed high expression of the α2,3 avian receptor in the bovine mammary glands, providing a rationale for why this virus appears to readily replicate in this tissue. “That can explain why we find so much virus in the milk,” said Larsen. They also found some expression of the avian receptor in the respiratory tract but very little evidence of the receptor in the brain, which matches the minimal respiratory or neurological symptoms observed in infected cows. When they analyzed the data on the human receptor, the team was surprised to also find high expression in the mammary glands, a finding that brought pigs to mind. Pigs provide a perfect platform for IAV looking to acquire new hosts. They coexpress both the avian and human receptors in their respiratory tracks. This means that pigs infected with both human and avian flus provide these viruses with a space to mingle and swap genome segments to generate new IAV that the human immune system has never seen before. This happened in 2009 when influenza strains of avian, swine, and human origin infected a pig, underwent genetic reassortment, and created a novel H1N1 strain that kicked off the last swine flu pandemic.6 Although the preliminary evidence from Larsen’s group provides a mechanistic explanation for why H5N1 is appearing in dairy cattle milk, what worries some scientists is that it also suggests that cows could be a potential mixing vessel for avian and human IAV. “That’s just in theory,” said Larsen. “I don’t think that the risk is very high.”Continue reading below... News & OpinionUnprecedented Avian Flu Epidemic Could Presage Year-Round OutbreaksRead MoreBrian Wasik, a virologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the study, said that he welcomes the preliminary analysis on IAV receptor distribution in bovine mammary tissue, which he noted has been limited in the literature. “A rapid dissemination of information about that is always great and open for the community to start building hypotheses of how we understand how influenza is moving in this particular tissue,” said Wasik. With respect to the “mixing vessel” hypothesis, Wasik said, “[They] are good hypotheses and worth discussion and worth setting the framework for future research. My concern, and what I expressed publicly, is that the concern of other people overinterpreting those narrow results and moving clearly beyond the hypothesis framework into something larger.”Unlike a protein receptor, which is transformed from a nucleotide sequence via transcription and translation, SA is carbohydrate that is synthesized by enzymatic processes. “There's a lot of heterogeneity and kinetics in that process, and you get lots of different chemical variations of these receptors,” said Wasik. These enzymatic processes lead to different subtypes of the SA-α2,6 receptor: the N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) forms. Neu5Gc is prevalent across different mammals, but the gene that encodes the enzyme that converts Neu5Ac into Neuro5Gc is absent in humans.7 Wasik noted that Sambucus nigra lectin, the molecule used in this study to detect the presence SA-α2,6, has a broad binding profile and therefore cannot distinguish between these two subtypes. Therefore, bovine may not express the Neu5Ac form of SA-α2,6 that the human influenza strains use to enter cells. Continue reading below... InfographicsBat Immune Systems: The Original Antivirus ProgramsRead More“The methodology needs a lot more rigorous verification,” said Wasik, who noted that he’d like to see a deeper dive into the chemistry of the bovine receptors to better understand what they look like and how influenza binds to them. “I’m sure that those studies are coming from this group and a number of others, but at this time we do not have a definitive understanding of what's present in that tissue,” he said.Scientists still need to determine whether cow mammary glands are susceptible to human IAV. More than 70 years ago, researchers injected cow udders with human influenza virus and observed viral replication, suggesting that it is possible.8 However, these were direct injections and it is still unclear if or how human transmission to the mammary glands would occur. Scientists still don’t know the mode of transmission of the avian virus into cows. “There are so many unanswered questions about this bovine infection,” said Larsen.In addition to increasing the sample size, Larsen would like to look more closely at the receptor distribution in the respiratory tract. “What we fear [is] that this virus starts to spread among cows by droplets because then the risk of human exposure will increase,” said Larsen. “Given these are all hypotheses and we don't know what this virus is going to do next, my suggestion is we stamp it out as quickly as possible,” said Wasik. “While we're concerned about human risk and now this new risk to cattle, what we're seeing is one of the largest ecological die-offs of avian species and sea mammals and a number of other different spillovers.”ReferencesKristensen C, et al.

Academic experts weigh in AAMCNews How worried should we be about avian flu? Academic experts weigh inAvian flu has spread to cows and one person in the United States. Scientists discuss the potential for a human epidemic and how to avoid it. By Patrick Boyle, Senior Staff Writer May 15, 2024 Bird flu is spreading into unprecedented territory in the United States, infecting scores of cows at dairy farms in nine states and jumping to one farm worker — only the second confirmed case ever of a human getting infected by the H5N1 virus within the United States. Federal and local agencies are working to monitor and curtail the spread of H5N1. We asked scientists who study bird flu what we know about the virus and how it might be kept at bay or could expand into the next pandemic. What is the reach of avian flu? Avian flu is, as its name suggests, most commonly found in wild and farm birds worldwide, with periodic outbreaks occurring among mammals. H5N1, a particular strain of bird flu, periodically flares up more expansively; it was cited for causing more than 100 million bird deaths globally in 2022 and has been detected in dozens of species of mammals. In the United States, the virus has been detected in more than 200 different mammals, including cats, goats, and raccoons. Most often, the virus gets transmitted when one animal eats an infected animal or comes in contact with bodily materials like feces and saliva from an infected animal, as explained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). What risk does the virus pose to humans? Avian flu viruses rarely infect humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 2003 to April 1, 2024, 23 countries reported a total of 889 human cases of H5N1. The most common symptoms in people, according to the CDC, include eye redness (conjunctivitis), respiratory difficulties, fever, cough, sore throat, and pneumonia. However, more than half of the worldwide human cases (463) resulted in death. “It is a highly pathogenic strain,” explains Erin M. Sorrell, PhD, MSc, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland. “It has the ability to replicate outside the traditional locations where low-pathogenic influenza does: the intestinal tract for poultry; the upper and lower respiratory tracts in humans. The virus becomes systemic in its infection.” In the United States, the first known case of transmission to a human occurred in 2022. The CDC says that person, who worked directly with infected poultry, reported mild fatigue and recovered. The second known case was reported in March 2024, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. The only symptom was conjunctivitis in both eyes, which receded, according to a case assessment by the CDC and Texas health agencies. “As of now, this is a low-risk situation for humans,” says Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. But that could change as the virus spreads among more animals, he warns. Is there concern that the virus might spread to more people? There are varying levels of concern among scientists who are watching the outbreak. One reason for that concern is that it has begun spreading to dairy cows — animals that have a lot of close contact with humans. “Dairy cows do not normally get infected with Influenza A viruses,” which is what bird flu is, says Jenna Guthmiller, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine. The assessment of the Texas case notes that the worker “reported no contact with sick or dead wild birds,” but “direct and close exposure to dairy cows.” Some of those cows showed signs of illness that had been appearing at other dairy farms in the area, including decreased milk production, reduced appetite, lethargy, fever, and dehydration. A map from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows the states where the virus recently has been found. Tests of cattle in the area where the worker got infected determined that the bovine outbreak started when a wild bird infected a cow at a Texas farm in December, perhaps through bodily secretions into the cattle’s food or water supply. The concern is that cows might become hosts that spread the virus to humans, Guthmiller says. That spread can occur a number of ways, including through milk from the udders that farm workers could absorb through their eyes, nose, or mouth. So far, the risk of humans getting infected is “low,” the CDC states in summaries about H5N1. But Rick Bright, PhD, former deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), says that because the virus is spreading among both birds and cows on farms where people work, “the opportunity for infecting a human is increasing.” Why might cows pose a particular threat of spreading H5N1? Close-up contact with people In the milking parlor of a farm, people work extremely close to the cows’ udders, even if they are primarily guiding the milking machines. “Your face, your shoulders, your head are at the level of the cow’s udders,” says Guthmiller, who milked cows on the dairy farm where she grew up. “We are literally putting our faces right where the flu viruses are coming out.” The machines If a milking machine gets infected with the virus from one cow, the infection can be spread to other cows and to workers who use the same machine. “The main transmission that people believe is occurring is through these milkers becoming contaminated, then moving on to the next cow,” Guthmiller says. She says it would add significant time and cost for a farm to try cleaning the milkers after each cow. Delayed diagnosis “It seems that this virus is transmitting [from cow to cow] before cows even show any symptoms, or their symptoms are mild,” Guthmiller says. “Cows can’t tell us that they’re not feeling well.” Data that signal warning signs of an illness, like decreased production from a few cows, take a long time to come to the notice of managers who are monitoring hundreds or thousands of cows. Meanwhile, humans and animals continue to have close contact with infected cattle. Cow trades Cows are routinely traded between farms. “They’re going from one farm to another, which could lead to outbreaks on more farms,” Guthmiller says. In April, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) mandated that dairy cows receive a negative test for Influenza A before being transported to another state. The lack of bird flu experience at dairy farms “The poultry industry has dealt with avian influenza for years,” says Sorrell at Johns Hopkins. The common responses include culling entire flocks to stop the spread. The dairy industry has no experience with testing and responding to cows with avian flu. It is much easier, faster, and cheaper for poultry farms to buy and raise new birds than for a dairy farm to do the same with cows, Sorrell explains. What don’t we know? Scientists are still learning about the extent of the disease and how it is being transmitted on farms. “We don’t know how many cows are infected, we don’t know how many people have been exposed,” says Bright, now chief executive of Bright Global Health, which focuses on responses to public health emergencies. Getting the answers requires surveillance of animal and human populations — no easy task. Disease surveillance in the United States is a fractured and uneven endeavor, carried out mostly on a voluntary basis by state and local governments with guidance and prodding from federal agencies. Scientists who have been critical of the federal effort say surveillance should include more testing of farm workers and cattle. But for various reasons (including lack of trust in government regulators), workers and farm managers are wary of government officials conducting tests. The tests could also help discover viral mutations that might facilitate the spread of the infection among humans. Bright worries that by the time the virus is confirmed in even a small number of people (say, 10), it will have spread so widely that an epidemic might be at hand. Some scientists speculate that more dairy farmers already have become sick, but haven’t been tested for H5N1. “If we haven’t caught the virus before it mutates to efficiently transmit person-to-person, all bets are off in terms of being able to control it,” Bright says. How can dairy farm workers protect themselves? Farm workers could wear personal protective equipment (PPE) — such as gloves, goggles, and masks — but PPE is rare on dairy farms. (The infected worker in Texas reported wearing gloves.) “Most diseases of cows don’t affect humans, so there’s very little biosecurity on dairy farms,” Guthmiller says. “We’re not concerned with getting something from the cows.” Plus, PPE is especially uncomfortable and inconvenient in a milking facility. Masks impede breathing and get soaked from sprayed milk. Goggles get sprayed as well and they decrease visibility. “People aren’t wearing safety glasses,” Guthmiller says. “That would be an annoyance.” The CDC has asked local jurisdictions to offer PPE to dairy farms. Reports are that few farms have taken up the offers. Is it safe to drink milk and eat beef? Pasteurized milk does not transmit H5N1 and is safe to drink, the FDA says. The conclusion is based on repeated qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) tests of pasteurized milk and other pasteurized dairy products (including cottage cheese and sour cream) that showed no live, infectious bird flu virus. The agency said that fragments of the flu were found in some samples, but that those fragments had been inactivated by the pasteurization process. “Influenza viruses are very sensitive to heat” from the pasteurization process, which kills them, Sorrell says. On the other hand, raw milk, which has not gone through that process, is not protected from the virus, Sorrell explains. A study of cats that got sick or died from H5N1 this year concluded that they had been infected by drinking unpasteurized milk from the cows on dairy farms. The USDA conducted testsof commercially sold ground beef in states where H5N1 had been confirmed in cattle. No samples have shown traces of H5N1. Are there vaccines to protect against bird flu? The United States has two candidate vaccines available to manufacturers for the production of a vaccine against H5N1 if an outbreak occurs among humans, according to the CDC. Some scientists are not convinced that vaccine production could ramp up quickly enough to meet the need. Bright notes that the vaccines are produced through the decades-old process of injecting a virus into eggs, then harvesting the fluid to create an inactivated virus. It’s a slow process. Some scientists, including at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, are exploring the use of mRNA technology to speed up production of a vaccine for bird flu, in much the same way as some COVID-19 vaccines were quickly developed. Bright and Osterholm note that adjusting vaccines to address mutations of a virus is a perpetual challenge. “Anything we have in the stockpile right now may not even come close to matching up with the new virus,” Osterholm says. What is being done to contain the virus? In early April, the CDC sent a health advisory to clinicians and state public health departments to consider the possibility of H5N1 infection in patients who develop respiratory illness or conjunctivitis, and who had been exposed to potentially sick or dead birds or livestock. The USDA and HHS have instituted several ways to financially support farms to help curtail the spread of H5N1, including reimbursing them for PPE, for costs of testing and treating their cattle, and for lost milk production in herds affected by the virus. The CDC is working with state and local health departments to monitor people exposed to infected cattle, and is boosting its analysis of data about Influenza A among people, including in wastewater samples and emergency room visits. For a person who does become infected by the virus, the CDC recommends antiviral drugs that are used for influenza. Despite these and other steps, some scientists worry that government agencies are not doing enough to monitor the often-invisible spread of H5N1. “The thing that is a concern to me is the lack of [widespread] testing” of animals and milk on farms, Guthmiller says. “By not having a better grasp of this outbreak, it could get a lot worse for dairy cows, for our food chain, and could have the potential to jump into a pandemic.” Patrick Boyle, Senior Staff Writer Patrick Boyle is a senior staff writer for AAMCNews whose areas of focus include medical research, climate change, and artificial intelligence.

Replication of avian IAVs in mammalian cells is hindered by species-specific variation in acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32) proteins, which are essential for viral RNA genome replication. Adaptive mutations enable the IAV RNA polymerase (FluPolA) to surmount this barrier. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of monomeric and dimeric avian H5N1 FluPolA with human ANP32B. ANP32B interacts with the PA subunit of FluPolA in the monomeric form, at the site used for its docking onto the C-terminal domain of host RNA polymerase II during viral transcription. ANP32B acts as a chaperone, guiding FluPolA towards a ribonucleoprotein-associated FluPolA to form an asymmetric dimer—the replication platform for the viral genome. These findings offer insights into the molecular mechanisms governing IAV genome replication, while enhancing our understanding of the molecular processes underpinning mammalian adaptations in avian-origin FluPolA.

The 5′ and 3′ termini of each viral RNA (vRNA) segment associate with FluPol, while the rest of the RNA is packaged in a scaffold of viral nucleoprotein (NP) to form a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP)1,2,3. FluPol, composed of the polymerase acidic (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) subunits (Supplementary Fig. 1a), transcribes viral genes and replicates the vRNA in the nucleus of infected cells. These activities require conformational rearrangements that are regulated by interactions with host and viral factors, including newly synthesised FluPol. Transcription is a primer-dependent process that requires capped RNA fragments derived from host RNAs. To access these, the FluPol of incoming vRNPs docks onto the C-terminal domain (CTD) of host RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)4,5,6,7,8. Replication is a primer-independent two-step process: first, a complementary RNA (cRNA) is synthesised, which then acts as a template for additional vRNA synthesis. cRNA and vRNA are assembled into complementary ribonucleoproteins (cRNPs) and vRNPs, respectively, to avoid exposure of cRNA and vRNA to the nucleoplasm, where it may get degraded by nucleases or sensed by innate immune factors9. Genome replication is dependent on host acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32) proteins10,11 and FluPol oligomerisation12,13.Recently, we determined structures of influenza C virus polymerase (FluPolC) forming replication platforms with chicken and human ANP32A14. The replication platform comprises an asymmetric dimer of FluPolC molecules, one of which functions as the replicase (FluPolR) and the other (FluPolE) encapsidates the genomic RNA product emerging from FluPolR. The N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of ANP32A (ANP32ALRR) bridges the two FluPolC molecules, while the unresolved C-terminal low-complexity acidic region (LCAR) is believed to recruit NP15. The second step of replication—vRNA synthesis from a cRNA template—may require alternative, symmetric FluPol dimers for template realignment16. Along with vRNPs, free FluPol and NP, ANP32 proteins are essential for influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus and influenza C virus (ICV) replication, supporting vRNA as well as cRNA synthesis10,14,17,18,19. Although ANP32 proteins are highly conserved among vertebrates, genetic variation, such as a 33 amino acid insertion in avian ANP32A17,20, or substitutions in amino acid residues 129, 130 or 15610,11,21,22,23, can affect influenza virus replication. IAVs naturally reside in the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic birds like ducks and geese; avian FluPolA activity is stymied in mammalian cells due to mismatched ANP32 proteins. Therefore, to cross into mammals, IAVs undergo mutations in the genes encoding their FluPolA subunits. The best-known example of a mammalian adaptation is a glutamate-to-lysine substitution in PB2 (PB2 E627K)24. Despite an increasing understanding of avian IAV adaptation, the molecular mechanisms driving such mutations have remained elusive.Here, we use cryo-EM to characterise the interaction of human ANP32B with FluPolA derived from the avian H5N1 strain Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 (Tky05), which naturally carries the mammalian adaptations PB2 627K and PA 383D25. Tky05 FluPolA acquired additional mammalian adaptations during passaging experiments in human cells lacking ANP32A and ANP32B (dKO)26. These substitutions—PB1 K577E and PA Q556R—allowed Tky05 FluPolA to co-opt an alternative host factor, ANP32E, to support its replication. Importantly, this adapted polymerase can still be supported by ANP32B26. Substitutions of the lysines at positions 577 and 578 of the PB1 subunit are common in avian-origin FluPolA adapting to replication in mice or mammalian cells; loss of either basic residue leads to enhanced virulence in mice and increased FluPolA activity, as well as reduced formation of symmetric dimers27,28,29,30. PA Q556R has also been widely described as a mammalian adaptation30,31,32,33,34,35. Furthermore, it evolved in an H9N2 virus infecting Anp32A gene-edited chickens36, and has been shown to enhance ANP32B binding to FluPolA26. We reasoned that disruption of symmetric dimer formation due to PB1 K577E, in combination with enhanced interaction with ANP32B, would be useful in obtaining a stable FluPolA–ANP32B replication complex. All experiments presented in this study were carried out with H5N1 Tky05 FluPolA with the PB1 K577E and PA Q556R amino acid changes. We uncover complexes of ANP32B with monomeric and dimeric FluPolA, revealing the structure of an IAV replication platform. In agreement with a recent publication26, we propose that some mammalian adaptations seen in avian-origin FluPolA arise to allow assembly of replication platforms with mammalian ANP32 proteins.ResultsHuman ANP32B forms a complex with monomeric H5N1 FluPolATo gain insight into the structural basis of genome replication in IAV, we employed a recombinant baculovirus co-expressing Tky05 FluPolA subunits PB1, PB2 and PA, along with human ANP32B, in Sf9 insect cells. We then purified the FluPolA–ANP32B complexes via affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Cryo-EM analysis revealed that FluPolA is present in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms, mostly bound to ANP32B (Supplementary Fig. 2). We did not observe symmetric dimers or higher-order oligomers in the samples. We determined the structure of a monomeric FluPolA in complex with ANP32B at a final resolution of 3.1 Å (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table 1). The endonuclease domain of PA (PAEndo), the CTDs of PB2 (PB2-C) and most of the highly acidic ANP32BLCAR (amino acids 160–251) remained flexible and were not resolved. The ANP32BLRR domain (amino acids 1–149) makes extensive contacts with the large CTD of PA (PA-C). Amino acid residues N129 and D130, which are essential for interaction between FluPol and ANP32A proteins11,37, form hydrogen bonds with PA K635. N129 also interacts with the first methionine of the PB1 subunit (Fig. 1b). The PA 550 loop (residues 550–560)38 forms a β-hairpin that inserts between the ANP32BLRR and the resolved N-terminal section of the ANP32BLCAR (residues 150–159), with the hydrophobic residues A553 and V554 contacting the concave face of the ANP32BLRR. PA R551 forms a salt bridge with ANP32B D159, while PA R559 interacts with ANP32B D119 and D146, in addition to π-stacking with F121 (Fig. 1c). PA R556 forms two salt bridges, with ANP32B E154 and D157, confirming its role in strengthening the interaction with ANP32B.Fig. 1: Human ANP32B forms a complex with monomeric H5N1 FluPolA.a Cryo-EM map of FluPolA heterotrimer (green) and ANP32BLRR (orange). b, c Close-up views of the ANP32BLRR–PA interactions.

Controls include RNAP II serine 2-phosphorylated (S2P) CTD peptide (S2P), unphosphorylated peptide (unphos), scrambled peptide and no peptide. Relative FluPolA binding levels to the peptide (bottom) are shown as a percentage of S5P binding (set at 100%). Band intensity was quantitated using Image J and analysed in GraphPad Prism 10. The signal in the no peptide lane (lane 8) was set to zero and subtracted from the other lanes, essentially rendering background signal (i.e. FluPolA binding to sepharose beads in the absence of CTD peptide) zero. Data represent mean values ± standard deviation (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). Ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to assess significance, with the confidence interval set at 95%. P values are as follows: S5P vs S2P: P = 0.0043; S5P vs unphos: P = 0.0007; S5P vs scrambled: P = 0.0014; S5P vs S5P + ANP32B: P = 0.0025; and S5P vs no peptide: P = 0.0002.

Comparison of the ANP32B and RNAP II CTD binding sites suggests that their binding is mutually exclusive (Fig. 1d). We performed competition experiments by immobilising RNAP II CTD peptides6 on streptavidin resin, followed by incubation with FluPolA in the presence or absence of ANP32B. As expected, FluPolA binds the serine 5 phosphorylated (S5P) version of the CTD, a hallmark of RNAP II transcription initiation40, but in the presence of ANP32B binding is reduced >6-fold (Fig. 1e). FluPolA pull-down is dependent on ANP32B concentration, while absence of ANP32B signal on the gel confirms that it does not bind CTD peptides itself, i.e. CTD binding is mediated solely by FluPolA (Supplementary Fig. 4). These data suggest that ANP32B can outcompete RNAP II for binding to FluPolA, in a concentration-dependent manner. Altogether, our data suggest that newly synthesised, RNA-free FluPolA binds ANP32B as it enters the cell nucleus, and that this interaction prevents binding to the RNAP II CTD.Dimeric H5N1 FluPolA forms a replication platform with human ANP32BWe next determined the structure of the Tky05 replication platform, comprising an asymmetric dimer of FluPolA and ANP32B, to a final resolution of 3.2 Å (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Movie 1). In this complex, the active site of the FluPolR PAEndo domain is buried and thus cannot perform cleavage of capped host RNA, i.e. FluPolR is transcription incompetent. Its orientation is stabilised by the arrangement of the PB2-C domains: the PB2 mid-link (PB2Mid-link) and cap binding domain (PB2CBD) pack against the PB1 palm subdomain (PB1Palm) to form the product exit channel (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The PB2627 domain sits at the dimer interface, while the PB2 nuclear localisation signal (PB2NLS) domain packs against the PB2 lid (PB2Lid) and PAEndo domains, locking the overall FluPolR conformation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1b).Fig. 2: H5N1 FluPolA dimer forms a replication platform with human ANP32B.a Cryo-EM map of IAV replication platform composed of a replicase heterotrimer (FluPolR, blue), an encapsidating heterotrimer (FluPolE, green) and ANP32BLRR (orange). b Model showing the organisation of the PB2 flexible domains and PAEndo in the replication platform. c Close-up view of the PAEndo, PB2Lid and PB2CBD interface. d–f Close-up views of the FluPolR-FluPolE interface. g Close-up view of the PB2627-ANP32B interface.

For panel c–g, the dashed rectangles in panels a and b denote the close-up view position. h Electrostatic iso-surface of the FluPolE PB2627-NLS–FluPolR PB2627 domains showing a positively charged groove adjacent to ANP32BLRR, with the dashed line highlighting the putative path of the ANP32LCAR domain. The orientation is identical to the rotated view in panel (b).Full size imageThe PB2-C domains of FluPolE are arranged differently from published transcriptase (FluPolT) or replicase (FluPolR) conformations14,16,41. In those previous structures, the PB2627 and PB2NLS domains pack against the PA-C domain (Supplementary Fig. 1b and Supplementary Movie 1), while in this study the PB2Mid-link and PB2CBD of FluPolE pack against the PB2 N2 (PB2N2) domain (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). In the transcriptase and replicase conformations, the PB2Lid domain packs against the PB1 thumb subdomain (PB1Thumb) and the C-terminal region to form the template exit channel (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). In contrast, in FluPolE the PB2Lid flips over to mediate the stacking between PAEndo and PB2CBD via its C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1b, d). This position of the PB2Lid and PAEndo domains is unique—to the best of our knowledge a direct interaction between the PB2CBD and the PAEndo or PB2Lid domains has not been observed before. To assume this configuration, PAEndo rotates by 70° so that its loop51–72 stacks against the PB2CBD domain, sandwiching the PB2Lid between the PAEndo α-helix84–98 and the PB2CBD domains (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The interface is stabilised through extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 2c) and secures the overall FluPolE conformation. This explains why the PA loop51–72 was found to be essential for viral replication but not transcription42. Without the loop the FluPolE configuration cannot form, and without FluPolE the replication platform cannot form.The interaction between FluPolR and FluPolE is predominantly mediated by their respective PB2 and PA subunits, forming a large interface. The PA-C domain and PB1 β-hairpin of FluPolE stack against the PB2N2 and PB2Mid-link domains of FluPolR (Fig. 2d, e), while the PB2627 domain of FluPolR interacts with the PA-C and the PB2627-NLS domains of FluPolE (Fig. 2f). The conformation of ANP32B in the replication platform is practically identical to that in the ANP32B-bound monomeric FluPolA structure (root-mean-square deviation = 1.056 Å). Both structures have clear density for the ANP32BLRR (amino acid 1–149) and the N-terminal region of the ANP32BLCAR (residue 150–159). However, in the replication platform, ANP32B interacts with the FluPolE PB2627domain, while we observe no direct contacts with FluPolR. Of note, the canonical mammalian adaptive residue PB2 K627 of FluPolE forms a salt bridge with ANP32B E151 (Fig. 2g). PB2 R630 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain of ANP32B E154, as well as π-stacking with ANP32B P156 (Fig. 2g). A proline-to-serine substitution at position 156 of swine ANP32A allowed avian FluPolA to replicate to some extent in porcine cells23,43, lending credence to the idea of pigs as intermediary hosts for avian IAVs. Our structure suggests that an ANP32 P156S mutation would allow additional hydrogen bonding with FluPolE. Mutagenesis of PB2 residues 627 and 630, and ANP32B residues 151 and 156 leads to significantly reduced FluPolA activity in vRNP reconstitution assays, suggesting this interface is biologically relevant (Supplementary Fig. 5).PB2 K627 of FluPolR is situated in a positively charged groove that may be a binding site for part of the unresolved section of the ANP32B LCAR domain (residues 160–251) (Fig. 2h). The ubiquitous PB2 627E-to-K switch, observed when avian IAVs spill over into mammals, likely allows a region of the fully acidic mammalian LCAR domain (for example, residues 176-DEEDEDD−183 in human ANP32B; acidic residues underlined) to interact with FluPolA, as suggested by Carrique et al. 14. Avian ANP32A contains acidic as well as basic residues in this region (176-VLSLVKDR−183; acidic and basic residues underlined), allowing interaction with either glutamate or lysine14 (Supplementary Fig. 6).Comparison of the IAV and ICV replication platformsThe marked similarity of the ANP32A and ANP32B LRR domains44 allows direct comparison between the IAV (with ANP32B) and ICV (with ANP32A) replication platforms, despite the fact that IAVs and ICVs, although closely related, represent different influenza types that diverged around 8,000 years ago45. FluPolA and FluPolC are only about 20–40% identical at the amino acid level46, so differences in their interactions with ANP32 proteins of their respective hosts (humans and swine only in the case of ICV; a wide variety of birds and mammals for IAV) are to be expected. Nevertheless, the replication platforms share a similar overall arrangement, albeit exhibiting some striking differences (Supplementary Movie 1).Notably, in the IAV replication platform, only the C-terminal region of the ANP32BLRR binds to the complex, exclusively interacting with FluPolE (Fig. 3a). This reinforces the essential role of ANP32 residues N129 and D130 in supporting replication. Unlike the ICV complex, no direct interaction is observed between the N-terminal region of the ANP32BLRR and FluPolR, suggesting that IAV has evolved to optimise the binding of ANP32 exclusively to FluPolE. We speculate that a single, optimised binding interface may allow IAV to target a wide range of host animals.Fig. 3: Comparison between IAV and ICV replication platforms.a Overall assembly of IAV and ICV replication platforms composed of FluPolR (blue), FluPolE (green) and ANP32LRR (orange; human ANP32B in the IAV platform; chicken ANP32A in the ICV platform). FluPolA PB2 K627 and its FluPolC equivalent K649 on both FluPolR and FluPolE are highlighted in yellow. b Comparison of the binding of human ANP32BLRR (dark orange) and chicken ANP32ALRR (light orange) to the PA-C domain of IAV (green) and equivalent P3-C of ICV (white). c Sequence alignment of the PA/P3 subunits of different influenza viruses. Influenza C virus (C/Johannesburg/1/1966) has elongated 490–500 and 550–560 loops, compared with influenza A virus, but it lacks a 51–72 loop. d Variation in the PA490–500 and PA550–560 loops between IAV and ICV affects the positioning of ANP32LRR (orange) and PB2627 (dark green) relative to the PA/P3-C domain (light green). The ICV replication platform structure in panels (a, b and d) is based on PDB 6XZR.Full size imageInsertions into regions of the ICV P3-C domain (P3 being the ICV equivalent of PA), in particular the loops between residues 490 and 500 and the 550 loop (Fig. 3c), lead to ANP32B binding to the IAV FluPolE PA-C in an alternative orientation (Fig. 3b). In ICV, the P3 550 loop is positioned between the PB2627-NLS domain and the ANP32ALCAR, preventing their interaction (Fig. 3d). In IAV, the shorter PA 550 loop is inserted between the ANP32BLRR and the ANP32BLCAR and, since the PA490–500 loop is also shorter, the PB2627-NLS is rotated towards the ANP32BLCAR, promoting direct interactions (Fig. 3d). These differences also affect how the remaining PB2-C domains are arranged: in IAV, the stacking of the PAEndo domain against the PB2CBD is mediated by PA loop51–72, which is not conserved in ICV (Fig. 3c).In summary, like their interaction with the CTD of host RNAP II39, differences in ANP32 protein binding between IAV and ICV likely reflect their evolutionary distance, and is informative with regard to key amino acid interactions.Molecular basis of mammalian adaptations in avian FluPolAMutations in the viral polymerase (Fig. 4a) are vital to the process of avian IAV adaptation to mammalian hosts47. PB2 E627K is the hallmark of mammalian adaptation; all 20th century IAVs circulating in humans had this signature. In contrast, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses had PB2 627E—their replication in mammals is attributed predominantly to a glutamine-to-arginine mutation at position 591 of PB248,49. Our structure shows that K627 and Q591 are adjacent in FluPolE and could substitute each other to form a salt bridge with ANP32 E151 upon mutation into a basic residue (Fig. 4b). The more recently identified adaptive mutation PB2 M631L is in the same FluPolE cluster (Fig. 4b). In combination with PA E349K, this mutation allowed an avian H9N2 FluPolA to replicate using the normally non-functional chicken ANP32B and ANP32E (as opposed to the proviral chicken ANP32A), as well as human ANP32 proteins36. Other mammalian adaptations in the PB2 subunit of avian FluPolA—including 2009 pH1N1 viruses—are T271A and D701N50,51. It has been suggested that PB2 Q591R, E627K and D701N specifically adapt avian FluPolA to mammalian ANP32 proteins52, while we hypothesise that T271A stabilises the FluPolE conformation through interaction with the 424 loop of PB2CBD53. Of note, on FluPolR Q591, K627 and M631 also form a cluster (Fig. 4a), on the interface with the PB2627 domain of FluPolE, which is the presumed location of the LCAR domain of ANP32. Thus some residues may fulfil a double function of strengthening FluPolE (via ANP32 residue 151), as well as FluPolR (through LCAR residues) binding to ANP32. Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear from the current structure how the 33 amino acid insertion in avian ANP32A allows both PB2 627E and 627K FluPolA activity.Fig. 4: Adaptive mutations on the IAV replication platform.a Overall assembly of IAV replication platform (without ANP32B), mapping mammalian FluPolA adaptations potentially affecting either ANP32B binding or FluPolR–FluPolE interactions. Mutations in PA are highlighted in red; PB2 adaptations in green. See also Supplementary Table 2. b Close-up view of adaptive cluster including PB2 residues 591, 627, 630 and 631, and their interactions with ANP32B residues 151, 154 and 156. c Close-up view of potential adaptive cluster on the FluPolE–FluPolR PA–PA interface. Residue 383 of FluPolE already is aspartate in wildtype Tky05 FluPolA. Also shown is a pair of adaptations found in human-adapted H5N1 FluPolA, namely S388R (FluPolE) and A448E (FluPolR). d Model for the role of ANP32 proteins in the assembly of the IAV replication platform. Upon nuclear entry (1), vRNP-associated FluPolA docks onto the CTD of RNAP II for primary transcription (2). Viral mRNAs are translated in the cytoplasm and newly synthesised FluPol enters the nucleus (3), where it associates with ANP32 and adopts an encapsidating conformation (4). The RNA-free FluPolE–ANP32 complex then associates with vRNP-associated FluPol, stabilising it in a replicase conformation (FluPolR) and forming a replication platform (5).Full size imageConsidering FluPolA adaptations that occur in nature when avian IAVs, including the highly pathogenic H5Nx and H7Nx subtypes, spill over into mammals (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 2), it appears that they fall in one of two broad categories. Substitutions like E627K in PB2 and Q556R in PA strengthen interactions between mammalian ANP32 proteins and FluPolE. Adaptations including PA E349K and PB2 K526R may shift the FluPolA oligomeric equilibrium (in particular, asymmetric vs symmetric dimers) in favour of the asymmetric replication platform, thus promoting replication.Besides the PB2 591/627/631 clusters, we observe a potential mutational hotspot at the PA-PA interface of the platform. Arai and colleagues54 identify a pair of PA substitutions—S388R and A448E—from an Egyptian H5N1 strain that replicates to high titres in human cells. These residues sit on opposite sides of the FluPolE–FluPolR interface and may enhance affinity between the molecules by forming an additional hydrogen bond (Fig. 4c). One of the mammalian adaptations that is already present in wildtype Tky05 FluPolA, PA N383D, maps a short distance across from K605 of the FluPolR PA subunit. Here a hydrogen bond can form between the FluPolE D383 and the FluPolR K605 (Fig. 4c). Clustered mutational hotspots are potential targets for antiviral intervention.DiscussionThe insights gained in this study enable us to propose a model for the assembly of the IAV replication platform (Fig. 4d). Upon viral infection, the vRNPs are trafficked into the nucleus. Through the interaction between the host RNAP II CTD and the PA-C domain of FluPolA, vRNP-resident FluPolA carries out transcription primed by host capped RNAs5,6. Translation of viral proteins takes place in the cytoplasm, and newly synthesised FluPolA and NP proteins are imported into the nucleus to support replication. We propose that ANP32 proteins act as chaperones for free FluPolA as it enters the cell nucleus, by binding on the PA-C domain. The FluPolA–ANP32 complex cannot dock onto the RNAP II CTD, preventing competition with vRNP-resident FluPolA. Through interactions of ANP32B residues E151, E154 and P156 with FluPolE PB2627 domain residues K627 and R630, FluPolA adopts an encapsidating conformation (FluPolE). A replication platform is assembled when the FluPolE–ANP32 complex interacts with a vRNP-bound FluPolA, stabilising it in a replication-competent conformation (FluPolR). As demonstrated by Zhu et al. 19 and others10,11, ANP32B (or ANP32A) is an essential component of the influenza virus replication machinery, alongside NP and free FluPolA. In the context of the replication platform, FluPolE does not act catalytically but initiates cRNP assembly by capturing the 5′ end of the nascent replication product, while ANP32 promotes the recruitment of NP to the nascent RNA, as proposed previously15. Our data suggest that mammalian adaptations not only allow the recruitment of mammalian ANP32 proteins, but also calibrate the different FluPolA oligomers to ensure assembly of the replication platform, enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind mammalian adaptations in avian-origin FluPolA.MethodsCells and plasmidsHEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma) with 10% FCS (Sigma); human eHAP (Horizon Discovery) TKO cells were maintained in Iscove’s Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma) with 10% FCS, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. ANP32A, ANP32B and ANP32E knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; this is described in detail elsewhere10,26. Sf9 cells were maintained in Sf-900 II serum free medium (Gibco) at 27 °C without CO2.pCAGGS plasmids expressing H5N1 Tky05 vRNP components PB1, PB2, PA and NP are described elsewhere55. Mutagenesis to obtain PB1 K557E and PA Q556R was performed by overlapping PCR as described26. PB2 K627E and R630A constructs were made by mutagenesis PCR using primers GCTGCTCCTCCTGAGCAGTCCCGTATGC and GCATACGGGACTGCTCAGGAGGAGCAGC, and CCACCGAAGCAGAGCGCAATGCAGTTTTCTTCTC and GAGAAGAAAACTGCATTGCGCTCTGCTTCGGTG, respectively. ANP32B constructs pcDNA-ANP32B E151A and P156A were obtained by mutagenesis PCR using primers GGATACGATCGCGCGGACCAAGAGGC and GGCCTCTTGGTCCGCGCGATCGTATC, and CGAGGACCAAGAGGCCGCTGATTCCGATGCCG and CCTCGGCATCGGAATCAGCGGCCTCTTGGTCCTC, respectively.Protein expression and purificationFluPolA subunits PA 556R, PB1 577E and protein A-tagged PB2 of Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1), with or without human ANP32B, were expressed in Sf9 cells from codon-optimised genes (Synbio) cloned into a single baculovirus using the MultiBac system56. Mutations PB1 K577E and PA Q556R were introduced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. Sf9 cell suspension cultures, maintained in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Gibco) without antibiotics, were infected with baculovirus and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication (3 × 30 s with 30 s intervals) in buffer A (50 mM Hepes:NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) octylthioglucoside, 1 mM DTT), complemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free) and 100 μg/ml RNase A. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 45 mins, 4 °C) and the supernatant was incubated with IgG sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Cytiva) for 3 h at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed extensively with buffer A and FluPolA (+/− ANP32B) was released overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 mg tobacco etch virus protease in buffer A. The supernatant containing FluPolA (+/− ANP32B) was collected by centrifugation, and SEC was performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer B (25 mM Hepes:NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT).GST-tagged human ANP32B for pull-down assays was expressed in E. coli overnight at 18 °C in LB growth medium, upon 1 mM IPTG induction at OD600 = 0.6. Cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 45 s with 30 s intervals) in buffer C (50 mM Hepes:NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) octylthioglucoside, 1 mM DTT), complemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free), 100 μg/ml RNase A and lysozyme (Sigma). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione sepharose™ 4B (Cytiva) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. After binding, the beads were washed extensively with buffer C and the proteins were released overnight at 4 °C with PreScission human rhinovirus 3 C protease in buffer C. The supernatant containing the protein was collected and SEC was performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer D (25 mM Hepes:NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT).Cryo-EM sample preparationGrids were prepared using a Vitrobot mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 100% relative humidity. Quantifoil Holey Carbon R2/1 200 mesh gold grids were glow discharged, before applying 3.5 μl of sample at around 0.3 mg/ml and blotted for 5 s, blot force 15, before vitrification in liquid ethane.Cryo-EM image collectionCryo-EM data were collected at the Oxford Particle Imaging Centre (OPIC), on a 300 kV G3i Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fitted with a SelectrisX energy filter and Falcon IV direct electron detector. Automated data collection was set up in EPU 3.4 and movies were recorded in EER format. Data were collected using AFIS with a total dose of ~50 e−/Å2, a calibrated pixel size of 0.932 Å/pix and a 10 eV slit. For the FluPolA–ANP32B dataset 14,937 movies were collected without tilt and 5397 movies were collected with the specimen tilted by 30°. For the FluPolA dimer–ANP32B dataset, 3985 movies were collected without tilt and 7305 movies were collected with the specimen tilted by 30° to improve the angular distribution of the particles. Sample-specific data collection parameters are summarised in Supplementary Table 1.Cryo-EM data processingAll datasets were processed using CryoSPARC V-4.257, following the workflow illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2. The EER format movies were fractionated in 60 frames without applying an up-sampling factor. Pre-processing was performed using patch motion correction and patch-CTF estimation with default settings. Corrected micrographs with poor statistics where manually curated. A first round of blob picking followed by a round of 2D classification generated initial templates that were used for template picking. After 2D classification using 200 classes, 500 particles per batch size and 40 iterations, well-resolved classes were selected and three ab initio models were generated and further refined using heterogenous refinement.For the monomeric FluPolA–ANP32B dataset, particles belonging to high-resolution maps were used to train a Topaz model and pick a new set of particles. These particles were 2D classified using 200 classes, 500 particles per batch size and 40 iterations and the selected particles were used to generate three new ab initio models that were then refined using heterogenous refinement. A single class was selected and the 1 M particles were refined using NU-refinement with per-particles CTF refinement. 3D classification without alignment, using ten classes and default settings led to two interesting classes after visual inspection, that were selected and independently refined using local NU-refinement. The first map containing 63k particles was refined to 3.12 Å resolution and had density for FluPolA core and ANP32B. The other class contained 110,000 particles and also led to a 3.12 Å resolution map after local NU-refinement. The FluPolA core, as well as PAEndo and the PB2NLS were resolved in the density but without density for ANP32B. Based on the orientation of the PAEndo and the PB2NLS domains, this conformation is analogous to the replicase.For the dimeric FluPolA–ANP32B dataset, particles belonging to well-resolved classes were used to train a Topaz model (default settings) and pick a new set of particles. To recover rare views that could have been classified out during 2D classification, particles from Topaz picker were directly 3D classified using heterogenous refinement with all the models generated with ab initio duplicated. After three rounds of Topaz training/picking and heterogenous refinement, the class representing the replication platform, containing 245,000 particles, was refined using NU-refinement with per-particles CTF refinement. To address the intrinsic flexibility of the complex, a focused refinement was performed on the FluPolE + PB2627 domain of the FluPolR and ANP32B (Supplementary Fig. 2, blue dashed lines) and one on the FluPolR without the PB2627 domain (Supplementary Fig. 2, green dashed lines). Each was independently 3D classified, without particle alignment and across ten classes using default settings. After visual inspection, in the case of FluPolR (without PB2627), a lot of the particles lacked a well-ordered PB1 β-hairpin and PA arch domain38, likely due to denaturation at the air-water interface. These particles were removed. Regarding FluPolE + FluPolR − PB2627 + ANP32B, we did not observe any variation in the occupancy of ANP32B. The organisation of the PA-C and the PB2627 domains from FluPolE and FluPolR are identical in the focus refinement and the consensus map. The 3D classification allowed us to select the two classes with the most ordered PB2CBD, PB2Mid-link and PAEndo for model building. Each of them were selected and independently refined using local NU-refinement, leading to 3.2 Å maps for each of them. The focus-refined maps were combined using PHENIX combine focused map58. The combined map was then used for model building after assessing that the quality of the combined map was identical to the focused maps and that the interface was identical to the consensus map.Structure determination and model refinementInitial modelling was performed using PDB 6RR7 by first fitting the entire FluPolA or individual domains. The ANP32B structure was predicted by AlphaFold259 implemented in CollabFold60. Fitting was done using UCSF ChimeraX61,62. In WinCoot 0.9.8.763, the restraints module was used to generate restraints at 4.3 Å and allow flexible refinement to fit the main chain into density. Multiple cycles of manual adjustment in WinCoot, followed by real space refinement in PHENIX64, were used to improve model geometry. The final model geometry and map-to-model comparison were validated using PHENIX MolProbity65. All the map and model statistics are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. Structural analysis and figures were prepared using UCSF ChimeraX.RNAP II CTD binding competition assayWe employed a method previously developed in our laboratory and described in detail elsewhere6. In short, 20 μg of biotinylated RNAP II CTD peptide (four heptad repeats6) was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 10 μl of Pierce streptavidin magnetic beads in buffer E, containing 10 mM HEPES (PAA Laboratories), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40 and 1 mM PMSF. As described by Martínez-Alonso et al. 6, the CTD peptides had been chemically synthesised by solid-phase peptide synthesis and quality controlled by mass spectrometry by Cambridge Peptide Ltd. Following three washes in buffer E the beads were incubated with 1% BSA in buffer E for 45 min at 4 °C in order to reduce non-specific binding. Following a wash in buffer E, 3.5 ug of purified Tky05 FluPolA (PB1 577E and PA 556R), in the presence or absence of a threefold molar excess of ANP32B, was incubated with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Following five washes in buffer E, bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were visualised by silver staining using the SilverXpress LC6100 kit (Invitrogen). Band intensity was quantitated using Image J and analysed in GraphPad Prism 10.vRNP reconstitution assaysHEK 293T or eHAP TKO cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with pCAGGS plasmids encoding Tky05 PB1 577E, PA 556R, PB2 and NP (0.05 μg each), alongside the viral reporter plasmid pPolI-firefly luciferase66 and ANP32B-encoding or empty pcDNA plasmids as indicated, using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (ThermoFisher) transfection reagent, with 2 μl P3000™ Enhancer Reagent and 3 μl Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent per μg plasmid DNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were lysed in 60 μl Reporter Lysis Buffer for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bioluminescence was then measured on a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech), using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).ImmunoblottingExogenously expressed proteins ANP32B and PB2, and the cellular control protein Vinculin were probed with primary antibodies rabbit anti-ANP32B (Abcam, ab200836; 1/2000), rabbit anti-influenza A virus PB2 (Genetex, GTX125925; 1/2000) and rabbit anti-Vinculin (Abcam, ab129002; 1/2000), respectively. The backsides of the primary antibodies were then detected with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Genetex, GTX213110-01; 1/10,000). Detection was carried out using either Cytiva ECL Start Western Blotting Detection reagent (Amersham) or Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

They said 19 of 23 monitored wastewater sites had at least one detection event and that, over time, H5N1 became the dominant serotype. They did not name the 10 cities they monitored, and the findings have yet to be peer-reviewed. On X, Mike Tisza, PhD, the first author of the study and assistant professor of virology and microbiology at Baylor, said it's still not clear where the viruses came from, but the evidence tilts toward an animal source, because the researchers didn't see any mutations with known links to human adaptation.He added that the network in Texas appears to be the only one using the wastewater sequencing technology, but that H5N1 is probably present in wastewater in other areas. If the virus becomes more of a problem, Tisza said wastewater sequencing may be the best way to identify new adaptive mutations. CDC launches ferret experimentsIn a May 10 response update, the CDC said more than 260 people have so far been monitored for H5N1 symptoms following exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. Of at least 33 who had flulike symptoms, no additional human cases have been reported beyond an initial case in a Texas dairy worker who had conjunctivitis.The CDC said it is still in talks with multiple states about state-led field epidemiologic investigations.Meanwhile, the group said it is moving ahead with scientific work to better characterize the virus, Last week it experimentally infected ferrets with the virus that infected the Texas dairy worker to assess disease severity and transmission under different contact scenarios. Scientists often use ferrets as a model to assess flu viruses because they get sick and transmit them similar to people.Results are expected in about 3 weeks, and the CDC said experimental infection of various cell lines will follow.In other developments:The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported more outbreaks in poultry in three states, including two that have reported H5N1 in dairy herds. Idaho reported two more poultry outbreaks, both in Jerome County. One occurred at a farm housing 1,000 birds and the other struck a backyard location that has 20 birds. Michigan reported another outbreak in Ionia County, which affected a backyard flock. And California reported a detection at a live-bird market in San Francisco.An animal influenza expert group of the World Organization for Animal Health and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, known as OFFLU, today issued a statement on H5N1 in dairy cows, noting that the B3.13 genotype hadn't been detected in poultry before it turned up in cattle.

The following pandemic strategy documents and resources are intended to guide the United States' preparedness and response during an influenza (flu) pandemic. Background In 1997, avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses first spread from poultry to humans in Hong Kong. Of the 18 persons infected with the virus, 6 died. Concerned that this A(H5N1) virus could easily spread to and between people, the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States government increased pandemic preparedness. An influenza pandemic could place an extraordinary burden on health care systems and essential community services. Preparing for such a threat is an important priority. In 2005, officials at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed a Pandemic Influenza Plan to coordinate and improve efforts to prevent, control, and respond to A(H5N1) viruses and other novel (non-human) influenza A viruses with pandemic potential. Although it is impossible to predict when the next pandemic will occur, three tools are used to guide national, state and local planning and response. These tools align with the World Health Organization's (WHO) global framework of pandemic phases and risk assessment activities for preparedness, response, and recovery.

Apr. 8, 2024 National Pandemic Influenza Plans In 2005 and 2006, the White House Homeland Security Council outlined the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan to guide the United States' preparedness and response activities in an influenza pandemic. These plans aimed to stop, slow, or otherwise limit the spread of a pandemic to the U.S.; limiting domestic spread, mitigating disease, suffering and death; and sustaining infrastructure and lessening the effects on the economy and society as a whole. At the same time, HHS framed its Pandemic Influenza Plan around a doctrine that laid out guiding principles for pandemic influenza preparedness and response. Since 2005, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has worked with partners in public health, health care, and emergency management to enhance the nation's pandemic influenza preparedness. Today, there is a well-established domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity, stockpiles of influenza vaccines and therapeutics, and evidence-based guidance on prevention, mitigation and treatment available for state and local governments, the private sector, individuals, and families. The nation now faces new challenges — how to sustain the advances made, how to keep up with the changes in how people live and work for example — and these challenges call for new approaches to better protect the nation against influenza pandemics. As part of HHS' overarching strategy to address these new challenges, seven focus areas ("Domains") have been developed to guide future efforts to improve pandemic influenza preparedness. HHS anticipates that the capacity and capabilities developed for pandemic influenza preparedness will enable HHS to respond more effectively to other emerging infectious diseases as well. Preparing for the next pandemic is an ongoing, iterative process. HHS will continue to refine its approach and incorporate lessons learned as it continues to prepare the nation for the next pandemic. National Pandemic Strategy The following documents guide the United States’ preparedness and response in an influenza pandemic, with the intent of stopping, slowing or otherwise limiting the spread of a pandemic to the United States; limiting the domestic spread of a pandemic, mitigating disease, suffering and death; and sustaining infrastructure and mitigating impact to the economy and the functioning of society.

The exact molecular mechanism(s) underlying this genetic change and reasons underlying the restriction to H5 and H7 viruses remain unknown. Here, we developed a novel experimental system based on frame repair through insertions or deletions (indels) of HAs with single nucleotide deletions. Indels were readily detected in a consensus H5 LPAIV CS at low frequency, which was increased upon the introduction of only one substitution leading to a longer stretch of adenines at the CS. In contrast, we only detected indels in H6 when multiple nucleotide substitutions were introduced. These data show that nucleotide sequence is a key determinant of insertions in the HA CS, and reveal novel insights about the subtype-specificity of HPAIV emergence.

To date, 17 HA and nine NA subtypes have been detected in wild aquatic birds1,2. Influenza A viruses generally cause asymptomatic or mild infections in birds, and are referred to as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs)3. Upon the introduction of LPAIVs of the H5 and H7 subtypes in terrestrial poultry, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) may emerge. HPAIVs cause severe disease in poultry with mortality rates as high as 100%4. Besides these disastrous consequences on animal welfare and the poultry industry, spill-over events to humans pose a continuous pandemic threat5.Post-translational cleavage of HA by host cell proteases is necessary for HA to be fusogenic and the virus to be infectious1. The HA proteins of LPAIVs have a monobasic cleavage site (CS) that is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases, predominantly expressed in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of birds6,7. In the vast majority of cases, the conversion from LPAIV to HPAIV is the result of the insertion of nucleotides coding for basic amino acids at the HA0 precursor protein CS, leading to a multi-basic cleavage site (MBCS)8,9. MBCSs are cleaved by furin-like proteases that are ubiquitously expressed, supporting systemic virus dissemination and severe disease in gallinaceous species10. Decades ago, different mechanisms of MBCS acquisition were identified upon the analysis of MBCS sequences of HPAIVs: (i) nucleotide substitutions and (ii) nucleotide insertions possibly due to either stuttering and/or backtracking of the influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or, (iii) in the case of some H7 viruses, to non-homologous recombination with exogenous viral or host RNA11,12,13. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying MBCS acquisition via insertions remain unknown to date. Additionally, it remains unknown why HPAIVs have so far only evolved from H5 and H7 LPAIV precursors. Artificial introduction of an MBCS into non-H5/H7 HAs generally led to trypsin-independency in vitro14,15,16,17, indicating that the absence of an MBCS in naturally occurring non-H5/H7 viruses is not due to incompatibility at the protein level. The restriction of HPAIVs to H5 and H7 subtypes might therefore be due to differences and/or constraints at the RNA level. RNA structures have been suggested to play a role in insertion generation at the HA CS11,18,19,20. Subtype-specific conserved secondary RNA stem-loop structures have been predicted at the HA CS19,21. However, RNA structure predictions of HAs from subtypes other than H5 and H7 have identified similar putative structures, suggesting that RNA structures might not be the only important factor that contributes to insertions in HA CSs21. The H5 and H7 CS sequences have been shown to stand out by their high purine content, suggesting that specific sequences and codon composition11,18,20,22,23,24,25 may be important for MBCS acquisition and subtype restriction of HPAIV genesis25.Research aimed to study the drivers of MBCS acquisition has been hampered by the fact that it is difficult to mimic this process in a laboratory setting, both in vitro and in vivo. H5 and H7 LPAIVs converted in rare occasions to HPAIVs and only when selection pressure for trypsin independency was applied26,27,28,29,30,31, extensive passaging was performed26,29,30,32,33, or non-basic amino acids at the CS were substituted to basic ones22,23,24,34,35,36. Some of these experiments were performed with virus isolates instead of clonal viruses, making the distinction between de novo insertions and the presence of viral quasispecies with mutated CSs impossible26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. Other shortcomings were the low throughput and sensitivity as viruses with mutated CSs have to outcompete the wild-type (WT) virus in order to be reliably detected. To cope with these limitations, we developed a sensitive system with which indels at the HA CS can be readily detected. Single nucleotide deletions (SNDs) were introduced at the HA CS, leading to a non-functional HA protein. Upon use of these templates in reverse genetics, viruses with HAs that contain indels restoring the reading frame are under strong selective advantage without competition with a WT virus. Using this experimental system, we investigated the impact of nucleotide sequence at the HA CS on insertions and deletions (indels), in order to shed light on subtype-restriction of LPAIV to HPAIV conversion. We showed that nucleotide sequence was important in the acquisition of indels in the H5 and H6 CS region. Indels in the H5 CS were easily facilitated by a one nucleotide substitution increasing the length of the adenine/uracil (A/U)-stretch while indels in the H6 CS were only detected upon five or six nucleotide substitutions.ResultsIndels were readily detected at the H5 CSWe aimed to develop a novel experimental system with which insertions at the HA CS can be detected with a high sensitivity. SNDs were introduced, leading to a (−1) frameshift in the HA reading frame and thus changing the coding sequence. Upon use of these templates in reverse genetics, functional virus can only be produced if the frame of the HA protein is repaired by indels. This system ensures that rare indels that would not necessarily confer a selective advantage over the WT virus can be detected.In order to study indels in an H5 with a LPAIV CS, the CS of the H5 A/Indonesia/5/2005 (A/Indo/5/05) HPAIV HA was mutated to match the H5 LPAIV amino acid and nucleotide consensus P4 to P1 RETR sequence (H5RETR)25 (Supplementary Fig. 1, Fig. 1a). SNDs were introduced into the H5RETR CS and the resulting plasmids were co-transfected with the remaining seven reverse genetics plasmids of A/Indo/5/05 as virus backbone. Each HA with a SND (HASND) was tested in three independent reverse genetics experiments. When virus was detected by observation of cytopathic effects and/or hemagglutination assay, the HA CS region was sequenced by Sanger sequencing to determine the nature of the indels which resulted in frame repair and recombinant virus production. Predicted RNA stem-loops (Supplementary Fig. 1) and positive-sense orientation are used throughout the manuscript to represent the data and describe the location and nature of the indels. Ten H5RETR HASNDs were tested and virus was detected with only three HASNDs in 13% (4/30) of the experiments (Fig. 1b). Two single A insertions in the A-stretch located at the 3’ end of the loop, a four-nucleotide insertion at the 3’ end and a two-nucleotide deletion in the A-stretch at the loop 5’ end were detected (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 1a). These insertions led to tribasic and tetrabasic CSs (RKTR, REKR and REKKR; Supplementary Table 1a).Fig. 1: Higher indel detection was observed in the H5MBCS CS than in that of H5RETR.The predicted RNA stem-loops serve as a basis to schematically represent the data.

Results from testing (b) H5RETR HASNDs and (c) H5MBCS HASNDs.Full size imageNext, SNDs were introduced in the HA of A/Indo/5/05 (H5MBCS). Nineteen H5MBCS HASNDs were tested. Virus was detected in either 2/3 or 3/3 experiments with 16 out of 19 HASNDs, resulting in a total of 46 detected indels. Two-nucleotide deletions (16/46), single-nucleotide insertions (15/46) and insertions of more than one nucleotide (15/46) were observed (Fig. 1c). Indels were mostly observed in the loop of the predicted H5MBCS RNA structure, and only 2/46 of the indels were located at the top of the 5’ side of the stem. Indels observed in the loop were mainly located in two regions: the large A-stretch at the 3’ end of the loop (position 1057-1062) and the small A-stretch at the 5’ end of the loop (position 1041-1043). Indels that were observed repeatedly and in multiple HASNDs across the study were defined as indel pattern 1–4. Indel pattern 1 corresponded to a seven-nucleotide insertion (AAGAAAA) and represented 28% (13/46) of the observed indels in H5MBCS HASNDs. Indel pattern 2 corresponded to a one A insertion in the A-stretch at the 3’ end of the loop and was observed in 26% (12/46) of indels in H5MBCS HASNDs. Indel pattern 3 corresponded to a two-nucleotide deletion in the A-stretch at the 5’ end of the loop and was observed in 7% (3/46) of indels in H5MBCS HASNDs. Finally, indel pattern 4 corresponded to the insertion of a single A in the A-stretch at the 5’ end of the loop and was observed in 4% (2/46) of indels in H5MBCS HASNDs. All other detected indels are shown in Supplementary Table 1a. As many indels were observed in homopolymers, SNDs were introduced in A, U, cytosine (C) and guanine (G) homopolymers in other regions of the influenza virus genome. Virtually no indels were detected (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting a peculiarity of the CS region.Next, SNDs were introduced in the stem of the predicted RNA structures of H5RETR and H5MBCS. No virus was detected in any of the 33 independent experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). This indicated that either indels did not occur or remained undetected because they did not lead to frame repair or led to non-functional HA proteins.Taken together, these results show that indels were observed at the CS of both H5RETR and H5MBCS albeit at a much higher level in the H5MBCS HA. A striking difference between H5RETR and H5MBCS is the length of the A-stretch at the 3’ end of the loop, which was three and six-nucleotides long, respectively. Moreover, indels were detected in H5RETR when the length of the 3’ end loop A-stretch was increased from three to four or five (HASND Δ1046 and Δ1050; Fig. 1b), suggesting that the sequence of the 3’ end of the loop might be important for indels at the HA CS.Increasing the length of the A-stretch at the 3’end of the loop facilitated indels in H5Our previous observations suggested that the presence of longer A-stretches might be an important driver of indels at the HA CS (Fig. 1). To further investigate the impact of sequence on indel generation, the length of the 3’ end loop A-stretch was increased. Nucleotide substitutions were introduced in H5RETR at positions 1046, 1050 or both, which increased the A-stretch length to five, six or eight nucleotides, respectively, creating tri- and tetrabasic intermediate CS sequences (G1046A (H5RKTR), C1050A (H5REKR) and G1046A/C1050A (H5RKKR); Fig. 2a).Virus was detected in 67% (16/24), 88% (21/24) and 94% (17/18) of experiments using H5RKTR, H5REKR and H5RKKR HASNDs, respectively (Fig. 2b–d). This contrasted with data obtained with H5RETR (13%; 4/30), indicating that increasing the length of the 3’ end loop A-stretch indeed promoted indels. Most of the observed indels corresponded to the previously identified indel patterns. Indel pattern 2 was most frequently observed, being identified in 73% (10/16), 67% (14/21) and 24% (4/17) of the viruses produced using H5RKTR and H5REKR and H5RKKR HASNDs, respectively. A wider variation of indels was observed when H5RKKR HASNDs were tested (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 1a). Several insertions of four, seven (indel pattern 1) and even 13 nucleotides were observed, all consisting of As and one to three Gs. All insertions of 4, 7 and more nucleotides appeared to be the result of duplications of neighbouring sequences. Interestingly, a deletion of two As (indel pattern 3) was consistently observed in H5RKKR HASND Δ1044, which only contained As in the loop, thereby suggesting that there may be a limit to the number of contiguous As that are tolerated at the HA CS. The HA CS sequence of some of the viruses could not be reliably determined by Sanger sequencing (indicated by a green wedge in Fig. 2), indicative of the presence of mixed virus populations. This was confirmed by performing TOPO-cloning of H5 CS PCR fragments and subsequent Sanger sequencing of six clones per fragment. A wide variety of sequences was detected (Supplementary Table 1b). In 58% (35/60) of the clones, a frameshift in the HA protein was detected due to either the presence of the introduced SND (69%; 24/35) or an indel that did not lead to reading frame repair. The most frequently observed indel was a one A insertion which resulted in a R323K amino acid change. Additionally, larger insertions of 3, 5, 7 and even 33 As were observed. Together, these data suggested that tri- and tetrabasic intermediate CS motifs were more error-prone than the LPAIV H5RETR CS.Fig. 2: Increasing A homopolymer length facilitates indels at the H5 CS.Results are shown as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Grey closed arrow heads refer to the introduced nucleotide substitutions as compared to H5RETR. A green wedge indicates that the HA sequence of the rescued virus could not be reliably determined by Sanger sequencing. Faded pie slices indicate that an HA with the same sequence was previously tested and show the data from the previous experiment, identified by the same number of asterisks. Observed indel patterns and corresponding frequencies are indicated below the structures, the other detected indels are shown in Supplementary Table 1a. a Alignment of H5 intermediate CS sequences shown in Fig. 2. The asterisk indicates the border between HA1 and HA2. Results from testing (b) H5RKTR HASNDs, (c) H5REKR HASNDs and (d) H5RKKR HASNDs.Full size imageThe reciprocal approach was then taken by decreasing the length of the A-stretch of the H5s for which the highest indel frequency was observed (H5MBCS, H5REKR and H5RKKR), through the introduction of G or C nucleotides leading to either silent or non-silent substitutions. In general, reducing the length of the A-stretch decreased indel frequency (Supplementary Figs. 3−6: see notes in Supplementary information). Furthermore, a higher deletion to insertion rate was detected in H5MBCS with decreased A-stretch length, mostly occurring in the middle and at the 5’ end of the loop.Taken together, these results revealed a positive association between the A-stretch length at the 3’ end of the loop and indel occurrence at the H5 CS. This suggests that the sequence of the HA CS is a key determinant of indel generation and the nature of such indels.Indels were observed at the H6 CS only after extensively changing the CS sequenceTo gain further knowledge on subtype-restriction of MBCS acquisition, LPAIV H6IETR HASNDs were tested in our experimental system. The HA of A/mallard/Sweden/81/2002 (H6N1; A/ml/Sw/81/02) was used as (i) no HPAIVs have so far evolved from H6 LPAIVs in nature, despite extensive circulation in poultry37,38 and (ii) H6 and H5 belong to the same phylogenetic group1 (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the H6 CS region of A/ml/Sw/81/02 corresponds to the consensus CS sequence of all H6 LPAIVs, both at the amino acid and nucleotide level25. SNDs were introduced into H6IETR and reverse genetics experiments were performed using the H5 A/Indo/5/05 virus backbone. No virus was detected in any of the 42 experiments using H6IETR HASNDs (Fig. 3b), reflecting the natural situation whereby no HPAIV has so far evolved from an H6 LPAIV. SNDs were also introduced into the stem of the H6 CS predicted RNA structure (Supplementary Fig. 1), and no virus was detected in any of the nine experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2c).Fig. 3: Indels are not readily detected at the H6 CS.Results are shown as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Grey closed arrow heads refer to the introduced nucleotide substitutions as compared to H6IETR. Observed indel patterns and corresponding frequencies are indicated below the structures, the other detected indels are indicated in Supplementary Table 1a. a Alignment of H6 CS sequences shown in Fig. 3. The asterisk indicates the border between HA1 and HA2. Results from testing (b) H6IETR HASNDs, (c) H6RKKR HASNDs, (d) H6H5_codon use HASNDs, (e) H6H5_codon use_RETR HASNDs and (f) H6H5_codon use_RKKR HASNDs.Full size imageNext, we investigated which changes in H6IETR were necessary to detect indels. Firstly, substitutions were introduced to create di- and tribasic intermediate CSs, which consequently increased the number of As at the 3’ end of the loop. To this end, the T327K substitution (C1045A and U1046A) was introduced, resulting in an IEKR CS motif and an A-stretch length of six nucleotides. Additionally, a tri-basic cleavage site, shown to be indel-prone in H5, was created by changing U1039G, U1040A, C1045A and U1046A to generate H6REKR (Supplementary Fig. 7a). No indel was observed in any of the H6IEKR and H6REKR HASNDs that were tested (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c), even though a 7-nucleotide long A-stretch was present at the 3’end of the loop of H6IEKR Δ1048, H6REKR Δ1041 and Δ1048 HASNDs. This suggested that, in contrast to H5, a long A-stretch at the 3’ end of the loop might not be sufficient to facilitate indels in H6. Next, an additional G1041A substitution was introduced to create a tetrabasic CS (H6RKKR) (Fig. 3a), thereby increasing the length of the A-stretch to eight nucleotides. Indels were then observed in 13% (3/24) of the experiments (Fig. 3c).As indels were either absent or occurred at a low frequency when H6 HASNDs were tested, we mutated the CS sequence of H6IETR to resemble that of H5. In addition to a different consensus CS sequence at the amino acid level, PQRETR in H5 versus PQIETR in H6, the consensus codon use of the common amino acids differed between the two subtypes25. Therefore, three silent substitutions (A1034U, G1037A and U1046A) were first introduced in the A/ml/Sw/81/02 H6IETR to change the P, Q and T codons to those predominantly observed in H5s from viruses of the African-Eurasian-Oceanian lineage (H6H5_codon use) (Fig. 3a). No indel was detected in any of the H6H5_codon use HASNDs (Fig. 3d). Therefore, two additional non-silent substitutions (U1039G and U1040A) were introduced in H6H5_codon use, resulting in a loop sequence identical to that of H5RETR at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (H6H5_codon use_RETR). Again, no virus was detected in any of the experiments using H6H5_codon use_RETR HASNDs (Fig. 3e). Next, additional non-silent substitutions (G1041A and C1045A) were introduced to change the sequence of the H6H5_codon use_RETR loop to that of H5RKKR (H6H5_codon use_RKKR). Virus was detected in 39% (7/18) of experiments (Fig. 3f), a higher frequency than that observed for H6RKKR (13%). The indels that repaired the HA reading frame corresponded to pattern 2 and 3, which were also observed multiple times in H5. The CS sequence of the virus obtained using H6H5_codon use_RKKR HASND Δ1036 could not be reliably detected by Sanger sequencing and sequencing of a subset of TOPO clones revealed a mixed virus population, as observed for H5RKKR (Supplementary Table 1b). As a high indel frequency was observed in H5MBCS, the nucleotides that encode the A/Indo/5/05 H5 MBCS (AGA AGA AAA AAG; RRKK) were introduced into H6H5_codon use between T327-R328 (H6H5_codon use_MBCS) (Fig. 4a). Virus was detected in only 11% (4/36) of the experiments (Fig. 4b). Additional substitutions (U1039G, U1040A, A1043G, C1045G and A1046C) were introduced in H6H5_codon use_MBCS to change the loop sequence completely to that of H5MBCS (H6H5_codon use_MBCS_loop_seq) (Fig. 4a). This increased virus detection frequencies from 11 to 44% (20/45; Fig. 4c). Most of the indels observed in H6H5_codon use_MBCS and H6H5_codon use_MBCS_loop_seq HASNDs corresponded to the previously identified patterns 1 and 2, which were also observed frequently in H5MBCS.Fig. 4: Introducing H5 loop sequences in H6 increases indel detection.Results are shown as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Grey closed arrow heads refer to the introduced nucleotide substitutions as compared to H6IETR.

In (b, c), the red curved line indicates the location of the inserted MBCS.Full size imageUpon increasing the length of the A-stretch at the 3’ end of the loop and inserting an H5 MBCS into the H6 CS, indel frequencies remained low. In addition, indel frequency in H6 HASNDs containing the RKKR CS was higher in the presence of the H5 codon use substitutions (13 versus 39%). These HAs only differed by two substitutions, and we sought to investigate the impact of the substitution closest to the CS (G1037A) (Fig. 4a). Introducing G1037A into H6RKKR (H6RKKR_G1037A) HASNDs increased indel frequency from 13 to 61% (11/18; Fig. 4d), which was also higher than observed in the H6H5_codon use_RKKR HASNDs (39%). Of note, 1037A, although not present in the H6 LPAIV CS consensus, is found in 37.4% of H6 viruses25. Indels identified by Sanger sequencing in H6RKKR_G1073A HASNDs corresponded to indel pattern 2. Nevertheless, as previously observed for H5RKKR, H6RKKR and H6H5_codon use_RKKR, the CS sequence of most viruses could not be reliably determined by Sanger sequencing, and a mixed virus population was revealed upon sequencing of TOPO-clones (Supplementary Table 1b). The majority (75%; 33/44) of the sequences showed a frameshift in HA, partially due to the presence of the introduced SND (39%; 13/33). The in-frame insertions mostly led to an additional K in the CS, and a ten A insertion, creating a PQRKKKKKKG CS, was observed.No direct relationship between indel detection rate and particle production efficiency was observedIn order to investigate whether differences observed in indel frequency could be due to differences in particle production upon reverse genetics, plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) were measured. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were inoculated with 293 T supernatants derived from reverse genetics experiments with all HA plasmids used as templates to produce HASNDs, to the exception of those coding for HAs with silent substitutions. Virus titres of H5MBCS or H5RKKR viruses were higher than those of viruses with dibasic (H5RETR) and tribasic (H5REKR and H5RKTR) CSs, probably due to cleavage independent of trypsin allowing re-amplification in 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, the increased indel detection in H5MBCS and H5RKKR HASNDs could be partially due to a higher rescue efficiency and the opportunity for additional rounds of replication. On the other hand, virus titres of H5REKR and H5RKTR viruses were comparable to that of the H5RETR virus even though indels were detected more frequently in H5REKR and H5RKTR than in H5RETR HASNDs.In general, virus titres of H6 viruses were lower than those of H5 viruses. The number of particles produced upon rescue of H6H5_codon use_MBCS and H6H5_codon use_MBCS_loop_seq viruses was slightly lower than for the H5MBCS virus, perhaps due to lower cleavage efficiency resulting in lower re-amplification levels. Nevertheless, they were higher than those of the H5REKR and H5RKTR viruses, for which high indel frequencies were observed. Virus titres of H6RKKR, H6H5_codon use_RKKR and H6RKKR_G1037A viruses were similar or lower than that of the H6IETR virus, yet increased indel detection was observed in the formers. The lowest virus titre was observed for the H6REKR virus, and thus it cannot be excluded that the absence of indels in H6REKR was partially the result of low virus rescue efficiency. Taken together, these results show that no direct relationship between indel detection rate and virus titre was observed. However, it cannot be fully excluded that, for some HAs, indels were not observed because of low virus production and insufficient rounds of genome replication by the RdRp. Trans-complementation with a functional H5 protein increased indel detection in the H5 CS but not in that of H6As a low number of indels were detected using H5RETR HASNDs and no indel was detected with many H6 HASNDs, a trans-complementation experiment was performed to attempt to increase indel detection sensitivity. To this end, an H5RETR expression plasmid was co-transfected in 293T cells along with the eight reverse genetics plasmids. This will result in the expression of a functional HA protein, to ensure that infectious virus particles harbouring HASND genes are produced in 293T cells. An additional round of replication in MDCK cells can then take place, thus increasing the opportunity for indel generation by the RdRp. Addition of the H5RETR expression plasmid during transfection of the H5RETR HASNDs led to an increase in the number of indels that were detected (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Trans-complementation decreased the clonality of the rescued viruses, whose CS sequences could not be accurately determined using Sanger sequencing. Therefore, six TOPO-clones of HA PCR fragments amplified from MDCK supernatants with an HA titre of ≥8 hemagglutination units (HAU/25 µl) were sequenced. An HA-titre of 8 HAU/25 µl was chosen as it was the lowest titre which coincided with the observation of cytopathic effect in MDCK cells, suggesting virus replication rather than just efficient trans-complementation of deficient viruses with an HASND. TOPO-clones contained different sequences, indeed indicative of the presence of mixed virus populations (Supplementary Table 1b). In total, a positive HA titre of >8 HAU/25 µl was observed with 19/30 (63%) HASNDs, while this was only 13% (4/30) without trans-complementation. Frameshift was observed in 11% (13/119) of the clones, which was mostly due to the presence of the introduced SND. In some occasions, the WT sequence was detected, which could be due to H5RETR expression plasmid DNA detection, despite extensive DNAse treatment and negative -RT controls. In total, for seven samples, either only the SND, only the WT, or a combination of both WT and SND were detected in all 6 clones. For one sample, TOPO-cloning failed and thus no sequence was obtained. Other one-nucleotide insertions and deletions were also detected. Taken together, indel detection of H5RETR HASNDs increased upon trans-complementation. A similar approach was taken using all H6s in which no indel had been detected (H6IETR, H6IEKR, H6REKR, H6H5_codon use and H6H5_codon use_RETR HASNDs). An HA-titre of ≥8 HAU/25 µl was detected only in 5% (2/42) and 8% (1/12) of experiments with H6IETR and H6H5_codon use_RETR respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9b−f) and only the introduced SND was observed upon Sanger sequencing of the corresponding clones, probably due to very efficient trans-complementation. Taken together, these data show that trans-complementation increased indel detection in H5, but not in H6.DiscussionTo date, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying MBCS acquisition and the reason(s) why HPAIVs have only evolved from LPAIVs of the H5 and H7 subtypes remain unknown. As reproducing MBCS acquisition in viruses in a laboratory setting has been proven very difficult, we developed a novel sensitive, virus-based system to study the drivers of insertions at the HA CS. Using this system, indels were detected relatively frequently. We observed that A-stretches at both the 5’ and 3’ end of the loop were the main regions where indels occurred. In addition, four indel patterns were observed, present in 54% (121/226) of the indel-containing viruses. At the 3’ end of the loop, 77% (98/127) of indels were insertions, suggesting that insertions in this part of the loop are well tolerated at the RNA and protein levels. At the 5’ end of the loop, mostly one-nucleotide insertions (11/37) or two-nucleotide deletions (12/37) were observed, suggesting that larger insertions at this location might be detrimental at the RNA or protein level. Accordingly, reducing the length of the A-stretches in the H5MBCS loop resulted in an increased deletion to insertion ratio that occurred at the 5’ end of the loop. Of note, most of the insertions of more than one nucleotide contained one G (32/36) among six (24/36) or three (8/36) As. A-stretches interrupted by Gs might be more prone to duplication through backtracking and re-alignment than A-stretches interrupted by pyrimidines, as Us in the product can pair with both As or Gs in the template during realigning, as previously suggested by Perdue et al.18. A six-nucleotide direct repeat consisting of five As and one G has also been observed in previous studies, which either occurred in nature or after in ovo passaging11,18,39.Data from the present study show that nucleotide sequence is an important driver of indels. We observed that increasing the A content in H5RETR, even through only one nucleotide substitution, increased indel frequency. Of note, it remains unknown whether MBCSs are generated during cRNA and/or vRNA replication and therefore if A and/or U content is a driver of insertions. Our data are in accordance with that of previous studies20,22,24,26,34,36. It was observed in ovo, in vivo and in vitro that H5 viruses with an intermediate CS genotype and higher A content, i.e., REKR, RKTR or RKKR, acquired insertions at the CS more easily than viruses with the consensus RETR CS22,24,26,34,36. The importance of polypurine-rich regions in insertion acquisition at the H5 CS region has also been proposed by Perdue et al.18. Using our experimental system, a trend towards fewer indels was observed upon reducing the length of the A-stretch, even when interrupting it with Gs, suggesting that nucleotide nature (A,C,G,U) rather than base type (purine/pyrimidine) might be a determinant.This study revealed novel insights regarding the subtype-restriction of MBCS acquisition. Indel detection in H5 increased upon a single nucleotide substitution, when the H5 CS was changed from RETR to REKR or RKTR. In contrast, indels in H6 were only observed when five or more nucleotide substitutions were introduced in the H6 CS. Of note, our experimental system is not fully quantitative, and it cannot be completely excluded that differences in rescue efficiency might lead to small variations in indel detection sensitivity between H5 and H6. Data from the present study are in line with observations from an in-silico analysis that we recently conducted using a comprehensive dataset of all available LPAIV HA CS sequences from all 16 HA subtypes25. It was observed that fewer substitutions were required in H5 and H7 HA CS sequences to obtain an insertion-prone sequence, as defined by the presence of three basic amino acids or A-stretches, than in those from other subtypes, including H6. Collectively, these results point to the fact that several substitutions are necessary to generate indels in H6 as a potential limitation for MBCS acquisition in non-H5/H7 subtypes. In addition, while nucleotide sequences of intermediate CS used in this study, e.g., H5REKR and H5RKTR, have been detected in WT virus isolates at low frequencies, none of the H6 sequences in which indels were detected in the present study have been observed in natural isolates25. Some non-H5/H7 viruses with tribasic CSs have been isolated (e.g., H4N2 and H9N2)23,40,41,42,43, yet they remained trypsin-dependent in vitro40,41. The tribasic CS in an H4 virus was acquired by a substitution and insertion, and the tribasic CSs in H9 viruses were acquired by substitutions only. Previously, Zhang et al. showed that changing the H9N2 HA CS to a tri- or tetrabasic CS, thereby increasing the number of consecutive As, increased the detection of insertions as indirectly measured by luciferase activity in a minigenome assay23, corroborating that the nucleotide sequence of the CS is a key determinant of insertions. Nevertheless, indel detection in H6 was never as high as in H5 in our study, even when the full H5RKKR or H5MBCS sequence was introduced in H6. Although it cannot be fully ruled out that this could be partially due to a lower particle production in H6 compared to H5, this observation suggests that RNA regions outside of the CS and other factors than CS nucleotide sequence, e.g., RNA structures, might play a role in MBCS acquisition. Several conserved alternative configurations of putative RNA stem-loop structures that encompass CS codons in H5 and H7 HA sequences have been predicted using folding algorithms on naked protein-free RNA, supported by covariation and phylogenetic analyses19,21,44. Although it has been proposed that RNA folding in the CS region might drive MBCS acquisition11,18,22,23,24,45, strong empirical evidence is lacking. Reducing the loop size of these predicted RNA CS structures, yet retaining a large A-stretch of 12 or nine nucleotides in H5 or H9 HA CSs respectively, reduced indels as indirectly measured by a luciferase-based minigenome assay22,23. Kida et al. reported a reduced indel frequency when the length of the A-stretch and the size of the predicted loop were decreased simultaneously, precluding the discrimination between the impact of these two factors on indels24. Here, we refrained from investigating the role on MBCS acquisition of these putative RNA structures in MBCS acquisition. These structures are predicted in-silico on naked RNA and might reflect those present in quiescent vRNPs. Instead, it might be more relevant to analyse structures in the context of RNA replication by the influenza RdRp, as RNA structures are expected to be melted by the polymerase complex during replication and might also be altered in the presence of the nucleoprotein.One limitation of the presently used system is that only frame-restoring indels (insertion of 3n + 1 or deletion of 3n −1 nucleotides) resulting in a functional HA protein are detected. Consequently, the lack of detection of replication competent viruses does not necessarily mean that indels did not occur at all. Other indels not leading to reading frame repair or leading to sequences detrimental to HA structure, folding, expression or function might have occurred but would not be detected using this experimental approach. The development of very sensitive, controlled and reliable next-generation sequencing methods and analyses that allow for the accurate detection of all indels, especially in homopolymer regions, is crucial. Unfortunately, the most widely used next-generation sequencing methods are still unreliable when it comes to the detection of indels in homopolymer regions, which are error-prone for many replication enzymes46. Another potential limitation is that our experimental system, based on reverse genetics, relies on the human RNA polymerase I (Pol I) for initial transcription of viral genomic RNA from the transfected plasmids47. Therefore, it cannot be fully excluded that some of the observed indels might have occurred during plasmid transcription. The insertion and deletion rates of Pol I from yeast, estimated at 8.8 × 10−7 and 3.4 × 10−7 per base pair respectively, have been recently investigated using circular sequencing48. It was observed that the majority of insertions were one or two nucleotides in length and that, as expected, homonucleotide and dinucleotide tracts were hotspots for indels by the yeast RNA polymerase II, as it is the case for many replication enzymes. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that Pol I errors majorly contribute to the present data as: (i) indels differed in pattern and length including multiple insertions of four or more nucleotides (30%; 40/133), (ii) no indel was detected in many HASNDs, despite the presence of long homopolymers (notably in H6 HAs and in the homopolymer controls) and (iii) the addition of an MBCS, and thus an A-stretch, in H6 only marginally increased indels, while changing the 5’ end of the loop of H6H5_codon_use_MBCS_loop_seq to that of H5, without the addition of homopolymers, increased indels.We have here developed a novel and sensitive experimental setup to study drivers of MBCS acquisition and showed that nucleotide sequence is a key determinant driving insertions at the H5 CS. We have shown for the first time that insertions can be detected at the H6 CS when substitutions increasing the A/U content were introduced. This experimental approach could be further used to identify drivers of indels at the CS of HAs of viruses from other subtypes than H5 and H6. Moreover, the impact of nucleotide substitutions within the CS region could be investigated to identify the minimal number of nucleotide substitutions needed for non-H5 and -H7 viruses to acquire a MBCS. This information could then be used in surveillance programmes to flag LPAIV with potential to evolve to HPAIV.MethodsCellsMDCK cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in EMEM (Capricorn) supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES (Capricorn), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Capricorn), 100 µg/µl streptomycin (Capricorn), 2 mM glutamine (Capricorn), 1X non-essential amino acids (Capricorn) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Human epithelial 293T cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Capricorn) and supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 100 Iµ/ml penicillin, 100 µg/µl streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1X non-essential amino acids and 10% FCS. During basal cell culture 293T cells were maintained in the presence of 500 µg/ml geneticin (Gibco) and passaged when sub confluent.PlasmidsThe generation of reverse genetics plasmids (modified version of pHW2000) containing all gene segments of A/Indo/5/05 and the HA of A/ml/Sw/81/02 (accession number: MN515099.1) was described previously49,50. The A/Indo/5/05 virus was kindly provided by M. Peiris (Hongkong University). The MBCS of the A/Indo/5/05 HA was removed (H5RETR) as described50. The generation of reverse genetics plasmids coding for the HA and NA segments of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1), the HA and M segments of A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1), the HA segment of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) and the HA segment of A/Guangzhou/39715/2014 (H5N6) were described previously47,51,52,53. The HA gene segment of the H5 A/Indo/5/05 ΔMBCS (H5RETR) was cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector, which was kindly provided by Dr. A. Garcia-Sastre (Icahn School of Medicine, New York, U.S.A.).The plasmids containing the H5RETR, H5 A/Indo/5/05 (H5MBCS), and H6 A/ml/Sw/81/02 (H6IETR) HA were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis using PFU Ultra II (Agilent Technologies) as described previously54. All HA plasmids were confirmed to lead to the expression of functional HA proteins and viruses when used in reverse genetics experiments and were subsequently used as templates to introduce SNDs. Every nucleotide belonging to the H5 LPAIV CS (Q322-R326), H5 HPAIV CS (Q322-R330), H6 CS (Q340-R344) or H6H5_codon_use_MBCS CS (nucleotide 1036-1059) resulting in a unique sequence, were deleted in the HAs described in the main text. A subset of SNDs were introduced into the H5 HAs containing reduced A-stretch lengths. All introduced nucleotide substitutions are indicated in the figures by grey arrowheads and sequences of all the CSs used to introduce SNDs can be viewed in Supplementary Table 1a, c. The presence of the desired mutation in each plasmid preparation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using a 3130XL or 3500XL genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems). Respective H5 or H6 numberings, starting from the signal peptide, are used throughout the manuscript. Primer sequences are available upon request.Recombinant virus production and sequencingRecombinant viruses were produced essentially as described previously51. In brief, 293T cells were transfected with 5 µg of a reverse genetics plasmid coding for WT HA or HASNDs, together with 5 µg each of the remaining H5N1 A/Indo/5/05 reverse genetics plasmids (H5 virus backbone). Three days after transfection, undiluted 293T supernatant was used to inoculate MDCK cells and virus production was assessed after three days by hemagglutination assay with 1% turkey red blood cells. If virus was detected, RNA was extracted from 200 µl of the supernatant with the high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was produced by reverse transcription (RT) using Superscript IV (Invitrogen) and an influenza A virus specific primer (5’-AGCRAAAGCAGG) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The region in HA spanning the HA CS was amplified by CS PCR using PFU Ultra II and primers 5’-GGCGATAAACTCTAGTATGC-3’ and 5’-CGGATAGTTGTACGTTCCGT-3’ for H5, and 5’-GGTAACAAAAGCTTGCCCTT-3’ and 5’-ATTCGTGGTCGACAGCTTCG-3’ for H6. PCR products were visualised by gel electrophoresis and agarose bands containing DNA were extracted and purified using the MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Next, sequences of PCR products were obtained by Sanger sequencing using a 3130XL or 3500XL genetic analyser. If ambiguous sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing, thereby suggesting a mixed virus population, the purified HA band resulting from the H5- or H6-specific CS PCR was cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For each sample, 6 clones were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Samples were considered negative when the Sanger sequencing of all TOPO-clones revealed the presence of the introduced SND, except for the trans-complementation samples. Trans-complementation experimentsTrans-complementation assays were performed as described above with the additional co-transfection of 5 µg of a pCAGGS expression plasmid coding for the H5RETR along with the eight reverse genetics plasmids. In order to deplete plasmid DNA, the MDCK supernatant was passed through a 0.45 µm filter to remove cell debris and the isolated RNA was subjected to extensive DNAse treatment. First, the DNAse I treatment from the high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche) was extended to 30 min. Subsequently, 1 µl of DpnI was added to the extracted RNA followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C and DpnI inactivation for 20 min at 80 °C. Turbo DNAse treatment and bead inactivation (Invitrogen) were subsequently performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Next, cDNA and HA amplicons were produced as described above. A minus RT control, in which 3 µl of RNA was directly added to the PCR mix, was included in the subsequent HA PCR to confirm the complete removal of plasmid DNA.Plaque assaysPlaque assays were performed to determine the particle production efficiency upon reverse genetics in 293T cells with most H5 and H6 HAs that were used as templates for the introduction of SNDs. For the mutants containing reduced A-stretch lengths, only the constructs containing non-silent substitutions were tested. The plaque assay was essentially performed as described previously54. In brief, different dilutions of 293T supernatant were added to 6-well plates with confluent MDCK cells. After one hour of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed with PBS twice. Subsequently, 4 ml of a 1:1 dilution of Avicel RC-591 (IMCD) in 2x EMEM (Capricorn) with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone treated trypsin (Sigma) was added to the plates. Twenty-eight hours after inoculation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently fixed with 80% acetone. NP staining was performed as described previously54 and the number of plaques were counted using ImageQuant TL colony counting software version 8.2.0.0 (GE Healthcare, Life sciences).BiosafetyAll experiments with H5N1 and H6N1 viruses were performed under biosafety level 3 or 3+ conditions.RNA structure predictionsThe predicted conserved RNA structures in the H5 and H6 CS region were described previously19,21. RNA structures of the modified H5 and H6 CS stem-loop region and of HASNDs were predicted using the UNAFold Web Server (http://www.unafold.org/mfold/applicationsna-folding-form.php) with default settings. All RNA structure predictions are shown in the positive sense orientation and the indicated 5’ and 3’ ends of the loop are based on the positive sense orientation.

CKD weakens the immune system, making it harder to fight off infections like flu. Find out how to protect yourself from the flu. Flu vaccines A flu vaccine is the best protection against flu. Flu vaccination is especially important for people with CKD because they're at high risk of developing serious flu complications. Vaccination every year is recommended for the best possible protection against flu. Flu vaccines are updated each season to protect against the flu viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each year by the end of October. Immunity from vaccination sets in after about two weeks. Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of getting sick with flu or reduce the severity of illness if a person does get sick. Some studies show that vaccinated people have lower risk of having a serious flu outcome like requiring a stay in the hospital, or even being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Among people with CKD, flu vaccination has been associated with reduced hospitalizations. Flu vaccines for people with CKD Injectable influenza vaccines (flu shots) are recommended for everyone, but especially for people with CKD and other health conditions. The flu shot has a long, established safety record in people with CKD. The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as the nasal spray vaccine, is not recommended for people with some kinds of chronic health conditions. The nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for people with CKD. Other vaccines for people with CKD Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People with CKD should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination to protect against pneumococcal diseases. These include pneumonia, meningitis (swelling of the brain due to infection), and blood infections. You can get either pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (but not both). Talk to your doctor to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Talk with your doctor to make sure you're up to date on all your vaccines, including the hepatitis B vaccine. Planning strategies In addition to getting a flu shot, people with CKD should take everyday preventive actions. This includes avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. Prepare in case you get sick People with chronic conditions like CKD should maintain a two-week supply of all regular medications during flu season. Talk to your doctor before stopping or adjusting any regular medications, especially if you become sick. Flu symptoms If you have flu symptoms, call your doctor right away. Antiviral drugs can treat flu illness and may prevent serious flu complications. CDC recommends flu treatment as soon as possible for people with the flu. It also recommends treatment for people with flu infection and who have a high risk of serious flu complications. This includes people with CKD. Flu symptoms can include: Fever Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Body aches Headache Chills Fatigue Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever. Flu treatment Treatment should begin as soon as possible. This is because antiviral drug treatment works best when started early (within 48 hours after symptoms start). Antiviral drugs require a prescription from a doctor. They may also prevent serious health problems that can result from flu illness. When to seek emergency care Anyone experiencing any of the following emergency warning signs of flu sickness, including people with CKD, should seek medical attention right away. Symptoms in adults: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening of chronic medical conditions Symptoms in children: Fast breathing or trouble breathing Bluish lips or face Ribs pulling in with each breath Chest pain Severe muscle pain (child refuses to walk) Dehydration (no urine for 8 hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying) Not alert or interacting when awake Seizures Fever above 104°F In children less than 12 weeks, any fever Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening of chronic medical conditions On This Page Flu vaccines Other vaccines for people with CKD Planning strategies When to seek emergency care May 14, 2024 Sources Print Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Syndicate Content Source: National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) Chronic Kidney Disease The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Initiative provides public health strategies for promoting kidney health.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between influenza pandemics and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, it has been shown that there is a decrease in cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patients following vaccination with the influenza vaccine. Here, we have investigated the role of anti-viral STAT1 signaling in influenza-induced myocarditis. Wild-type mice (C57BL/6) were infected with either influenza A/PR/8/34 or control, and cellular response and gene expression analysis from the heart samples were assessed 7 days later. The expression of interferon response genes STAT1, STAT2, Mx1, OASL2, ISG15, chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9 and CXCL10, and the frequency of neutrophils (CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+) and CD4+ T cells (CD45+CD4+) were all significantly increased in influenza-infected mice when compared to vehicle controls. These data suggest that influenza infection induces interferons, inflammatory chemokines, and cellular recruitment during influenza infection. We further investigated the role of STAT1 in influenza-induced myocarditis. The frequency of neutrophils and the levels of lipocalin 2 were significantly increased in STAT1−/− mice when compared to WT controls. Finally, we investigated the role of Lcn2 in viral-induced myocarditis. We found that in the absence of Lcn2, there was preserved cardiac function in Lcn2−/− mice when compared to WT controls. These data suggest that the absence of Lcn2 is cardioprotective during viral-induced myocarditis.

It is estimated that 3–4 million cases of severe illness and 300,000 deaths due to influenza infection occur annually. Pandemic outbreaks of highly virulent strains of influenza can have a major impact on healthcare settings. During influenza pandemics, lung disease, the most common cause of death, is a primary focus. However, epidemiological studies have indicated that influenza seasons positively correlate with increased numbers of hospitalizations and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases1,2,3,4. Further, studies have shown that influenza vaccination significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality5,6,7. In the 2009 pandemic, it has been estimated that influenza A/pH1N1 caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and 83,300 cardiovascular deaths8. Clinical reports show that acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy in adults, and fulminant myocarditis in children occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic9,10,11. Several cases of influenza-associated myocarditis showed elevation in cardiac injury markers and abnormal ECG findings12,13. However, the pathogenic mechanism involved in influenza-induced myocarditis is not clear.During viral infection, the innate and adaptive immune systems activate a variety of immune signaling pathways that induce type I (IFNα/β), type II (IFNγ), and type III (IFNλ) interferons (IFNs), and a variety of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines14,15,16,17. IFNs inhibit viral replication by inducing interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX dynamin-like GTPase1 (Mx1) and 2ʹ-5ʹ-Oligoadenylate synthase-like protein (OASL2), through Janus kinase (JNK)-dependent phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat218. IFNs and inflammatory mediators recruit monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages to the lungs for viral control. However, the excessive influx of innate immune cells and the dysregulated production of inflammatory cytokines result in host-mediated pathological responses during viral infection14,17,19,20,21.In the heart, viral infection-associated disease can occur by either direct viral entry or due to the systemic inflammatory response initiated in the lung. Studies have shown that influenza virus infection induces host cell proteases, such as trypsin and matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) in various organs, which may cause increased vascular permeability and disease propagation in the myocardium22,23. Further, a recent study has shown influenza viral replication in cardiomyocytes and Purkinje cells in mice24.Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) or Lcn2 is a secreted 25 kDa protein. Studies have shown that Lcn2 plays a role in iron trafficking and has chemotactic and bacteriostatic properties25,26,27. It has also been used as a biomarker for acute kidney injury because of its release due to tubular damage. Recently, it has been shown that Lcn2 is induced in coronary heart diseases, heart failure, and myocarditis and plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)28,29.In this study, we established the murine model of immune responses to influenza infection in the heart. Influenza infection increased the expression of interferon response genes as well as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increased frequency of neutrophils. Further, we analyzed the role of Stat1 in the heart during influenza infection. We found an increased frequency of neutrophils and increased expression of Lcn2 in the heart in Stat1−/− mice when compared to WT mice. These findings establish a potential mechanism by which interferon signaling through Stat1 suppresses the inflammatory immune response in the heart during influenza infection.ResultsInfluenza infection increases the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), proinflammatory chemokines, and the frequency of neutrophils in the heartDuring early infection, the influenza virus induces the expression of type I and type III interferons, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while also inducing cellular recruitment in the lung for viral control. Studies have shown an increased incidence rate of cardiovascular events during influenza season. However, the pathogenesis due to influenza-induced myocarditis is not clear. To determine the effect of influenza in the heart, we infected C57BL/6 mice with influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1 or a PBS control and measured the interferon response genes STAT1, STAT2, Mx1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1), OASL2 (2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like), ISG15 (Interferon stimulated gene-15), and CXCL9 on day 7 after influenza viral treatment. We observed increased expression of all these genes in the influenza-infected mice when compared to PBS-treated controls (Fig. 1A–F). These data suggest that influenza infection induces interferon responses in the heart.Figure 1Influenza infection increases the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), proinflammatory chemokines, and the frequency of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the heart. C57BL/6 mice were treated with PBS or 103 PFU of influenza A PR/8/34 on day 0, left for 7 days, and sacrificed on day 7. Relative expressions of STAT1, STAT2, Mx1, OASL2, ISG15, and CXCL9 in the hearts were measured by RT-PCR (n = 4–6) (A–F). Stat1, Stat2, Mx1, Oasl2, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were analyzed from PR8, pH1N1, and H3N2 strains of influenza from the heart (n = 5–7) (G) and the lungs (n = 5–7) (H). A plaque assay was carried out from heart sample homogenates (n = 4–6) (I). The percentage of CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+ cells in the heart was measured by flow cytometry (n = 5) (J). Representative flow cytometry plots were shown (K). The percentage of CD45+CD4+T cells, CD45+CD8+T cells, and CD45+CD11b+F4/80+Ly6C+ cells in the heart were measured by flow cytometry (n = 5) (L–N). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested by unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns not significant. Each experiment was independently performed two or more times, and the representative data is shown.Full size imageNext, we analyzed the expression of interferon response genes Stat1, Stat2, Mx1, Oasl2, and proinflammatory immune response genes CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10 from influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1, pandemic H1N1, and seasonal H3N2, strains of influenza viruses in the heart and compared them with lung responses. We observed increased expression of Stat1, Stat2, Mx1, Oasl2, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in influenza-infected hearts and lungs when compared to PBS-treated controls (Fig. 1G,H). The relative fold inductions were approximately tenfold in the heart when compared to expression levels in the 100-fold range in the lungs. These data suggest that the influenza virus infects the heart and induces interferon responses regardless of influenza strains.Next, to determine if the virus translocated to the heart, we homogenized the hearts from mice on days 4, 7, and 14 following influenza infection. We found measurable viral titers on day 4 and day 7 after influenza infection (Fig. 1I). However, we found no viral titer in the hearts on day 14 following influenza infection (Fig. 1I). These data suggest that the influenza virus directly infects the heart when infected via a pulmonary route.Next, we analyzed the cellular responses in mice treated with influenza and found that there was a higher frequency of CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils and CD45+ CD4+ T cells present in the hearts of influenza-infected mice when compared to the PBS controls (Fig. 1J–L). However, we found no significant differences in the frequency of CD45+ CD8+ T cells between influenza-infected mice and PBS controls (Fig. 1M). Next, we analyzed the frequency of CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+ Ly6C+ cells or inflammatory monocytes and found that the frequency was trending to increase in influenza-infected hearts when compared to PBS control hearts (Fig. 1N). These data suggest that the virus infiltrated and managed to infect the heart and induce an inflammatory immune response.Next, we wanted to see whether the influenza virus infects cardiomyocytes directly and induces interferon response genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We isolated cardiomyocytes from WT mice and placed them in media for 24 h. The cells were treated with PBS or influenza virus (MOI = 1) for 24 h. The cells were analyzed for interferon response genes and proinflammatory immune response. We found increased expression of influenza M protein, Stat1, Oasl2, and CCL2 in influenza-infected mice when compared to PBS-treated controls (Fig. 2A–D). These data suggest that the heart does signal for chemotaxis to the site of infection which could produce an inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, the increased expression of Stat1 and OASL2 suggests that the cardiomyocytes enter an antiviral state in the presence of the influenza virus, further demonstrating the ability of the virus to infect the cells and induce IFN responses in the heart.Figure 2Influenza infection increases the expression of interferon response genes and proinflammatory chemokines in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 mice, and treated with influenza (1 MOI), and expression of Influenza M protein, Stat1, Oasl2, and CCL2 were analyzed by RT-PCR (n = 3). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested by unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns not significant. Each experiment was independently performed two or more times, and the representative data is shown.Full size imageInfluenza infection decreases left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) following influenza infectionNext, we determined whether the influenza-induced inflammatory immune response has an impact on heart function via in-vivo cardiac imaging by MRI. Mice were treated with PBS or influenza and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), circumferential, and longitudinal peak strains were measured on day 7 following influenza infection. We found that the LVEF was significantly decreased in influenza-treated mice when compared to the PBS controls (Fig. 3A). The LVEF values decreased from 66 to 42% which is indicative of mild myocarditis. Next, we found the circumferential peak strain was worse (− 20 to − 13) in influenza-infected mice when compared to PBS controls (Fig. 3B–D). The longitudinal peak strain was significantly impaired (− 16 to − 11) in influenza-infected mice when compared to PBS controls (Fig. 3C,D). These data suggest that heart function was compromised during pulmonary influenza infection.Figure 3Influenza infection impairs heart functions during influenza-induced myocarditis. C57BL/6 mice were treated with PBS or 103 PFU of influenza A PR/8/34 on day 0, left for 7 days, and sacrificed on day 7. The percentage of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) (n = 4) (A), percentage of circumferential peak strain (n = 4) (B), and percentage of longitudinal peak strain (n = 4) (C) were analyzed from micro-MRI live imaging from C57BL/6 mice treated with PBS or influenza. The representative images are shown (D). The top row shows circumferential strain overlayed on the short-axis mid-slice cardiac cycle. The bottom row shows longitudinal strain overlayed on the long axis 4 chamber cardiac cycle. The blue line represents the long axis extent that runs from the aorta to the apex of the heart to calculate the LV function parameters (D). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested by unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns not significant. Each experiment was independently performed two or more times, and the representative data is shown.Full size imageSTAT1 regulates neutrophil infiltration in the heart during influenza infectionStudies have shown that STAT1 is crucial in the type I, II, and III IFN signaling pathways. After discovering STAT1 is highly expressed in the hearts of influenza-infected mice, we decided to investigate the role of STAT1 in the pathogenesis of myocarditis. First, we analyzed the response of ISGs to the elimination of STAT1 expression using STAT1−/− mice. We infected both C57BL/6 and STAT1−/− mice with influenza or PBS control and then measured the relative expression of Mx1 and the chemokine CXCL10. As expected, the expressions of Mx1 and CXCL10 were decreased in STAT1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). These data suggest that Stat1 is crucial in the induction of ISGs in the heart during influenza infection.Next, we determined whether Stat1 controls the viral burden. We measured the viral burden and found that the viral burden was significantly increased in Stat1−/− mice when compared to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data suggest that Stat1 controls the viral burden in the heart.Our previous studies suggested that STAT1 regulates Th17 responses during influenza infection30. Therefore, we measured the expression of IL-17 and IL-22 responses from the heart samples from WT and Stat−/− mice. We found no differences in the expressions of IL-17RA, IL-17F, IL-22RA1, and IL-22RA2 and the levels of IL-17A in the heart samples from WT and Stat1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A–E). These data suggest that Stat1 does not regulate the IL-17 responses in influenza-induced myocarditis.Lipocalin 2 is an antimicrobial peptide produced in response to inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-17. Our studies have shown that IL-17 and TNFα synergistically induce Lcn231. Therefore, we determined whether STAT1 affects Lcn2 expression in influenza-induced myocarditis. We found the Lcn2 expression was significantly increased in the hearts from Stat1−/− when compared to WT mice during influenza infection (Fig. 4A). We further measured the Lcn2 protein levels and found the levels were increased in the hearts of influenza-infected Stat1−/− mice when compared to influenza-infected WT mice (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that STAT1 plays a role in regulating the expression of Lcn2 in influenza-induced myocarditis.Figure 4The elimination of STAT1 expression suppresses the neutrophils. WT or STAT1−/− mice were treated with PBS or 103 PFU of influenza A PR/8/34 on day 0, left for 7 days, and sacrificed on day 7. Relative expression of Lcn2 was carried out from WT and Stat−/− mice (n = 4–9) (A). The Lcn2 protein levels were measured from WT and Stat1−/− mice (n = 4–6) (B). The percentage of CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+ cells in the hearts of STAT1−/− mice was measured via flow cytometry (n = 3–5) (C). Representative flow cytometry plots are shown (D). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested by unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns not significant. Each experiment was independently performed two or more times, and the representative data is shown.Full size imageFollowing influenza infection, the innate immune response induces pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil recruitment. The neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 increase recruitment to promote viral control. Previously we have shown that the STAT1 antigen-presenting cells were biased towards Th17 response. Th17 response is known to drive neutrophilic immune responses, therefore, we measured whether Stat1 has any effect on neutrophilic responses. We found that there was a significantly higher frequency of CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils present in the hearts of STAT1−/− mice infected with influenza compared to the WT control mice (Fig. 4C,D). These data suggest that Stat1 suppresses the neutrophilic infiltration in influenza-induced myocarditis.Next, we conducted an MRI scan measuring the LVEF, circumferential, and longitudinal strain from WT and Stat1−/− mice infected with influenza. We found no significant differences between WT and STAT1−/− in LVEF, circumferential and longitudinal strains (Supplementary Fig. 4A–D). These data suggest that despite Stat1 regulation of neutrophilic infiltration it does not impact the heart function during pulmonary influenza infection.Suppression of Lcn2 expression improves outcomes during influenza infectionStudies have shown that Lcn2 plays a role in iron trafficking and has chemotactic and bacteriostatic properties25,26,27. It has also been used as a biomarker for acute kidney injury because of its release due to tubular damage. Recently, it has been shown that Lcn2 is induced in coronary heart diseases, heart failure, and myocarditis and plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)25,29. We also found that Stat1−/− showed increased expression of Lcn2 when compared to WT mice (Fig. 4A,B). However, it is not clear that the influenza infection itself induces Lcn2 in the heart. To answer that we analyzed the expression of Lcn2 in WT mice at different time points either infected with PBS or influenza. We found that influenza infection induces the levels of Lcn2 in the heart on day 3 (early) and day 7 (peak) of influenza infection (Supplementary Fig. 5). We also found the levels returned to basal level on day 14 (recovery phase) of influenza infection (Supplementary Fig. 5). These data suggest that the presence of the virus induces Lcn2 during the early and peak phases of influenza infection.Next, we analyzed whether the Lcn2 influences the frequency of neutrophils in the heart during influenza infection. We found that there was no significant difference in CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils present in the hearts between WT or Lcn2−/− mice infected with influenza (Supplementary Fig. 6A,B). These data suggest that the Lcn2 induction was not directly correlated with the frequency of neutrophils.Next, we conducted an MRI scan to determine whether the Lcn2 affects heart functions. We found that Lcn2−/− mice infected with influenza had an increased LVEF compared to WT mice infected with influenza (Fig. 5A). The LVEF of the Lcn2−/− mice was almost on par with WT mice treated with PBS from our initial MRI study. The circumferential peak strain and longitudinal peak strain were not different between WT and Lcn2−/− mice (Fig. 5B–D). These data suggest that Lcn2 has a pathogenic role in inflammatory damage to the heart, resulting in decreased function. In the absence of Lcn2 heart function improves in Lcn2−/− mice when compared to WT mice.Figure 5The elimination of Lcn2 expression improves heart functions during influenza infection. WT and Lcn2−/− mice were treated with PBS or 103 PFU of influenza A PR/8/34 on day 0 and left for 7 days. The percentage of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) (n = 4) (A), percentage of circumferential peak strain (n = 4) (B), and percentage of longitudinal peak strain (n = 4) (C) were analyzed from micro-MRI live imaging from C57BL/6 mice treated with PBS or influenza. MRI images of LVEF, and circumferential and longitudinal peak strains of the heart samples from WT and Lcn2−/− mice infected with influenza (D). The top row shows circumferential strain overlayed on the short-axis mid-slice cardiac cycle. The bottom row shows longitudinal strain overlayed on the long axis 4 chamber cardiac cycle. The blue line represents the long axis extent that runs from the aorta to the apex of the heart to calculate the LV function parameters (D). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested by unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ns not significant. Each experiment was independently performed two or more times, and the representative data is shown.Full size imageOverall, our data suggest that influenza infection increases neutrophil and lymphocytic recruitment in the heart and affects the LVEF during influenza-induced myocarditis. Further, our data suggest that STAT1 suppresses neutrophilic infiltration and the induction of Lcn2 in the heart, and Lcn2 affects the LVEF in influenza-induced myocarditis.DiscussionDuring influenza infection, type I, type II, and type III interferons (IFNs) and their downstream signaling events are crucial for the control of viral infection15,16,32,33. These IFNs and inflammatory mediators recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the lungs to help control the viral infection. The direct antiviral effect is mediated through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes. In our study, we found increased expression of Stat1, Stat2, Mx1, Oasl2, and ISG15 in the heart during pulmonary influenza infection. These data suggest that the influenza infection induces interferon responses in the heart.Viral infection induces a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL1034,35. These cytokines and chemokines recruit innate immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and NK cells to control the virus35,36. In our study, we found increased expression of CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in the heart following PR8, pH1N1, or H3N2 strains of influenza infection. These data suggest that the influenza infection in the heart induces these chemokines to recruit the innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages to control the virus. In our study, we found increased neutrophils and CD4+ T cells in the heart in response to influenza infection suggesting that there is cellular recruitment to control the virus. Similarly, previous studies have shown the presence of cardiomyocyte degeneration, and macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration into the heart during influenza infection37.In our study, we found the virus in the heart on days 4 and 7 post-influenza infection. These data suggest that the virus infects the heart directly.We next found a decreased LVEF and increased longitudinal peak strain in influenza-infected mice when compared to PBS-treated mice. Previous studies have shown that both the systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle were impaired in response to influenza infection37. Our study further shows an increase in the longitudinal peak strain in response to influenza infection. These data suggest that normal heart function is compromised due to influenza infection.Our previous studies suggested that STAT1 regulates Th17 response during influenza infection30. In our study, we found no differences in the expression of IL-17F, IL-17RA, IL-22RA1, and IL-22RA2 and the levels of IL-17A in the heart in between WT and Stat1−/− mice. However, we found increased levels of Lcn2 in Stat1−/− mice hearts when compared to WT controls. Studies also have shown that IL-17 induces Lcn231,38. These data suggest that Stat1 plays a role in regulating the expression of Lcn2 independent of Th17 responses. IL-17 is known to drive the induction of neutrophil-attracting chemokines such as CXCL1 and GCSF to mediate granulopoiesis and neutrophil recruitment to the mucosal sites39. In our study, we found increased neutrophils in Stat1−/− mice suggesting that Stat1 regulates neutrophilic infiltration into the heart. This may be because of IL-17 in the circulation or lung thereby increasing neutrophils in the heart.As previously mentioned Lcn2 is shown to be induced in coronary heart diseases, heart failure, and myocarditis and plays a role in the pathophysiology of CVD25,29. In our study, we found that LVEF is preserved in the absence of Lcn2 suggesting that Lcn2 plays a crucial role in the pathology of influenza-induced myocarditis. However, no significant differences were observed in circumferential and longitudinal peak strain between WT and Lcn2−/− mice suggesting that there is a possible mild protective effect in the absence of Lcn2 in the heart during the influenza infection. In that case, an Lcn2 inhibitor is likely to be useful therapeutically to overcome the pathological effects caused by influenza-induced myocarditis. Previously studies have shown that Lcn2 is responsible for increasing iron accumulation within cardiomyocytes of a failing myocardium leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis40. Our data suggest that in the absence of Lcn2 expression, there is likely decreased iron accumulation within the influenza-infected cardiomyocytes resulting in decreased apoptosis and preserved LVEF. Conversely, in our data showing an increase in Lcn2 expression in the absence of Stat1 expression, there is a possible increase in iron accumulation within the virally infected cardiomyocytes which subsequently increases apoptosis of the virally infected cardiomyocytes. Overall, our data suggest that Stat1 suppresses the neutrophilic infiltration and the induction of Lcn2 thereby suppressing the Lcn2-mediated pathological effects during influenza-induced myocarditis.Materials and methodsMiceWT C57BL/6 (6–8-week-old) and Lcn2−/− mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Stat1−/− mice were obtained from Dr. Christian Schindler (Columbia University) and Dr. David Levy (New York University). Lcn2−/− mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Stat1−/− and Lcn2−/− mice in C57BL/6 background were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. In vivo studies were performed on age-matched adult male or female mice. All experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh IACUC (Protocol number 23063262). All the authors complied with the IACUC guidelines, and the study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.Influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1 infectionInfluenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus was propagated by using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS (Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN). The cells were washed with PBS, and infected 0.001 MOI of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) in DMEM with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), and 2 μg/ml of l-tosylamido-2-phenyl ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (Sigma–Aldrich, MO). The virus-containing supernatant was harvested after 72 h, and the viral titer was determined by standard plaque assay.Mice were infected with 1000 pfu of Influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1 via an oropharyngeal route of administration. Mice were incubated for 7 days, and the lungs and the heart were harvested. Viral burden from the lungs and the heart was determined by plaque assay. The gene expression levels of influenza M protein were analyzed by using the following primers. Forward: 5′-GGACTGCAGCGTAGACGCTT-3′, Reverse: 5′-CATCCTGTTGTATATGAGGCCCAT-3′, Probe: 5′-/56-FAM/CTCAG TTAT/ZEN/TCTGCTGGTGCACTTGCCA/3IABkFQ/-3′.Quantitative real-time PCRRNA was isolated by using the TRIzol reagent and its associated method as per the manufacturer’s directions (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). The isolated RNA was quantified and converted into cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Gene expression levels were measured by RT-PCR using Assay-on-demand Taqman primers and probes from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).Flow cytometryMouse hearts were perfused with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS through the right and left ventricles and collected in RPMI media. Then the hearts were chopped into small pieces (~ 2 mm) and digested using 10 U of DNAse and 300 U collagenase II (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in RPMI media for 1 h in a 37 °C shaking incubator. After one hour the tissues were passed through a 70 μM filter to isolate single cells. The RBC was lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The single cells were stained with CD45 (30-F11, leukocyte common antigen), CD11b (M1/70, monocytes), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5, neutrophils) antibodies, and the data were analyzed using Flow jo analysis software.In-vivo cardiac MRIAnesthesia induction was achieved by using isoflurane liquid (Piramal Pharma Ltd) for inhalation, which is vaporized using a SurgiVet Isotec (VetEquip) vaporizer. The percentage of isoflurane to oxygen is 4% to initially anesthetize the mouse inside an induction chamber. The depth of anesthesia was monitored by toe reflex, extension of limbs, and spine positioning. Once the plane of anesthesia was established, the mouse was placed on a designated animal bed for imaging and the anesthesia was maintained by 1.0 to 1.5% isoflurane with 100% oxygen via a nose cone. The body temperature was monitored by an optical rectal temperature probe which is used for feedback control of a warm air blower around the animal to maintain the core temperature 37 °C ± 0.5 °C. Respiration was continuously monitored by placing a small pneumatic pillow under the animal’s diaphragm which was connected to a magnet-comparable pressure transducer feeding to a physiological monitoring computer equipped with respiration-waveform measuring software (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). The respiration waveform was automatically processed to detect the inspiration, expiration, and respiration rates. In-vivo cardiac MRI (CMR) was carried out on a Bruker Biospec 7T/30 system (Bruker Biospin MRI, Billerica, MA) with the 35 mm quadrature coil for both transmission and reception. Free-breathing-no-gating cine MRI with retrospective navigators was acquired with the Bruker Intragate module. Multi-planar cine movies covering the entire heart volumes with 20 cardiac phases were acquired for short-axis and long-axis 4-chamber views with the following parameters: Field of view (FOV) = 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm, slice thickness = 1 mm for long-axis views and 1.2 mm for short-axis views, inter-slice gap = 0, acquisition matrix = 256 × 256, in-plane resolution = 98 μm, flip angle (FA) = 10 degrees, echo time (TE) = 3.059 ms, repetition time (TR) = 5.653 ms, number of repetition = 300, total scan time = 3 min 39 s. Systolic functions and strains were analyzed with the FDA-approved Circles Cvi42 software. The left ventricular endocardium and epicardium boundaries of each imaging slice at the end-systole (ES) and the diastole (ED) were defined by a blinded operator.Measurement of Lipocalin 2 proteinHearts were homogenized using 1 ml PBS, and the supernatants were collected and stored in a − 80 °C freezer. Lipocalin protein was analyzed using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Cardiomyocyte isolation from adult mouse heartsPrimary adult mouse cardiomyocytes were isolated from WT mice as described before41. The myocardium was perfused with EDTA and perfusion buffers to remove blood and subsequently digested using a collagenase buffer containing collagenases II and IV, and protease XIV (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were filtered using 100 μM filters and plated at roughly 25,000 cells per well. The cell culture plates were coated with 5 μg/ml mouse laminin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and left to incubate in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for one hour, after which they were washed with PBS. Cardiomyocytes were cultured with M199 media supplemented with 10 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), 100 units/ml penicillin with 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) supplement, and a chemically defined (CD) lipid supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were treated with this media and or influenza, for 24 h, and collected for gene expression analysis.Statistical analysisAll the data are presented as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested by students t-test or a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s posthoc test. All the statistical analyses were performed by GraphPad Prism software.

Though the virus hasn't been detected in beef cattle, some dairy cattle are used in the production of ground beef. Earlier this month, PCR testing by USDA scientists on retail ground beef samples found no traces of H5N1.Researchers inoculated the ground beef patties with high levels of an H5N1 surrogate virus, then cooked them to different internal temperatures. Deeble said no virus was found when the beef was cooked to 145°F internal temperature (medium) or 160°F (well done).When the virus-laden beef patties were cooked to 120°F degrees (rare), however, the tests found evidence of the virus, but at much reduced levels, he said. Deeble said there are no recommended changes in safe cooking practices and that the longstanding USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) advice is to cook beef patties to an internal temperature of 160°F. In other food safety tests, USDA scientists are testing whole-muscle cuts for any evidence of H5N1, and he said results are expected next week.Boost for animal disease responseRegarding the funding boost for NAHLN labs, there are no concerns about testing capacity, but the infusion will build on existing capacity and add more resources, Deeble said. Some labs need updated equipment, and some of the funding will target research projects within the labs that are aimed at expanding testing methods.Of the more than $22.2 million announced today to boost animal disease efforts, $16.2 million will target 74 projects to advance animal disease preparedness, such as helping states develop plans and practice quickly controlling animal disease outbreaks. In addition, $1 million is earmarked for emergency preparedness, and $5 million will go directly to labs for capacity building. Outbreak trajectory uncertainUSDA officials today said they wouldn't speculate on the current trajectory of the outbreaks or if activity has peaked. Deeble said, however, that the lack of recent spread beyond the nine currently affected states may be partly due to the federal rule that requires testing for dairy cows before movement between states.Meanwhile, Nirav Shah, JD, MD, principal deputy director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters that although current findings from the CDC's new influenza A wastewater dashboard are reassuring, the investigation is ongoing. "There's a lot more to be done." The dashboard, unveiled 2 days ago on the CDC's H5N1 surveillance page, found that, over the past 2 weeks, there were only 3 sites in the high category among 230 that met data reporting criteria. The sites are in Kansas, Florida, and Illinois. Little success testing farm workersRegarding epidemiologic and scientific investigations, federal officials last week announced—as part of new support for farms and the outbreak response—a $75 financial incentive for farm workers at affected dairy farms to be tested. Shah said so far the CDC hasn't identified any workers who are willing to participate.He added that the CDC is eager to conduct testing to answer key questions, such as which farm jobs pose the highest risk to workers. There are no plans to add a testing requirement, Shah said. "We would like to do this in voluntary cooperation with farms and farm workers."Federal officials said they were aware of anecdotal reports that some proponents of drinking raw milk are claiming that drinking H5N1-contaminated milk will boost immunity against the virus. Deeble said the USDA is not aware of any raw milk sold from any of the known outbreak farms. He added that the only way to protect against H5N1 infection from milk is to avoid drinking raw milk.Even before the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows was first detected in late March, federal health agencies have had a longstanding recommendation against drinking raw milk because of potential contamination with pathogens.

In 2022, it caused an outbreak in farmed mink. Researchers at Penn State have found that this strain in mink is capable of inefficient airborne transmission in ferrets. Credit: Opla/Getty Images. All Rights Reserved.ExpandMay 16, 2024By Sara LaJeunesseUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was detected in dairy cattle for the first time in the United States in March, with nine states reporting outbreaks by May. While the method of transmission among cattle is currently unknown, new research published May 15 in Nature Communications demonstrates that a related strain of H5N1, subtype clade 2.3.4.4b, which caused an outbreak in farmed mink in 2022, could transmit through the air to a limited number of ferrets. This is the first time that a member of the group of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses has been shown to exhibit this ability. According to the Penn State researchers who led the study, the findings suggest these viruses are evolving to infect mammals and with potentially increased risk to humans. “While there is no evidence that the strain of H5N1 that is presently affecting dairy cattle is capable of airborne transmission, our study suggests that another member of this family of viruses has evolved some degree of airborne transmissibility,” said Troy Sutton, associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences, Penn State, and corresponding author on the paper. “This finding underscores the importance of continued surveillance to monitor the evolution of these viruses and their spillover into other mammals, including humans.” According to the researchers, assessing a virus’s potential for airborne transmission in mammals could inform the understanding of its potential risk to humans. Since virus samples could not be readily obtained after the outbreak in mink had been controlled, the team reconstructed the virus using publicly available genetic sequences. Next, the researchers evaluated the ability of the virus to transmit in ferrets, which have respiratory tracts that are more similar to humans in their susceptibility to viral infection and transmission than other model organisms, such as mice. The team measured both direct transmission of the virus by placing infected ferrets in cages with uninfected ferrets and indirect airborne transmission by placing infected and uninfected ferrets in cages that enabled shared airspace but prevented physical contact. To assess disease severity, the team examined the ferrets’ weight loss and signs of clinical illness. The researchers found that the virus transmitted by direct contact to 75% of exposed ferrets and by respiratory droplets to 37.5% of exposed ferrets after about nine days of exposure. The team also found that the virus had a low infectious dose, meaning that even small amounts of virus caused an infection. Sutton noted that the mink strain of the virus contained a mutation, called PB2 T271A. To test the influence of this mutation on viral transmission and disease severity, the team engineered the virus without the mutation and found that mortality and airborne transmission in the ferrets infected with this version of the virus was reduced. “These findings suggest that the PB2 T271A mutation is enhancing viral replication of the virus, contributing to both virulence and transmission in ferrets,” Sutton said. “Understanding the role that this mutation plays means we can monitor for it or for similar mutations to arise in the currently circulating strains of H5N1.” Sutton added that the ferrets that the team used in its studies had no preexisting immunity to influenza, whereas the majority of humans have been exposed to H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses. “This exposure would likely offer some degree of cross-protection against H5N1 if humans are exposed to another H5N1 variant,” he said. Furthermore, he said that the transmission rate the team observed in the mink virus is lower than is typical for pandemic influenza viruses. “Pandemic influenza viruses typically transmit via the airborne route to 75% to 100% of contacts within three to five days, whereas the mink virus we studied transmitted to fewer than 40% of contacts after nine days,” Sutton said. “The transmission observed in our studies is indicative of increased pandemic potential relative to previously characterized strains of H5N1; however, the mink virus does not exhibit the same attributes as pandemic strains. The H5N1 strain affecting cattle also has not caused severe disease in cattle or humans, but the longer the virus circulates, and the more exposure humans have to it, the greater the chances that it will evolve to infect humans.” This research was conducted in Penn State’s Eva J. Pell Advanced Biological Laboratory, a high-containment biosafety level 3 enhanced laboratory that is regularly inspected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Agriculture.

In 1918, the H1N1 strain ripped through war-stricken populations, resulting in the deaths of more than 50 million people – more than any other recorded disease outbreak. Today, another highly pathogenic subtype, named H5N1, is causing a global animal pandemic.Since H5N1's emergence in 1996, it has led to the deaths of billions of poultry birds, killed millions of birds in the wild and infected at least 48 species of mammals. In the US, farm cats have died after drinking the unpasteurised milk of H5N1-infected cattle. (Read more about how bird flu became an animal pandemic.)H5N1 has a fearsome mortality rate of over 50% among humans, but is not adapted to spread easily between people: since 2003, 463 people have died. So far, cases of human-to-human transmission are thought to have been limited and non-sustained.But in May 2024, the first human death was reported from the H5N2 subtype, and the virus's ability to jump from mammal to mammal may also be changing.In March, the H5N1 variant was found to be spreading among cattle as well as poultry. By April, a farm worker in Texas became the first person to contract the virus from a cow. With modern cattle farming offering a potentially vast incubator for the virus, further mutation that results in more efficient spread in mammals, including humans, could become more likely, scientists have warned. If the virus does gain the ability to spread efficiently in humans, a vaccine would be one way to slow its progress. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus is not yet at a stage that requires a human vaccine. But in anticipation of such a change, the organisation has confirmed that there are systems and plans in place to produce one. BBC Future Planet spoke to Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and interim director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at WHO, about what the process of producing and rolling out a human vaccine for bird flu might look like.Has avian influenza's circulation among US cattle – as well as its detection in milk – made the need for a human vaccine more pressing? Anytime that new species are infected, it changes our understanding of the virus: the more these viruses circulate, the more opportunities they have to change, and to infect people. Right now, we're seeing herd-to-herd transmission within cattle in the US – and there are a lot of studies underway that are trying to understand how the virus is circulating between the farms. On the H5N1 virus's presence in milk, we're also working with a number of researchers who are looking at the role of pasteurisation and virus inactivation. So for now it's really important for people to consume only pasteurised milk products. But human vaccines are for humans. And (at point of interview) we've had only 28 reported human cases since 2021, and no documented human-to-human transmission. For WHO to trigger increased development or the production of H5N1 vaccines, then something would really need to change in terms of the risk in humans.Getty ImagesThe virus appears to be able to transmit form cow to cow, but not yet easily from human to human (Credit: Getty Images)At what point would the rollout of a human vaccine for bird flu become necessary?To evaluate transmissibility and severity, and especially if the virus were to more efficiently transmit between people, the WHO regularly undertakes risk assessments of all available data. As well as the virus's internal, genetic make-up, the assessment would consider the phenotypic characteristics of the virus, i.e. how it operates in the world. Would it be transmitted only among people who are in close contact with one another, such as health workers? Would it lead to small clusters of infections? Or efficient transmission with large outbreaks?What systems are in place to deal with a rollout?Unlike with Covid-19, which stemmed from the Sars-CoV-2 virus, we have a 70-year system in place for studying influenza viruses. Called the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), this global partnership entails 150 national influenza centres, in 130 member states – including 12 centres that are specific to H5. These centres are already looking at the circulation of influenza viruses to see which subtypes could potentially become epidemics, and which could potentially become pandemics. We then have another system, called the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness framework (PIP), that, together with GISRS, identifies candidate vaccine viruses so the potential production of vaccines can start ahead of time. In that framework, we already have several H5N1 vaccines that are in development.Scaling up vaccine development and production would require a declaration by WHO – based on the above assessments – that we have a virus that has pandemic potential. When that happens, we have agreements that are in place to switch production from seasonal influenza vaccine production to pandemic vaccine production. But we're not there yet. We're not seeing human-to-human transmission. Are vaccine makers prepared for an avian influenza mutation that could transmit efficiently between humans?When you have a novel pathogen, then the whole world is susceptible to infection. That's what we saw with Sars-CoV-2.We don't yet know what the susceptibility of the population to H5N1 will be. There have been surveys done on H5N1 to see how many people have actually been exposed to this virus – and so far the only people to fall ill are those who have been directly exposed through their occupations, such as contact with poultry. With this particular virus, I think the world could be largely susceptible to it. But what I want to reiterate is that we have a global system in place that is tracking these viruses. We also have a number of viruses that we call "candidate vaccine viruses", which are available to manufacturers to allow them to develop vaccines. Among these, we have two available candidate vaccine viruses that are related to the H5N1 virus that is circulating right now. So we're in a very good position to ramp up production should we need to. Would existing vaccines work if the virus further adapts and mutates?If the virus changes, we have a system in place to recommend that new virus for manufacturers to use. We also work with partner agencies at the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, and their veterinary labs, that are sharing viruses from animal species. And we're constantly looking at these influenza viruses to ask: are they a different subtype? Are they more prevalent? Where are they being detected? And could this avian influenza virus become more transmissible and become a pandemic? Getty ImagesBird flu has decimated both birds and mammals in the wild (Credit: Getty Images)How long would it take to roll out a bird flu vaccine for humans?Current vaccines for avian influenza do not use the same messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology that was used for Covid-19. Those vaccines help the body to produce its own vaccine antigens (inactivated virus proteins), and can be manufactured at speed.In contrast, current influenza vaccines use a slower, more traditional egg-based manufacturing process. Egg-based vaccines involve injecting the candidate vaccine viruses into fertilised eggs, incubating them so the virus replicates in weaker form, and then harvesting the resulting fluid.We estimate that four to eight billion doses of a pandemic influenza vaccine could be produced over a 12-month period. Through our PIP framework, and the agreements we have with vaccine manufacturers, the WHO would have access to about 11-12% of production right away, which we could use based on need. That's approximately 500 million doses that we would have access to (though that amount would vary depending on antigen needs).How does that compare with how the Covid-19 vaccines rolled out?Covid-19 vaccines took about a year to be used. A potential vaccine for avian influenza could be available earlier than that because we're more prepared. This is because we have identified and made available the H5N1 candidate vaccine viruses, and we have an existing influenza vaccine manufacturing pipeline with these agreements in place. In terms of use of vaccines, we would look at who is most likely to be infected in terms of exposure, and those who are most likely to experience severe disease – taking into consideration risk factors like age, pregnancy or underlying conditions. Young children are particularly at risk of influenza viruses. More like this:• The country inoculating against misinformation• How to talk to vaccine-hesitant people• The long shadow of Covid-19 distrustWhat can governments do to help scientists prepare a potential human vaccination programme?We're asking governments to increase their surveillance in animals and humans, especially those who are exposed to infected animals. And to ensure that they're sequencing the virus and sharing those sequences, so we can really understand any changes. They also need to reinforce and sustain surveillance and vaccine-delivery systems that were strengthened during Covid-19, rather than directing money away from infectious diseases to other threats. Plus, there's a lot governments can do to increase trust in vaccines, and especially to address misinformation and disinformation. How can misinformation about vaccines best be addressed?This requires a multi-faceted approach and needs to look at the source of the misinformation or disinformation. During Covid-19, there was work done by some of the big online platforms to prevent this information spreading – but some of that has now stopped. So it's really up to organisations like ours and national governments to try to make sure that what is online is accurate.

As is known, immune escape is a strategy that benefits the proliferation of IAVs by antagonizing, blocking, and suppressing immune surveillance. The HA protein binds to the sialic acid (SA) receptor to enter the cytoplasm and initiate viral infection. The conserved components of the viral genome produced during replication, known as the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), are thought to be critical factors for the activation of effective innate immunity by triggering dependent signaling pathways after recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), followed by a cascade of adaptive immunity. Viral infection-induced immune responses establish an antiviral state in the host to effectively inhibit virus replication and enhance viral clearance. However, IAV has evolved multiple mechanisms that allow it to synthesize and transport viral components by “playing games” with the host. At its heart, this review will describe how host and viral factors interact to facilitate the viral evasion of host immune responses. Graphical abstract Graphical Abstract. 1 Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV), a negative-stranded RNA virus containing eight single-stranded RNA segments, belongs to the orthomyxoviridae family and can infect birds, humans, and other mammals. Indeed, IAV infection has become a global risk factor (Richard and Fouchier, 2016), with outbreaks that can cause up to 5 million severe illnesses and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide (Gopal et al., 2020). The host’s innate immunity is the initial line of defense against viral invasion, especially the interferon (IFN) response (Tan et al., 2018). Despite the potent antiviral activity of the innate immune system, it is interesting that viruses, to escape from strong immune responses, have evolved tactics to subvert the host immune repertoire and thereby establish successful infection and proliferation. Antigenic drift, a minor change in the antigenicity of IAV caused by site mutations of surface glycoprotein (either hemagglutinin or neuraminidase), can lead to annual seasonal epidemics (Webby and Webster, 2001), while antigenic shift is to blame the HA or NA recombination events and can generally cause a virus pandemic (Gao et al., 2013). Even healthy young populations vaccinated in advance may have little or no protective immunity when infected with IAV, which significantly increases the mortality rate. Presently, the effects of immune escape are intricate and multi-dimensional, and myriad outstanding achievements have been accumulated in existing studies. However, the in-depth immune escape study needs a recent comprehensive content summary highlighting the importance of assessing IAV infection and the immune responses to control and eliminate the infection. Therefore, this review summarizes the latest research on how IAVs evade the host immune system and gain the upper hand in the virus-host game. Most importantly, this review aims to answer the following research questions: How does IAV elude immune defense? What viral proteins and host factors are involved in this process? On the other hand, it allows researchers to put some order into the current patchwork of studies on immune evasion strategies utilized by IAV. Finally, we discuss some major gaps and unknowns on this subject. 2 Morphological structure and protein function of IAV IAV has a broad distribution spectrum, and its main host is waterfowl (Olsen et al., 2006). The viral RNA (vRNA) genome is comprised of eight negative-sense RNA segments (Figure 1). The core proteins encoded by vRNA are polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2), polymerase basic 1 protein (PB1), polymerase acidic protein (PA), hemagglutinin protein (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase protein (NA) and matrix proteins (M1 and M2), nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Figure 1 Figure 1. Structure of IAV. The image was created with Adobe Illustrator. The shape of virus particles is not static, canonically spherical, and a few are filamentous. The surface glycoproteins of virions include HA and NA, and their antigenicity can be used to distinguish and name different virus subtypes. The HA spikes have receptor binding and fusion functions, and NA spikes have receptor-destroying activity. The envelope also contains a third integral membrane protein, M2, which is exposed on the outer surface and functions as an ion channel, essential for uncoating. There are 18 HA subtypes, and 11 NA subtypes unlocked in nature (Yang et al., 2021; Fereidouni et al., 2023). Among these subtypes, there are 3 HA (H1, H2, and H3) and 2 NA (N1 and N2) subtypes of IAV that have occasionally infected humans and caused annual epidemics (Watanabe et al., 2014). The density and thickness of the M1 protein align with the host cell capsule layer. M1 associates with viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) and the virion core and connects with the envelope glycoproteins, HA and NA, to support the virus particle structurally (Schaap and Eghiaian, 2012). The innermost component of the virion is the vRNP complex, composed of vRNA, polymerase proteins, and NP (Moeller et al., 2012). It is characterized by being imported into the cytoplasm for virus assembly and budding at the late stage of the IAV life cycle. 3 IAV escapes from innate immune 3.1 Viral proteins mediate immune escape The initial response to IAV is directed by the innate immune system, which is triggered by the host’s PRRs recognizing viral PAMPs. PRRs are composed of membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytoplasmic bound retinoic acid inducer I (RIG-I) -like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod) -like receptors (NLRs) (Zhang et al., 2022), mediate viral sensing and activate downstream transcription factors and interferons (IFNs). IFNs initiate immune responses in infected and neighboring cells. The innate immune response releases mounting IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to the arrest of viral replication (Negishi et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021). IAV has evolved multiple strategies to circumvent host immunity to establish successful infection. For example, IAV infection inhibits IFN signaling to reduce IFN production, thus suppressing many antiviral molecules’ expression. The suppression of innate immunity by AIV is a sophisticated mechanism and mainly involves a variety of viral proteins (PB1, PB2, PA, NS1, and PB1-F2). 3.1.1 NS1 protein Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is considered a pivotal fraction in enhancing virulence by antagonizing the innate antiviral response in various hosts (Figure 2). As stated above, the RIG-I, TLR3, and TLR7 can detect viral RNA in different cell types to induce type I IFN antiviral response upon IAV infection. Figure 2 Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the mechanism of NS1-mediated immune escape in IAV. NS1 mediates the innate immune escape of viruses in five main ways. (A–D) could reduce IFN-β synthesis by inhibiting IFN signaling pathways, thereby circumventing the antiviral effect of host immunity, while E contributes to the immune escape of IAV by inhibiting the inflammatory response pathway. (A1,A2) mainly play the virus against the host by blocking the RIG-I signaling pathway. (B) NS1 mainly acts through host factors (SPL and SSU72) to subvert the antiviral response. (C) The NS1 protein can escape host innate immunity through amino acid substitutions such as single mutation F9Y, double mutation (R108K/G189D), and conserved FTEE motif (aa150-153). (D) NS1 truncation leads to the blocking of TLR production and weakens the antiviral effect. (E) NS1 can also interact with TRIM25 through the NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation pathway to reduce IL-1β signaling, which may have additional antagonistic effects on host pro-inflammatory responses and create a favorable environment for viral replication. The image was created with BioRender.com. NS1 inhibits the activity of RIG-I mainly through direct or indirect influences, enabling the virus to counteract the host antiviral innate immune response successfully (Figures 2A1,A2). For instance, overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) leads to the inhibition of RIG-I expression, while NS1 can promote the phosphorylation process of C/EBPβ and C/EBPβ/NS1 complex occupies the RIG-I promoter, which ultimately promotes viral replication in human lung epithelial cells (Kumari et al., 2020). The pan-handle structure of the vRNA promoter is reckoned to be sensed by RIG-I; the results demonstrated that the mismatched vRNA promoter could affect the formation of the RNA/RIG-I complex and prevent RIG -I activation. In other words, mismatch may represent a general viral strategy to escape RIG-I sensing (Anchisi et al., 2016). IAV can also hijack cellular 5′-3′ exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1) to increase viral titers. IAV NS1 directly interacts with cellular XRN1 and co-localizes in the P-bodies (PBs), and the virus utilizes XRN1 activity to inhibit RIG-I mediated innate immune response (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, IAV NS1 competitively binds to 14–3-3ε protein with RIG-I to inhibit the translocation of RIG-1 to the adaptor MAVS, leading to insufficient IFN-β production (Wang et al., 2022). Studies have shown that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) lyase (SPL) enhances the IKKε-mediated type I IFN response, and IAV infection or NS1 protein expression can cause ubiquitination or down-regulation of SPL. Thus, the SPL-mediated antiviral response is subverted (Figure 2B) (Wolf et al., 2021). However, many questions remain unanswered regarding the underlying mechanism of NS1 triggering SPL ubiquitination and degradation. Compared with less virulent seasonal IAV, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 can better bypass the innate immune response. Furthermore, through the molecular mechanism of the NS1-SSU72-trans-transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-STAT1/2 axis, AIV infection can reduce the expression of SSU72 and induce TRT, thereby weakening the innate immune response (Figure 2B) (Zhao et al., 2022). Thus, restoring SSU72 expression could be a potential strategy for preventing AIV pandemics. The NS1 protein can escape innate immunity through amino acid substitution (Figure 2C). The NS1 F9Y amino acid mutation of H1N1 introduced by error-prone PCR can significantly enhance virus growth in vitro and in vivo, increasing virus virulence in mice (Yu et al., 2022). This characteristic mutation can target antiviral drugs and attenuate vaccine development. In addition, the double mutation (R108K/G189D) in the NS1 protein suggested a systematic and selective inhibition of cytokine responses to counteract the innate immune response (Huang et al., 2021). At the same time, the conserved FTEE motif (aa150-153) of NS1 can subvert the RIG-I, TLR3, and TLR7 pathways in combination with TRAF3 E3 ubiquitin ligase to produce type I IFN (Lin et al., 2021). Therefore, the “power” of the virus to antagonize host immunity should not be underestimated by the changes in crucial amino acids. TLR and NLR significantly contribute to innate immunity against the IAV. The hippo signaling pathway can act as an immune regulator. NS1 binds to the C-terminal domain of the hippo effectors (Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)) YAP/TAZ complex. It activates YAP/TAZ, hijacking the complex into the nucleus. At the same time, YAP/TAZ can downregulate the expression of TLR3 and ultimately block the antiviral innate immune signal, facilitating viral replication and host cell apoptosis (Figure 2D) (Zhang et al., 2022). In addition, NS1 can also interact with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) through the NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation pathway. NS1 attenuates the association between pro-caspase-1 and ASC, followed by decreasing IL-1β signal transduction. Collectively, NS1 has an additional antagonistic effect on proinflammatory response to create a favorable environment for viral replication (Figure 2E) (Park et al., 2021). 3.1.2 Polymerase proteins The PB2 protein of RNA polymerase utilizes another key inhibitory mechanism to mediate viral immune evasion. However, the PB2 protein can be localized in the nucleus and mitochondria, and the interaction between PB2 and MAVS can inhibit MAVS mediate IFN-β expression. Still, the PB2 protein of AIV has not been found to have such a phenomenon (Graef et al., 2010). PB1 preferentially interacts with a selective autophagic receptor neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1), which delivers MAVS to autophagosomes for degradation via the PB1-RNF5-MAVS-NBR1 axis, blocking RIG-I-MAVS-mediated innate signaling pathway to promote H7N9 infection (Figure 3A) (Zeng et al., 2021). In addition, PA can inhibit the IFN-β by interacting with IRF3, an alternative strategy IAV utilizes to antagonize the host immune response (Figure 3B) (Yi et al., 2017). Interestingly, PB1 (398E/524S/563I) and PA (351E)-referred to as ESIE-motif-adequately antagonized IFN expression, which leads to a failure to sense the virus, suggesting the combination of ESIE-motif with viral rearrangements may contribute to pandemic risk (Figure 3C) (Liedmann et al., 2014). However, the mechanism of IFN-β inhibition by the viral polymerase proteins is poorly understood. Figure 3 Figure 3. Working model of polymerase acidic proteins-mediated regulation of innate immune escape signal transduction. (A) PB1 delivers MAVS to autophagosomes for degradation through the PB1-RNF5-MAVS-NBR1 axis, blocking RIG-I-MAVS-mediated degradation, ultimately leading to IFN decline and promotion of H7N9 infection. (B) The N-terminal functional domain of PA blocks IRF3 phosphorylation, which is responsible for IFN-β suppression. (C) The ESIE motif can sufficiently antagonize the induction of IFN, which may be associated with the pandemic risk of IAV. The image was created with BioRender.com. 3.1.3 Novel proteins PA-X, an overlapping protein-coding region in PA, encodes the N-terminal 191 amino acids and unique C-terminal sequences (41 or 61 amino acid residues) of the PA protein produced by +1 reading frame of the PA gene via ribosomal frameshifting (Jagger et al., 2012). PA-X protein inhibits the expression of chemokine CCL20 to reduce the recruitment of DCs to the nasal epithelial cells (Ecs), which assists the immune evasion of H9N2 subtype AIVs by blocking the downstream innate and mucosal immune activation (Figure 4A) (Qin et al., 2022). Another result showed that PA-X protein inhibited viral replication in chBM-DCs (chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells) but not in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1). Moreover, the PA-X protein downregulated the expression of phenotypic markers (CD40, CD86, and MHC II) and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-12 and IL-1β) of chBM-DCs. Taken together, these findings indicated that PA-X protein is a key viral protein that helps H9N2 subtype AIVs escape the innate immunity of chBM-DCs (Qin et al., 2023). In addition, PA-X acts as a positive viral replication regulator and interacts with host proteins to inhibit IFN expression (Figure 4B) (Rigby et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Figure 4 Figure 4. The progression of PA-X and HA-mediated immune escape of IAV. (A) PA-X protein assisted H9N2 subtype AIVs in escaping immune response of mucosal DCs. The binding of PA-X to CCL20 blocks the recruitment of CD11b+ CDs and CD103+ CDs to the nasal mucosa. It downregulates the expression of CCR7 to reduce the expression of CD4+ T cells, which mediates the adaptive immune escape of the virus. (B) PA-X reduces the expression of interferon by inhibiting RIG-I and NF-κB pathways and increases the replication advantage of the virus. (C) The interaction between HA and PARP1 decomposes IFNAR1, inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT1, and then reduces IFN-β, which finally mediates the innate immune escape of the virus. The image was created with BioRender.com. PB1-F2 is a 90 amino acid protein expressed from the +1 open reading frame in the PB1 gene of IAV (Chen et al., 2001). Recently, it has been reported that PB1-F2 transport to mitochondria by interacting with the Tu translation elongation factor, mitochondria (TUFM), which in turn promotes complete mitophagy. As a result, MAVS is delivered to autophagosomes for degradation, and the type I IFN induction is then suppressed (Wang et al., 2021). Albeit duck and human MAVS share only 28% amino acid similarity, PB1-F2 inhibits both human and avian MAVS signaling to suppress IFN-β induction (Xiao et al., 2020). Of course, there are some exceptions. For example, PB1-F2 of the H7N9 AIV can significantly induce mitochondrial ROS production, accelerate the activation of NLRP3, and negatively regulate virus replication (Pinar et al., 2017). 3.1.4 HA protein The IAV employs a sophisticated strategy to evade the host’s innate immune response, with the HA protein playing a pivotal role. Our investigation sheds light on the intricate mechanisms underlying HA-mediated immune evasion: IFNAR1 (IFN-alpha receptor 1) Degradation by HA1 Protein: • The HA1 subunit of the HA protein orchestrates IFNAR1 ubiquitination, leading to a reduction in IFNAR1 levels within infected cells (Xia et al., 2015). • Remarkably, the abundance of IFNAR1 on the cell surface directly influences cellular sensitivity to interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) signaling (Kumar et al., 2004, 2007; Zheng et al., 2011). • A comprehensive study delved into the mechanism of IFNAR1 degradation by IAV HA. Intriguingly, HA not only targets IFNAR1 but also degrades the type II interferon (IFN-γ) receptor 1 (IFNGR1) via casein kinase 1α (CK1α). Knockdown of CK1α using small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively repressed the degradation of both IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 induced by IAV infection (Xia et al., 2015, 2018). Role of PARP1 [Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1] in IFN Receptor Degradation: • Mass spectrometry (MS) studies unveiled the molecular mechanism underlying IFN receptor degradation by IAV HA. • Cellular PARP1 emerges as a critical mediator of IAV HA-induced IFNAR1 degradation. • IAV HA dynamically alters the distribution of endogenous PARP1, facilitating the orchestrated degradation of IFNAR1. This process significantly benefits IAV propagation (Figure 4C) (Xia et al., 2020). Uncharted Territory: HA and Innate Immune Escape: • Despite these intriguing findings, our understanding of HA’s role in innate immune escape remains incomplete. • Further exploration is warranted to unravel the precise mechanisms by which HA orchestrates immune evasion, especially considering its potential impact on pandemic risk. 3.1.5 NP protein Autophagy is an important cellular process to maintain cellular homeostasis by cleaning up the hazardous substrates in lysosomes. Accumulating research has also suggested that autophagy is a critical mechanism in host defense responses against IAV infection by degrading viral particles and activating innate or acquired immunity to induce viral clearance. However, IAV has conversely hijacked autophagy to strengthen virus infection by blocking autophagy maturation and further interfering with host antiviral signaling to promote viral replication (Krammer et al., 2018). A study revealed that NP-mediated mitophagy leads to the degradation of the mitochondria-anchored protein MAVS, thereby blocking MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and promoting virus replication. The NP-mediated mitophagy depends on the NP’s interaction with MAVS and the cargo receptor TOLLIP (toll-interacting protein). Moreover, Y313 of NP is a key residue for the MAVS-NP interaction and NP-mediated mitophagy. The NPY313F mutation significantly attenuates the virus-induced mitophagy and the virus replication in vitro and in vivo (Zhang et al., 2023). 3.2 Host factors mediate immune escape 3.2.1 Host proteins IAV utilizes host factors to inhibit the expression of IFNs for efficient transmission, which is the most common way of immune escape (Table 1). N-Myc and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) interactor (NMI) is an IFN-induced protein. Upon IAV infection, NMI recruits the TRIM21 (tripartite motif-containing 21, an E3 ubiquitin ligase) to IRF7 and promotes proteasomal degradation of IRF7. Consequently, NMI impairs the IRF7-induced type I IFN response and facilitates IAV infection (Ouyang et al., 2021). IAV manipulates Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, which leads to the downregulation of IFNs and suppression of innate antiviral immunity (Wang et al., 2021). IAV infection upregulates the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein SOCS1, which antagonizes the IFN-activated JAK/STAT signaling pathway by inducing the degradation of JAK1, resulting in suppressed type I and type II IFN responses (Du et al., 2020). Sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), a host sphingolipid metabolism-related factor, interacts with IFN-β promoter through the binding of demethylase TET3 but not with the other promoters regulated by TET3, can in turn recruit HDAC1 to the IFN-β promoter, enhancing the deacetylation of IFN-β promoter, therefore negatively regulating type I IFN expression and thus facilitates IAV propagation (Xu et al., 2022). From RNA interference (RNAi) screening, the double plant homeodomain fingers 2 (DPF2/REQ) gene was identified as one of six genes for which knockdown significantly decreased the infectivity of IAV. DPF2 negatively regulated the induction of the type I IFN and strongly suppressed activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in IAV-infected cells in response to promoting the immune escape of IAV (Shin et al., 2017). As such, PR8 infection specifically induces transcription factor RUNX1, which blocks the expression of IRF3 and STAT1 to attenuate the production of IFN-β and ISGs to facilitate viral infection in A549 cells (Hu et al., 2022). The RNase activity of MCP-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) can directly degrade cytokine mRNAs, such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-1β, and IL-2, by functioning as an RNase. The study showed that MCPIP1 reduced RIG-I expression after IAV-infected A549 cells by disrupting the stability of RIG-I mRNA, thereby diminishing the IAV-induced host antiviral response (Sun et al., 2018). Table 1 Table 1. Summary of host factors involved in innate immune escape in IAV infection. IAV relies on positive cytokines and decreases the activity of NF-κB-related signaling pathways, which is one of the common ways of immune escape. The transcriptional repressor N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) facilitates IAV replication by targeting IKKβ and promotes HPAIV H5N1 replication by inhibiting canonical NF-κB activity (Chen et al., 2018). In addition, the sex-determining region Y-box 4 (Sox4) is induced to be up-regulated during IAV infection. Sox4 inhibits the production of MyD88 and most TLRs by binding to their promoters to attenuate gene transcription. In addition, Sox4 blocks the activities of the TLR/MyD88/IRAK4/TAK1 and TLR/TRIF/TRAF3/TBK1 pathways by repressing their key components. Moreover, Sox4 represses the activation of the NF-κB by interacting with IKKα/β and attenuates NF-kB and IRF3/7 abundances by promoting protein degradation. All these contributed to the down-regulation of IFNs and ISG expression, facilitating viral replications and shutting down host immunity to assist IAV (Shang et al., 2021). Notably, the major enzymatic source of ROS, NOX2 oxidase, is activated by a variety of ssRNA and DNA viruses, including IAV, in endocytic compartments, followed by the production of endosomal hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which modifies a unique and highly conserved the cysteine residue (Cys98) of TLR7 to promotes viral replication (To et al., 2017). In addition, proteasome subunit alpha type 2 (PSMA2) is a cellular protein highly expressed in IAV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. The result showed that PSMA2 was required for nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated ROS neutralization and that IAV uses PSMA2 to escape viral clearance via the NRF2-mediated cellular oxidative response (Rashid et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the ROS-dependent regulation of antiviral immunity remains a direction worthy of further exploration. 3.2.2 Non-coding RNAs IAV can circumvent the host’s innate immune system by regulating certain host-long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) for their effective propagation (Li et al., 2019; Wang and Cen, 2020). LncNSPL directly binds to RIG-I and blocks the interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25 by reducing TRIM25-mediated lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, inhibiting IFN-β activation and reducing the production of antiviral cytokines (Jiang et al., 2022), which is similar to the mechanism mediated by the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2009). Increasing evidence has shown that IAV can alter the expression profile of host miRNA (Zhang et al., 2019). Some host miRNAs are involved in various viral infections by regulating type I IFN (Ho et al., 2014). In vitro, miR-221 down-regulation promotes IAV replication by targeting the SOCS1/NF-κB pathway to inhibit type I IFN response (Zhang et al., 2021). Besides, miR-194 can directly target fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), down-regulating FGF2 expression at protein transcription and translation levels to limit IFN response and accelerate H5N1 virus replication (Shi et al., 2020). 4 IAV escapes from adaptive immune Host recognition of IAV invasion stimulates innate immune signaling, which leads to the synthesis of numerous effectors and directs the adaptive immune response to the corresponding type of response (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2015). Adaptive immunity is the second line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms, including humoral and cellular immunity. In humoral immunity, the host mainly produces neutralizing antibodies against HA protein. The antibodies bind to HA spherical heads on the virions, inhibiting the attachment of IAV to host cells. In contrast, binding of HA on the surface of infected host cells is required to initiate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic effects (ADCC) to eliminate IAV (de Jong et al., 2000). However, antibodies produced against the NA protein have no neutralizing activity, and their major effect is to inhibit NA’s enzymatic activity, thereby preventing the release of progeny virions from infected cells (Krammer, 2019). Cellular immunity is dominated by memory T cells. IAV antigens are presented to CD4+ T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and subsequently activated to produce T helper (Th1) and Th2 cells. Th1 cells express IFN gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-2, which promote the proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Th2 cells express IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, activating B cells’ differentiation and producing specific antibodies. In acquired immunity, DCs are involved in innate immunity and crucial antigen-presenting cells (APCs). DCs present endogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells via MHC class I molecules, capable of activating and differentiating into IAV-specific CTLs. CTLs then migrate to the site of infection, recognizing and eliminating cells infected with multiple IAV subtypes (Ekiert et al., 2011). Clearance of viral infection by adaptive immunity is mediated by neutralizing antibodies produced by humoral immunity and immune cells produced by cellular immunity. The body produces Th1 immunity to clear the IAV from the lungs (Graham et al., 1994). DCs initiate primary immune responses after recognizing pathogens (Mellman and Steinman, 2001), present antigens to MHC II and MHC I, and up-regulate the expression of costimulatory molecules, which are eventually processed by CD4+ T cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that lyse virus-infected cells and secrete IFN-γ to initiate Th1 immunity (Moran et al., 1999). Many studies have demonstrated that the substitution of HA protein amino acids is a key determinant of viral antigenic variation (Kaverin et al., 2004; Okamatsu et al., 2008; Ping et al., 2008; Wan et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015, 2022; Peacock et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022; Lyashko et al., 2024), and the antigenic drift of NA may be a by-product of HA (Hensley et al., 2011). The two have co-evolved to assist IAV immune escape. The antigenicity changes of H9N2, H7N9, and H5NX subtype AIVs are pushed by the renewal of vaccine strains and the pressure of antibody selection. Viral evolution promotes viral escape from the neutralization of antibodies by adding N-linked glycosylation (NLG) to shield the antigenic sites, changing virus-antibody binding, or altering the specificity of receptor binding. Adding glycosylation sites at the mutated amino acid sites carried in proteins HA and NA can induce virion escape (Chang and Zaia, 2019; Sealy et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021; Ge and Ross, 2021; Thornlow et al., 2021). Still, glycosylation is often accompanied by the emergence of compensatory mutations whose function is unknown. Obviously, the exact mechanism of how IAVs escape from adaptive immunity remains to be elucidated (Kosik et al., 2018). 5 Conclusion and future perspectives In general, the latest research results on the IAV escaping the host’s innate immunity are abundant. We know that IAV uses its proteins and hijacks host proteins as the main means of escape. Recently, various novel viral proteins have been discovered to facilitate virus infection. Still, more studies are needed to explore the roles of these proteins in the IAV infection process and the detailed mechanisms of viral replication and successful antagonism against the host. Moreover, lncRNAs can mediate the antiviral response manipulated by host immunity (Chen et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2021). Hence, future studies should emphasize how viruses use host lncRNAs for immune escape. A study identified that the dimerization domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (SARS2-NP) is required for SARS2-NP to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) with RNA, which inhibits Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS and thereby suppresses the innate antiviral immune response. Mice infected with an RNA virus carrying SARS2-NP exhibited reduced innate immunity, an increased viral load, and high morbidity (Wang et al., 2021). Future research can explore whether there is a relationship between liquid–liquid phase separation and the immune escape of the IAV. IAV escaping from acquired immunity is a key “blind area.” Viral fitness requires compatibility between HA and NA. So, the IAV needs to change antigenicity so that antibodies cannot neutralize the IAV. Moreover, N-glycosylation of IAV is required for proper viral binding and release (Wagner et al., 2000; Daniels et al., 2003). The glycosylation of HA and NA can interfere with vaccine-induced antibodies by forming steric hindrance (Wagner et al., 2000; Chang and Zaia, 2019), ultimately leading to immune escape of IAV (Hervé et al., 2015). Data suggested that aberrant cellular glycosylation may increase the risk of severe influenza due to the increased ability of glycome-modified IAVs to evade the immune response. Specifically, immunization of mice with NGI-1-treated virus significantly reduced antihemagglutinin and antineuraminidase titers of total serum antibody and reduced hemagglutinin protective antibody responses (Alymova et al., 2022). However, the detailed escape mechanism has yet to be discovered. Indeed, the selection of model viruses is one of the difficulties in studying the immune escape of IAVs. Future studies should explore which adaptive immune signaling pathways are responsible for the failure of antibody neutralization. Only with a better understanding of how IAVs escape from the host immune response can we more effectively develop vaccines and antiviral drugs to achieve the purpose of precise prevention and control of influenza epidemics.

Wastewater samples from across the U.S. overall show low levels of influenza nationally. Flu experts, however, remain vigilant. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images fileMay 14, 2024, 11:04 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsThere’s no solid evidence that bird flu is spreading among people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday amid an outbreak of the virus in dairy cows.New data from 189 of the agency’s wastewater sampling sites showed that as of May 4, an influenza A virus had been detected at higher-than-average levels in a handful of sites across the country, including in Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois and Kansas. The bird flu currently circulating in cows, called H5N1, is a type of influenza A. Just one site, in Saline County, Kansas, showed notably high levels of flu virus for this time of the year. Four herds in Kansas tested positive in April, the CDC said. It’s unclear whether the Kansas wastewater samples were limited to human waste or whether they included runoff water from farms. It’s also unclear whether the high levels of virus in the wastewater indicate infections in humans, cows, birds or other animals. There hasn’t been any unusual uptick in flu-like illnesses in recent weeks, the CDC said. “We’d really like to understand what might be driving that influenza A increase during what we consider the lower transmission season for influenza A,” said Jonathan Yoder, deputy director of the CDC’s division of infectious disease readiness and innovation.A representative from one of Saline County’s major hospitals didn’t respond to a request for comment. Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease expert and an associate professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina, said the new CDC data “is actually pretty reassuring.” “We’re in the middle of May,” he said, when “there isn’t naturally a lot of flu.” Wolfe said he isn’t seeing any uptick in flu-like illnesses in his medical practice. As of Tuesday, 42 herds in nine states — Kansas, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas — had been affected.The agency is monitoring 260 people who have been exposed to infected dairy cows for flu-like symptoms. Thirty-three people have been tested for the virus. So far just one person — a dairy farm worker in Texas — has been diagnosed with bird flu connected to the dairy cow outbreak. He developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, and has recovered.

The study period included the emergence of the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant in December 2023. Follow-up was 30 days or until death. Causes of death weren't examined.Nonsignificant difference during JN.1A total of 8,625 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 at 30 days (unadjusted death rate, 5.70%), and 2,647 were admitted for flu (unadjusted death rate, 3.04%).Compared with a study using the same database and methods, the death rate at 30 days was 5.97% in 2022-2023 vs 5.70% in 2023-2024 for COVID-19 and 3.75% in 2022-2023 vs 4.24% in 2023-2024 for influenza.COVID-19 patients were more likely to die than those with flu by 30 days (adjusted death rate, 5.70% vs 4.24%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.35), but the difference between the two groups was nonsignificant immediately before and during JN.1 variant predominance (adjusted death rate, 5.46% vs 5.82%; adjusted HR, 1.07). "Compared with a study using the same database and methods, the death rate at 30 days was 5.97% in 2022-2023 vs 5.70% in 2023-2024 for COVID-19 and 3.75% in 2022-2023 vs 4.24% in 2023-2024 for influenza," the study authors wrote. "Both adjusted HRs were statistically significant, with an HR of 1.61 in 2022-2023 and 1.35 in 2023-2024, with overlapping 95% CIs [confidence intervals]."The team said that mutations in the COVID-19 or flu viruses and/or the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs influence the relative risk of death. They also noted that the results should be interpreted in the context of nearly twice as many hospitalizations for COVID-19 than for flu during the 2023-24 respiratory virus season.The finding that, at the level of the study's statistical power, the risk of death wasn't significantly different in the COVID-19 and flu cohorts in the JN.1-dominant era suggests that the variant may have a similar severity profile as the variants emerged immediately before, the researchers said. Because most participants were older men, they cautioned that the results may not be generalizable to the rest of the population.

Pasteurization destroys the influenza virus and other microbes in milk. Raw milk has not been through the high-temperature processing of pasteurization and carries a number of potentially dangerous microbes. Baldwin says the reason we began pasteurizing milk was to control the spread of tuberculosis. “And since pasteurization kills those bacteria, it will certainly inactivate flu virus,” Baldwin says. As of May 6, Colorado was the most recent state to report cows testing positive for HPAI. The American Veterinary Medical Association notes that there are 36 confirmed infected dairy herds in nine states, three of them adjacent to Utah — Idaho, Colorado, and New Mexico. In late April, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mandated that dairy cows must be tested for HPAI within seven days of being transported across state lines whether they are going to another dairy or a livestock show. What does HPAI look like in dairy cows? Baldwin says one of the first things dairy farmers have noticed is a change in the cow’s manure. Most dairy cows have very loose fecal material. What farmers report is that infected animals’ manure becomes thicker. Cows also have a sharp drop in milk production. Dr. Carmen Lau, a veterinary pathologist at the UVDL at Utah State University, notes that cows with the virus have a low-grade fever, their milk production decreases, and the quality of the milk changes, becoming thicker than normal. The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has information online about HPAI in cattle and poultry, including instructions about testing animals. A statement issued by Utah’s Assistant State Veterinarian Dr. Amanda Price says dairies that suspect cows may have the virus should move sick animals to a hospital pen and immediately contact their veterinarian. In the case of some illnesses, farmers and dairy workers bring samples they have taken directly to the UVDL for testing. Baldwin says that is not the procedure for suspected cases of HPAI. The state covers the cost of the test, but samples must be collected by a licensed veterinarian or “an approved sample collector” who has received a case number from UDAF before collecting the required milk samples. Cow Udder Anatomy 101 A cow’s udder is comprised of four separate glands. Each gland is called a quarter. “It’s suspected that the virus is being spread by milking machines because they have found in some cows that only one-quarter is affected instead of the whole cow,” Lau explains. “It makes us suspect that maybe some milking equipment is not self-cleaning the way it should, and it’s shooting infected milk into that quarter. We don’t have proof of that right now, but virus this isn’t showing any of the classic cow-to-cow transmission.” For example, Lau says pathologists find almost no HPAI virus in nasal secretions, so samples from nasal swabs alone are not reliable for diagnosing the infection, and secretions are not likely to be a means of spreading it. Baldwin and Lau say that while being vigilant about animal health is important, they do not advise testing animals that are clinically healthy as a random surveillance of herd health. “If you are selling cows that are going across state lines, you test them,” Baldwin says. “Or if it appears you have a disease outbreak, you need to test.” Lau explains that testing healthy animals as a way of looking for disease is discouraged because it is not necessary and because it would consume large quantities of laboratory supplies that are needed to diagnose sick animals, especially if there were to be a large outbreak. Still a Virus Primarily in Birds A lot of attention is currently focused on cross-species infections, but the virus still primarily affects birds. While it’s technically possible for humans to become infected, Lau says that to date, even workers at poultry farms are rarely infected where there are confirmed cases of HPAI and large numbers of sick and dead birds. Unlike HPAI in cows, the virus is deadly in chickens and some other birds. Ducks are commonly a host species spreading the virus, but they often do not die from the infection. Richards adds that wild bird mitigation and biosecurity practices are on the agenda for the free USU Extension Dairy Producer Field Day, on June 4 at the Cache County Fairgrounds. Baldwin and Lau point out that there are other diseases to watch for in poultry. When a backyard chicken owner finds a single dead bird and more do not die shortly after that, it likely was not caused by avian influenza. But in a flock of 25 birds, if a quarter or half of them die over a week, it is possible that HPAI is the cause. In some cases, the numbers are more drastic. “When you suddenly find 20 of them dead in a day, that’s avian influenza,” Baldwin says. He adds that hotter summer temperatures will likely reduce the number of infections because the virus does not thrive in very warm temperatures. Also, fewer migratory birds that transport the disease travel through and stop in Utah in the summer. However, the virus will not be gone, and there will likely be another surge of cases in the fall as more birds migrate and temperatures decrease.

Egypt is part of CDC’s Middle East/North Africa regional platform which includes 25 countries, one regional office based in Oman, and one country office in Pakistan. Overview CDC works with the Egyptian government, Ministry of Health (MOH) and other partners to: Reduce the impact of emerging diseases. Build capacity in areas such as lab systems and epidemiology. Strengthen immunization services. Respond to public health emergencies. Conduct surveillance, surveys, and studies. CDC staff assigned to World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) provide direct support on measles and rubella elimination. CDC staff also directly support respiratory disease surveillance and response. Global health security Strategic focus CDC supports efforts to protect Egypt's public’s health by developing and strengthening disease detection and outbreak response systems. CDC provides capacity-building activities and training in: Epidemiology. Surveillance. Laboratory diagnostics. Data management and reporting. Infection prevention and control. Outbreak investigations and response. Public health systems CDC supports capacity building in surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, and data management and reporting focused on complying with International Health Regulations. CDC supported trainings for surveillance data analysis and data visualization to provide timely data for policy makers. Laboratory systems strengthening Egypt’s Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) virology lab serves as the nation’s reference laboratory. CPHL is a WHO-designated National Influenza Center. WHO Collaborating Center at CDC's Influenza Division routinely provides technical assistance and training to CPHL. This training includes support for sub-national laboratories. CPHL regularly shares influenza data and specimens with WHO Collaborating Centers. This data helps inform biannual global recommendations for influenza vaccine antigen composition. Workforce development CDC supports training health workforce through the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP). CDC’s FETP helps Egypt build critical global health security capabilities. FETP trains future disease detectives and public health leaders. Key leaders at MOH are FETP graduates. CDC’s Public Health Emergency Management Fellowship builds capacity for Egypt’s National Rapid Response Team (RRT) Training. This 3-month immersion fellowship builds public health emergency management capacities within partner nations’ public health authorities. The newly trained RRT members were deployed to investigate pediatric cases of Hepatitis A, early COVID-19 detection, and control dengue outbreaks. Surveillance systems CDC supported expansion of Egypt’s Event Based Surveillance (EBS) system which serves as an early warning system for public health events. This included capacity building of MOH staff to provide timely and quality data for decision makers through rebuilding the EBS system. Emergency response CDC supported the development of Egypt’s National RRT Program in 2022 through the following activities: Development of the program’s management team structure and their training. Development of standard operating procedures. Staffing and training the RRT first cohort on program and all hazards response. Immunization Strategic focus Since 1995, CDC has been providing technical and financial support for vaccine-preventable disease control and prevention to the MOH. This assistance is offered both directly to and through WHO-EMRO. CDC provides support to WHO-EMRO and collaborates with MOH through CDC offices in the Middle East North Africa region. This assistance targets efforts such as eradicating polio, eliminating measles, preventing rubella and congenital rubella syndrome, and enhancing routine immunization services. During and shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasis was placed on supporting COVID-19 vaccine rollout and restoring routine immunization services. Key achievements Achieved significant progress in vaccine preventable disease control and prevention. A CDC supported door to door COVID-19 vaccination campaign was implemented in six governorates. This campaign reached more than 1.8 million people in 2022. More than 3,000 public health officers and healthcare workers were trained on surveillance for adverse events following immunization. They also received training on communication skills for increasing vaccine demand, data management and evidence-based decision making. Indigenous wild poliovirus transmission was eliminated in 2006. Wild poliovirus is monitored by ongoing environmental surveillance in a program assisted by CDC and other partners. Influenza Strategic focus For over 20 years, CDC's Global Influenza Program, the MOH and partners have strengthened Egypt's capacity to respond to influenza threats. CDC works to achieve these goals by: Providing epidemiologic and laboratory technical support for influenza detection, response, and prevention. Expanding the evidence-base to inform prevention and control programs and policies, including influenza vaccination. Supporting pandemic preparedness. Key achievements Egypt’s CPHL virology lab serves as the nation’s reference laboratory and is a WHO-designated National Influenza Center. CPHL routinely receives technical assistance and training from the WHO Collaborating Center at CDC Influenza Division. At a national level, they support sub-national laboratories and regularly share influenza data and specimens with WHO Collaborating Centers. This further informs biannual global recommendations for influenza vaccine antigen composition. Influenza surveillance data from Egypt are used in local pandemic planning while guiding decision makers on appropriate prevention and control strategies. This has also included the introduction and use of seasonal influenza vaccines for higher risk groups. Smoking and respiratory diseases Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine implemented a tobacco control campaign in 2022-2023 reaching over 50 million people in the region. The "United Against Tobacco and COVID-19" campaign was developed after many governments realized the increased risk of severe illness among smokers. This regional campaign was a collaboration with CDC, the MOHs, Vital Strategies, and The Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET).

NIAID; Peter Cade/Getty Images; NIAID Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Tina Hesman Saey May 14, 2024 at 9:15 am Cows have entry portals for both human and bird flus. This new finding may mean that cattle could host both types of flus at once. The two viruses could then swap parts to create a new type of influenza, maybe even one that could cause a pandemic. Cattle have three types of influenza A receptors — entry portals viruses use to infect host cells — veterinarian Charlotte Kristensen and colleagues report May 3 at bioRxiv.org. One portal is like a receptor that decorates human cells. Another is like that found in chickens. And the third resembles receptors from ducks. Tell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now One of those avian receptors may have allowed a virus from a wild bird to infect a dairy cow in Texas, leading to the current H5N1 bird flu outbreak in cattle. Researchers have long thought cattle were resistant to influenza A, says Kristensen, of the University of Copenhagen. Some cows have been infected in lab studies, and there have been suggestions that cows might sometimes catch human seasonal influenza. But it surprised many experts when H5N1 bird flu was found in dairy cattle and in grocery store milk this spring (SN: 4/25/24). In the new study, Kristensen and colleagues tested whether cows have receptors that bird flu viruses can use to infect their cells. Not only did the team find such entry portals but also found that the receptors, especially the duck version, were abundant in the mammary glands, at low levels in the respiratory tract and at very low levels in the brain. That fits with the description of the illness in cows, Kristensen says, which affects milk production but doesn’t seem to make most cows very sick. It’s still unclear how an infection gets to the udder. It’s possible the virus enters through the teat via contaminated milking machines. But none of the receptors are present in the ducts leading up to the milk-producing glands, Kristensen says. The virus might get to the mammary glands through the blood, but so far there are no reports of the virus in cows’ blood, she says. “These are just preliminary results,” Kristensen says, “but still important, because right now we really [don’t] know very much about cattle and influenza viruses.” Questions or comments on this article?

Vásquez/AP Reluctance among dairy farmers to report H5N1 bird flu outbreaks within their herds or allow testing of their workers has made it difficult to keep up with the virus’s rapid spread, prompting federal public health officials to look to wastewater to help fill in the gaps. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to unveil a public dashboard tracking influenza A viruses in sewage that the agency is collecting from 600 wastewater treatment sites around the country.advertisement The testing is not H5N1-specific; H5N1 belongs to the large influenza A family of viruses, as do two of the viruses that regularly sicken people during flu season. But flu viruses that cause human disease circulate at very low levels during the summer months. So the presence of high levels of influenza A in wastewater from now through the end of the summer could be a reliable indicator that something unusual is going on in a particular area. Wastewater monitoring, at least at this stage, cannot discern the sources — be they from dairy cattle, run-off from dairy processors, or human infections — of any viral genetic fragments found in sewage, although the agency is working on having more capability to do so in the future.

Privacy Policy CDC wastewater team lead Amy Kirby told STAT that starting around late March or early April, some wastewater collection sites started to notice unusual increases in influenza A virus in their samplings. Those readings stood out because by the last week of March, data the CDC tracks on the percentage of people seeking medical care for influenza-like illnesses suggested that the 2023-2024 flu season was effectively over.advertisement The increases were very site-specific, she said, and were not reflected in other areas. In fact, she called it “a very limited phenomenon. … The vast majority of our sites are not seeing this.” To date there has been little information in the public sphere about where infected cattle herds have been located. When the U.S. Department of Agriculture announces positive test results, it merely names the state in which the herd was located when the testing took place. Last week, the USDA reported that six additional herds — in Michigan, Idaho, and Colorado — had tested positive for H5N1, bringing the total to 42. Related: Bird flu keeps rewriting the textbooks. It’s why scientists are unsettled by the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak A dashboard that shows high influenza A readings down to the level of individual wastewater operations will give a much more detailed picture of where transmission of the virus is currently happening — potentially drawing attention to dairy farms in those areas. Kirby admitted those concerns have been raised, and said the presence of the virus in wastewater will not necessarily mean there is an infected herd nearby. “What I will say is we have learned that animal operations and livestock, particularly dairy, is far more mobile than we anticipated. So, cows moving around from farm to farm, but also milk moving around,” she said. “So just because the dairy processing facility is in a community, doesn’t mean that it’s getting milk from farms nearby.” The CDC has developed a test to specifically detect H5 subtypes of influenza A — as have a number of academic researchers. A project called WastewaterSCAN, led by scientists at Stanford University and Emory University, recently found large amounts of H5N1 viral RNA in archived wastewater samples from three sites in northern Texas. It showed the virus had been present at detectable levels as early as February 25, a full month before the state confirmed its first case of H5N1 in dairy cattle. On Friday, scientists from the Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Texas Health Science Center, and the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute, all in Houston, reported they too had found H5N1 virus in wastewater in nine of 10 Texas cities they checked over a two-month period from March 4 to April 25. They did not specify the cities. Neither group could say with certainty what the source of the virus was, though the Texas authors noted there was no indication of a corresponding spike in human illness in the cities when the virus was detected in wastewater. Both groups reported their findings in preprints, which are scientific reports that have not yet been through a journal’s peer review process. At this time the CDC is not recommending rolling out H5N1-specific tests nationwide, saying it’s not an efficient use of resources given how few sites are showing evidence of significant influenza A activity. In addition to influenza A and B, the CDC is also currently monitoring the nation’s sewage for SARS-CoV-2, mpox, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Related: From sewage to safety: Hospital wastewater surveillance as a beacon for defense against H5N1 bird flu The new dashboard will allow individuals and local public health authorities to check for increases in influenza A in their area and compare it to historical data. Kirby said the just-finished flu season will serve as a comparator, providing needed context to determine whether what is being seen is abnormal. Readings from the past flu season were divided into percentiles; any places that have wastewater readings positive for influenza A that are at least 80% of what they were during the flu season will be viewed as a signal that needs exploring, she explained. “We are working to understand that signal better, but in the meantime, we want to make sure all of that data is available for any groups that are working on this to have access to it,” Kirby said. “There are so many players here that have valuable input and information. And so they may see things in this data that we don’t see … patterns that we’re not aware of, and we hope that they will reach out and help us.” For now, the CDC is only including data from wastewater treatment sites that were collecting samples during last year’s flu season, starting October 1, 2023. There are currently 230 sites from 34 states that meet that criteria. The first iteration of the dashboard showed that in the week ending May 4, only one location tested positive for concentrations of influenza A in the wastewater that exceeded that 80% threshold. That was Saline County, Kansas, population 54,400. The county was home to just over 18,000 cattle and calves at the end of 2022, according to the USDA’s National Agriculture Statistical Services. A site that spans two Northern California counties, San Francisco and San Mateo, almost reached the threshold, showing a reading for influenza A that was 79% of seasonal activity. Four other counties — Cooke, Tex., La Salle, Ill., Kent, Mich., and Jackson, Mich. — had readings that were close to 55% of what was seen during the flu season. Jonathan Yoder, deputy director of the CDC Division of Infectious Disease Readiness and Innovation, said in an interview Tuesday that local public health officials are closely monitoring those sites for signs of sustained high levels of virus week after week, which could indicate the presence of human-to-human transmission. So far, Yoder said, they haven’t seen evidence of that. At sites where there have been spikes, the levels have gone down almost as quickly as they’ve gone up. “Those are important initial clues,” he said. “But I don’t want to make too much of any particular data point because I think we really do need to know more.” The CDC is still working to figure out how to interpret any elevated levels of flu viruses seen in wastewater that are likely the result of the H5N1 outbreak, acknowledging that the concentration of flu viruses shed in human stool when seasonal influenza is transmitting in a community might be entirely different from what might be seen when a dairy or a processing plant disposes of large volumes of contaminated milk via a community’s sewage system. Trending Now: What can Trump and RFK Jr. actually do on health care? “We did not expect this presentation in dairy cattle where you would have high concentrations of virus in milk. And what we’re working on now and learning very quickly about is all the ways that milk and milk products and milk byproducts and waste can get into wastewater systems,” Kirby said. In addition to speaking with local utility managers to understand all the things that could be flowing into a given sewershed, the CDC is working to develop technological capabilities for ascertaining animal-specific sources of viral genetic material. There has been some work underway over the last decade to use mitochondrial DNA and other molecular markers to measure contributions to wastewater from cows, pigs, cats, geese, deer, humans, and other species. Kirby said it’s still early days for that technology, but something the agency is hoping to be able to deploy in the future. The CDC will report any locations with elevated influenza A wastewater readings to state health departments, and urge them to inform their local counterparts, if they exist, as well as the utilities collecting the wastewater in that location, to try to get a better understanding of where the virus is coming from. Using wastewater to track H5N1 will become less useful when the weather turns cool in the fall and human flu activity picks up again. “We are very much focused on this as an immediate response to the current situation,” Kirby said. “And we’ll be continuing to work through this as the situation evolves — hopefully resolves. But if … we start getting into the seasonal flu season, we’ll have to think about some additional testing to tell those things apart.” This story has been updated with the initial data posted on the CDC wastewater surveillance dashboard on Tuesday, May 14, and comments from agency official Jonathan Yoder.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: The CDC launched an interactive map that shows site-level data for influenza A virus levels in wastewater. Wastewater surveillance does not distinguish by virus subtype and cannot specifically identify H5N1. The CDC was already monitoring wastewater in the United States for influenza A viruses as part of its regular year-round surveillance. Now, the agency has launched an influenza A wastewater online dashboard to help track the potential spread of H5N1 avian influenza, or “bird flu,” which has caused outbreaks among birds and dairy cows. The CDC has added wastewater detection data to its public H5N1 dashboard. Image: CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith H5N1 has been confirmed in more than 9,300 wild birds in all 50 states, nearly 91 million poultry in 48 states and in 46 dairy herds in nine states, in addition to one human case in Texas, according to the CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture. The CDC had not made data on influenza A available as part of its wastewater surveillance dashboard until this week. According to the agency, current methods for monitoring wastewater are able to detect influenza A viruses — including H5N1 — but are not able to distinguish between subtypes, meaning it cannot tell H5N1 from seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 viruses, for example, although those viruses are not circulating widely now that influenza season is over. It also cannot tell if viruses detected in wastewater came from a human or animal source, but the CDC uses the data to determine where novel influenza viruses such as H5N1 may be occurring before investigating further. “Having a dashboard tracking avian influenza would be helpful in knowing how much of the illness is present in different populations and in different areas,” Aaron E. Glatt, MD, MACP, FIDSA, FSHEA, chair of Mount Sinai South Nassau’s department of medicine, told Healio. “It is a rough guide to the spread of avian influenza, and it can help with public decision-making by identifying new areas of spread and whether illness is receding. While a rough tool, it is a potentially helpful new public health measure,” Glatt said. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater has increasingly been used to track the population-level spread of pathogens, including mpox and polio. “[The dashboard] does not have direct implications for individual patients or the general public at this time, but it is a very new and potentially powerful surveillance method for public health officials,” Glatt said.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were more likely to die than those hospitalized with influenza during the fall and winter of 2023-2024, according to an analysis of Veterans Affairs data. Among over 11,000 patients hospitalized for either illness during this past fall and winter, 5.7% of patients with COVID-19 died within 30 days of admission versus 4.24% of patients with influenza, reported Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, of the VA St. Louis Health Care System, and colleagues. After adjusting for variables, the risk of death in people hospitalized for COVID-19 was 35% higher (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10-1.66), the authors detailed in a research letter in JAMA. Al-Aly told MedPage Today that his group was actually surprised by the results. "We pretty much bought into the public narrative and drank the Kool-Aid like everybody, thinking that COVID is no longer [more deadly than the flu], although ... there was no data," he said. "But the verdict is out now, because we've analyzed the data from the 2023-2024 COVID season and clearly COVID mortality is still higher than the flu." Moreover, the authors pointed out that the results of the study should be considered in light of the fact that there were nearly twice as many hospitalizations for COVID-19 compared with the flu for the 2023-2024 season, according to CDC surveillance data. In the study population, over three times the number of people were hospitalized for COVID-19 than for the flu. However, the results did reveal that the risk of mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had fallen when compared to the previous 2022-2023 season. In their 2023 study, using the same database and methods, Al-Aly's group found that in the fall and winter of 2022-2023, COVID was about 60% more deadly than the flu in patients hospitalized for the illnesses. "We should continue to take COVID seriously," Al-Aly emphasized. "I know we're all sick and tired of this pandemic and all of us have pandemic fatigue, but COVID is still more of a threat to health than the flu." Reassuringly, there appeared to be no significant difference in the risk of death among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 before and during the emergence of the JN.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.28), suggesting that JN.1 may not be more severe than other recent variants, they posited. The JN.1 variant became predominant beginning in late December 2023. The study looked at data from VA electronic health records across all 50 states. Researchers identified people admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or influenza between Oct. 1, 2023 and March 27, 2024, along with a positive test 2 days before or up to 10 days after admission. Patients with either illness who were hospitalized for another reason were excluded. The study's cohort included 8,625 participants hospitalized for COVID-19 and 2,647 participants hospitalized for seasonal influenza. After propensity score weighting, the mean age of the two cohorts was about 74 and 95% were male. About 19% were Black and 65% were white. Approximately 47% were infected before the JN.1 variant emerged. Also, of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, about 65% had received three or more shots of a COVID-19 vaccine, but approximately 15% had not received any COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately 44% of the study population had been vaccinated for influenza. Only about 5.3% of people with COVID-19 had been treated with an outpatient antiviral, such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir (Lagevrio), or remdesivir (Veklury). In contrast, 8% of patients hospitalized with the flu had received outpatient oseltamivir (Tamiflu). The authors acknowledged that the VA study population was older and predominantly male, so the results may not be generalizable to other populations. Also, the causes of death were not examined.

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) By Karen KaplanStaff Writer May 15, 2024 8 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print Since the earliest days of the pandemic, health officials have gauged the threat of COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu. At first, it wasn’t even close. People hospitalized in 2020 with the then-novel respiratory disease were five times more likely to die of their illness than were patients who had been hospitalized with influenza during the preceding flu seasons.Immunity from vaccines and past coronavirus infections has helped tame COVID-19 to the point that when researchers compared the mortality rates of hospitalized COVID-19 and seasonal influenza patients during the height of the 2022-23 flu season, they found that the pandemic disease was only 61% more likely to result in death. Advertisement Now the same researchers have analyzed data for the the fall and winter of 2023 and 2024. Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, and his colleagues expected to find that the two respiratory diseases had finally equalized.“There’s a narrative out there that the pandemic is over, that it’s a nothingburger,” Al-Aly said. “We came into this thinking we would do this rematch and find it would be like the flu from now on.”The VA team examined electronic health records of patients treated in Veterans Affairs hospitals in all 50 states between Oct. 1 and March 27. They zeroed in on patients who were admitted because they had fevers, shortness of breath or other symptoms due to either COVID-19 or influenza. (People who were admitted for another reason, such as a heart attack, and were then found to have a coronavirus infection weren’t included in the analysis.) Advertisement The COVID-19 patients were a little older, on average, than the flu patients (73.9 versus 70.2 years old), and they were less likely to be current or former smokers. They were also more likely to have received at least three doses of COVID-19 vaccine and less likely to have shunned the shots altogether. California Older Californians now eligible for another COVID-19 vaccine dose The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that seniors 65 and older get a second dose of the 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccination.March 13, 2024 Yet after Al-Aly and his colleagues accounted for these differences and a host of other factors, they found that 5.7% of the COVID-19 patients died of their disease, compared with 4.2% of the influenza patients. In other words, the risk of death from COVID-19 was still 35% greater than it was for the flu. The findings were published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. Advertisement “There is undeniably an impression out there that [COVID-19] is no longer a major threat to human health,” Al-Aly said. “I think it’s largely driven by opinion and an emotional itch to move beyond the pandemic, to put it all behind us. We want to believe that it’s like the flu, and we did — until we saw the data.”Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases specialist at UC San Francisco, said the study results are right in line with what he sees in his hospital.“COVID continues to make some people in our community very ill and die — even in 2024,” he said. “Although most will not get seriously ill from COVID, for some people it is like 2020 all over again.”That’s particularly true for people who are older, who haven’t received their most recent recommended COVID-19 booster, and who haven’t taken full advantage of antivirals such as Paxlovid. Chin-Hong noted that only 5% of the COVID-19 patients in the study had been treated with antivirals before they were hospitalized. Even if the mortality rates for the COVID-19 and flu patients had been equal, COVID-19 would still be the bigger health threat because it is sending more people to the hospital, Al-Aly said.Between Oct. 1 and the end of March, 75.5 out of every 100,000 Americans had been hospitalized with influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During that same period, the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 122.9 per 100,000 Americans, the CDC says. Advertisement “COVID still carries a higher risk of hospitalization,” Al-Aly said. “And among those hospitalized, more will die as a result.” Politics Mistrust, fights and blood sport: How COVID-19 trauma is shaping the 2024 election Americans want to forget about COVID-19, but fallout from the pandemic is shaping voter attitudes about the nation’s economy and divisive politics heading into a Biden-Trump rematch. May 9, 2024 Yet Al-Aly noted with frustration that while 48% of adults in the U.S. received a flu shot this year, only 21% of adults are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the CDC.Chin-Hong added that more than 95% of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 this past fall and winter had not received the latest booster shot, according to the CDC.Considering all the tools available to prevent hospitalizations and deaths — and especially the fact that they are readily available to patients in the VA system — the 35% relative risk of death from COVID-19 compared with the flu was “surprisingly high,” Chin-Hong said. And it’s not like the flu is a trivial health threat, especially for senior citizens and people who are immunocompromised. It routinely kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, CDC data show. “Influenza is a consequential infection,” Al-Aly said. “Even when COVID becomes equal to the flu, it’s still sobering and significant.” Advertisement The researchers also compared the mortality rates of VA COVID-19 patients before and after Dec. 24, when the Omicron subvariant known as JN.1 became the dominant strain in the United States. The difference was not statistically significant. California There’s a new highly transmissible COVID-19 variant. Could FLiRT lead to a summer uptick? In years past, summer travel and gatherings have spurred surges in coronavirus infections. As immunity wanes for those who received the most recent vaccine, experts urge caution.May 10, 2024 In just the last two weeks, JN.1 appears to have been overtaken by one of its descendants, a subvariant known as KP.2. It’s part of a family of subvariants that’s taken on the nickname “FLiRT,” a moniker that references some of the mutations that have cropped up on the viruses’ spike proteins. So far, there’s no indication that KP.2 is any more dangerous than JN.1, Al-Aly said.“Are the hospitals filling up? No,” he said. “Are ER rooms all over the country flooded with respiratory illness? No.” Nor are there worrying changes in the amount of coronavirus detected in wastewater.“When you look at all these data streams, we’re not seeing ominous signs that KP.2 is something the general public should worry about,” Al-Aly said.It’s also too early to tell whether KP.2 — or whatever comes after it — will finally erase the mortality gap between COVID-19 and the flu, he added.“Maybe when we do a rematch in 2025, that will be the case,” he said.

(Photo by Austin Santaniello on Unsplash)FORT COLLINS, Colo. (THE CONVERSATION) — Colorado has highly pathogenic avian influenza – also known as HPAI or bird flu – on a dairy farm, the ninth state with confirmed cases. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the virus on April 25, 2024, in a herd in northeast Colorado. This farm is one of 35 dairy farms across the U.S. with verified cases of bird flu in cattle as of May 7, 2024, according to the USDA. Bird flu is not new to Colorado. The state experienced an outbreak in poultry that began in 2022. Since then, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has reported that 6.3 million birds in nine commercial flocks and 25 backyard flocks have been affected by the virus. The most recent detection was in February 2024. But this is the first time the disease has made cattle in Colorado sick. I’m a veterinarian and epidemiologist at Colorado State University who focuses on infectious diseases in dairy cows. I spent many years on a USDA incident management team working on multiple cattle and poultry disease outbreaks, and I’m leading the efforts at Colorado State University to study this novel outbreak. The first cases of bird flu in cattle Bird flu was first detected in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas in March 2024. Colorado State University faculty responded to the outbreak by forming a multistate group with state departments of agriculture, the USDA and other universities to gain a better perspective of how this virus is transmitted between farms and among cows. The team is coordinating the sampling and testing of sick and healthy cows on affected farms to understand which animals are shedding the virus, meaning they are more likely to spread the disease, and for how long. We are also working to identify mitigation steps to help control this disease. Our network of animal health specialists is working with dairy producers and informing them of new data on a weekly basis. Detecting bird flu in cattle In February 2024, veterinarians and researchers began testing the blood, urine, feces, milk and nasal swab samples of sick cows. The virus was detected most frequently in raw milk, suggesting the disease may have been spread to other cows during the milking process. More recent laboratory tests have also detected the virus in cows’ nasal secretions for a short time before the virus presents in their raw milk. In late April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and USDA began testing commercial milk samples. To date, authorities have not detected any live virus in these samples. That’s expected because the pasteurization process, which heats milk to at least 161 degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius) for at least 15 seconds, kills the virus. Pasteurization times and temperatures used in the U.S. are designed to kill bacterial pathogens, but they are working against this virus. Raw milk, as its name implies, is not pasteurized. The CDC has linked drinking raw milk to many foodborne illnesses, including E. coli and salmonella. The presence of the virus that causes bird flu, H5N1, is an additional reason for concern. Dairy producers are required to divert abnormal milk and milk from sick cows from the food supply to protect consumers. In addition to milk, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service has tested samples of commercial ground beef from states with sick cows. No virus had been found in beef as of May 1, 2024. Slowing the spread of the disease At this early stage of the outbreak in dairy cows, researchers don’t know exactly how bird flu spreads in cattle, so recommendations to contain it may shift as more is learned. I have seen many infected cows and they look dull and depressed, similar to how humans feel during a viral infection. Many infected cows have signs similar to humans with the flu, such as a fever. Many dairy producers separate sick cows in hospital pens, away from healthy ones, so sick cows can be easily monitored and treated. Since the virus has been found in nasal secretions in early infection, it’s possible the water tanks for the herds’ drinking water could be a source of infection. Farmers should continue to clean these tanks at least weekly – and even more often in hospital pens – as a best practice. Infected cows can recover The good news is that most cows get better. Like a human with the flu, they respond to anti-inflammatory drugs and oral fluids. A small percentage of cows do get secondary bacterial infections and die or are humanely euthanized. Some cows recover from the infection but stop producing milk and are removed from the herd and usually slaughtered for beef. Because the virus is detected most often in milk from sick cows, our team recommends dairy producers continue following best milking practices on the dairy farm, including disinfecting the cow’s teats before and after milking, even healthy cows. Just one case of human conjunctivitis due to bird flu was reported in a Texas dairy farmworker in late March. The worker was likely exposed through direct contact with milk from an infected cow or from rubbing their eyes with their hands or gloves that had come in contact with contaminated milk. The CDC recommends farmworkers wear personal protective equipment, including eye protection, when in direct or close physical contact with raw milk. How dairy producers can protect herds Viruses can end up on farms through the movement of cattle, people, vehicles, equipment and wild birds. The U.S. dairy industry has a Secure Milk Supply Plan that addresses foreign and emerging dairy cattle diseases like bird flu. The plan calls for increased biosecurity practices on farms during disease outbreaks. Biosecurity practices include limiting cattle movement on and off farms, allowing only required personnel access to cattle, preventing vehicles and equipment from other farms from entering cattle areas, and cleaning and disinfecting vehicles entering and leaving dairy farms. Following these practices should greatly reduce the opportunity for the virus to enter new herds. Birds also carry the virus. They are more difficult to control because of their easy access to feed and water on dairy farms. State and federal fish and game departments and wildlife agencies work with farmers to reduce the risk of diseases spread by wild birds. These include programs to limit the number of birds attracted to dairy farms while respecting rules protecting these species. Producers who observe cows with clinical signs of bird flu should let their veterinarians know so that proper testing can be done to confirm the presence of bird flu. If a test result is positive, the lab that conducts the test must report it to the USDA. As USDA and affected states continue to track the disease, an accurate estimate of affected farms will allow investigators to determine how the virus is spreading from farm to farm – and if we are making progress in containing it. –Jason Lombard Colorado State University The Conversation Spread the word RECOMMENDED ARTICLES USDA Launches Voluntary H5N1 Dairy Herd Status Pilot ProgramJune 02, 2024WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it is taking several additional actions to ensure the health and viability of the nation’s livestock and poultry.

Bird flu is now infecting cows, the FDA found viral genetic material in milk, and a second human was recently infected.H5N1 — the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza circulating — currently poses little threat to people as spillover from animals to humans is rare, as is human-to-human transmission. But the recent spillover from birds to cows has triggered new fears that the virus could potentially mutate and cause a deadly human pandemic.Should you be worried about bird flu? Vox offers clarity. @vox Should you be worried about bird flu? Our staff writer, Kenny Torrella, explains what you need to know. #birdflu #birdsoftiktok #avianflu #avianbirdflu #birdfluoutbreak #health ♬ Dance You Outta My Head - Cat Janice Check out the rest of our bird flu coverage here.In the past two years, more than 90 million poultry birds from 48 US states have died from the virus or were killed in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease. (Wild birds and some mammals including sea lions and cats have gotten sick, too.)Historically, farmers and poultry producers have used three main strategies to slow the spread: kill entire flocks of chickens and turkeys at the earliest sign of infection, surveil the movement of the virus, and improve biosecurity measures. This approach, sometimes referred to as “stamping out,” has thus far failed to curb bird flu and has raised concerns around animal cruelty. But as the virus continues to spread among livestock animals such as cows, relying on mass culling may not be as tenable.“This virus is not going away,” said Carol Cardona, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “And I’m not sure how sustainable this approach that we’re using is.” Given the record-shattering infection rates among poultry and the unprecedented recent spillover to a wide range of other species, some bird flu experts and wildlife researchers are calling for renewed efforts to develop, test, and deploy a vaccine for poultry and potentially other species. Short of triggering a human pandemic, continued spread of bird flu among livestock could further threaten national and global food security. “The current virus is being spread by wild birds. It is evident that the biosecurity arrangements on some farms, especially chicken layer and turkey farms, are not sufficient to prevent all virus incursions,” said Leslie Sims, the director of the Asia Pacific Veterinary Information Services. “Vaccination, if used, would add an additional layer of protection.” Effective bird flu vaccines for poultry have existed for years and are even used routinely in other countries. But, in stark contrast to the Covid-19 pandemic when new vaccines were rapidly developed and rolled out, the US has yet to adopt vaccination as a disease control strategy for bird flu. The US Department of Agriculture reported promising results from clinical trials of several vaccine candidates, but despite this breakthrough, a slew of logistical, political, and economic challenges might prohibit their use.A brief history of bird flu vaccinesAvian influenza vaccines have long been used around the world with varying degrees of success. In some countries, such as Egypt and China where bird flu is enzootic (meaning it is consistently present in animals), vaccination is routine. In China, several vaccines have been developed. One study found that vaccinating against H5 and H7 subtypes reduced the number of cases in poultry, but another study pointed out that China continues to suffer recurrent outbreaks while others have suggested that culling would be a more cost-effective strategy. In Egypt, vaccination efforts have largely been unsuccessful, in part because it is the only disease control method used in the country.Last year, Mexico, Guatemala, and other countries hit hard by the ongoing epidemic also started vaccinating against H5N1. In late 2022, Mexico began vaccinating broiler chickens and other birds in high-risk zones; almost one year later, the government declared the country free of influenza before reporting an outbreak in one flock on a commercial farm about a month later. Only in the past year did some Western countries begin focusing on vaccination. In March 2023, the Dutch government announced that it had developed two bird flu vaccines and that laboratory trials revealed those vaccines to be effective at preventing infection and disease transmission. Italy and the Netherlands are also testing vaccines. In October, the French government started vaccinating ducks for avian influenza and has since vaccinated more than 21 million. According to a press release from France’s Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty, there have been only 10 outbreaks since vaccination began compared to 315 outbreaks during the same time in the previous year. (The EU is dividing research among member states.)“Vaccination has played a very important role in the prevention of avian influenza elsewhere,” Sims said, adding that widespread preventive vaccination has also been used successfully in Hong Kong since 2003. In both France and Hong Kong, “the decision was taken to vaccinate because existing strengthened measures based around biosecurity could not prevent all cases of infection,” Sims explained.Scientific, economic, and logistical challenges of mass bird flu vaccinationThe US government has at least considered vaccination before. During the 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak when more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died or were culled, the USDA stockpiled a bird flu vaccine. However, those vaccines were not deployed; the epidemic was instead brought under control through the stamping-out approach. Following that outbreak, the USDA developed policies and guidance regarding the use of bird flu vaccines. A 2016 policy brief stated that controlled vaccination for flocks at risk should be included in a multi-prong control strategy alongside enhanced biosecurity, an eradication plan, monitoring, and a repopulation plan. In a 2016 report, the USDA reported that the stockpiled vaccine wasn’t “well matched” to then-circulating strains. Like influenza in humans, bird flu is a quickly evolving virus. Ensuring that a vaccine is highly effective against H5N1 is the first critical step in a successful vaccination campaign. In 2023, the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service began testing five vaccine candidates. According to the USDA’s website, studies show the candidates provided near 100 percent clinical protection in chickens. (The USDA has also started to “assess the potential to develop” an H5N1 vaccine for cows.) The USDA has not released further information about the clinical trials. However, despite seemingly having an effective vaccine in hand, as of late April, the USDA is still not pursuing bird flu vaccination as a disease control strategy. “While USDA is exploring the possibility of developing a poultry H5N1 vaccine to stock and use in an emergency, we are not moving forward with a HPAI vaccination program at this time,” a USDA spokesperson told Vox. Given the scale of the ongoing outbreak, some experts feel that the lack of a vaccine push from the USDA is hamstringing disease control efforts. “I’m a poultry veterinarian, and as a veterinarian, I don’t like the idea that you tell me to go fight the biggest fight of my career and you say, here’s your gun; first, let’s unload it. Now, go,” said Cardona. “A vaccine is simply a tool, and how we use it can be very effective.”The USDA and industry stakeholders have cited a slew of various challenges that would hinder vaccination. The biggest sticking point is around trade. The US exported more than $5 billion in poultry meat and products on average every year for the past three years. The USDA enters into trade agreements with each individual country it trades with, explained Upali Galketi Aratchilage, a senior economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Each agreement outlines specific biosafety and production requirements that both countries agree to follow. The USDA said, in an email to Vox, that many of those agreements do not allow bird flu vaccination. “For now, biosecurity is the best defense against HPAI,” a USDA spokesperson wrote. One main reason is the potential to import infected poultry. Vaccination does not prevent infection; it prevents severe disease and death by priming the immune system to better squash pathogens upon infection. By preventing overt flu symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, or reduced egg production, infected birds might then inadvertently enter the food chain. Importing an infected bird could set off new outbreaks, threatening the local supply chain. But, Cardona explained, the industry no longer relies on diagnosing sick poultry based on visible signs and symptoms but on strict protocols that utilize molecular testing. Take eggs, for example. Before eggs can enter the food chain, the hens that laid the eggs are tested twice for influenza. Farmers collect samples from the hens the day they lay the eggs and then two days later (the virus spreads so fast that it could be detected in that time). The samples that are collected undergo molecular testing, meaning that scientists look for the genetic fingerprints of the virus in the samples which would be found even in asymptomatic chickens. Not every single hen can be tested, but a random and representative selection is tested each time. “Markets have been negotiated based on not using vaccination ... based on, frankly, older data [that] there could be a chance that you would import the virus in an animal or in a product that has vaccine in it,” Cardona said. Another concern is differentiating infected from vaccinated animals, the so-called “DIVA” problem. It’s the challenge of identifying whether a bird is actually sick or just has antibodies after vaccination, as Kenny Torrella has previously explained. Again, this seems like an outdated concern as newer technology is capable of differentiating between animals infected with flu versus those that received the vaccine.Then there’s the logistical challenge that the USDA and other stakeholders cite. The vaccines currently undergoing trials “continue to rely on a two-dose regimen, which can be impractical for distribution to flocks,” the USDA website states. This hurdle does not seem insurmountable, the experts Vox spoke with said, since poultry already receive several vaccines such as those for Newcastle disease, salmonella, and bronchitis. Some vaccines are given through the poultry’s water supply or sprayed in the air. There is even a method where the vaccine is poked through the eggshell and injected into a chicken embryo during development at the hatchery. Even with biological, technological, and logistical hurdles surpassed, the decision around vaccination seems to be a monetary one. Beyond the cost of vaccination, there’s the potential of losing key trade partners. Trade agreements, especially for meat, are notoriously delicate, in part because of the risk of introducing infectious diseases and pests into a country’s food chain but more so because governments need to protect the agricultural industry from foreign competition. The National Chicken Council is opposed to vaccination efforts. The National Turkey Federation says unilateral vaccination “would have a severe impact on exports” but that it has urged — and continues to urge — the federal government to “move as rapidly as possible to try to develop new agreements” with trading partners.“Meat is a highly politically sensitive issue for many countries, and the entire livestock industry is protected in many countries for various reasons,” said Aratchilage. Introducing bird flu vaccines is not going to be easy, he added. “It’s a political decision more than a scientific decision.” You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Birds and cattle frequently interact, as in this photo from a farm in Mexico. DarioGaona/E+/Getty Images Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Tina Hesman Saey May 16, 2024 at 11:00 am Updated May 22, 2024 at 7:37 pm A flurry of reports about the genetics of the bird flu currently infecting U.S. cattle are offering insight into how the virus has and continues to spread. Since it first emerged in late 2020, this particular type of bird flu has infected a dizzying array of bird species, about 20 mammal species and some people (SN: 3/6/23; SN: 4/3/24). But transmission from cow to cow and from cow to person and other animals is new. Now researchers tracing the family tree of the H5N1 avian influenza virus say that the outbreak in cattle, first reported in late March, probably started in late December 2023 (SN: 4/25/24). Cases of low milk production — a symptom of infection in dairy cows — in the Texas panhandle were reported in late January and early February. The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the H5N1 diagnosis on March 25. Tell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now Since then, the virus has spread to dairy cows in at least nine U.S. states. Dairy farm workers in Texas and Michigan got eye infections, presumably from contact with sick cows. And genetic remains of the virus have been found in grocery store milk, suggesting the outbreak is widespread. Mia Kim Torchetti, a veterinarian who directs the USDA’s Diagnostic Virology Laboratory at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, says she had hoped this incursion could be stamped out quickly, but as detections in birds and mammals pile up, “I have rapidly lost hope.” Though all public health agencies consider the risk of the bird flu spreading widely in people to be low, the outbreak is still reminiscent of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that case too, researchers had used genetic analyses to determine that the outbreak had started long before cases were recognized (SN: 1/29/20). And as with COVID, preliminary data are coming out in press releases and preprints without first going through peer review. That doesn’t mean the results aren’t trustworthy, but it does suggest we are in the early days and conclusions may change. The early data also point to myriad versions of influenza viruses preceding the cattle outbreak, just as many waves of SARS-CoV-2 variants caused peak after peak of COVID cases. We often call the avian influenza virus currently infecting cattle by its nickname, H5N1 bird flu. But its full name is “highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13.” That specificity denotes the virus’ place in its family tree. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses — which are deadly to chickens and related birds — are a huge family tree of bird flu viruses. They all have the H5 form of hemagglutinin, a protein that latches onto host cells so the virus can infect them. The first highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus was found in 1996. Since then, scientists have documented the tree’s expansion, with some limbs dying off and others making it big. One successful limb of the tree is clade 2.3.4.4b. It has sprouted branches of its own, including genotype B3.13. Various H5N1s have winged their way around the world after infecting wild birds. A different version crossed the Atlantic in 2014 and caused an outbreak in North American poultry in 2015, but it didn’t take hold, Torchetti says. This time is different. There are many varieties of avian influenza A H5N1 (gold in this electron microscope image growing on cells, green, in a lab dish). The branch of the family tree fueling the outbreak in dairy cattle sprouted in Europe in 2020.CDC; Courtesy of Cynthia Goldsmith, Jacqueline Katz, Sherif R. Zaki Clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have been infecting poultry and wild birds for several years. But the limb of the tree we’re dealing with now — H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b — emerged in Europe in October 2020 when two bird flu viruses swapped parts. It came to the Americas in 2021. It has killed more than 90 million birds in the United States since January 2022, including wild birds and commercial poultry and backyard and hobbyist flocks that were culled when the virus was detected. How the current bird flu emerged Sponsor Message Influenza viruses are all about the swap meet. Instead of one long novel, the genetic instruction books of influenza A viruses are more like a series of eight novellas, known as gene segments. Each segment carries one or more of the 11 genes that the virus needs to infect host cells and copy itself. When people, birds or other animals are simultaneously infected with more than one type of influenza virus, the viruses may exchange segments and thus create a new type of virus. This process — called reassortment — has resulted in pandemic strains of flu, including the 1918 influenza pandemic and 2009’s swine flu (SN: 5/22/09). Viruses can’t swap parts willy-nilly. Not all combinations are compatible with each other. But what’s unusual about this clade of H5N1s is that it undergoes reassortment far more often than earlier relatives, Torchetti says. In wild birds in the Americas, “this interchange of genes has been occurring for the last almost 24 months” among H5N1 and other bird flus, says Rafael Medina, a virologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. Torchetti and colleagues have found more than 100 genotypes in clade 2.3.4.4b, mostly generated by reassortment. About 20 of those genotypes managed to spread among wild birds, poultry and the occasional other wild animal, the researchers reported May 1 in a preprint posted at bioRxiv.org. One such reassortment happened shortly before the start of the cattle outbreak, scientists reported May 3 at Virological.org. Genotype B3.13 is a mix of four gene segments from the H5N1 that arrived from Europe in 2021 and four gene segments from a low pathogenicity bird flu from North America. (Low pathogenicity viruses aren’t usually deadly and may not produce any symptoms in infected birds.) It shows up relatively rarely among the viruses sampled in birds, Torchetti says. “The B3.13 genotype is actually not common. The cattle have made it common.” In fact, if predicting which virus might spillover into cattle based on prevalence in wild birds, “this one was a little bit of an underdog,” she says. All the dairy cattle that have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu have this genotype, suggesting that the virus made the leap from birds to cows just one time. That probably happened in Texas toward the end of last year, Torchetti and colleagues as well as the team posting to Virological.org conclude. Of the four gene segments the B3.13 genotype picked up, one produces an enzyme that helps copy the virus and the other makes a protein that encases the virus’ RNA. “These specific gene segments have a role in the efficiency of virus replication,” but scientists don’t yet know whether that swap or other changes allowed the virus to more easily infect cattle or grow in mammalian cells, says Tavis Anderson, a research biologist at the USDA Agricultural Research Service’s National Animal Disease Center in Ames. With COVID-19 variants, specific genetic changes led to new properties of the virus that made it more contagious or helped it evade the immune system (SN: 12/16/21; SN: 3/1/22). But there’s no obvious indicator of that happening with the H5N1 currently spreading, Anderson says. In other words, B3.13 has been successful at replicating in cattle, but that may be more happenstance than thanks to any special properties of the virus. What we know about the virus’ spread No one knows exactly where, when and how the virus passed from wild birds into cattle. Cows may have grazed on grass that wild birds carrying the virus pooped on, or the cows may have picked it up through contaminated feed or other livestock-bird interactions, Medina says. “It’s present at such a high levels in nature [that] the potential of spilling over into domestic animals is something that shouldn’t surprise us anymore,” he adds. Once in cows, the virus started spreading from cow to cow. There’s now concern that cows could serve as mixing vessels for new varieties, much the way that pigs have been crucibles for the reassortment of avian, human and swine influenza viruses (SN: 5/14/24; SN: 2/12/10). USDA monitors influenza viruses in domestic swine and wild hogs but hasn’t detected any H5 viruses in those animals, Anderson says. Genetic signals suggest that cattle carrying the virus spread it from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. There’s also a genetic link suggesting that the cows from Michigan spread the virus to North Carolina, but the USDA researchers have found no record of cows moving between those states. More likely, these researchers say, cows that were moved from Texas to North Carolina spread the virus there. Confirmed cow cases Genetic analyses and shipment records confirm that H5N1 bird flu spread from Texas to other U.S. states, probably when infected dairy cattle with no symptoms were moved from state to state. The virus has been detected in nine states. States with confirmed cases of H5N1 in cattle USDA Since getting into cattle, the virus has jumped into other species including cats in Kansas and Texas that drank infected raw milk. More than half of infected cats from one north Texas dairy died within a few days of having the milk, probably because the virus went to the cats’ brains and nervous systems, researchers reported April 29 in Emerging Infectious Diseases. The B3.13 genotype virus has also spilled from cows to raccoons, poultry and wild birds including blackbirds and grackle, researchers said in the Virological.org report. There were as many as five spillbacks from cattle to poultry and three from cows to wild birds, Torchetti and colleagues found. More spillbacks create more possibilities for swapping gene segments and thus more opportunities for a lethal or transmissible virus to emerge, possibly even one that could spread in people. Though agencies agree that risk to people is low, they have warned that human cases from exposure to an infected animal should be expected to pop up from time to time. And though there may be limited spread between people, such as family members, experts don’t expect the virus as is to spread easily from person to person. On May 22, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention reported finding the virus in an eye swab from worker at dairy farm in Michigan where cows were infected with H5N1. The Texas dairy farm worker who got an H5N1 eye infection was carrying a slightly different but closely related version of B3.13 from the one found in cows, researchers from the CDC and colleagues reported May 3 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The person had contact with some dairy cows showing signs of H5N1 infection that were similar to symptoms in cattle at nearby farms with confirmed cases. A veterinarian who works at multiple dairies in the Texas panhandle encouraged the worker to get tested for H5N1. They went to a Texas Department of Health field site but didn’t reveal where they worked. The worker is one of 13 people worldwide confirmed to have been infected with a clade 2.3.4.4b virus, and the only one thought to have been infected by a mammal. Some, including the dairy farm worker and a poultry farm worker diagnosed in 2022, have had no symptoms or mild ones. Others have developed severe or critical illnesses. One person in China died in 2022. The dairy farm worker got an antiviral medication called oseltamivir and has fully recovered. A close look at the genetic makeup of the virus that infected the Texas dairy farm worker revealed that it carried a mutation in a gene known to help the virus replicate better in mammalian cells. But without samples from cattle or other people on the farm, researchers have little information about the evolution of the virus in cattle and whether it can pass from person to person. It’s possible that the worker’s virus is a slightly earlier version of the one from cows, the CDC researchers say. That suggests that after first jumping from a wild bird into a cow, the virus spread more widely in cattle than previously thought. One twig of the B3.13 branch moved from Texas to other states. That’s the one that has been identified in cows and milk. Meanwhile, close cousins may have continued to quietly infect cows including ones at the worker’s farm. Let’s hope any callbacks to the early days of 2020 will end here. New regulations that went into effect April 29 governing the movement of dairy cattle and other measures may help contain the virus’ spread in cattle. So far, it hasn’t turned up in the 30 samples of ground beef the USDA has tested. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found traces of the virus’ RNA in milk and dairy products from 15 states, but did not detect any live virus. A wider outbreak in cattle might allow the virus to adapt to spread easily in mammals, including humans. One big thing coronavirus taught us is to never underestimate a virus, especially one that can change quickly. Questions or comments on this article?

What should I expect if my herd became infected? This case report describes what one farmer has faced since herd infection began. Please note: This story and publish date have been updated to reflect additional information. The original version was posted on May 17, 2024. May 1, 2024 marked day one of the onset of an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) on one dairy farm in Michigan. The farmer, recognizing the potential benefit to other farmers, willingly shared this information and agreed to have official testing of his herd. This report is what was known and reported on day 15 of the HPAI infection in a herd of approximately 500 lactating cows. Prior to infection, the average cow production on this farm ranged from 95 to 100 lbs. per day. Initial symptoms were detected with the SmaXtec monitoring boluses that they currently have in about 90% of lactating cows. The onset was manifested by a spike in body temperature of 4 to 5 degrees above normal, followed by a decrease in rumination 6 hours later. The decrease of rumination in infected cows was severe with almost no activity occurring. The temperature elevation lasted about two days, and there was a sharp drop in water intake by infected cows from 40-50 gallons to 5–10 gallons. per day. These conditions resulted in severe dehydration in cows. The farm took an aggressive approach to supportive therapy, administering aspirin boluses twice a day to reduce temperature and inflammation. Additionally they provided Vitamin B and a rumen yeast capsule for a minimum of three days. For cows that refused to drink, they administered hypertonic saline IV. They tried IV Banamine on a limited number of cows but did not see any positive impact. Their goal is to make the cows as comfortable as possible. It began in a barn with two pens of cattle that had three water fountains, the center one being shared. They wanted to try to confine the disease to a single group or at least a single barn. They changed their wash cycle in milking so that it washed after this group of cows. Regardless of their efforts, HPAI spread to all groups of lactating cattle on the farm. For the first nine days, milk production per cow only decreased by about 5 lbs. and the farm was optimistic they had beaten back the disease. However, by day 12 each cow was producing 21 lbs. less than average, accompanied by a doubling of somatic cell count to 180,000 c/ml. Cows were dehydrated with sunken eyes. Day 15 was the first day that the monitoring report showed fewer cows affected than the day before. Based on the number of cows with elevated temperatures and subtracting out the normal rate, they believe 40% of the lactating herd was infected. The number of cows the farm employees needed to handle in some way had increased sixfold, making the work very labor intensive. Breeding stopped during this time because of the demands of just working with sick cattle. While pregnancy checks have not at this point shown a reduction in conception, multiple late-lactation (150-220-day) cows have aborted their calves, and the farm believes this is due to high body temperatures. The disease primarily affected high-producing, multi-lactation cows and the low group. Transition cows seem to be performing normally at this point. Waste milk is pasteurized before feeding it to calves, and to date, the calves seem to be doing fine. Employees have stayed healthy to date. The farmer encouraged them to wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their face and eyes. All employees were offered safety eyewear or face shields. By day 15, the full impact of the disease has not yet been felt. However, the farmer did some cost estimations. He has spent $5,000 – $7,500 in extra medical supplies. Even though the costs of these common medications are low, the volume needed has been quite high. There has been the loss of milk, loss of quality premium, increased labor and loss of a few pregnancies resulting in culling animals. He estimates the cost for this herd of approximately 500 cows at $30,000 – $40,000. By day 24, the farmer said that some cows—approximately 10% that became infected—have not recovered rumen activity. It is likely that these cows will be culled because they are not regaining weight and health. It appears that there are some individual cows that have a “long” form of the disease. The owner of the farm in this case report understands that this does not include the potential longer-term costs. Another farmer said that some herds are seeing symptoms for four to six weeks. Additional negative impacts include increased culls of animals that do not recover significantly and increased weight gain of late lactation cows that recover feed intake but not milk output. “It has been a lot of work, stressful on the cows and frankly overwhelming,” the farmer said. He shared that the monitoring system they have in place has enabled them to get a head start on supporting the health of infected cattle that show milk loss which begins two days after temperature elevation is detected. Therefore, they initiated therapy before milk loss occurred. The monitoring has also enabled him to evaluate the impact of supportive therapy and recovery by animals. This farmer reported the disease to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD). He believes it is important for the industry to understand the disease. He knows that his is not the only farm to get HPAI and hopes that the more we can learn from his experience, the better we can prevent more herd infections, reduce the impact and potentially be better prepared against other diseases. Michigan State University Extension is a leader in working with this and other farms regarding HPAI for the benefit of the dairy industry and provides resources at our animal agriculture and avian influenza websites.

There are three types of seasonal influenza viruses – A, B and C. Influenza A viruses are further categorised into subtypes, and influenza B into lineages. The 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (hereafter referred to as influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) which appeared for the first time in 2009 causing a global influenza pandemic, is now a seasonal influenza virus that co-circulates with other seasonal viruses (namely influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses). Influenza viruses are genetically dynamic and evolve in unpredictable ways. Influenza viruses are further classified based upon antigenic properties. Humoral immunity to influenza viruses is generally thought to be strainspecific and acquired through infection and/or vaccination. Seasonal influenza epidemics can be caused by evolving virus strains that are antigenically distinct from previously circulating virus strains to which a population has some immunity; this is known as antigenic drift. Uncommonly, a completely new strain of influenza will emerge to which there is little or no existing immunity, this is known as antigenic shift and such novel strains can give rise to influenza pandemics. Influenza viruses are spread from person-to-person. They can be transmitted by exposure to infectious droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing that are then inhaled by others, or can contaminate hands or other surfaces. The typical incubation period for influenza is 1-4 days. Most persons ill with influenza shed virus (i.e. may be infectious) from a few days before symptoms begin through 5-7 days after illness onset. However, very young children can be infectious for >10 days after illness onset; adults with severe disease (e.g. viral pneumonia) may also shed virus for >10 days, and severely immunocompromised persons can shed virus for even longer. Children have the highest rates of seasonal influenza infection and illness in this group can amplify viral transmission in the community.

Print As researchers increasingly rely on wastewater testing to monitor the spread of bird flu, some are questioning the reliability of the tests being used. Above, the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant in Playa Del Rey. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times) As health officials turn increasingly toward wastewater testing as a means of tracking the spread of H5N1 bird flu among U.S. dairy herds, some researchers are raising questions about the effectiveness of the sewage assays. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says current testing is standardized and will detect bird flu, some researchers voiced skepticism. “Right now we are using these sort of broad tests” to test for influenza A viruses in wastewater, said epidemiologist Denis Nash, referring to a category of viruses that includes normal human flu and the bird flu that is circulating in dairy cattle, wild birds, and domestic poultry. Advertisement “It’s possible there are some locations around the country where the primers being used in these tests ... might not work for H5N1,” said Nash, distinguished professor of epidemiology and executive director of City University of New York’s Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health. Climate & Environment What you need to know about the bird flu outbreak, concerns about raw milk, and more Answering the basics on Bird Flu 2024May 15, 2024 The reason for this is that the tests most commonly used — polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests — are designed to detect genetic material from a specific organism, such as a flu virus.But in order for them to identify the virus, they must be “primed” to know what they are looking for. Depending on what part of the virus researchers are looking for, they may not identify the bird flu subtype.There are two common human influenza A viruses: H1N1 and H3N2. The “H” stands for hemagglutinin, which is an identifiable protein in the virus. The “N” stands for neuraminidase. The bird flu, on the other hand, is also an influenza A virus. But it has the subtype H5N1.That means that while the human and avian flu virus share the N1 signal, they don’t share an H. Advertisement If a test is designed to look for only the H1 and H3 as indicators of influenza A virus, they’re going to miss the bird flu. Marc Johnson, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Missouri, said he doesn’t think that’s too likely. He said the generic panels that most labs use will capture H1, H3 and H5. He said while his lab specifically looks for H1 and H3, “I think we may be the only ones doing that.” It’s been just in the last few years that health officials have started using wastewater as a sentinel for community health. Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and principal investigator and program director for WastewaterSCAN, said wastewater surveillance really got going during the pandemic. It’s become a routine way to look for hundreds if not thousands of viruses and other pathogens in municipal wastewater.“Three years or four years ago, no one was doing it,” said Boehm, who collaborates with a network of researchers at labs at Stanford, Emory University and Verily, Alphabet Inc.’s life sciences research organization. “It sort of evolved in response to the pandemic and has continued to evolve.” Advertisement Since late March, when the bird flu was first reported in Texas dairy cattle, researchers and public health officials have been combing through wastewater samples. Most are using the influenza A tests they had already built into their systems — most of which were designed to detect human flu viruses, not bird flu. Climate & Environment Flu season is over, but there is a viral surge in California wastewater. Is it avian flu? Samples from wastewater plants across the nation show an increase in multiple flu viruses. Some experts worry that H5N1 bird flu might be to blame. May 13, 2024 On Tuesday, the CDC released its own dashboard showing wastewater sites where it has detected influenza A in the last two weeks.Displaying a network of more than 650 sites across the nation, there were only three sites — in Florida, Illinois and Kansas — where levels of influenza A were considered high enough to warrant further agency investigation. There were more than 400 where data were insufficient to allow a determination.Jonathan Yoder, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of Infectious Disease Readiness and Innovation, said those sites were deemed to have insufficient data because testing hasn’t been in place long enough, or there may not have been enough positive influenza A samples to include.Asked if some of the tests being used could miss bird flu because of the way they were designed, he said: “We don’t have any evidence of that. It does seem like we’re at at a broad enough level that we don’t have any evidence that we would not pick up H5.”He also said the tests were standardized across the network.“I’m pretty sure that it’s the same assay being used at all the sites,” he said. “They’re all based on ... what the CDC has published as a clinical assay for for influenza A, so it’s based on clinical tests.” Advertisement But there are discrepancies between the CDC’s findings and others’.Earlier this week, a team of scientists from Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute and the El Paso Water Utility, published a report showing high levels of bird flu from wastewater in nine Texas cities. Their data show that H5N1 is the dominant form of influenza A swirling in these Texas towns’ wastewater.But unlike other research teams, including the CDC, they used an “agnostic” approach known as hybrid-capture sequencing.“So it’s not just targeting one virus or one of several viruses,” as one does with PCR testing, said Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and a member of the Texas team. “We’re actually in a very complex mixture, which is wastewater, pulling down viruses and sequencing them.”“What’s critical here is it’s very specific to H5N1,” he said, noting they’d been doing this kind of testing for approximately two years, and hadn’t ever seen H5N1 before the middle of March.Blake Hanson, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health and a member of the Texas wastewater team, agreed, saying that PCR-based methods are “exquisite” and “highly accurate.” “But we have the ability to look at the representation of the entire genome, not just a marker component of it. And so that has allowed us to look at H5N1, differentiate it from some of our seasonal fluids like H1N1 and H3N2,” he said. “It’s what gave us high confidence that it is entirely H5N1, whereas the other papers are using a part of the H5 gene as a marker for H5.” Advertisement Boerwinkle and Hanson underscored that while they could identify H5N1 in the wastewater, they cannot tell where it came from.“Texas is really a confluence of a couple of different flyways for migratory birds, and Texas is also an agricultural state, despite having quite large cities,” Boerwinkle said. “It’s probably correct that if you had to put your dime and gamble what was happening, it’s probably coming from not just one source but from multiple sources. We have no reason to think that one source is more likely any one of those things.” But they are pretty confident it’s not coming from people.“Because we are looking at the entirety of the genome, when we look at the single human H5N1 case, the genomic sequence ... has a hallmark amino acid change ... compared to all of the cattle from that same time point,” Hanson said. “We do not see that hallmark amino acid present in any of our sequencing data. And we’ve looked very carefully for that, which gives us some confidence that we’re not seeing human-human transmission.”The Texas’ team approach was really exciting, said Devabhaktuni Srikrishna, the CEO and founder of PatientKnowHow.com, noting it exhibited “proof of principle” for employing this kind of metagenomic testing protocol for wastewater and air.He said government agencies, private companies and academics have been searching for a reliable way to test for thousands of microscopic organisms — such as pathogens — quickly, reliably and at low cost.“They showed it can be done,” he said.

Local News Texas Tech confirms first avian influenza case from cow to human by: Urijah Jaushlin Posted: May 13, 2024 / 03:09 PM CDT Updated: May 13, 2024 / 05:52 PM CDT by: Urijah Jaushlin Posted: May 13, 2024 / 03:09 PM CDT Updated: May 13, 2024 / 05:52 PM CDT SHARE LUBBOCK, Texas– On Monday afternoon, Texas Tech researchers confirmed the first case of avian influenza from cow to human. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine said in March a farm workers who was in contact with dairy cattle began showing symptoms and later samples collected by scientists tested positive for influenza A. Free Skin Cancer Screening Day hosted by Texas Tech Physicians Dermatology on Saturday Texas Tech University’s Biological Threat Research Laboratory played a huge part in confirming the case. Read the full Texas Tech press release here for more information: Texas Tech University’s Biological Threat Research Laboratory (BTRL) played a key role in detecting the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) transmitted from a mammal (dairy cow) to a human. The case was made public in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Steve Presley, the director of The Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH) and the BTRL, and Cynthia Reinoso Webb, the biological threat coordinator at TIEHH, were co-authors on the journal publication. The journal article explains that in March a farm worker who reported no contact with sick or dead birds, but who was in contact with dairy cattle, began showing symptoms in the eye and samples were collected by the regional health department to test for potential influenza A. Initial testing of the samples was performed at the BTRL, which is a component of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory Response Network-Biological (LRN-B) located at TIEHH. “It’s a huge thing that the virus has jumped from birds to mammals, dairy cows in this case, and then to humans,” Presley said. “That’s why this paper in the New England Journal of Medicine is very significant. It’s going to lay the foundation, I believe, for a lot of research in the future of how the virus is evolving.” The involvement of Texas Tech’s BTRL is a continuation of the partnership between regional, state and federal public health partners. “Being part of the CDC LRN-B, we have the standing capability to test for a lot of biological threats and some that are considered emergent,” Reinoso Webb explained. The lab’s standby status allowed Reinoso Webb and the Texas Tech BTRL team to respond quickly to the needs of the regional public health authority. Knowing the potential dangers of the virus, Reinoso Webb pushed the testing into the safest laboratory available, and the team went to work. Having received the samples in the early evening, results were being reported to regional, state and federal levels within hours. By the next day the samples were on their way to the CDC for further testing and confirmation. “We were on the phone with the CDC until around midnight discussing different scenarios and follow up requirements,” Reinoso Webb said. “There is a lot of federal reporting. It was a very complicated case, even though it was two samples and one patient. “But we had this wonderful communication with the CDC and made sure we did everything by the book. This is how it’s been structured, and this is how the communication was supposed to happen.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Potter Nigel French Jemma L. Geoghegan Nick Wilson Oz Mansoor Sue Huang Richard Webby Breadcrumb Home The Briefing Potential for an avian influenza pandemic: Time for NZ to ramp up preparedness Share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Download PDF SummaryInfluenza A(H5N1) virus, a major cause of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or ‘bird flu’, is causing concern as it continues to evolve and infect new hosts, notably cattle for the first time. Although this virus is still not adapted for human-to-human transmission, its spread is a warning for Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) to review and enhance our pandemic preparedness. At a minimum, we need to immediately update our pandemic plan to incorporate lessons from past pandemic responses, notably the effective use of public health and social measures (PHSM) to delay entry and circulation of serious pandemic infections. We need to review systems to ensure timely supply of A(H5N1) testing, vaccine, antivirals, and infection prevention and control (IPC) equipment. And strengthen One Health approaches to reduce the risk of influenza emergence and spread in poultry, livestock, wildlife, and humans, along with effective surveillance and early detection and response systems covering these populations.The continuing global spread of influenza A(H5N1) is causing international concern. A(H5N1) virus causes highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with high death rates in chickens and other birds.1 This is the largest influenza panzootic (a pandemic in animals) of HPAI virus ever documented. An increasing number of mammals, most recently cattle, appear to be susceptible hosts for the virus. And a dairy farm worker was infected, the first known case of this virus jumping to humans from another mammal.2 3 This Briefing provides a high-level risk assessment of the current A(H5N1) panzootic and comments on needed risk-management measures.Risk assessment of influenza A(H5N1)Influenza is considered the world’s most likely pandemic threat, for good reason (see Appendix for background).General principles of pandemic risk assessment are based on key attributes of the emerging threat, notably its infectiousness, severity, controllability, and the certainty of knowledge and stability of the threat in question.4 A(H5N1) viruses are not currently being transmitted between people. It is still in the category of an uncommon ‘spillover’ infection, where people in close contact with infected birds and mammals become infected.5 (see Figure). Severity varies, but the overall case fatality risk is high.6 A(H5N1) virus infection in birds is relatively well characterised, based on more than two decades of research. However, it is uncertain how it may evolve and adapt to other hosts, including humans.7 Preliminary genomic evidence from the ongoing dairy cattle infections in the United States supports a single bird-to-dairy cattle transmission event with subsequent spread between cattle.8 Despite potentially widespread transmission between dairy cows, the virus currently retains characteristics that are more avian virus-like than mammalian virus-like.7 The virus isolated from the dairy worker did, however, have one mutation that has been associated with mammalian adaptation of A(H5N1) viruses.2 There is potential that cows, like pigs, could become influenza ‘mixing vessels’ and/or promote the selection of mammalian virus traits enhancing zoonotic A(H5N1) virus transmission to people.9 10NZ has systems to reduce the risk of importing A(H5N1) from animal populations overseas, including border biosecurity. However, the virus could be introduced by wild birds as NZ is on the migratory path of multiple species.11 If the virus evolves to transmit in humans, we can expect rapid spread across the globe as with previous influenza pandemics, unless NZ and other countries applied vigorous control measures – see “risk management” below. Risk management and upgrading our pandemic preparednessThere are international calls to strengthen preparedness for avian influenza.12Effective surveillance for emerging infectious diseases is critically important. For zoonotic infections such surveillance needs to support early detection of A(H5N1) in wildlife, poultry, and livestock. Biosecurity New Zealand leads surveillance initiatives in this area. Members of the public have an important role in reporting sick or dead wild birds, poultry and sea mammals (see Biosecurity NZ for details). Similarly, the human disease surveillance system has been extended to A(H5N1). HPAI is a separate notifiable disease (in addition to non-seasonal influenza). If the risk of importing A(H5N1) rises, NZ clinicians will need to be particularly vigilant, including considering the diagnosis in occupational groups who work with poultry, livestock, and wildlife and in arriving travellers. Public health authorities in NZ need to update the national pandemic plan to cover the full range of A(H5N1) scenarios. The publicly available version is still the pre-Covid influenza plan from 2017.13 The revised plan needs to fully support public health and social measures (PHSM): border management to exclude cases; case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine; ventilation upgrades; and masking and physical distancing.14As was demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic, these measures were sufficient to interrupt disease transmission in multiple jurisdictions and to protect a sizeable proportion of the world’s population from infection prior to arrival of a new vaccine.15 Equity needs to be at the heart of pandemic responses.16 NZ also has a responsibility to support measures to protect Pacific Island populations from pandemic diseases.17 Enhanced pandemic planning will also help prepare NZ for other emerging threats such as bioengineered pandemics.18One positive feature of A(H5N1) is that there is already production technology that can deliver effective vaccines.19 The candidate vaccine viruses are a good match with circulating A(H5N1).2 However, it would still take many months or longer to meet global demand.20 There are small stocks of A(H5N1) vaccine available in NZ (though the online policy document has not been updated to describe the present situation). The threat of A(H5N1) is a further opportunity for NZ to strengthen and exercise its pandemic preparedness and response capacity.21 The work of the NZ Royal Commission COVID-19 Lessons Learned is particularly important given its forward-looking focus on increasing NZ’s preparedness for future pandemics. NZ should also consider use of simulation exercises to test national pandemic preparedness plans, as it has done in the past.22 In addition, specific mitigation measures such as mask use could be implemented and evaluated for managing seasonal epidemics of respiratory infections.23 The One Health paradigm is useful for managing pandemic threats across the human, agricultural, and ecological domains.24 Relevant organisations need to coordinate their work and consider a full range of scenarios including a sustained epizootic in poultry and dairy cattle. A New Zealand CDC-type organisation looks increasingly important to support the integration of science workforces and systems across these fields.25This situation is a further impetus to strengthen collaborative international disease surveillance and control measures with the World Health Organization, including finalising revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR) and Pandemic Accord. Strengthening cooperation with Australia (which is building new vaccine facilities) and capacity building in the Pacific will increase regional resilience. What this Briefing addsInfluenza has been a cause of human pandemics for centuries and is still the primary focus for pandemic preparedness (although there is growing concern about the threat of bioengineered pandemics).Influenza A(H5N1) has caused a global panzootic (a pandemic in birds and other animals) since 1997, with occasional and frequently fatal infections of humans but as yet no sustained human-to-human transmission.This virus is now infecting a wider range of birds and mammals, increasing exposure of humans to this infection and creating opportunities for mutations that could allow sustained human spread and trigger a pandemic.Implications for policy and practiceNZ needs to increase preparedness for a global influenza A(H5N1) pandemic, including: an updated plan that incorporates lessons from past pandemics (including the option of exclusion/elimination for a severe pandemic) and arrangements for supply of A(H5N1) testing, vaccine, antivirals, and appropriate protective equipment (notably respirator-grade masks).NZ needs to strengthen response capacities including One Health approaches to reduce the risk of influenza emergence and spread in poultry, livestock, wildlife, and humans, along with effective surveillance and early response systems.NZ should more actively support international approaches to reduce the risks of pandemics and improve their management, including an updated International Health Regulation and Pandemic Accord and capacity building in the Pacific region.Author detailsProf Michael Baker, Department of Public Health, University of Otago Wellington, and Public Health Communication CentreProf John D.

Detection of 18 human cases of the newly described influenza A(H5N1) were identified in Hong Kong following serious outbreaks on chicken farms.37 38 Six of the 18 people died; all were infected directly by chickens—there was no direct human-to-human transmission. The epidemic was halted following the slaughter of more than 1.5 million birds.39Concerns again rose in 2003 regarding a possible epidemic of A(H5N1)40 41 following an outbreak of bird flu among chickens in multiple southeast Asian countries and then evidence of limited human-to-human transmission in Vietnam in early 2004. There were 14 cases identified and 11 people died. Eight countries saw more than 20 million chickens slaughtered following expert advice that this was the only way to effectively extinguish the virus.42 In all, more than 300 people were infected, of whom about 60% died.41 The virus has also been sporadically detected in other mammals.43In the last two years, the A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has spread explosively across most regions of the world following a reassortment event.44-46 The increased prevalence of the virus in wild birds has led to infection of atypical bird species such as vultures47 and also infection of multiple mammal species.48-51 Most recently, it has been reported in dairy cattle in multiple US states52-55 and has infected people.56-58 Definable mutations are probably needed before this current A(H5N1) variant can adapt to cause sustained human-to-human transmission, given its failure to do so in the past. The virus isolated from the dairy worker did, however, have one mutation that has been associated with mammalian adaptation of A(H5N1) viruses.2 Spread in multiple mammal species may make it easier to develop the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission and thus risk producing a human pandemic.59 A 3 May 2024 preprint shows that human avian influenza A virus receptors are widely expressed in the bovine mammary gland, increasing the risk that cattle can act as a ‘mixing vessel’ for further viral evolution and possible development of the capacity for human-to-human transmission.10From 2003 to 31 March 2024, there were 888 human cases of A(H5N1) influenza reported, of which 463 (52.1%) were fatal.6 There have been very few human cases of the currently circulating lineage 2.3.4.4b, with 13 between 2022-24 of which two (15.4%) have died.60 The majority were reported in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam.This fatality risk may be overestimated because mild and asymptomatic infections in humans are less likely to be identified than severe disease, which would have shrunk the recorded denominator of total infections.Influenza (and other) pandemics remain unpredictable in timing and severity. Previous documented pandemics have ranged from the intensity of seasonal influenza (as seen in influenza (H1N1) in 200961) through to the 1918 influenza (H1N1) pandemic with a case fatality risk of about 2%.62 For other respiratory pandemics the case fatality risk has been even higher, as was seen with SARS in 2003 where it was >10%.62 Details about influenza virusesInfluenza A(H5N1) virus causes HPAI outbreaks with high death rates in chickens and other birds (other HPAI viruses include A(H7N9), A(H5N8), A(H5N5), A(H5N6)).1 It is distinguished from low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, a more common form of the virus, which typically causes few or no signs in birds.The two glycoproteins on the influenza virus membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), enable entry and exit of the virus, respectively. HA mediates entry by binding to sialic acids on target cells and NA mediates exit by destruction of these bonds. The sialic acid receptors preferred by avian and human adapted influenza viruses differ slightly in chemical composition. HAs are a principal determinant of the pathogenicity of influenza A viruses. In addition to mediating binding to host cells, HAs initiate infection by inducing fusion between host cell and virus membranes. The capacity to fuse is dependent on the activation of HA by enzymatic cleavage by host proteases. There are striking differences between highly pathogenic and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses in their sensitivity to these host proteases and as a consequence their intrinsic ability to cause systemic disease, particularly in gallinaceous poultry.63 After virus replication occurs in the host cells, the receptor-destroying virus enzyme, neuraminidase, removes the sialic-acid residues from the surfaces of the infected cells, releasing the newly made viruses to infect more cells.64The 1980 WHO system of nomenclature of influenza viruses consists of two parts: a type (A, B, C, D) and strain designation and, for influenza A viruses, designation of the antigenic subtypes, based on the characterisation of the surface antigens that determine infection: HA antigens initially were classified as having 12, but now 18, subtypes, H1-H18, and NA antigens initially 9, now 11, subtypes, N1-N11.65-68 These designations give rise to the HxNy classification of the influenza viruses. There are further divisions of subtypes based on the mutation-driven evolution of the virus.69One Health approach to understanding and managing the A(H5N1) threatA(H5N1) poses a risk to humans, wildlife, and poultry/livestock, and as such benefits from a One Health approach.24 This infection could be devastating to native birdlife and marine mammals as seen internationally.70 It is also a severe threat to poultry.71 The current outbreak in livestock in the US shows its broader threat to agriculture.2 For example, infected dairy cattle can shed virus in milk and potentially transmit infection to other mammals via unpasteurised milk.3 On one north Texas dairy farm in March 2024, >50% of approximately 24 domestic cats became ill and died after being fed raw milk from sick cows. Laboratory testing of bovine milk samples and specimens from two autopsied cats confirmed they were infected by the same strain of A(H5N1).3While A(H5N1) remains in non-human populations, Biosecurity New Zealand (Ministry of Primary Industries) is the lead agency for assessing and managing the threat. Given the threat to wildlife, the Department of Conservation (DOC) is also involved. These agencies also work with the Ministry of Health and Te Whatu Ora/Health NZ which is actively monitoring a range of pandemic threats. Those agencies are working together to develop response options that represent the best approach for NZ to protect our unique native species, mitigate the impact on the poultry sector and take preventative measures to protect human health.Organisations working across the human health, agricultural, and ecological domains as well as those concerned with occupational health and safety, will need to consider a full range of scenarios including a sustained epizootic in dairy cattle in NZ. In the event of an outbreak in poultry and/or livestock, there are a range of possible actions that would be taken. These include movement control, vaccination, or depopulation, depending on the species infected and the location.Biosecurity New Zealand is actively monitoring the international spread of A(H5N1) viruses. This virus first appeared in South America in late 2022,70 the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia in late 2023, and the Antarctic Peninsula near South America in February 2024. So far, Australia, NZ, the Pacific Islands and much of Antarctica remain free from the A(H5N1) virus. The virus has been detected in most other regions of the world.Diagnosis of A(H5N1) depends on collecting suitable specimens for specialist testing at two Wallaceville laboratories: the WHO National Influenza Centre for human specimens and the Animal Health Laboratory for animal specimens. Biosecurity New Zealand leads several streams of surveillance, aimed at detecting A(H5N1) should it arrive in NZ or the Ross Sea region: Passive surveillance via Biosecurity NZ’s Exotic Pest and Disease hotline. Material has been circulated to the veterinary profession to highlight the clinical signs of A(H5N1) and the poultry industry is in a state of heightened awareness;Surveillance of migratory birds and shorebirds not displaying clinical signs of A(H5N1) via a contract between MPI and Dunedin Wildlife Hospital, began in September 2023. Dunedin and other wildlife hospitals will continue to report birds with suspected avian influenza symptoms via the 0800 number. Study of the ecology and evolution of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza viruses (LPAI) viruses circulating in NZ, run by MPI’s Animal Health Laboratory, involving the sampling and testing mallard ducks in conjunction with a Fish and Game New Zealand annual banding programme to track duck numbers;Poultry export testing for avian influenza to meet Overseas Market Access Requirements (OMAR) and enable export of day-old chicks and hatching eggs. Managed by the poultry industry, with lab results being provided to MPI. All non-negative samples are sent to the MPI Animal Health Laboratory for confirmatory testing; Biosecurity NZ is also working with DOC on any suspected exotic diseases in wild bird populations, including native birds:DOC staff in the sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctic New Zealand staff at Scott Base, Antarctica have been issued sampling kits and instructions. Sample-handling systems for this Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic pathway have been validated. DOC staff and researchers in the sub-Antarctic islands and Chatham Islands have collected samples from seabirds for baseline health monitoring in the 2023/24 summer season. Any detection of Avian Influenza viruses will be reported to Biosecurity NZ. A collaboration with the University of Otago, ESR and others to understand the transmission of avian viruses between migratory and sedentary birds in NZ and to develop rapid, in-field, testing. DOC is also working on a HPAI vaccine trial, beginning with five native species. Public Health Expert Briefing (ISSN 2816-1203) References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Geoff Bennett: The continuing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. has alarmed researchers and prompted new efforts to track the virus that's already caused the deaths of tens of millions of birds from Europe to Antarctica.But, as William Brangham reports, as H5N1 continues to jump into mammals, most recently dairy cows, many scientists are concerned that we're not watching closely enough as this virus continues to spread. A warning: This story contains scenes of animals in distress. William Brangham: Evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey at the University of Arizona is one of many scientists around the world trying to untangle bird flu's latest twist, how and when it spread to dairy cows.Michael Worobey, The University of Arizona: The jump into cattle probably took place between mid-November and mid-January, and so we're months into this already. William Brangham: And since then, it's spread like wildfire, infecting dairy cows in at least 46 herds across nine states. Michael Worobey: It seems to be spreading cow to cow in some fashion, but we don't know exactly how that is. For example, it could just be mechanical transmission as one cow leaves a milking machine, leaves virus on it, and then the next cow comes in. Or is this going respiratory, like flu does with humans? William Brangham: In late April, the USDA mandated that milking dairy cows being transported across state lines need to be tested for bird flu.Do you think we have got now enough surveillance out there to know what this virus is doing and where it's moving? Michael Worobey: I think we still have a long way to go, honestly. We are still sort of dealing with a pretty limited number of samples from a limited number of farms. And that limits exactly how much we can understand.For example, you can actually figure out, just like we did with COVID, the number of people infected is doubling every two days. We still don't know that with cattle. William Brangham: But even the initial discovery that bird flu had jumped species and was now circulating in cows was thanks to a bit of epidemiological work by a handful of veterinarians. Dr. Drew Magstadt, Clinical Associate Professor, Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory: The main common denominators with the cattle were a sudden decrease in feed intake, a sudden decrease in milk production, variable fevers, variable manure consistency. William Brangham: Dr.Drew Magstadt is a veterinarian at Iowa State'S Vet Diagnostic Lab. He was helping colleagues in the Texas Panhandle and Kansas who were dealing with a bunch of sick cows, but then a new clue emerged.On these same farms where cows were sick, a lot of cats had gone missing, gotten sick, or had died.So, you thought, we have to check H5N1, the bird flu, because it's been in this area, but you really didn't think that was going to be the case. Dr. Drew Magstadt: Well, yes. And we didn't end up ruling it out. We ended up finding the virus. The intriguing part here is that this virus in cattle doesn't seem to be causing any mortality. After several weeks, the animals recover. It's very different from the infection in other mammalian species. William Brangham: In fact, unlike cows, this bird flu has been deadly to the nearly two dozen other mammal species that have been infected in this U.S., from a polar bear in Alaska, to a mountain lion in Colorado, to raccoons and foxes. Many of those animals were likely infected by eating dead animals that were carrying the virus.But, by far, the biggest impact here in the U.S. has been on birds. Since this strain of avian influenza first arrived in the U.S. in early 2022, brought here by migratory birds, more than 90 million domestic birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died or been intentionally killed across 48 states.And unlike previous outbreaks, this variant has affected more wild birds and spread across a wider geographic area, crossing down into South America at the end of 2022.Dr. Ralph Vanstreels, University of California, Davis: I think the alarm really went off when it reached Peru, and that's a massive seabird community, and we saw just unprecedented mortality in the seabirds there. William Brangham: U.C. Davis' Dr. Ralph Vanstreels is a wildlife veterinarian based in Argentina, and he watched as the virus arrived and decimated bird populations, and then made another jump into mammals. An estimated 24,000 sea lions died from the outbreak.It was one of the earliest known mass mortality events from bird flu in mammals. Dr. Ralph Vanstreels: At first, we weren't sure if each of those sea lions was getting infected by eating a bird. But it became pretty obvious pretty quick that this was spreading from mammal to mammal. William Brangham: In Argentina, Dr. Vanstreels estimated that the virus killed 17,000 elephant seal pups and an unknown number of adults, a blow to that population that may take decades to recover. Dr. Ralph Vanstreels: It's definitely very distressing, I can say. We have worked with these animals for many years. So we have known these populations, we have seen these colonies. And on the one hand, we are prepared, because we expected it. On the other, nothing can prepare you for it. William Brangham: Earlier this year, researchers confirmed that bird flu had spread all the way to Antarctica, primarily affecting birds known as skuas, but, so far, Antarctica's iconic penguins haven't been affected. Dr. Ralph Vanstreels: But this virus can mutate quite quickly, right as it did when it started infecting mammals. So it could mutate again and start infecting penguins. So we're not quite out of the woods yet. William Brangham: And it's that possibility of mutation, where the virus adapts and becomes better suited to spreading from mammal to mammal, that has many on edge, particularly now that H5N1 was discovered spreading in all those dairy cows.While experts stress it's still very unlikely that this outbreak will lead to the next human pandemic, and government officials say pasteurization kills the virus in milk and dairy products, there are real risks for those who work in close contact with cows.In March, a farmworker in Texas was infected, but had mild symptoms and recovered. The CDC says it's monitoring people exposed to infected cattle, but admits that only 33 people have been tested. Michael Worobey: What we have is a situation where the virus, in a sense, has more shots on goal to jump from a related species, a mammal like us. And now people are no doubt being exposed on a daily basis in pretty large numbers. William Brangham: Worobey says it's a stark reminder that we have not learned as much as we hoped from the COVID pandemic. Michael Worobey: We need to be spending billions more to do things like routinely monitor not the tip of the iceberg of cattle who are visibly ill, but routine monitoring to just find, OK, is there something that shouldn't be spreading in this animal species or in humans? And we are still not doing that. William Brangham: And with more than nine million dairy cows in the U.S. alone, getting eyes on where this virus may go next remains a monumental challenge for animal and human health.For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm William Brangham.

Print There is a bird flu outbreak going on. Here is what you need to know about it:What is bird flu?Bird flu is what’s known as a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. The “highly pathogenic” part refers to birds, which the virus is pretty adept at killing. In virology speak, the virus is of the Influenza A type, and is called H5N1. The “H” stands for the protein Hemagglutinin (HA), of which there are 16 subtypes (H1-H16). The “N” is short for Neuraminidase (NA), of which there are 9 subtypes (N1-N9). There are many possible combinations of HA and NA proteins. The two known type A human influenza viruses are H1N1 and H3N2. (Two additional subtypes, H17N10 and H18N11, have been identified in bats).When did this bird flu first appear?The current strain of H5N1 circulating the globe originated in 1996, in farmed geese living in China’s Guangdong province. It quickly spread to other poultry and migrating birds. By the early 2000s, it had spread across southern Asia. By 2005, it was observed in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. In 2014, it showed up in North America, but appeared to peter out here while it still raged in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In 2021, it showed up in wild birds migrating off Canada’s Atlantic coast. Since then, it has spread across North and South America. California Bird flu spreads to Southern California, infecting chickens, wild birds and other animals A highly infectious bird flu that has felled millions of birds globally is in California. Experts worry it could affect our food supply.Oct. 3, 2022 What kinds of animals does bird flu effect?Birds are the primary carriers and victims of the virus. Across the globe, hundreds of millions of wild and domestic birds have died. Since 2021, hundreds of U.S. poultry farms have had to “depopulate” millions of birds after becoming infected, presumably from sick, migrating wild birds. The virus is highly contagious among birds and has a nearly 100% fatality rate. Mammals, too have been infected and died. In most cases, these are scavenging or predatory animals that ate sick birds — and the virus has died in these animals and not become contagious between them. So far, 48 species of mammals have become infected. However, there have been a few cases in which it appears the virus may have spread between mammals, including on European fur farms, on a few South American beaches where elephant seals came to roost, and now among dairy cattle in the United States. Climate & Environment California wildlife is vulnerable to an avian flu ‘apocalypse.’ What is driving the spread? What is driving the unprecedented spread of avian flu?Feb. 25, 2024 Can humans get bird flu?Since 2003, when the virus first started spreading through southern Asia, there have been 868 cases of human infection with H5N1 reported, of which 457 were fatal — a 53% case fatality rate. There have been only two cases in the U.S. In 2022, a poultry worker was infected in Colorado and suffered only mild symptoms, including fatigue. In 2024, a dairy worker was infected in Texas and complained only of conjunctivitis, or pink eye. Advertisement Why is everyone paying attention to dairy cows?On March 25, 2024, officials announced that dairy cows in Texas had been infected with bird flu. Since then, the virus has been found in 36 herds across nine states. There are no known cases in California. It is believed that there was a single introduction of the virus from wild bird exposure (either by passive exposure, or maybe from eating contaminated feed), that probably occurred in December in Texas. The virus has since been detected in milk. A study conducted by federal researchers found that 1 in 5 milk samples collected from retail stores had the virus. It is believed that the virus may be passing between cows and that there may be cows that show no symptoms. For the most part, it seems dairy cows only suffer mild illness when infected, and milk production slows. They clear the virus after a few weeks. Climate & Environment ‘Nobody saw this coming’; California dairies scramble to guard herds against bird flu As the avian flu continues to threaten poultry farms and wildlife, are factory farms a sitting duck? April 14, 2024 Is it safe to drink milk?Yes — if it is pasteurized milk. Federal officials say the virus they have detected in pasteurized milk samples is inactive and will not cause disease. In the case of raw milk, they urge people to avoid it. That’s because they have found high viral loads in raw milk samples. In addition, studies of barn cats that have consumed raw milk have reported severe consequences. In one cluster of 24 barn cats, half of them died after consuming raw milk, with others suffering blindness, neurological distress and copious nasal discharge. The virus has not been found in sour cream or cottage cheese. Climate & Environment Despite H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in dairy cattle, raw milk enthusiasts are uncowed Despite warnings of H5N1 bird flu outbreaks among dairy cattle, raw milk enthusiasts say they will continue to drink unpasteurized milk.May 12, 2024 What’s the situation with wastewater?As health officials and researchers scramble to understand how widespread avian flu is in cattle and the environment, they are analyzing municipal wastewater. One team from Emory University and Stanford University looked at 190 wastewater treatment sites in 41 states. They found a surge of Influenza A virus in the last several weeks at 59 sites. This does not necessarily mean there is bird flu at these sites. However, in places where the team has gone to investigate — including three in Texas where they knew there was H5N1 in dairy cattle — they have found bird flu. Influenza A is generally seasonal in humans — peaking from late fall to early spring. The surge the researchers noticed — including at several sites in California — started after the flu season had died down. Researchers in Texas have also detected H5N1 in the wastewater of nine of 10 cities they tested, all located in Texas. The CDC is also monitoring for Influenza A at roughly 600 sites across the nation. Climate & Environment Flu season is over, but there is a viral surge in California wastewater. Is it avian flu? Samples from wastewater plants across the nation show an increase in multiple flu viruses. Some experts worry that H5N1 bird flu might be to blame.

By: Danielle Prokop - May 15, 2024 12:59 pm Dairy cows eat alongside blackbirds. No new cases of avian flu in New Mexico dairies have been confirmed since April 17. (Stock photo via Getty Images) Despite surrounding states recording additional herds infected with avian flu in recent weeks, there’s been no change in the number reported in New Mexico. New Mexico is still counting eight herds with confirmed positives of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, all in Curry County, and no presumptive positive cases, state agriculture officials said Monday. “We do not have exact numbers of cows affected in each herd, but the average has been about 10%,” state veterinarian Samantha Uhrig said in a written response to questions. The state is unaware of any cow deaths that are directly attributed to avian flu, she added. Uhrig said the state will not name infected dairies and will only identify them at the county level. The most recent data from 2022 estimated that Curry County has 21 dairy farms, and about 78,300 milk cows, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture census. Last month’s outbreak of influenza strain H5N1 affected more than 33 dairy cow herds across eight states: Idaho, South Dakota, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, Kansas, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on infections in cats at a Texas Panhandle dairy found that of 24 cats that drank raw milk from infected cows, 12 died. New Mexico had an outbreak of avian influenza in a neighboring Roosevelt County poultry facility, which required all of the birds to be euthanized. The birds were infected by the same strain that’s infecting cattle, the USDA confirmed in late April, documenting cases in eight facilities in five states (New Mexico, Kansas, Texas, Michigan and Minnesota). New Mexico chicken farm infected with avian influenza One Texas dairy worker tested positive for H5N1, the second case reported in the U.S. No other human cases have been reported since April 1. Three workers in New Mexico were tested, but all of those tests came back negative, state health officials told Source NM Friday. The USDA also found an asymptomatic cow from an affected herd sent for slaughter had H5N1 in its lung tissue. But according to the USDA, the cow did not enter the food supply. So far, federal officials are only mandating testing for dairy cows moving between states. An April 29 order from USDA said any dairy cows moving between states must receive a negative test for Influenza A virus from a certified lab. This requirement does not apply to cows moving within a state, according to a clarification from the department. To send a cow to slaughter or sale barn in state, only a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection “stating the animal is healthy” is required — not testing. The USDA will reimburse costs for samples sent to National Animal Health Laboratory Network labs for dairy cattle suspected of having the disease, those that are asymptomatic, cattle that’s about to be moved and other animals present on dairies that have an outbreak, according to the order. Milk, eggs, beef Food and Drug Administration tests found remnants of the H5N1 virus in 20% of commercial pasteurized milk product samples. The FDA emphasized the material was inactive during the process and does not pose risks to consumers, and that all 297 retail dairy samples were negative for a viable virus. “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the FDA said in an April 24 statement. In additional tests on eggs on May 10, all samples were negative for a viable virus. Separately, the USDA tested 30 samples of beef from affected states, and all were negative for the virus. The FDA said it would continue with sampling and surveillance of food supplies. Federal officials urge people not to drink unpasteurized or “raw milk.” Here’s what to watch for avian flu symptoms in backyard flocks and other domestic animals GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

So far, Oregon is not one of those states, but officials are taking precautions and coordinating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others. Jenifer Cruickshank is an assistant professor and dairy extension specialist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. She joins us to tell us everything we need to know about bird flu in dairy cattle.The following transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer:Dave Miller: This is Think Out Loud on OPB. I’m Dave Miller. Avian influenza is spreading through America’s dairies. Particles of the virus have been found in nearly 20% of milk samples nationwide. Outbreaks have been detected in 36 dairy herds in nine states. So far, Oregon is not one of those states but neighboring Idaho is, and Oregon officials are coordinating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC. Jenifer Cruickshank is an assistant professor and dairy extension specialist at Oregon State University. She joins us now with more details. Jenifer, welcome back.Jenifer Cruickshank: Oh, thank you.Miller: This is known as an avian virus, a bird virus because it originated in birds, but what effect does it have on cows?Cruickshank: This is something that we only learned this last winter, where there’s been a spillover event at the very least in West Texas and herds there had cows that became sick. They went off their feed, their milk production dropped dramatically down to very low levels and the milk that they were giving was thicker and yellow, definitely not normal milk. Some of the cows showed fever, some of them had abnormal feces, either too loose or too firm. This prompted a veterinary investigation and that’s when it was identified as being avian influenza, the H5N1 strain that has been problematic when it’s jumped into poultry flocks the last few years.Miller: And in those poultry flocks, it’s catastrophic, right?Cruickshank: Yes, it’s very lethal. Fortunately, we don’t see that with cattle. Even those cows that show clinical signs and are quite ill do recover after two or three weeks. So, fortunately, it does not have the same effect in cattle.Miller: You just outlined a whole series of things that I suppose dairy producers in Oregon, and all across the country, are on the lookout for right now?Cruickshank: Yeah, I think that’s kind of how I would describe the mood, as being watchful. Probably paying a little bit more attention to biosecurity measures. In this case, that’s making your farm less welcoming to waterfowl because they seem to be the primary carriers of the disease.Miller: How would you do that?Cruickshank: Ideally, you don’t have ponds anywhere near where your cows are. Trying to make your farm as unattractive to water fowl as possible, so that they don’t want to stop there. Other biosecurity measures are our standard ones, where if you’re bringing any new animals onto the farm, they go into a quarantine area,where they don’t mix with the other animals for 30 days. Other kinds of basic ones include controlling who has access to the farm and using disinfectants.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorMiller: Those biosecurity measures, are those always in place? Or are there specific things, either from USDA or from state authorities, that are specifically in place now because of this particular outbreak?Cruickshank: What’s been enacted is there was a federal order from a few weeks ago, from USDA, requiring testing of cows that will be traveling between states. That applies to lactating dairy cattle only. In order to cross state lines, they need to have a negative test for H5N1 within seven days of making that move. There is an exception to that, though. If animals are moving directly to slaughter, which is where our retired dairy cattle go – they go on to their second career as beef providers – there’s an exception. If they are going to slaughter, there’s a USDA inspection process at slaughter facilities, so they don’t require the testing in those cases.Miller: That is a brief career. I’m wondering if you can help me understand the two stats that I mentioned at the beginning, because I find them a little bit confusing put together. The first is that outbreaks have only been detected in 36 herds in the entire country, but the second is that federal officials have also detected the virus, or parts of the virus, in nearly one in five, 20%, of milk samples nationwide, after they looked at something like 1,000 samples, a pretty good selection. How do you make sense of both of those together?Cruickshank: What I suspect we have … and this has been true on farms that have had identified infections, having clinical cows, cows that were sick, other cows on the farm have been fine. On those farms where they’ve had sick cows, it’s affected 10% or fewer of the herd, so you’ve got a lot of animals who aren’t showing any signs of illness at all. Probably what the case is, is that there are cows walking around who have subclinical cases, who by all appearances and measures are healthy, but maybe shedding virus. I’m speculating here, but there may have been additional spillover events to get us to that high level of detection of evidence of the virus in milk samples. That was certainly a surprising number, where 20% were coming back.I do want to make the note that those tests were using PCR and identifying genetic material from the viruses, which can persist, not just of viruses but anything that does have nucleic acid. The nucleic acids can persist. The way that the test works is it’s just identifying certain pieces of the genetic material, so that doesn’t mean that there’s any functional virus in the milk supply.Miller: It just means there are pieces of DNA that could still be identified in the cottage cheese, or the milk, or the half and half?Cruickshank: Yes, and technically, influenza are RNA viruses.Miller: Oh, RNA, I appreciate that. This is why we have the experts on; to correct us. In other words, you’re saying dairy consumers shouldn’t worry that particles of bird flu virus might be in the dairy that they’re buying at the store.Cruickshank: No. Pasteurization is highly effective at disabling influenza viruses, and the FDA has confirmed that again, very specifically, with this new disease in cattle. I’ll point out that all food that we eat is gonna have trace nucleic acids, genetic material, from all kinds of things. That’s not unusual for milk.Miller: What about raw milk for folks? A much, much smaller number of consumers, who are maybe buying unpasteurized milk directly from a farm, say. Is there more concern there?Cruickshank: There definitely is. Pasteurization is very effective at disabling the virus, and raw milk, of course, is not going through that pasteurization process. So, were that milk to contain H5N1 viruses or any other pathogens for that matter, then that could be consumed by the person who drinks it. There’s definitely a much higher risk with raw milk consumption.Miller: So far, there’s only been a report of one person, a dairy worker, who contracted this virus from a cow. That worker, I’ve read, had a minor eye infection that apparently cleared up after a couple of days, but are there still scarier spillover scenarios, where the virus jumps from livestock to people and morphs in a way that makes it a lot more dangerous?Cruickshank: Yeah, for sure. There is definitely that concern. This comes back to the watchfulness on the part of federal and state agencies, and dairy farm owners, and veterinarians. That watchfulness, of keeping an eye on it, [is important] because that is a concern, that the virus will undergo a mutation that makes it easier to jump into humans or enables the virus to become more virulent. We can transfer a lot of the concerns that we have about COVID, which is also a virus, over to this scenario; this could happen and hopefully it won’t, but we’ll keep an eye on it.Miller: Jenifer, thanks very much.Cruickshank: Oh, you’re very welcome.

In late March 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of mammal-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus (bird flu), sparking concerns about the potential public health implications that could follow. On April 1, 2024, the CDC reported a second case of bird flu transmission from a mammal to a human after a resident of Texas was exposed to dairy cattle presumably infected with the virus.1-3 As of April 26, 2024, the CDC has reported outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu in poultry and cattle across 48 and 9 states, respectively.4 The virus typically infects animals through direct or indirect exposure to infected wild birds and has been identified in numerous animals in the United States.5,6 Results of a new study suggest that cow-to-cow and cross-species transmission of the virus has occurred, raising “new concerns regarding the potential for virus spread within mammal populations.”7 Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has “indicated the commercial milk supply remains safe, the detection of influenza virus in unpasteurized bovine milk is a concern because of potential cross-species transmission,” the authors continued, underscoring the need for continued surveillance of bird flu in livestock.7 The human health risk associated with bird flu is currently considered low for the general public, according to the CDC.4 However, the agency recommends the public heed various safety measures, including avoiding direct contact with wild birds and avoiding unprotected exposure to infected animals or contaminated surfaces.4 In addition, the CDC recommends specific measures be taken regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers at increased risk for exposure to animals infected with bird flu.8 “Public health officials should be monitoring the incidence of emergency department and urgent care visits for influenza-like illness and positive influenza A tests, especially in areas with farms and places where the disease has been reported. To gain expert insight on these emerging developments, we spoke with Shira Doron, MD, attending physician, hospital epidemiologist, and chief infection control officer at Tufts Medical Center; professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts; and Infectious Diseases Society of America fellow. According to the CDC, the overall public health risk related to H5N1 bird flu is low. From an infectious disease perspective, what would be the threshold for concern on a public health level? Dr Doron: Changes that would raise the level of concern for human health include a greater number of human cases acquired from farm animals; sustained human-to-human transmission; transmission of influenza from the food supply, such as dairy, beef, chicken, and eggs; food shortages due to contaminated food supply; and economic impacts due to effects on the food industry. What is known about transmissibility and survival associated with the virus, as well as treatment options and efficacy? Dr Doron: We have only seen 2 human cases of this strain of avian influenza to date and both have been extremely mild. However, globally, a high mortality rate of about 50% has been seen in detected cases. This is, perhaps, attributable to more severe cases being more likely to be detected.9 In all cases, transmission has occurred from animal to human, with only very rare cases of human-to-human transmission occurring in close household situations. All antivirals with activity against influenza that have been studied are active against this strain; however, generally speaking, antivirals for influenza have fairly limited efficacy.10 The CDC noted that the H5N1 bird flu viruses are “very closely related to two existing HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] A (H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed.”11 At what point would that measure become necessary? Dr Doron: There would likely be different criteria for pulling the trigger to vaccinate farmworkers or other professionals with occupational contact with animals and animal products vs the whole population. The former might happen if animal-to-human transmission continues despite the use of PPE. The latter would likely happen if the virus mutated such that sustained human-to-human transmission occurred. What should clinicians and public health officials be monitoring during this development, and what other recommendations do you have for health care providers regarding this topic? Dr Doron: We are no longer in influenza season and testing for influenza is not typical when the virus is not circulating at appreciable levels. However, I would test for influenza if a patient with compatible symptoms reported close contact with animals that have been reported to harbor the virus. If such a patient tests positive for influenza A, state health officials should be notified so that the specimen can be tested for H5N1. Public health officials should be monitoring the incidence of emergency department and urgent care visits for influenza-like illness and positive influenza A tests, especially in areas with farms and places where the disease has been reported. A subset of specimens positive for influenza A should be screened for the presence of H5N1 by public health laboratories. Monitoring wastewater for H5N1 is an option, but in many, if not most, farming communities, homes are not tied into sewers. Wastewater testing for H5N1 is difficult to interpret because it includes runoff containing animal feces, and we already know there are animals throughout the country carrying H5N1. What questions should be the focus of further research in this area? Dr Doron: There are many data gaps and research needs remaining on the associated risks and transmissibility of H5N1 bird flu: Commercial milk was found to be polymerase chain reaction-positive for H5N1, so virus viability in pasteurized milk, though unlikely, must be ascertained. In what scenarios, if any, might pasteurization fail? Does unpasteurized aged cheese contain viable virus? Can the virus cause human infection via the ingestion of dairy or meat products? Are beef cattle at risk for infection? What is the route of transmission among cattle, and why is it concentrated in their milk and not found in appreciable quantities in their respiratory tracts? What is the prevalence of exposed, recovered farmworkers? What is the prevalence of exposed, recovered cattle, and how much contaminated milk has entered the food supply? What proportion of cattle remain asymptomatic when infected? What is the duration of infectivity in cattle? How long should farmworkers be monitored if in continuous contact with sick cattle, and for how long should their milk be discarded? What dose of vaccine will be required to achieve a good immune response, and how effective will it be at preventing infection, hospitalization, and death? I recently participated in a symposium that included the CDC, the US Department of Agriculture, the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Department of Health and Human Services. For more details on research needs regarding this topic, I highly recommend viewing the slides on “HPAI Key Scientific Data Gaps” toward the end of the symposium recording.12 References: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection reported in a person in the US.

Disease control zones will remain in place until all disease control and surveillance activities have been successfully completed and there are no suspect cases under investigation. Keepers can check if they are in a bird flu disease control zone using the Animal and Plant Health Agency’s interactive map. HPAI, H5N5, and H5N1 have both been detected in wild birds in Great Britain this autumn and the risk level in wild birds has increased from medium to high. The risk level in poultry where good biosecurity is consistently applied has increased from very low to low with low uncertainty. While the risk in poultry where there is suboptimal or poor biosecurity remains assessed as low, this is heightened with high uncertainty. Further information on the evidence which supports these risk levels can be found in APHA’s risk and outbreak assessments which was last updated on 5 November 2024. It is essential that birds and kept mammals (including pets) are watched closely for any signs of disease, and that prompt advice is sought from a vet if there are any concerns. All bird keepers are reminded that they have a legal requirement to register their poultry and other captive birds (with the exception of certain psittacines and passerines), even if only kept as pets, and that they are breaking the law if they fail to do so. Registered keepers will receive regular updates and guidance to help protect their birds from avian influenza. The latest information and guidance on bird flu can be found here. 13 May 2024 Wild birds are the natural hosts of avian influenza (bird flu) viruses. However, avian influenza viruses can also infect mammals. In response to the emerging situation in dairy cattle in the USA, Defra has updated its guidance on Influenza A (H5N1) infection in mammals: suspect case definition and diagnostic testing criteria on the government website. This includes a new case definition for ungulates including dairy cattle. If the presence either of avian influenza virus, or antibodies to avian influenza virus, are suspected or detected in a kept or wild mammal, it must be reported immediately by calling: 03000 200 301 if you’re in England. 03003 038 268 if you’re in Wales. your local Field Services Office if you’re in Scotland. If you do not report it, you’re breaking the law. 8 April 2024 Change to HPAI H5 Wild Bird Risk Level The risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 in wild birds in Great Britain has reduced from medium (event occurs regularly) to low (event is rare but does occur). The risk of poultry exposure to HPAI H5 in Great Britain remains assessed as: low (event is rare but does occur) (with medium uncertainty) where there are substantial biosecurity breaches and poor biosecurity low (event is rare but does occur) (with low uncertainty) where good biosecurity is applied While the UK has now declared itself free of HPAI in poultry in line with World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) rules, both HPAI H5N1 and H5N5 continue to be found in wild birds in Great Britain and Europe. Outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 also continue to occur in poultry and other captive birds in several countries in Europe. The virus is still circulating in wild birds in Great Britain and all bird keepers should remain vigilant for signs of disease to protect the health and welfare of their birds.The risk is continually reviewed, and it is too early to predict the outlook for future seasons and risk levels may increase again in autumn associated with the migratory pattern of waterfowl and environmental conditions becoming more favourable for virus survival. Details of the evidence that supported these decisions in the latest APHA outbreak assessments is available on gov.uk 3 April 2024 The UK has self-declared zonal freedom from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) for Great Britain with effect from 29 March 2024. This is in line with World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) rules, and the declaration will be reviewed and published by WOAH in due course. This follows the UK’s declaration on behalf of Northern Ireland that the Province was free from HPAI on 31 March 2023. The UK does not currently have any outbreaks of HPAI in poultry or other captive birds, and the risk to poultry from HPAI H5 in Great Britain is now low. However, HPAI H5N1 continues to be found in wild birds in Great Britain where the risk level remains at medium, and across Europe, with outbreaks occurring in poultry and other captive birds in several countries. All keepers of poultry and other kept birds, including gamebirds prior to their release, must therefore remain vigilant, and practice stringent biosecurity to protect the health and welfare of their birds. Biosecurity guidance and a biosecurity self-assessment checklist have been published by Defra to assist all bird keepers in instigating and maintaining high standards of biosecurity. The latest information on avian influenza can be found here. 8 November 2023 Following a reduction in the number of findings of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds, the risk of HPAI H5 in wild birds has been reduced from high (event occurs very often), to medium (event occurs regularly). The risk of HPAI H5 remains low (event is rare but does occur) in poultry. While the risk in wild birds has reduced, the virus is still circulating, and all bird keepers should remain vigilant for signs of disease. The risk is continually reviewed, and it is possible that it may increase again as the autumn migration continues. Practising good biosecurity at all times protects the health and welfare of your birds and for commercial keepers it will help protect businesses from HPAI and other diseases. Biosecurity guidance and a biosecurity self-assessment checklist have been published by Defra to assist all bird keepers in instigating and maintaining high standards of biosecurity. 20 October 2023 The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) carries out year-round surveillance of dead wild birds submitted via public reports and warden patrols as part of its wild bird surveillance programme. APHA publish a report which is updated weekly on findings of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in wild birds in Great Britain, and further information on reports of avian influenza in Great Britain and across Europe are also available via APHA’s outbreak assessments. As part of its avian influenza in wildlife surveillance programme in Great Britain, APHA have also launched both an Interactive Map of reported wild bird mortality and findings of avian influenza in wild birds and wild mammals, and an Interactive Data Dashboard of findings of avian influenza in wild birds. Data in the Map and Dashboard will be updated weekly, but for recent reports, collection information and testing may be shown as pending. If you have reported a dead wild bird online or via the helpline (03459 33 55 77), you can check the status of your report by entering the location, or your Defra reference number (prefixed by WSF- or REP-) in the map’s search box. 03 October 2023 While avian influenza viruses are predominantly considered a pathogen of birds, there is emerging evidence that the virus responsible for the current highly pathogenic avian influenza is also able to infect a broader range of mammals following their close contact with infected poultry, wild birds, captive birds, or contaminated equipment, environment, or feed. Those mammals that are known to scavenge dead or dying birds are most likely to be susceptible. If members of the public find a dead wild carnivore such as a fox, otter, pine marten, stoat, weasel, pole cat, or mink, where the cause of death is unknown, or the animal has shown signs of respiratory or neurological disease prior to death, they should report it immediately to APHA by calling: 03000 200 301 if in England. 03003 038 268 if in Wales. Your local Field Services Office if in Scotland. The same also applies to dead marine mammals such as seal, dolphin, porpoise, or whale, again where the cause of death is unknown, or where signs of respiratory or neurological disease were shown prior to death. More information on how the government monitors spill over of avian influenza virus from wild birds to wild mammals can be found here. 12 September 2023 Risk of Avian Influenza to Gamebirds in Release Pens Two new highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infected premises have recently been confirmed on two consecutive days, both of which involved pheasants still within and being fed in release pens, and therefore classified as poultry. This has resulted in formal 3km and 10km restrictions being put in place which has impacted on all keepers of poultry and captive birds within those zones. It has also meant that gamebirds including pheasants, partridges and ducks cannot be released in these zones. The infected birds will have to be culled, and cleansing and disinfection procedures statutorily applied. In both circumstances, the biosecurity measures on the two premises were found to be minimal. Whilst there will always be potential for birds in release pens to have some wild bird contact, direct or indirect, biosecurity measures such as: ensuring food and water sources cannot be accessed by wild birds and are kept spotlessly clean; disinfecting footwear and any other items that are taken into the pen; and having dedicated overalls for each pen are strongly advised. These measures can significantly reduce the risk of disease, and they also demonstrate that the game shooting sector is taking the risk seriously, and playing its part in attempting to protect all poultry. The risk of HPAI infection in wild birds remains high, and where there is poor biosecurity there is an increased risk of kept birds becoming infected. It is therefore essential that strict biosecurity measures are in place until such time as birds are released. Further advice and links to other sources of advice can be found on GOV.UK. 25th August 2023 Changes to Permitted Bird Gatherings in England Bird gatherings include events where live birds and/or hatching eggs from multiple premises are bought together and remaining at the gathering location for 14 days or less in England and 13 days or less in Wales and Scotland, following the arrival of the last bird. Bird gatherings include (but are not limited to) bird fairs, markets, shows, sales, exhibitions, and some premises used for dealing or internet sales. In addition, vehicles used to transport live birds where the birds are brought together from multiple premises (so called many-to-one or many-to-many activities) are also considered bird gatherings. The risk of introduction and spread of HPAI H5N1 into bird fairs, shows, markets, sales and other gatherings in Great Britain has recently been reviewed and has been reassessed as now LOW for five of the six bird orders (namely Psittaciformes, Columbiformes, birds of prey, passerines, and Galliformes) but MEDIUM for Anseriformes (ducks and geese). Further information on the evidence that supports these risk levels can be found in our qualitative risk assessment on the likelihood of spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 associated with bird fairs, shows, markets, sales and other gatherings in Great Britain available as part of the ‘Animal diseases: international and UK monitoring’ collection on gov.uk. Bird gatherings are not permitted within a disease control zone, outside of these areas bird gatherings are only permitted if licensed. General licences permitting certain bird gatherings have been made available in England, Wales and Scotland. In England following a reduction in the risk levels associated with gatherings from 23 August 2023: Gatherings of Galliforme poultry and Galliforme birds are permitted in England provided they follow and meet all the requirements of the poultry gathering general licence and APHA are notified of the gathering at least 7 days before the event. Gatherings of all other types of birds except Anseriforme poultry and Anseriforme birds are permitted provided they follow and meet all the requirements of the captive bird gathering general licence or the poultry gathering general licence and APHA are notified of the gathering at least 7 days before the event. Gatherings of Anseriformes birds remain prohibited in England. Galliforme poultry and Galliforme birds from Wales and Scotland are not permitted to attend bird gatherings in England. Further guidance for bird gatherings and a full list of what is permitted in England has been published on GOV.UK. In Wales and Scotland, all gatherings of poultry (Galliforme and Anseriforme birds) remain prohibited. Gatherings of all other types of birds are permitted, excluding Galliforme and Anseriforme birds, provided they follow and meet all the requirements of the relevant bird gatherings general license made available by Welsh Government or Scottish Government and APHA are notified of the gathering at least 7 days before the event. 4th July 2023 The risk of avian influenza for all poultry has reduced to low (meaning the event is rare but does occur) and the Avian Influenza Prevention Zones for poultry and captive birds in England, Wales and Scotland have been lifted from midday on the 4 July 2023. Whilst the risk level in kept birds has reduced, the risk in wild birds remains high, and all bird keepers should continue to take steps to prevent bird flu and stop it spreading at all times, and be vigilant for signs of disease. All poultry gatherings, including at fairs, shows and markets, remain banned, due to a large number of flocks mixing together, and the risk posed by any infections spreading across the country. Additional mandatory restrictions apply in disease control zones in force surrounding infected premises where avian influenza has been confirmed in poultry or other captive birds. You can check if you’re in a disease control zone on the bird flu zone map and follow the rules for that zone. 11th April 2023 Mandatory housing measures for poultry and captive birds, which were introduced across England and Wales to help stop the spread of bird flu, will be lifted from 00:01 on Tuesday 18 April 2023, the Chief Veterinary Officer has confirmed today following the latest assessment of the risk level. Following ongoing monitoring using the latest scientific evidence and a robust risk assessment, bird flu risk levels have been reduced meaning poultry and other captive birds will no longer need to be housed and can be kept outside, unless they are in a Protection Zone. 30th March 2023Defra together with Welsh Government have published their updated Mitigation strategy for avian influenza in wild birds in England and Wales. The strategy, originally published in August 2022, provides guidance to conservation charities and land managers including local authorities on how to prepare and respond to suspected and confirmed findings of avian influenza in wild birds. The key updates reflect: the launch of the online reporting tool for dead wild birds; the outcome of risk assessments on gamebird release, waterfowl and game shooting, and carcass removal; establishment of the Defra-Welsh Government Avian Influenza Wild Bird Recovery Advisory Group and general guidance accessibility improvements. 13th January 2023 On Monday 9th January 2023 the National Avian Influenza Protection Zones (AIPZ's) that cover England, Scotland and Wales, were amended to include new mandatory requirements for those who catch-up gamebirds (pheasants, partridges or ducks). In England and Wales catching-up is legal until the end of the shooting season on 1 February. In Scotland, it is legal until 28 February. The catching-up of any birds is illegal after these dates. All birds that are caught up must be quarantined in a building or top netted-holding pen that eliminates contact with wild birds. This is to be for a minimum of 21 days after the last caught-up bird was introduced, before being moved to a new premises, shoot, game farm, or location other than where they were caught up. In all cases, accurate up to date records of all catching-up activity must be kept and must be available on demand to APHA/DEFRA. In Wales there is an additional requirement for all keepers of captive birds to complete a Self-Assessment checklist, which can be found here. Once caught up, previously wild birds are classed as poultry and will be subject to the same rules and regulations as other kept birds. Therefore, all relevant requirements under the relevant AIPZ must be complied with when dealing with caught-up birds. In England and Wales this includes mandatory housing measures in addition to the quarantine requirements. The answers to some frequently asked questions can be found below. Q. Why must caught-up birds be held for 21 days? A. To reduce the likelihood of Avian Influenza being spread by caught-up gamebirds that are being moved to another location. This is in line with many other disease control and prevention policies. 21 days is deemed long enough for any presence of infection, even if only in one or two birds, to spread to other birds in the flock, and become noticeable. Q. What happens if I wish to move birds from my premises before the 21-day period is up? A. You will need to apply for a license from the relevant authority in your home country. However, it is unlikely that this would be granted unless there was an essential reason to permit such movement. Q. Can I still catch up if I am in a 3km Protection Zone (PZ), a 10km Surveillance Zone (SZ), or a 3km Captive Bird Monitoring Zone (CPBZ)? A. Yes, but you cannot move caught-up birds off your premises until the zone has been lifted, and you are no longer in a restricted area. If any part of your premises is in one of the disease control zones then the whole premises is deemed to be in that zone. You can check if you are affected by any of the disease control zones by looking at the APHA interactive map here. Click on the search icon in the top left corner and enter your postcode to see your exact location on the map. Q. If my premises is not affected by any disease control zones (PZ, SZ or CBMZ) and I catch-up birds and observe the new quarantine requirements, can I then move the birds to a new location inside a disease control zone? A. Such a movement will need a licence from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). The granting of a licence will be at the discretion of APHA and will depend on a range of factors, mostly centred around biosecurity and record keeping on the site of origin, and the site of destination. Q. If Avian Influenza (AI) was found in wild birds either on our shoot or nearby, can I still catch-up? A. There is no law preventing this, but common sense suggests that it will be very risky. DEFRA, Scottish Government and Welsh Government are all strongly advising keepers not to catch-up if they are in an area known to have, or have had, AI. Q. What happens if caught-up birds are infected with AI? A. Once caught up, previously wild birds are classed as poultry / captive. If they contract AI, your premises will become an Infected Premises (IP) and be treated like any other IP. All birds on site will be culled and restrictions will be placed on the premises. Q. Do I need to complete the Poultry Register for caught up birds? A. It is a legal requirement to complete the register if you keep 50 or more captive birds for any period of time, and this includes gamebirds. You can find more details, and register, here. You should also sign up for poultry alerts which will provide early details of any suspected or confirmed cases. Q. What other precautions should I be taking? A. The AIPZ's which affect the whole of the UK requires keepers of birds to observe specified standards of biosecurity. Enhanced standards apply for keepers of more than 500 birds. Once birds have ben caught-up they become captive birds, and the keeper of those birds is subject to the mandatory obligations placed on them by the AIPZ. You can find details of the AIPZ for England here, for Wales here, and for Scotland here. 13th December Defra has launched a new online reporting system to report dead wild birds in Great Britain, as part of the response to the ongoing avian influenza outbreak. The new online system will be available to use 24/7, making it simpler and quicker for the public to report dead wild birds. It will not replace the Defra helpline, which will remain in place. They have advised that in Great Britain members of the public should use the new online reporting system or call the Defra helpline (03459 33 55 77) if they find one or more dead birds of prey (such as an owl, hawk or buzzard), three or more dead birds that include at least one gull, swan, goose or duck or five or more dead wild birds of any species. APHA and their contractors then collect some of these birds and test them to help us understand what risk posed to poultry and other captive birds is through understanding how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of wild bird, not all birds will be collected. The new system can be accessed here. 8th December Through our contacts in government, we have been made aware that the European Commission has announced their intention to consider (among other things) changing their surveillance requirements for imported poultry eggs and birds from Disease Control Zones, from a minimum of 90 days to a minimum of 30 days for international trade with all third (non-EU) countries. If this proposal was to be approved and adopted, and if the government made a reciprocal change, this has the potential to alleviate some of the problems experienced by our sector this year due to the Avian Influenza outbreak in France, should such an outbreak occur again in the future. However, we are currently unable to say whether these changes will be approved, or how long such changes would take to be implemented. We will of course, let you know as soon as we have more information. 30th November New mandatory biosecurity and housing measures for all poultry and captive birds in Wales are to be introduced on 2nd December, following a decision by the interim Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales. The introduction of biosecurity and housing measures comes after surveillance of avian influenza suggests a heightened risk of disease for Wales over the winter months. Bringing Wales in line with current guidelines in England, from this date it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separated from wild birds. Keepers must also complete and act upon a bespoke biosecurity review of the premises where birds are kept. This is to minimise the risk of virus entry in bird houses, which usually results in high mortality. These new measures are in addition to those in the Wales Avian Influenza Prevention Zone, which remain crucially important. Bird keepers are encouraged to prepare for the introduction of the new measures, by making sure housing is suitable, with the housed environment enhanced to protect bird welfare. Keepers should consult their vet for advice where needed. A copy of the biosecurity checklist can be found here. 31st October Mandatory housing measures for all poultry and captive birds are to be introduced to all areas of England from 00:01 on Monday 7 November, following a decision by the United Kingdom's Chief Veterinary Officer. The housing measures legally require all bird keepers to keep their birds indoors and to follow stringent biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the disease, regardless of type or size. The order will extend the mandatory housing measures already in force in the hot spot area of Suffolk, Norfolk and parts of Essex to the whole of England following an increase in the national risk of bird flu in wild birds to very high. The addition of housing measures to the AIPZ already in force across England means all bird keepers across England must: housing or netting all poultry and captive birds cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control keep records of mortality, movement of poultry and poultry products and any changes in production thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds prevent access by poultry to ponds and watercourses and ensure that birds are kept in fenced or enclosed areas 18th October It is incumbent on the shooting community to play its part in helping to reduce the spread and impact of the current outbreak of Avian Influenza. To this end, we, alongside our partners in Aim to Sustain, have created this useful Q&A to help all in the shooting world understand how they can reduce the possibility of spreading AI through their activities. This is not an exhaustive list and will be updated as the situation evolves. It should help most people ensure their activities minimise the chances of spreading AI. It is vital that the shooting community continues to behave responsibly. It can be accessed here. 17th October Following an increase in the number of detections of avian influenza (bird flu) in wild birds and on commercial premises, the Chief Veterinary Officers from England, Scotland and Wales have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) across Great Britain to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading amongst poultry and captive birds. This means that from midday on Monday 17 October, it is a legal requirement for all bird keepers in Great Britain to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the threat of avian flu. Biosecurity guidance and a biosecurity self-assessment checklists have been published on each of the GB administration's website to assist all bird keepers in instigating and maintaining good biosecurity: England Scotland Wales 28th September There are reports of game birds being infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) by other wild birds, particularly gulls and wildfowl, in several areas across England and Wales. It is important to stress that these cases are isolated, however it is of the utmost importance that strict biosecurity measures are adhered to by those involved in the management of game. Game shooting has already been hugely affected by the spread of HPAI in the UK, this year facing a shortage of poults and eggs from France that has already proved devastating for some. Of concern is the longer-term impact that shooting brings to biodiversity and habitat creation, as if investment is not made into the associated land management practices, the environment will suffer. The latest advice can be found here. 16th August The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) has now been lifted in England. The latest information can be found here. Although this is very good news, it is still important that thorough bio security measures are followed as Avian Influenza is still present in the UK. 25th April The mandatory housing measures for poultry and captive birds, which were introduced across the United Kingdom to help stop the spread of bird flu, will be lifted from 00:01 on Monday 2 May 2022, the Chief Veterinary Officers have confirmed today. Poultry and other captive birds will no longer need to be housed, unless they are in a Protection Zone, and will be allowed to be kept outside. While the risk of bird flu has been reduced to 'medium' for premises with poor biosecurity, the enhanced biosecurity requirements that were brought in as part of the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) will remain in force as infection may still be circulating in the environment for several more weeks. All poultry gatherings will remain banned. Those who intend to allow their birds outside are advised to use the upcoming days to prepare their outside areas for the release of their birds. This will include cleansing and disinfection of hard surfaces, fencing off ponds or standing water and reintroduction of wild bird deterrents. The UK has faced its largest ever outbreak of bird flu with over 100 cases confirmed across the country since late October. Scrupulous biosecurity is the most effective method of disease control available and all bird keepers should apply enhanced measures at all times to prevent the risk of future outbreaks. The AIPZ will remain in force across the UK, with only the housing measures component being lifted from Monday 2nd May. This means all bird keepers (whether they have pet birds, a commercial sized, or a backyard flock) must be diligent in continuing to take effective and precautionary biosecurity measures. These include: cleansing and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles; limiting access to non-essential people on their sites; and workers changing clothing and footwear before entering and when leaving bird enclosures. Bird keepers must continue to look out for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns. Adrian Blackmore, the Alliance's Director of Shooting, said: "The lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news to bird keepers, some of whom have had to keep their birds indoors since 21 November last year. Biosecurity remains the most critical form of defence to help keep your birds safe, and it is vital that bird keepers remain vigilant for any signs of disease, and maintain stringent standards of security at all times." It is therefore extremely important that bird keepers: cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – and if practical use disposable protective clothing. reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control. thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points. minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds. Defra is encouraging all bird keepers to register their flocks with the Animal and Plant Health Agency. For poultry this is a legal requirement if you have 50 or more birds (poultry includes chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants). In Northern Ireland, this applies to all birds except those kept within your home. Registration forms are available here or by contacting your local DAERA Direct Regional Office. If registered, you will be contacted and informed of any action that is required should an outbreak of Avian Influenza occur near you.

Cynthia Reinoso Webb. (Courtesy photo.) The case was made public in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Steve Presley, the director of The Institute of Environmental and Human Health and the BTRL, and Cynthia Reinoso Webb, the biological threat coordinator at TIEHH, were co-authors on the journal publication. She is pictured here. The journal article explains that in March a farm worker who reported no contact with sick or dead birds, but who was in contact with dairy cattle, began showing symptoms in the eye and samples were collected by the regional health department to test for potential influenza A. Initial testing Initial testing of the samples was performed at the BTRL, which is a component of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Laboratory Response Network-Biological (LRN-B) located at TIEHH. “It’s a huge thing that the virus has jumped from birds to mammals, dairy cows in this case, and then to humans,” Presley said. “That’s why this paper in the New England Journal of Medicine is very significant. It’s going to lay the foundation, I believe, for a lot of research in the future of how the virus is evolving.” The involvement of Texas Tech’s BTRL is a continuation of the partnership between regional, state and federal public health partners. “Being part of the CDC LRN-B, we have the standing capability to test for a lot of biological threats and some that are considered emergent,” Reinoso Webb said. Response time The lab’s standby status allowed Reinoso Webb and the Texas Tech BTRL team to respond quickly to the needs of the regional public health authority. Knowing the potential dangers of the virus, Reinoso Webb pushed the testing into the safest laboratory available, and the team went to work. Having received the samples in the early evening, results were being reported to regional, state and federal levels within hours. By the next day the samples were on their way to the CDC for further testing and confirmation. “We were on the phone with the CDC until around midnight discussing different scenarios and follow up requirements,” Reinoso Webb said. “There is a lot of federal reporting. It was a very complicated case, even though it was two samples and one patient. “But we had this wonderful communication with the CDC and made sure we did everything by the book. This is how it’s been structured, and this is how the communication was supposed to happen.” TAGS: Cynthia Reinoso Webb, dairy, Steve Presley, texas tech university, Texas Tech University's Biological Threat Research Laboratory Trending Now Follow HPJ: Search HPJSearch Corn Cotton Livestock Soybean Wheat Related Articles Texas Tech unveils renovations to historic dairy barn Missouri dairy producers have their eyes on the drought Dairy webinar outlines how Inflation Reduction Act affects farmers Deadline extended to enroll in 2022 Dairy Margin Coverage, Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage Facebook LinkedIn Twitter YouTube Newsletters Advertise Explore HPJAg Cares Livestock Crops Opinion HPJ EventsCattle U Soil Health U Alfalfa U Cotton U Sorghum U Wheat U Wheat and Sorghum U Subscriber ServicesDigital Edition Subscribe to HPJ My Account Bill Payment Change of Address Forgot Password Manage Auto Renewal About HPJAbout Us Contact Us Advertise With Us Promote Your Event Terms of Service Privacy Policy Acceptable Use Return Policy High Plains Journal is a publisher of agricultural news, information, and analysis for farmers, ranchers, and agribusiness professionals across the High Plains region.

Share Bird flu found in western China as US combats cattle outbreak share Print BEIJING — Cases of bird flu have been confirmed among wild fowl in western China, the agriculture ministry said Saturday, as concerns grow over a U.S. outbreak infecting cattle. Two counties in Qinghai province confirmed 275 cases of H5 influenza among dead Pallas's gull and other wild birds, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a notice on its website. The ministry received a report on the cases from the China Animal Disease Control Center, and the national Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed the finding, the notice said. The H5N1 outbreak among dairy cattle in at least nine U.S. states since late March has raised questions over whether it could spread to humans. No such cases have been reported. The U.S. announced on May 11 that it would spend close to $200 million to fight the outbreak. News of the China bird flu cases came as the nation's anti-graft watchdog announced a corruption probe of the agriculture minister Saturday. Tang Renjian, 61, is under investigation for "serious violations of discipline and law" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission, CCDI said on its website. The term is CCDI's typical euphemism for corruption. The notice gave no further details.

But scaling up the supply could take timeBy Hannah Docter-LoebA lab technician demonstrates injecting eggs with a sample of the H5N1 bird flu virus. Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe infection of dozens of cattle herds in the U.S. with the avian influenza virus H5N1 has raised concerns about whether the pathogen, which frequently infects poultry and wild birds, could spread more widely in humans. While the virus has circulated in birds many times in the past few years, it is now infecting mammals that come into contact with humans on a regular basis.“The concerning part is: there seems to be a lot of human contact with these viruses through cattle,” says Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. “That could change the equation very quickly.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many experts maintain that the public health risk is still very low. And in the U.S. only two cases have ever been reported in humans, one of whom was infected with the strain that is currently circulating in cattle. Nevertheless, the federal government, pharmaceutical companies and researchers are all preparing in case mass vaccination of people against H5N1 ever becomes necessary.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

But experts have expressed concerns about the U.S.’s ability to create and distribute enough vaccines, as well as about the question of whether the vaccines will hold up against circulating strains.The CDC is constantly screening circulating bird flu strains and updating vaccines accordingly. There are currently two candidate vaccine viruses that are well matched to the currently circulating strain. The National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile has around several hundred thousand filled vials and syringes that could be deployed during an initial wave of vaccination. And these vaccines are not that old: they are left over from recent and ongoing clinical trials, says David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness and response at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR).ASPR also has materials on hand to make additional vaccines. “We have a pretty large stockpile of bulk antigen [the part of the virus that a vaccine targets], and we also stockpile adjuvant [a substance that increases the body’s immune response to the vaccine] so that we have the two main building blocks of vaccines if we need to pivot over to manufacturing,” Boucher says. He estimates it would be the equivalent of several million doses, produced over three to four months.The U.S. government also has partnerships with three pharmaceutical companies: GSK, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi. These companies have seasonal influenza production capacity and say they would be able to scale up production of avian flu vaccines if needed.“We would have to weigh this against interrupting seasonal [flu vaccine] production, but if we did enter into that, we would be looking at tens of millions of doses available in the next four or five months—approximately over 100 million in the first four months of production,” Boucher says.But there are some nuances that would make it difficult to scale up an avian flu vaccine, Doron says. For one, the current candidate vaccines are egg-based, which is a bit of a logistical issue: the virus can kill the chickens that produce the eggs needed for a flu vaccine. The U.S. keeps a secret chicken stockpile to avoid any contamination and maintain security, however. “We have a supply of eggs that has a biosecurity fence around it, so we’re not, at this moment, concerned about supply of eggs,” Boucher says.Candidate bird flu vaccines can be used in both egg- and cell-based cultures (which are grown in a lab dish), says Luis Martinez-Sobrido, a molecular biologist at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute, who is currently working on such vaccines in conjunction with the CDC.CSL Seqirus manufactures an FDA-approved cell-based H5N1 vaccine called AUDENZ. According to a company spokesperson, CSL Seqirus’s vaccine manufacturer, located in North Carolina, could deliver up to 150 million doses of cell-based pandemic influenza vaccine within six months of an influenza pandemic declaration.There is also some skepticism about how vaccines would hold up against newer strains of H5N1. Just as the virus that causes COVID mutates and necessitates updates to the vaccine, so, too, would H5N1.“It’s one of the concerns that we have anytime we have a virus percolating in a new species,” Boucher says. “But where we are right now, with the candidate vaccine virus that’s well matched, we would not expect a rapid decline in effectiveness if we used it.”Additionally, a recent report from the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the H5N1 virus in the dairy farmer who was recently infected had a gene that affects how the pathogen binds to cells that is commonly associated with viral adaptation in mammals, and also had proteins very closely related to that of the evolutionary group of the virus that is targeted by the existing candidate vaccine.” This bodes well for the ability of the vaccine to protect humans, at least against severe illness and death.One way to counter mutating viruses is by creating a messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine like those developed to protect against COVID because it could be easily tailored toward circulating strains. “When you’re tracking a virus that can evolve, you would like to be able to pivot quickly,” Boucher says, noting that adaptability was key for the COVID vaccines. “When that virus evolved to a place where it was a little too different from the vaccine we were using, we changed the sequence of the mRNA.”Boucher says that his team at ASPR has sent a solicitation out to companies who might be able to partner with the group and that he and his colleagues may have more to announce in the coming weeks.Biotech company Moderna is conducting a phase 2 trial of an mRNA vaccine that targets the same evolutionary group as the avian influenza virus that is causing outbreaks in the U.S. The company believes it could be adapted easily to new mutations.“As we’ve seen with our COVID-19 vaccines, one feature of our mRNA platform is that vaccines can be quickly updated to address the latest strains,” wrote a spokesperson for Moderna in an e-mail to Scientific American.Academic researchers are also working on developing their own mRNA vaccines. Hensley and his colleagues have posted a preprint paper, which was recently accepted for publication in a scientific journal, that demonstrated that their mRNA H5N1 vaccine elicited very strong immune responses in both mice and ferrets. It hasn’t been tested in humans, though.“The vaccine appears to do what it is designed to do, [which] is to elicit very strong neutralizing antibodies against these new H5 clades [evolutionary groups] and to protect animals from infection,” Hensley says. (He notes that the virus has mutated a bit since the studies began but that the changes are fairly minor, and the vaccine can be updated accordingly.)Experts emphasize vaccines are also just one part of a pandemic response. Behavioral changes are also key to reducing viral transmission.“This is definitely not a panic-worthy situation,” Doron says. “But there are things that all people should be doing, and then there are some things that people who work with animals should be doing.” She advises the general public to avoid unpasteurized milk and to limit contact with wild or farm animals. She adds that those who come into contact with these animals should wear personal protective equipment.Both Doron and Martinez-Sobrido emphasize the importance of validating and developing new antiviral medications for H5N1. The virus is likely susceptible to current flu treatments such as Tamiflu, but researchers have highlighted the need for more robust antivirals.“If this virus jumps to humans, it’s going to take a while for the CDC to produce [a] large amount of the vaccines to vaccinate everybody,” Martinez-Sobrido says. “We need drugs that will be our first line of defense against the virus until everybody has access to the vaccine.”Rights & PermissionsHannah Docter-Loeb is a freelance writer based in Washington, D.C.More by Hannah Docter-LoebExpand Your World with ScienceLearn and share the most exciting discoveries, innovations and ideas shaping our world today.SubscribeSign up for our newslettersSee the latest storiesRead the latest issueGive a Gift SubscriptionFollow Us:Return & Refund PolicyAboutPress RoomFAQsContact UsInternational EditionsAdvertiseAccessibility StatementTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCalifornia Consumer Privacy StatementUse of cookies/Do not sell my dataScientific American is part of Springer Nature, which owns or has commercial relations with thousands of scientific publications (many of them can be found at www.springernature.com/us).

The medical science community is on alert after recent reports of bird flu outbreaks across the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been more than 90 million poultry impacted by bird flu, also known as H5N1, as well as 46 herds of dairy cows, as of Tuesday. 24/7 San Diego news stream: Watch NBC 7 free wherever you are As for the virus spreading to humans, the second human case was reported in April 2024 in Texas. The CDC said the person was exposed to dairy cows through work. Their only symptom was eye redness, and they were able to recover. “It’s a Type A flu, so it’s Influenza A, and it manifests the same way as influenza, with high temperatures,” Dr. Francesca Torriani, an infectious disease specialist and the medical director of Infection Prevention and Clinical Epidemiology for UC San Diego Health, told NBC 7. Get top local stories in San Diego delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC San Diego's News Headlines newsletter. Torriani explained that the symptoms appear to be mild in the rare human cases reported. According to the CDC, chickens are the most impacted, with outbreaks in nearly every state, including one in San Diego County. Dairy cows have not been nearly as affected. Nine states have reported outbreaks among their cattle, as of Tuesday. However, that’s not what medical experts like Torriani are worried about. “Dairy cows [are] less of a concern, but as some other people in the scientific community have pointed out, where we are concerned is if this could be translated to pigs,” Torriani said. Pigs, Torriani continued, have a variety of influenza strains that could make bird flu more easily transmitted to humans. Still, based on the research currently available, she clarified there should not be cause for concern.

One of those surveillance measures includes looking at wastewater testing throughout the state. As of the latest report, shared with NBC 7 by a spokesperson for the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency, some areas in California, including Indio and Riverside, have seen upward trends in Influenza A. This would include, but is not limited to, bird flu. However, the spokesperson added, San Diego has only seen a slight uptick and numbers are still much lower than they were during flu season. Torriani shared that more testing and surveillance is expected on a national level to keep an eye on H5N1. The CDC has tips on its website to protect yourself from bird flu, including avoiding dead birds, if you come across them.

Previous research has investigated the antimicrobial properties of proline-linked CDPs and their combinations in the culture filtrate (CF) of Lactobacillus plantarum LBP-K10 using anion exchange chromatography (AEC). However, the quantity of CDPs showcasing notable anti-influenza virus activity derived from AECs was generally lower than those originating from Lactobacillus CF.Methods: To address this issue, the study aims to propose a more efficient method for isolating CDPs and to introduce the antiviral combinations of CDPs obtained using a new method. The study employed a novel technique entailing high-throughput C18-based solid-phase extraction with a methanol gradient (MeSPE). The MeSPE method involved increasing the methanol concentration from 5% to 50% in 5% increments.Results: The methanol SPE fractions (MeSPEfs) eluted with methanol concentrations between 35% and 45% evinced substantial efficacy in inhibiting the influenza A/H3N2 virus via plaque-forming assay. MeSPEf-45, the 45% MeSPEf, exhibited exceptional efficacy in preventing viral infections in Madin-Darby kidney cells, surpassing both individual CDPs and the entire set of MeSPEfs. To identify the specific antiviral components of MeSPEf-45, all MeSPEfs were further fractionated through preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC). MeSPEf-45 fractions S8 and S11 presented the highest activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and influenza A/H3N2 virus among all MeSPEfs, with 11 common fractions. Antiviral fractions S8 and S11 were identified as proline-based CDPs, specifically cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The combination of MeSPEf-45 fractions S8 and S11 displayed superior antibacterial and anti-influenza virus effects compared to the individual fractions S8 and S11.Discussion: High-throughput MeSPE-derived MeSPEfs and subsequent HPLC-fractionated fractions presents an innovative approach to selectively purify large amounts of potent antimicrobial CDPs from bacterial CF. The findings also show the effectiveness of physiologically bioactive combinations that utilize fractions not containing CDP. This study provides the initial evidence demonstrating the antimicrobial properties of CDPs acquired through high-throughput SPE techniques.IntroductionPostbiotics, which are derived from microbiome research, consist of metabolic byproducts, non-viable microbial cells, and their components (Aggarwal et al., 2022). These postbiotics exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities, resulting in various physiological, immunological, neuro-hormonal, regulatory, and metabolic reactions (Ji et al., 2015; Cuevas-González et al., 2020). Postbiotics produced by microorganisms include physiologically active and antiviral substances found in the culture filtrates (CFs) of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (AI Kassaa et al., 2014; Archer and Halami, 2015). The filtrates primarily consist of low-molecular-weight compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), organic acids (RCOOH, RSOOOH, ROH), diacetyl [(CH₃CO)₂)], acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO) (Rouse and van Sinderen, 2008; Crowley et al., 2013). The CFs contain proteinaceous or peptidic toxins known as bacteriocins, which are the most abundant and diverse group of bacterial defense systems. Probiotics and their prebiotics have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and disease therapeutic potential (Özogul and Hamed, 2018; Sharma et al., 2021). Additionally, 2,5-diketopiperazines (2,5-DKPs), the simplest form of cyclic dipeptides (CDPs), offer a promising avenue for drug development. CDPs have the potential to serve as reservoirs for medically significant antiviral compounds due to their distinctive orbital and target-specific chirality, diverse structural nature, and potential application of cyclotides and relevant peptide scaffolds for creating novel bioactive molecules based on DKPs in the pharmaceutical sector (Borthwick, 2012; Bellezza et al., 2014). CDP derivatives, obtained from natural sources or chemical synthesis, are essential active compounds with diverse biological functions. These properties include bacterial quorum sensing, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects, neuroprotective functions, and serving as carriers for essential molecules through the blood-brain barrier (Martins and Carvalho, 2007). CDPs offer simple yet effective structures for self-assembly, enabling molecular recognition, water solubility, thermal stability, biocompatibility, and versatile structures for developing new therapeutic approaches with improved effectiveness and fewer side effects (Manchineella et al., 2017). A self-assembly is the process of linking molecules through noncovalent interactions to form functional systems known as supermolecules. It can be observed in living organisms, from bacteria to humans. The arrangement of bio-machinery, such as the DNA double helix, ribosomes, enzymes’ quaternary structure, and bio-entities like cell membranes, collagen’s helical structure, or cytoskeleton, is essential (Manchineella and Govindaraju, 2017). Non-covalent interactions at the supramolecular level create systems that aid in understanding bio-processes and developing innovative bio-materials. These materials can enhance 3D cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (Chibh et al., 2021).The significance of CDPs lies in their effectiveness as antimicrobial agents and their physiological implications for human diseases. Cyclo(His-Leu), originating from Bacillus subtilis B38, displays both antimicrobial and antioxidative properties (Elkahoui et al., 2013). Cyclo(L-Pro-D-Arg), produced by Bacillus cereus, a bacterium associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode, acts as a negative regulator of chitinase enzyme activity and has antibacterial and antitumor effects (Kumar et al., 2014). Cyclo(dehydroAla-Leu) and cis-cyclo(prolyl-valyl), synthesized by Penicillium sp. F70614 and Pediococcus italicum FUN2 respectively, exhibit inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase activity (Kwon et al., 2000; Nagia et al., 2012). High doses of cyclo(His-Pro) combined with zinc effectively lower hyperglycemia and blood glucose levels in both healthy human subjects and obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice (Uyemura et al., 2010; Jung et al., 2016). Cyclo(His-Phe) and cyclo(His-Tyr) demonstrate inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria and fungi. These CDPs affect intracellular ion channels, leading to cell death in cervical (HeLa), esophageal (WHCO3), and breast (MCF-7) carcinoma cell lines (McCleland et al., 2004). Additionally, CDPs prove to be highly effective in treating a range of conditions, such as dermatitis, dementia, diabetes mellitus, pancreatic disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders (Tsuruoka et al., 2012; Song et al., 2018). Despite the extensive research on the effects of CDPs on pathogenic microorganisms and human diseases, there remains a lack of studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the antiviral properties of CDPs. However, the majority of studies on CDPs reveal antibacterial activity, with some suggesting antifungal effects. The prior research presents proof of the antimicrobial properties of CDPs, such as cyclo(dehydroAla-Leu), cis-cyclo(prolyl-valyl), cyclo(Pro-Trp), cyclo(Phe-Pro), cyclo(Trp-Pro), and cyclo(Trp-Trp) (Graz et al., 1999). These findings suggest that the potential of CDPs lies in their ability to inhibit the proliferation of virulent virus strains in vitro (Martins and Carvalho, 2007; Lee et al., 2018). Cyclo(Leu-Pro) from Goishi tea, along with proline-containing CDPs from Lactobacillus plantarum LBP-K10 display inhibitory effects against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses (Kwak et al., 2013; Yoshioka, 2013). Cyclo(Phe-Tyr) and cyclo(Ala-Ile) derived from Moslae Herba exhibit antiviral activity against both the H1N1 and H3N2 strains of the influenza A virus (Zhang et al., 2018).We previously reported two types of proline-containing CDPs produced by Lb. plantarum LBP-K10, namely, cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), which exhibit activity against influenza A (H3N2) virus (Kwak et al., 2013). We further studied the antimicrobial effects of various proline-based CDPs acquired via anion exchange chromatography (AEC) by utilizing Amberlite IRA-67 and Purolite A420S resins to remove organic acids and sugars from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF. Even though AECs aid in investigating the combined synergistic activity of CDP mixtures against pathogenic microbes, their use in experiments presents several limitations and challenges. To improve the accuracy of our findings, we aimed to validate a new experimental technique that employs high-throughput solid-phase extraction (SPE) in combination with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) fractionation.In this study, we put forward a hypothesis regarding the potential production of CDPs dependent on biosynthesizing building blocks. These CDPs may play a role as biologically antiviral agents, particularly focusing on the yet undiscovered synergistic effect between small compounds 2,5-DKPs. These compounds are experimentally expected to be derived from the combination of LAB-fermented raw material CFs and methanol-based SPE techniques. Previous research has shown that antimicrobial CDPs containing proline, derived from bacterial CFs and naturally fermented plant-based foods, commonly exhibit antagonistic and antimicrobial activities (Kwak et al., 2018). Previous studies have investigated CDPs originating from both plants and animals. For example, CDPs sourced from plants like kimchi and CDPs from animals were discovered after enriching quail eggs with probiotics (Liu et al., 2017; Kang and Kwak, 2024). However, the experimental trials in this study differ significantly from our prior research in that they significantly reduce the loss of CDP yields through a newly used method. Through the functions of sample concentration and purification, SPE effectively circumvents these issues. Furthermore, SPE is highly compatible when combined with HPLC or HPLC-MS, making it the most effective and versatile method for sample pretreatment (Yan et al., 2008). Liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) are currently the most extensively used methods to detect trace amounts of dipeptidyl molecules in water due to their high selectivity and sensitivity (Shimada et al., 2001). However, exact determination of trace analytes is impossible without sample preparation due to their extremely low concentration, which is usually lower than the instrumental limit of detection (LOD), and complex matrices that result in ionization suppression of electrospray ionization (ESI) (Laganà et al., 2000; Beck et al., 2008). A proper sorbent is crucial for SPE procedures to guarantee adequate recovery and extraction efficiency. The most frequently utilized sorbents in SPE are C18 bonded silica and a variety of polymeric materials. These sorbents are deemed suitable for the traditional analysis of trace analytes in low-concentration solutions. In the pursuit of high throughput and reduced solvent usage, there has been a surge of interest in the exploration and production of novel materials for application as sorbents in SPE methods. This trend has gained significant momentum in the past decade, signifying a vibrant area of research and development in SPE methodologies.It is currently unknown whether any form of CDP or its derivatives can be detected through SPE experiments. Based on our hypothesis, this study aimed to investigate the effect of SPE resins on the yield of antiviral CDPs, due to the unique performance of SPE. The combination of C18-based SPE-derived fractions showed greater activity against influenza A virus compared to the CDP mixtures obtained from AEC. This technique provides a more efficient purification strategy for larger quantities of antiviral CDPs.Materials and methodsStrains and culture conditionThe bacterial and viral strains used in this study are listed (Table 1). The Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 strain was grown on either de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar or broth, and consistently maintained in modified MRS (mMRS, MRS without beef extract) broth, as previously described (Kwak et al., 2018).Table 1 Table 1. The bacterial and viral strains employed in this study consist of Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant bacteria, bacterial indicator strains, and the influenza A/H3N2 virus.Inoculum grown overnight, equivalent to 0.1% of the total volume of the mMRS liquid medium, was utilized for the cultivation of LAB strains. The bacterial inoculum culture was introduced into 4 L of fresh mMRS liquid medium and incubated in a stationary incubator at 30°C for 72 h. The mMRS broth was prepared by combining 2% D-glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium acetate (CH3COONa), 0.2% ammonium citrate dibasic (C6H14N2O7), 0.2% dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4), 0.005% manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O), and 0.01% magnesium sulfate anhydrous (MgSO4). It did not contain any peptone. A 3-day culture of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 was utilized to prepare C18-based SPE fractions. To compare the HPLC fractionation patterns, we cultured other isolates, such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides LBP-K06 and Pediococcus pentosaceus LBP-K17, in the same manner.Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial indicators, as well as multidrug-resistant bacteria, were used to evaluate antibacterial activity. The study utilized multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 11,471 and Streptococcus pneumoniae 14,596, along with the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium 12,219.The influenza A (H3N2) virus was employed to induce infection and evaluate the efficacy of antiviral interventions. All bacterial pathogens and the influenza A (H3N2) virus were obtained from the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH).SPE fraction preparationThe culture supernatant of LBP K-10 was concentrated 10-fold prior to freeze-drying. The concentrated supernatant underwent a 24-h liquid-liquid extraction with five times its volume of methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) employing a separating funnel. Subsequently, the organic phase was lyophilized by evaporation at 55°C. The CH2Cl2-extracted samples were eventually adjusted to a final volume of 1 mL and underwent SPE using a C18 SPE resin (Waters Sep-Pak C18 Plus cartridge, Millipore Corp., UK). Before this process, the SPE resins were sequentially activated and rinsed with 15 mL of 100% methanol and TDW. Once the sample loading was complete, the SPE resins were equilibrated with TDW. The samples were then loaded onto the SPE resins and eluted using a methanol gradient, increasing in increments of 5% from 5% up to 50%. A stepwise gradient with incremental increases of 5% in methanol concentration was used to facilitate hydrophobic interaction. The eluted solutions were collected and evaporated to remove any remaining organic solvents. The samples were then dissolved in an appropriate amount of TDW for antiviral assays or HPLC fractionation. The resulting samples comprise the following: MeSPEf-5, MeSPEf-10, MeSPEf-15, MeSPEf-20, MeSPEf-25, MeSPEf-30, MeSPEf-35, MeSPEf-40, MeSPEf-45, and MeSPEf-50, representing methanol SPE fractions of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, and 50%. Unless otherwise specified, this study refers to methanol SPE fractions and methanol SPE eluates as MeSPEfs. Furthermore, the methanol-based SPE experiment is referred to as the MeSPE.HPLCTo identify the compounds present in the samples obtained via MeSPE, the MeSPEfs were fractionated using an Agilent prep-HPLC system equipped with CHEMSTATION software. The system utilized a C18 octadecyl bonded silica (ODS) Hypersil column (9.4 mm × 250 mm) with diode array detector (Agilent, USA). The concentration of every fraction obtained from the MeSPEfs was ascertained through prep-HPLC analysis. The column was maintained at a constant temperature of 40°C. The mobile phase consisted of 67% water, 3% acetonitrile (ACN), and 30% methanol. The wavelengths used were 210 nm, 260 nm, and 280 nm. Each fraction obtained from the MeSPEfs was collected, concentrated through evaporation, and then freeze-dried to obtain powder samples.Antiviral assayAntiviral activity was determined using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as the host cells, as previously described (Kwak et al., 2013). MDCK cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) for the plaque assay. A semi-confluent layer of 500,000 MDCK cells was transferred to six-well culture plates for further cultivation. The cells covered about 90%–95% of the surface area of 90 mm × 15 mm cell culture dishes. After infection with influenza A (H3N2) virus, the cells were cultured for 60 h. Samples in the six-well plates were then inoculated with the virus at a concentration of 2.8 × 107 PFU/mL. To evaluate the plaque-forming assay, we employed cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) analogs, purchased from Bachem (Switzerland), as a reference experiment.Antibacterial activity assayThe antibacterial activity of the isolated MeSPEfs was evaluated using established methods. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using a broth microdilution assay in accordance with the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (Wikler, 2006). The MeSPEfs were assessed for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial indicators, as well as multidrug-resistant bacteria, as previously described (Kwak et al., 2018).The MeSPEfs were diluted twice to concentrations between 400 and 3.125 μg/mL. After 17-h incubation at 37°C, the MIC was determined. The MeSPEfs’ minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), defined as the lowest concentration resulting in >99.9% reduction of initial inoculum growth, was measured. The evaluation of antibacterial activity of MeSPEfs utilized bacterial indicators and multidrug-resistant bacteria at a concentration of 5 × 105 CFU/mL (Wiegand et al., 2008).Mass analysisTo perform electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) of each fraction, we used GC-MS (Agilent, Germany), as described previously (Kwak et al., 2013). A chromatographic system consisting of an Agilent 6,890 series GC equipped with a 7,679 series automatic liquid sampler was used. Mass analysis was performed using a high-resolution mass spectrometer (JEOL JMS-700, Japan).Statistical analysisData are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis of data gathered during experimental trials to determine the CDP content and antimicrobial activity among the groups. The level of significance was set at p = 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the STATISTICA 6.0 software package (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK).Results and discussionThe most potent antiviral CF derived from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10Various CDPs have been achieved using CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF (Figure 1). Alternatively, combining Amberlite IRA-67 and Purolite A420S AEC resins can also yield CDPs by effectively removing organic acids, sugars, and impurities from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF and facilitating the isolation of combined CDP mixtures. These mixtures show noteworthy anti-influenza A (H3N2) viral effects, surpassing those of an individual CDP. Nonetheless, limitations exist in preparing AECs to efficiently obtain CDPs. AECs-derived CDPs demonstrate significantly lower amounts than those acquired from Lactobacillus CFs. The AEC process is costly, time-consuming, and generally ineffective in gathering CDPs. From a biosynthetic perspective, naturally occurring CDPs are recognized for their efficacy and biodegradability; nevertheless, their production yield is limited (Tareq et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2019). Laboratory experiments investigating CDPs-microbial induction have encountered certain limitations. While it is possible to produce CDPs from microorganisms using an expression system, the optimization process is time-consuming and not straightforward (Nielsen et al., 2019). To address this issue, we propose a new method to efficiently obtain extremely potent antiviral CDPs via high-throughput C18-based SPE, instead of AECs.Figure 1 Figure 1. The CDP production by Lb. plantarum LBP-K10. The provided figure illustrates the chromatographic profile of the individual CDP fractions acquired from the CF of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10. The filtrate obtained following a 3-day growth of LBP K-10 was subjected to extraction using CH2Cl2 for the purpose of chromatographic separation at a wavelength of 210 nm.One key experiments in this study observes whether Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF exhibits higher antiviral activity than other LAB. This comparison is vital before MeSPE as there is no data available on the antiviral activity of all isolated LAB. The plaque-forming assay revealed that solely the CFs from two particular LAB isolates, Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 and Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06, displayed anti-influenza virus activity (Figure 2). The HPLC analysis focused on determining the relative peak area of detected fractions and the maximum production of metabolites during Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 growth. Before conducting prep-HPLC fractionation, the LAB CFs extracted with CH2Cl2 were prepared because of their enhanced CDP selectivity during the purification procedure. The peaks of all CFs achieved their peak levels at 72 h when analyzed using analytical HPLC (Figure 3A). In the HPLC chromatogram of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF from the 16-h culture, it was observed that the peak area and peak height of the CDPs peak were notably reduced compared to those of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF from cultures at different time points. This discrepancy indicates a lack of active CDPs synthesis in the 16-h culture. The peak observed in the preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) chromatogram, which aligns with the peak having a retention time of 9 min in the analytical HPLC analysis, corresponds to the peak depicted in Figure 3B, exhibiting a retention time ranging from 9.5 to 10.5 min. This HPLC peak corresponds to the cyclo(Tyr-Pro) of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10, which was previously identified in our study through HPLC fractionation and 2D-LC MS/MS analysis, demonstrating antifungal and weak antibacterial properties. Nevertheless, the presence of cyclo(Tyr-Pro) was predominantly noted within the 16-h timeframe, with fluctuations in its quantity observed between 24 and 64 h, albeit without a clearly defined cause. Alternatively, this phenomenon may be attributed to the dual role of microbes as either probiotics or agents of dysbiosis through the secretion of CDPs such as cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro), cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Pro), and cyclo(L-Leu-L-Leu) (Ogilvie and Czekster, 2023). These CDPs have the potential to influence other microbes and their respective hosts. The hydroxyl group of tyrosine, which is derived from the high production of cyclo(Tyr-Pro), is considered more favorable for proton transfer during the initial stages of cell growth compared to the hydroxyl groups of other amino acids like serine and threonine (Schmitt et al., 2018).Figure 2 Figure 2. Antiviral activity of isolated LAB. As described in the Materials and Methods section, a solution containing influenza A (H3N2) virus with a concentration of 2.8 × 107 PFU/mL was inoculated into cell cultures labeled as (A, C). In contrast, MDCK cells that were not infected with the virus were designated as (B). In each experimental trial, the samples were diluted by a factor of 0.25 relative to the initial culture, taking into account the total volume of medium utilized in the plaque assay. The LAB samples were treated according to the following procedure: Ln. citreum LBP-K03, Ln. holzapfelii LBP-K05, Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06, Ln. Pseudomesenteroides LBP-K08, Lb. brevis LBP-K09, Lb. plantarum LBP-K10, Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K12, Weissella cibaria LBP-K15, W. Confusa LBP-K16, Pediococcus pentosaceus LBP-K17, Lb. sakei LBP-B01, Lb. kimchii LBP-B02, Ln. mesenteroides LBP-B04, Ln. paramesenteroides LBP-B05, and Weissella cibaria LBP-B06 are the strains included in the study. All experiments were carried out a minimum of three times.Figure 3 Figure 3. Analytical HPLC chromatogram characteristics of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF. (A) A significant increase was observed in the production of antimicrobial and antiviral CDPs by Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 during different incubation periods. It is worth mentioning that all experiments were performed independently no less than three times. (B) The HPLC fractionation pattern of the CFs in Lb. plantarum LBP-K10, Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06, and Pediococcus pentosaceus LBP-K17 was examined. Chromatographic analysis of the culture filtrates induced by LAB strains was conducted at a wavelength of 210 nm after 72 h. All experiments were performed at least three times independently.In our previous study, the HPLC fractionation patterns generated by CDP production of both Lactobacillus genus and other LAB isolates exhibited a high degree of similarity (Kwak et al., 2018; Kang and Kwak, 2024). The production levels of antifungal cis-cyclo(L-Val-L-Pro) and antiviral cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) derived from both Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 and various previously identified LAB isolates (i.e., Lb. sakei LBP-S01, Lb. plantarum/pentos LBP-S02, Lactococcus lactis LBP-S03, Lc. lactis LBP-S06, Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06, Weissella cibaria LBP-K15, and Weissella confusa LBP-K16) exhibit distinct differences, while their fractionation patterns are consistently similar (Liu et al., 2017; Kwak et al., 2018). This experimental approach, which included the use of HPLC to separate the CH2Cl2 extracts of bacterial CFs followed by repeated CH2Cl2 extraction, is distinctive due to its high selectivity for CDP isolation and its adaptability to various modifications of the mobile phases. This procedure typically enables the production of highly pure CDPs suitable for analysis and identification through EI/CI GC-MS as individual compounds, without the presence of any other peptidyl or non-peptidyl molecules. The CDP purification model, in conjunction with CH2Cl2 extraction, has the capability to generate isolated fractions, all of which exhibit a consistent CDP fractionation pattern in the HPLC chromatograms. The HPLC chromatogram of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CFs reveals a distinctive broad shoulder in the curved shape of the peak area from F13 to F15 of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10, which differs from the sharp peak observed at N13 of Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06 and P. pentosaceus LBP-K17 (Kwak et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017). Moreover, our investigation revealed that the proportion of all fractions derived from the Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF was greater compared to those from the other isolates. While the CF fractions of P. pentosaceus LBP-K17 or Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06 exhibit a lower amount of peak area for CDPs compared to those of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10, the identification of CDPs in the CF fractions of P. pentosaceus LBP-K17 is notably more straightforward compared to other LAB isolates. In our previous works and studies, Ln mesenteroides LBP-K06 and P. pentosaceus LBP-K17 have been identified as potentially valuable standardization indicators for CDP research. This indicates that even though there are variations in the substances present in the isolates, LAB could potentially produce and release similar metabolites that act as antiviral agents, such as antifungal and antibacterial CDPs, regardless of the genus of LAB.Meanwhile, the HPLC peak area of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF was significantly higher than that of other isolates (Figure 3B). The chromatographic peak distribution observed in LAB CFs showed remarkable similarities, implying the possible existence of CDPs in the CFs of other isolates, including Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06 and P. pentosaceus LBP-K17. Figures 2, 3 illustrate the potential for performing high-throughput MeSPE with CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF owing to its highly effective antiviral efficacy.Significant activity of MeSPEfs against influenza A virusThe findings (Figures 2, 3) led to an examination of the antiviral activity of MeSPEfs. To extract substances that were bound to the SPE resin, a 5% increase in methanol concentration was implemented gradually (Figure 4). The CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF was routinely prepared for MeSPE procedures throughout this study before the plaque-forming assay. Since the CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF was used for both MeSPE procedures and reference experiments, it has been designated as non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) from this point onwards and throughout the study. MeSPEf-45 showed the most robust effectiveness against the influenza virus, resulting in a noteworthy reduction of up to 82.3% in virus plaque count. While MeSPEf-30, MeSPE-35, and MeSPE-40 demonstrated a decline in plaque count, MeSPEf-45 displayed superior antiviral efficacy, resulting in fewer plaques. MeSPEf-30, MeSPEf-35, and MeSPEf-40 generated 57, 41, and 40 virus plaques, respectively, resulting in 54.0%, 67.0%, and 67.7% reduction in plaque count compared to the control group. The unbound and washout fractions obtained after sample loading were unsuitable for the plaque assay. The low pH effect of each sample is likely responsible for the unbound fraction. The fraction not bound to the SPE resin after undergoing washout with TDW showed a 1.21-fold increase in virus plaques compared to the control experiment. Nevertheless, the cause of this result is unclear since there is no literature or studies to support it. As a result of this finding, further antibacterial activity tests were conducted using MeSPEfs (Table 2). Certain MeSPEfs, specifically MeSPEf-30, MeSPEf-35, MeSPEf-40, and MeSPEf-45, showed exclusive antibacterial activity against bacterial indicators and multidrug-resistant bacteria (Gram-positive S. aureus 11,471 and Gram-negative Salmonella Typhimurium 12,219). This result shares a noticeable similarity with the antiviral efficacy observed in plaque-forming assays (Figure 4). Figure 4; Table 2 demonstrate the potential effectiveness of high-throughput MeSPE following CH2Cl2 extraction to target low-molecular-weight compounds. The antiviral activity observed in the plaque assay depicted in Figure 4 aligns with the results obtained from the antagonism test and MIC values presented in Table 2. It is noteworthy that both antibacterial and antiviral activities were detected across the range from MeSPEf-15 to MeSPEf-45, with MeSPEf-45 exhibiting the highest level of activity. The findings suggest variations in the presence and quantity of active substances eluted with methanol among the MeSPEfs samples. MeSPEf-50 exhibited the lowest amount of antimicrobial active substances, while MeSPEf-45 contained significantly higher levels of antibacterial and antiviral active substances.Figure 4 Figure 4. Antiviral activity of MeSPEfs acquired from non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). Before the plaque assay, 2.8 × 107 PFU/mL of influenza A (H3N2) virus was introduced into cell cultures as previously described. A hydrophobic interaction was utilized by employing methanol and a 5% step-gradient to introduce an initial 5% methanol to the SPE resins. The final elution was performed utilizing a 50% methanol solution, following the protocol outlined in the Materials and Methods section. Control experiments were designed and conducted in accordance with established protocols. The abbreviations used in this study are as follows: MDCK, reference; SC, sample control (30% fraction); VC, virus control; UB, unbound; WO, washout. The measured data values are indicative of the mean (± standard deviation) obtained from three separate experiments.Table 2 Table 2. Relative antibacterial activity of each MeSPEfs isolated from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CFs.Several simple CDPs have been reported to possess antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, although with relatively low potency levels (Milne et al., 1998; Rhee, 2002). In addition, cyclo(L-Leucine-L-Proline) has shown activity against 12 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacterial strains, while cyclo(L-Phenylalanine-L-Proline) has demonstrated similar activity against VRE strains and other pathogenic microbes (Rhee et al., 2001; Rhee, 2002). Nevertheless, the combination of X and Y appears to have a synergistic effect. The drug combination is highly effective against anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, surpassing the efficacy of other antimicrobial agents such as erythromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, and metronidazole significantly. Additionally, it demonstrated an MIC50 value of 0.064 mg/L against Clostridium difficile (Rhee, 2006). Moreover, bicyclomycin derivatives possessing CDP structures sourced from Streptomyces sapporonesis and S. aizumenses (Borthwick, 2012), along with proline-based CDPs functioning as both quorum sensing agonists and antagonists, are demonstrating promising clinical effectiveness (Degrassi et al., 2002; Park et al., 2006). Proline-based compounds show potential for treating infections caused by major human pathogens (Li et al., 2011; Gowrishankar et al., 2016). Their non-bactericidal mode of action offers an appealing alternative to traditional antibiotics (Gowrishankar and Karutha Pandian, 2017). However, understanding the intricate microbial networks and metabolites related to homeostasis and dysbiosis is crucial for predicting their effects on microbes associated with health or disease.Consequently, this study focuses on isolating small cyclic dipeptidyl compounds through high-throughput MeSPE. Nonetheless, this approach does not encompass proteinaceous fractions such as bacteriocins. This experimental design has practical implications for class IIa bacteriocins, which are potentially useful as antiviral agents but have certain limitations (AI Kassaa et al., 2014; Alvarez-Sieiro et al., 2016; Dey et al., 2021). These constraints arise from necessary and specific conditions, including temperature, pH, nutrient availability, and salt concentration (De Vuyst and Leroy, 2007; Lohans and Vederas, 2012). To increase the potency of class IIa bacteriocins, it is crucial to eliminate any N-terminal disulfide bridges. Nevertheless, substituting these bonds with carbocycles produces biologically active peptides, but their activity decreases by tenfold. These findings contradict the ease of isolating antiviral peptidyl metabolites like tripeptides (Hu et al., 2021), dipeptides (Ceña-Diez et al., 2023), and 2-5-diketopiperazines (Huang et al., 2014).The discrepancies observed in fractions obtained via HPLC fractionation between MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF)Based on the findings of the plaque-forming assay (Figure 4), we examined the HPLC fractionation patterns of MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). In a previous section, it was mentioned that the utilization of initial CH2Cl2 extraction was carried out to obtain Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF for both MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). This process ensured experimental uniformity and enabled easier detection of cyclic dipeptidyl molecules. The HPLC chromatogram displayed the patterns of fractionation for MeSPEfs, which were eluted in increments that varied by 10% in methanol concentration (Figure 5). The majority of the fractions separated from MeSPEfs had minimal peak detection in the first half of the chromatogram, particularly in the retention time (tR) range spanning from 5 to 20 min. The detectable peaks of the MeSPEfs were predominantly evident in the later segment of the tR range (16.0-33.5). The peak positions showed a certain level of dependence on the methanol concentration, with the exception of MeSPEf-50. However, none of the fractions separated from MeSPEf-10 and MeSPEf-20 were in line with the fractionation pattern observed in the non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). A critical factor in characterizing antiviral fractions acquired via MeSPEfs was the peak-to-peak correspondence between MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) (Figure 5). A peak-to-peak alignment strategy was used to enhance the efficiency of data analysis. Analysis of the peak-to-peak alignment between MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfs revealed no significant correlation. The peak-to-peak correspondence observed between MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF), exclusively in the middle to latter portions of the tR range, suggests the presence of specific antiviral effectors that selectively attack the influenza virus. Comparable yet noteworthy results were noted for the peaks exclusively detected in the MeSPEfs associated with cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), which corresponded with non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) fractions F13 and F17. Nevertheless, the initial HPLC separation of MeSPEfs revealed peaks that were asymmetric and overlapping, exhibiting absorption at 210 nm (Figure 5). The retention times of these peaks did not correspond to those of any identified CDP fraction from the previously examined fractions F13 and F17 of Lactobacillus CDPs’ fractions F13 and F17, cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), respectively. The aforementioned fractions F13 and F17 demonstrated the highest level of antimicrobial efficacy in our previous work (Kwak et al., 2018). Most fractions of MeSPEfs showed lower peak areas associated with cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) (corresponding to non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) F3, F4, and F12 fractions) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) (corresponding to non-MeSPEfc F16 fraction) in comparison to the non-MeSPEfc control. To provide definitive support for potent and targeted antiviral combinations, we conducted a comparative analysis of MeSPEfs plaque-forming assay results (Figure 4) and their HPLC fractionation pattern (Figure 5). This assumption was based on the peak-to-peak correspondence between MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEf chromatograms within the tR range’s middle to latter parts. Certain chromatograms of MeSPEfs, specifically MeSPEf-30, MeSPEf-35, MeSPEf-40, and MeSPEf-45, exhibited significant skewness towards the latter portion of the chromatogram in terms of tR. Consequently, the results of the plaque-forming assay suggest that there may be specific MeSPEfs present with the aforementioned effectors.Figure 5 Figure 5. HPLC chromatograms of the samples obtained through SPE from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF. (A) The MeSPEfs in the HPLC experiment were classified based on the methanol concentration used for elution. The HPLC chromatogram of non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) presents a comparison of CDP fractions. In every HPLC chromatogram, the terms a and b represent the fractions of cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) with a retention time between 20.5 and 23.5 min, derived from non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) fractions F12 and F13. The terms c and d refer to the fractions cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) with a retention time of 26.1–31.3 min, derived from fractions F16 and F17 of non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). (B) Information regarding these proline-containing CDPs originating from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 is extensively discussed in the main body of the text. Each experiment is depicted by individual lines, which correspond to the observed peaks. Each experiment was conducted at least three times, independently.Several peaks in MeSPEfs fused together, depending on the degree of overlap. For instance, the fractionation pattern of the overlapping HPLC peaks in the MeSPEfs samples posed challenges in identifying the specific HPLC peaks corresponding to F13 and F17 of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10. To address this issue, overlapping peaks that might impact each other were effectively separated by employing distinct isocratic mobile-phase compositions at various pH levels. This approach allowed for the differentiation of primary peaks before precise estimations of any parameter could be made. Due to endeavors aimed at isolating individual peaks from intricate chromatograms (Figures 5, 6), we successfully isolated a singular compound with the highest antiviral activity from all types of peaks obtained from MeSPEf-45. This was achieved by meticulously controlling the experimental parameters related to elution volume at peak maximum and peak height.Figure 6 Figure 6. HPLC separation of all MeSPEfs. A further HPLC fractionation method was developed by utilizing samples obtained through MeSPE with methanol elution at 5% intervals, ranging from 5% to 50%. Fractionation was subsequently performed to gather 11 fractions from each MeSPEf. The results obtained in this experiment were derived from a minimum of three independent experiments.Antibacterial and antiviral activities of fractions fractionated from MeSPEfsAs described, in addition to the lack of a noticeable peak-to-peak correlation between MeSPEfs and non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) (Figure 5), a major portion of MeSPEfs fractions displayed skewness towards the latter part of the chromatogram. This discovery holds significance since fractions from later sections of the chromatograms may contain antiviral substances in substantially higher quantities than fractions from the former section. As previously stated, the fractionation pattern of the majority of the MeSPEfs during the resolution of co-eluting peaks into individual components suggested the potential presence of CDPs in nearly all fractions of MeSPEfs, given the selective observation of HPLC peaks corresponding to CDPs in non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). Another supporting factor for this assumption was observed in the latter part of the HPLC profile of non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF). In this section, the HPLC peaks corresponding to F13 [cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro)] and F17 [cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro)], which are the antiviral CDPs of this particular strain, were identified in the fractionation pattern of the MeSPEfs samples. This identification was achieved by consolidating their overlapping peaks into a singular peak during the separation process.Hene, HPLC fractionation was carried out to separate and collect individual fractions separated from MeSPEfs (Figure 6) in light of the antibacterial and antiviral activity findings. The aim was to re-evaluate the antiviral activity to pinpoint potential targets for antiviral substances. Through antibacterial assays (Supplementary Table S1) and antiviral experiments (Table 3), we elucidated the distinct impacts of specific fractions fractionated from MeSPEfs on pathogenic microbes. The results suggest that fractions obtained from MeSPEf-45 display superior antiviral efficiency against the influenza virus in contrast to fractions isolated from other MeSPEfs. This increased activity is likely caused by the higher amounts of S8 and S11 fractions. The results were also notable for their significant antibacterial effects. The activity against the Influenza A (H3N2) virus (Table 3) and antibacterial activity (Supplementary Table S1) were solely observed in two of the eleven collected fractions, S8 and S11. No antiviral activity or antibacterial antagonism was observed in any of the assessed fractions, except for fractions S8 and S11.Table 3 Table 3. The fractions separated from MeSPEfs were evaluated for their anti-influenza A virus (H3N2) activity.Based on the antiviral activity of the two fractions of MeSPEf-45, we purified 11 individual fractions from MeSPEf-45 for antiviral activity assays. It is worth noting that in this study, the majority of MeSPEf-45 fractions were not separated as a single compound. For instance, the HPLC separation of fraction S2 revealed peaks that were both asymmetric and overlapping, with absorption observed at 210 nm. Several peaks in fraction S2 merged together and could have potentially affected each other due to the high degree of overlap. The precise assessment of any given parameter necessitated differentiation of the primary peaks through different isocratic mobile-phase compositions at varying pH levels. Unfortunately, this adjustment failed to effectively differentiate the overlapping peaks, leading to imprecise analysis. Despite our extensive efforts to isolate individual peaks from the complex chromatograms, we were unable to isolate any compounds from fraction S2. We meticulously controlled the experimental parameters of elution volume at peak maximum and peak height, yet no other fractions showed any compounds except for S8 and S11.Characterization of antiviral fractions containing bioactive CDPs from MeSPEfsThe use of CI mode proves advantageous when the molecular ion peak is missing in EI mode, particularly for identifying samples of unknown origin. Nevertheless, in this study using EI/CI GC-MS, 9 fractions from MeSPEf-45 remained unidentified. Besides the purified fractions S8 and S11, we did not observe any molecular ions in their low-quality EI mass spectra. Fragment ions were not clearly observed due to uncertain molecular ions and the lack of high-resolution mass measurements. EI and CI fragmentation yielded poor results with confirmatory ions <10% of the base peak. Under these circumstance, the EI and CI fragmentation did not reveal significant information to distinguish between them. The sensitivity of EI/CI GC-MS was insufficient to accurately determine the molecular mass. This inadequacy resulted from a combination of poor ionization patterns and limited signals across most MeSPEfs fractions (data not shown). The primary culprit was the overlapping of peaks owing to insufficient chromatographic fractionation. This result indicates that the overlapped peaks may comprise various types of compounds that cannot be differentiated.The lyophilized powders of the isolated fractions S8 and S11 underwent structural examination using EI/CI GC-MS. The molecular ion peaks at m/z 211 and m/z 244, indicating both [M+1]+, respectively (Figure 7; Table 4). EI and CI fragmentation patterns revealed that fractions S8 and S11 of MeSPE-45, which showed a substantial increase compared to other MeSPEfs in the chromatogram, represent cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), identified as C11H18N2O2 and C14H16N2O2, correspondingly. The identified mass spectra of the chromatographic peaks offer proof of the cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro), which display antiviral properties. Thus, it seems likely that MeSPEfs, consisting of two antiviral proline-based CDPs, can effectively treat viral infections.Figure 7 Figure 7. The CDPs that were identified in fractions S8 and S11 from MeSPEf-45. EI fragmentation patterns are displayed with dashed lines marking the separation of structural units by the chemical bonds. The patterns are shown twice for clarity.Table 4 Table 4. Mass spectrometric analysis was conducted on fractions S8 and S8 obtained from MeSPEf-45 using EI GC-MS.Importantly, no conformational enantiomeric pairs or diastereomeric structures were found in any of the fractions acquired from the MeSPE method in the current study. It is noteworthy that these findings align with prior research on proline-based CDPs, but do not pertain to the current study. Combining enantiomers or diastereomers leads to synergistic antimicrobial effects, which are more potent than those of a single compound. These structural variances occur due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the cyclic dipeptidyl moiety. The investigations of enantiomeric pairs and diastereomeric structures highlight a possible connection between the molecular structures of established compounds, including CDPs, and their tR range (Shan et al., 2008; Ishikawa et al., 2010). The proline-based CDPs frequently occur as conformational enantiomeric pairs or diastereomeric structures, leading to alterations in tR and the emergence of unique peaks in the HPLC chromatogram (Swadesh, 2000; Lesma et al., 2012). Cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) appears in multiple regions of the chromatogram, particularly in the non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) fraction F13, corresponding to the latter portion of S8. It is also detected in non-MeSPEfc fraction F3 (tR, 7.5-7.8) and non-MeSPEfc fraction F4 (tR, 7.8-8.1), likely corresponding to S2. Furthermore, the non-MeSPEfc fraction F12 (tR, 20.5-22.0) is related to the former part of S8. Since S11 contains cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) according to the EI/CI GC-Ms data, the S10 (tR, 26.1-28.0) that corresponds to the non-MeSPEfc (CH2Cl2-extracted Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF) fraction F16 is likely to suggest the existence of cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro). Nevertheless, we failed to establish a correlation between MeSPEfs fractions and enantiomeric pairs or diastereomeric structures because of the overlapping peaks’ extreme difficulty in distinguishing, leading to imprecise analysis, as previously explained.The study findings indicate that numerous trials are necessary to optimize the methodological effectiveness of the MeSPE technique. The extraction of peptides from the biological matrix is a crucial initial procedure before chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection or radio-metabolite profiling (Ewles and Goodwin, 2011; Katsila et al., 2012). For instance, the optimal extraction conditions for highly hydrophilic peptides, such as somatostatin catabolites, may differ significantly from those suitable for hydrophobic peptides, as exemplified by liraglutide. When employing SPE and simple extraction methods utilizing methanol and ethanol, as well as 80% methanol and 80% ethanol solutions, researchers have utilized these solvents to extract compounds for the assessment of antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds in oils. The results indicate that the methanolic extracts of hemp and milk thistle seed oils exhibit the highest antiradical activity, while the ethanolic extracts demonstrate superior reducing properties (Kalinowska et al., 2022). Polar peptides are typically more compatible with solvents such as methanol and ethanol, while hydrophobic peptides may require aprotic solvents like acetonitrile. The proportion of matrix to solvent volume (usually varying between 1:2 to 1:5) and the incorporation of acids (e.g., formic or trifluoroacetic acid) or bases (e.g., ammonia) in the protein precipitation process can markedly impact the efficiency of the recovery process (Esposito et al., 2020). The ability of an elution solvent to dissolve particular target analytes should be directly proportional to their subsequent retrieval. The elution solvent for SPE experiments was identified by assessing the recovery rates with different solvent systems, such as methanol, acetonitrile, methanol:acetonitrile (1:1), dichloromethane, and acetonitrile:dichloromethane (1:1). Various volumes between 2 and 5 mL can be examined to assess solvent recoveries, and the most suitable volume should be chosen for further studies (Liang et al., 2016). In the context of developing purification methods for radiopharmaceuticals intended for clinical use, the timely integration of biocompatible solvents provides advantages and aids in addressing potential challenges that may arise during subsequent stages of the process. For example, the utilization of ethanol in the development of HPLC methods as opposed to methanol. The use of ethanol in HPLC has been associated with elevated back pressure, requiring modifications in flow rate and column parameters (such as stationary phase and dimensions) to maintain the highest level of purification effectiveness. Furthermore, replacing trifluoroacetic acid with an alternative acid, such as hydrochloric, acetic, or phosphoric acid, may be considered suitable for pH adjustment (Barnes et al., 2022).The combined fractions S8 and S11 with increased activity against pathogenic microbes and viruses compared to a single fraction separated from MeSPE-45As demonstrated by both Figure 4, which depicts antiviral activity when using MeSPEf, and the MIC experiments in Table 2, the MeSPEf itself has inherent antibacterial activity. When utilized as the experimental group, the MeSPEf, which represents a mixture of all peaks in the sample, exhibits a wide range of antibacterial and antiviral activities across different samples, ranging from 15% to 50%. However, variations exist among the MeSPEfs. The fractionated provide insight into the specific fractions that contribute to the antibacterial and antiviral activity, compared to the experimental group that utilized the MeSPEfs directly. Figures 4–6, along with Tables 2 and Supplementary Table S1, depict the core characteristics of the MeSPE-obtained eluate. According to our findings, fractionation of MeSPEfs permits the comprehensive identification of individual fractions at different methanol concentrations. This provide insight into the precise antiviral and antibacterial properties of each fraction. We posit that a synergistic bioactive formula can be developed by combining fractions from MeSPEf-45, containing compounds with both antibacterial and antiviral activities.We established the efficacy of the high-throughput MeSPE approach by conducting a thorough evaluation of the antimicrobial properties using fractions obtained from MeSPEf-45 in specific combinations. We assessed the antiviral activity of the combined fractions using a plaque-forming assay (Table 5), following the evaluation of the antibacterial effectiveness of MeSPEf-45 (Supplementary Table S2). As anticipated, most experimental groups showed an increase in the anti-influenza A virus effect that relied on the fraction combination when using MeSPEf-45. Similarly, a proportional boost in the antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and multidrug-resistant bacteria was noted when using the combined fractions acquired from MeSPEf-45. The MeSPE techniques are essential for achieving optimal performance as they eliminate any need for additional and time-consuming processing procedures. Hence, the anti-influenza A virus properties of the MeSPEf or any subsequently fractionated fraction can be harnessed through selective employment of S8 and S11. The combination of SPE resin with Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF shows potential to enable efficient and selective biosynthesis of cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro). However, MeSPEf-45, non-fractionated MeSPEf, shows higher levels of antiviral activity against Influenza A virus than other MeSPEfs and their fractionated fractions. For this reason, it is recommended to avoid further secondary fractionation in order to enhance the efficiency of obtaining antiviral fractions. As previously mentioned, despite various efforts, all of the preceding fractions of the HPLC chromatogram, including the S2 fraction (fractions with retention times of 20 min or less), showed little antibacterial and antiviral activity. However, two fractions of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF, F6 [cis-cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Pro), retention time: 9.5–10.5 min] and F7 [cis-cyclo(L-Val-L-Pro), retention time: 12.2–13.2 min], exhibited weak antibacterial and antifungal activity (Kwak et al., 2014). However, among the fractions tested, F13 [cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro)] and F17 [cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro)] exhibited the most significant and unique antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. Previous studies have shown that no other fraction of Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF exhibited antiviral activity, except for F13 and F17. Additionally, F17 showed a pronounced antifungal activity (Kwak et al., 2013; Kwak et al., 2018). The previous study also discovered a significant difference in antibiotic activity between fractions with HPLC chromatogram retention times of 20 min or less and those with retention times of 20 min or more in the case of Ln. mesenteroides LBP-K06 CF, similar to Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 (Liu et al., 2017). Even with the MeSPEf-45 fractionation, the quantities of the preceding fractions, excluding S8 and S11, were significantly low. The results suggest that only two fractions, S8 and S11, corresponding to F13 and F17, of the MeSPEf-45 fractions passed through the SPE cartridge retain antiviral activity. This study presents a sophisticated system that investigates the effect of the newly utilized MeSPE on the identification and recovery of biologically active CDPs, in comparison to the previously showcased AECs (Figure 8).Table 5 Table 5. The synergistic antiviral and antibacterial effects of the composite fractions comprising S8 and S11 against pathogenic microorganisms.Figure 8 Figure 8. Comparisons between the SPE technique and previously demonstrated AECs. Significantly improved efficiency in terms of both yield and time is attained when employing SPE resin for the isolation of CDPs from LAB cultures, in comparison to AEC resins such as Amberlite IRA-67, Purolite A420S, or a combination of both. The presented data demonstrates a more efficient approach to purifying a substantial quantity of combined CDPs. The application of MeSPE techniques in modified antiviral CDP combinations has led to significant experimental progress, providing valuable insights into potential enhancements for the efficacy of antiviral treatments.As a representative in clinical trials involving CDPs with antiviral properties, spiro-DKP is a CDP derivative utilized to design chemokine receptors for selective C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists, demonstrating promising antiviral effects (Habashita et al., 2006). CCR5 antagonists are powerful anti-HIV medications. There is increasing interest in CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonists as HIV-1 entry inhibitors for AIDS treatment. CCR5 is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and the first antiviral CCR5 antagonist in this class was the spiro-DKP aplaviroc. The spiro-2,5-DKP template was chosen to design combinatorial libraries for targeting chemokine receptors to develop selective CCR5 antagonists. This template resembles spiropiperidine privileged structures found in various GPCR ligands. It is a fundamental heterocyclic scaffold that allows for diversity at up to four positions and can be synthesized in two steps from common α-amino acids using the Ugi reaction. The predicted 3D structure of spiro-DKP suggests that having three substituents on this template could align similarly to three side chains on the type I β-turn structure of the protein. The oral bioavailability of different aplaviroc formulations in rats and monkeys varied from 3% to 30%. It is 93% bound to human plasma, mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and in vitro cell culture studies indicate it is a P-glycoprotein substrate (Adkison et al., 2005).Certain CDPs are currently utilized as pharmaceutical agents, such as bicyclomycin and flinabulin (which are currently undergoing clinical trials), excluding 2,5-DKPs (Kohn and Widger, 2005; Blayney et al., 2020). Furthermore, cyclo(leucyl-glycine), a DKP compound designed as an analgesic and a therapeutic agent for Parkinson’s disease, has progressed into clinical trials (Bhargava, 1984; Chipkin and Latranyi, 1984). In contrast to the straightforwardly structured CDPs like cyclo(L-Phenylalanine-L-Proline), which have shown activity against 12 VRE bacterial strains and spiro-DKP, currently under investigation for its efficacy against the HIV virus, there has been a limited number of clinical trials conducted thus far utilizing the most basic structured CDPs, such as 2,5-DKP, a proline-containing CDP, for therapeutic purposes. Ampion represents a nearly unique case as a human serum albumin containing a small molecule compound. It has been formulated as the initial intra-articular injection intended for managing severe knee osteoarthritis. Ampion, also referred to as ‘aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine’ or ‘DA-DKP’, is an immunomodulatory molecule. DA-DKP has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating inflammation through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in T cells. The clinical trial NCT03349645, which focused on investigating DA-DKP, aimed to evaluate the safety of long-term treatment with Ampion for severe knee osteoarthritis (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03349645?intr=NCT03349645&rank=1). However, the trial recently yielded unsuccessful results. Hence, it is postulated that the two categories of proline-containing CDPs delineated in this investigation could potentially yield clinical advantages provided that the diverse factors contributing to the shortcomings observed in the aspartyl-alanyl-diketopiperazine clinical trial mentioned earlier are rectified, leading to enhanced efficacy. The scope of applications for the two categories of CDPs outlined in this research is presently constrained to biopesticides, food additives, orthorexia, orthostasis, orthotics, and functional food materials aimed at mitigating foodborne illnesses.ConclusionIn this study, we aimed to introduce a more efficient method for quickly extracting large amounts of proline-containing CPDs, which are antiviral agents secreted extracellularly in Lactobacillus cultures. The high-throughput MeSPE technique accurately identifies CDPs by quantifying and comparing CDP fractions using CH2Cl2 extraction and a simple, reproducible HPLC fractionation method. The utilization of C18-SPE resin through the MeSPE method is more efficient in achieving a higher CDP yield and in eliminating organic acids and impurities from Lb. plantarum LBP-K10 CF. When compared to fractions obtained using the previous AEC method, which involved complex and multiple steps, the fractions with antiviral activity in MeSPEfs are easier to isolate CDPs. These CDPs were primarily eluted with 40% and 45% methanol. After HPLC fractionation, fractions from MeSPEf-20, MeSPEf-25, MeSPEf-30, and MeSPEf-35 exhibit moderate anti-influenza activity. MeSPEf-45 fractions S8 and S11 showed the highest activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and influenza virus compared to other fractions of MeSPEfs. The anti-influenza activity in MeSPEfs fractions, like MeSPEf-40 and MeSPEf-45, is limited to the S8 and S11 fractions. Antiviral fractions S8 and S11 were identified as proline-based cis-cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro). We show that combining MeSPEf-45 fractions S8 and S11 with other fractions resulted in enhanced antibacterial and anti-influenza virus effects compared to using each fraction individually. This study strengthens our knowledge of managing and preventing viral infectious diseases using a specific CDP combination strategy and its applications. High-throughput MeSPE-derived MeSPEfs and their fractions offer innovative materials for selectively purifying significant quantities of potent antimicrobial CDPs from bacterial CF. Throughout the study, we present compelling evidence for our SPE technique to assess the impact of antiviral CDPs in complexes and identify specific bioactive CDPs.Data availability statementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material; further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.Ethics statementEthical review and approval was not required for this study in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.Author contributionsJS: Data curation, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing–original draft.

Positions include accounting, coordinator, clerk, feed mill, human resources, manager, sanitation and supervisor.Layoffs began on Wednesday at five locations.Kempa said the virus impacted the company's hen population at some farms in Ionia County."The company plans to rehire many positions as hen replenishing and egg production increases," Kempa said in the letter. According to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the virus can spread through contact with infected poultry, equipment and a caretaker's clothes and shoes.Health officials say the risk of the virus for humans remains low. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was detected in one person this year after being exposed to infected dairy cows. The last human case was reported in 2022.Earlier this month, MDARD issued guidance to help producers reduce the spread. The order went into effect on May 8.Under the order, all Michigan dairy farms and poultry operations must implement the following:Designate a biosecurity managerDesignate a line of separation to represent the perimeter of a secure area, limiting access pointsEstablish cleaning and disinfection practices and procedures at those access points for both vehicles and individuals, including deliveries of feed and other supplies, and training for employeesEstablish a logbook maintaining a record of all vehicles and of individuals who have gotten out of vehicles and crossed those access points, to be retained and made available for examination upon request by MDARD.

Share this item with your network: By Alivia Kaylor, MSc Published: 13 May 2024 In the face of reluctance among dairy farmers to report H5N1 bird flu outbreaks and test workers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is pioneering an approach to track the virus's spread: monitoring wastewater. This innovative strategy aims to fill crucial gaps in understanding the rapid dissemination of the virus, particularly in regions where reporting from traditional channels remains limited. The CDC's public dashboard, expected to be revealed today, will track influenza A viruses detected in sewage collected from 600 wastewater treatment sites across the United States since last fall. While the testing is not H5N1-specific, it encompasses influenza A strains, providing insights into unusual viral activity. "The presence of high levels of influenza A in wastewater could be a reliable indicator of unusual viral circulation in a particular area," Amy Kirby, the lead of the CDC wastewater team, told STAT News. Kirby noted that certain wastewater collection sites have observed significant increases in influenza A virus levels since late March or early April despite indications suggesting the end of the 2023–2024 flu season. "It's a very limited phenomenon — the vast majority of our sites are not seeing this," she added, underscoring the localized nature of the observed spikes. While concerns have been raised about implicating nearby dairy farms based solely on wastewater data, Kirby stressed the mobility of animal operations, emphasizing the need for comprehensive surveillance. It has been learned that animal operations, particularly within the dairy sector, exhibit more mobility than anticipated, she added. Cows and milk traverse between farms. Consequently, the presence of a dairy processing facility within a community does not guarantee local milk sourcing. A call for collaboration and data sharing accompanies the unveiling of the dashboard. “We are working to understand that signal better, but in the meantime, we want to make sure all of that data is available for any groups that are working on this to have access to it,” Kirby explained. “There are so many players here who have valuable input and information. They may see things in this data that we don’t see — patterns that we’re not aware of — and we hope that they will reach out and help us." Despite the promising outlook, the CDC remains cautious about the nationwide deployment of H5N1-specific tests, prioritizing resources based on influenza A activity. Additionally, the CDC monitors sewage for other pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), highlighting the multifaceted nature of wastewater surveillance in public health. As the CDC continues to refine its wastewater monitoring approach, Kirby emphasized the importance of adaptation to evolving circumstances. This presentation of high virus concentrations in milk from dairy cattle was unexpected. Current efforts focus on swiftly understanding the various pathways through which milk and its byproducts enter wastewater systems, she clarified. The CDC's wastewater dashboard represents a pioneering effort to leverage unconventional data sources for disease surveillance, offering a promising tool in combating the spread of H5N1 bird flu and other infectious threats. "We are very much focused on this as an immediate response to the current situation," reassured Kirby. "And we’ll be continuing to work through this as the situation evolves — hopefully resolves. But if we start getting into the seasonal flu season, we’ll have to think about some additional testing to tell those things apart."

But who's at risk, and should we be concerned?JBy Joseph Hathaway-WilsonTopic:InfluenzaSun 12 MaySunday 12 MaySun 12 May 2024 at 7:47pmAn early-than-normal flu season is leading health authorities to urge the public to get vaccinated. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)abc.net.auewssw-flu-season-early-who-at-risk-should-we-be-concerned/103816646Link copiedShareShare articleNew South Wales health authorities are urging people to protect themselves against influenza, with the latest data indicating an early flu season is imminent.Respiratory surveillance reports published by NSW Health indicate approximately 5,160 people across the state were diagnosed with influenza in April, an increase of more than 20 per cent from the same time last year.Nearly 200 people have presented to hospital emergency departments with influenza-like illnesses every week in that time.The Australian Influenza Surveillance Report shows influenza cases typically rise in May, leading to a peak circulation of the disease in July and August.This year, NSW is experiencing a flu season more akin to what it experienced in 2019, when cases rose in April and peaked in June and July.However, Associate Professor of Health at the University of NSW Holly Seale said an early flu season itself was not a cause for deep concern."It has peaks and troughs that have changed over the years," she said."Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was more common to have late seasons in which peak influenza activity was occurring in September and October as the weather was getting warmer."This year, we're seeing a repeat in trends from what the northern hemisphere has encountered in terms of having an earlier flu season."Holly Seale says an earlier flu season is not of concern, with the trend mirroring what we've seen previously in the northern hemisphere. (Supplied; UNSW)While changes to the timing of flu season are not uncommon, the early start to the season in 2024 has seen politicians and health professionals encourage people to take earlier action than usual to protect themselves.NSW Minister for Health Ryan Park has been advising the community to get vaccinated as soon as possible, emphasising that the flu was far more serious than the common cold that people often mistake it for."This is not an ordinary cold and flu," he said."We know that it can lead to hospitalisations and serious impacts on people's health, and unfortunately, this year, we're already seeing significant increases in cases compared to the same time last year."Young children hardest hit by influenzaThe government's respiratory surveillance reports show 1,458 children under the age of 10 were diagnosed with influenza in April, making up 28 per cent of all diagnoses.Rod Pearce says because of the COVID-19 pandemic, children under five are particularly vulnerable to the influenza virus. (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)Chair of the Immunisation Coalition Rod Pearce told ABC Radio National that children under the age of five were especially susceptible to influenza, having not been exposed to the disease throughout the COVID-19 pandemic."A three- or four-year-old child hasn't seen influenza through natural protection," Dr Pearce said."They're being hit with a disease the body's not yet seen."According to the Australian Immunisation Register, only one in 14 children under the age of five are currently vaccinated against influenza in NSW, despite vaccines being available for all children over six months old.What stops people from protecting themselves against influenza?Flu vaccination call for young childrenPhoto shows A mum with two smiley girls on her lapParents of children born during the COVID-19 pandemic are being urged to get their children flu shots, with almost 5,000 cases in children aged zero to four so far this year.Dr Seale said the most effective way someone can protect themselves against infection is by getting a vaccination, but misconceptions about influenza and the effectiveness of the vaccine are complicating this process for many.Vaccinations help the body develop immunity to influenza using deactivated or weakened versions of the virus.Antigens in the vaccine stimulate the immune system to recognise the virus and develop antibodies that fight infection.This process takes approximately two weeks to take effect, during which Dr Seale said the vaccinated person is still susceptible to contracting influenza."You may end up getting the flu in that period when you're still waiting for your vaccine to kick in," Dr Seale said."That's when you hear people say the flu vaccine didn't work for them or that they had the worst case of flu the year that they got vaccinated."Because of this, she says there is no ideal time to wait for vaccination, and that members of the community are best protected by vaccinating themselves as early as they are able.Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself against infection, Dr Seale says. (AAP: Albert Perez)Beliefs about the severity of influenza and alternative forms of treatment also complicate the matter.Dr Seale said a high number of people are attempting to obtain antibiotics as treatment, despite evidence that they don't remedy symptoms of influenza.The frustration of having to get vaccinated annually also disincentives people from protecting themselves against infection, she said. The Australian Immunisation Register indicates that, as of April 28, only one in 10 people had been vaccinated against influenza.Change on the horizon for influenza vaccinesThe beginning of the influenza season this year coincides with a breakthrough discovery that could change the need for an annual vaccination against influenza.Currently, as new strains of influenza develop every year, new vaccines must be rolled out to match the risk posed by the virus, making an annual flu jab necessary.Different vaccines are available for people of different ages and with different health conditions.With new variants and strains of viruses developing, there's a need for new and updated vaccines each year. (AAP: James Ross)Two weeks ago, scientists from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne discovered nine viral fragments of influenza that have been present in all historical strains of the virus.These nine fragments are key to activating killer T-cells, a type of cytotoxic T cell in the body that is crucial to fighting influenza.It is their hope that this discovery can be used to develop a universal influenza vaccine.Posted Sun 12 May 2024 at 7:47pmSunday 12 May 2024 at 7:47pmSun 12 May 2024 at 7:47pm, updated Sun 12 May 2024 at 9:39pmSunday 12 May 2024 at 9:39pmSun 12 May 2024 at 9:39pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Get your flu shot! Despite what you may hear, they don't give you the flu. They're made of harmless versions of flu virus to help your body recognize and fight it if exposed to the real thing. What is influenza or flu? Influenza, or flu, can be caused by three different virus types: influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. There is uncomplicated flu and complicated flu. Uncomplicated influenza: ILI (Influenza-like illness) may present with fever, cough, sore throat, coryza, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, but without any features of complicated influenza. Complicated influenza: Influenza requiring hospital admission and/or with symptoms and signs of lower respiratory tract infection (hypoxaemia, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, lower chest wall indrawing and inability to feed), central nervous system involvement and/or a significant exacerbation of an underlying medical condition. How do flu vaccines work? Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies (fighter cells) provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. Because the flu virus change (mutation) as it is passed along from one person to another, the vaccine needs to be changed every season as well. Those with severe allergy to chicken eggs should avoid the flu vaccine. Why should people be vaccinated? Influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and some cases, death. Every flu season is different, and influenza infection can affect people differently, but millions of people get the flu every year, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalised and thousands or tens of thousands of people die from flu-related causes every year. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and spread it to others. Read tips on tips on how to stay healthy in winter and foods to eat. Higher Health​ has expressed concern about the rising number of students with flu at universities. ​ Who should be vaccinated? Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at high risk of serious complications from influenza.

The farm is in the city of Tomisato in Chiba. This prefecture is part of the Kanto region on the main island of Honshu, corresponding to the area of Greater Tokyo.The latest outbreak affected laying hens, according to Japan’s agriculture ministry, and suspicions of an infection arose from a sudden increase in flock mortality.This development brings the country’s total outbreaks in poultry this year to 11. Directly impacted have been around 808,000 poultry, based on WOAH notifications. Of these, 10 outbreaks involved the H5N1 virus serotype, and were widely dispersed across five of Japan’s eight regions. Furthermore, in February, a broiler flock in the southwestern-most main island of Kyushu tested positive for the H5N5 variant. Furthermore, around 150 Japanese wild birds have tested positive for HPAI since the start of the 2023-2024 winter. During the season, most prevalent in the wild population has also been the H5N1 virus serotype, while a few cases have involved the H5N5 and H5N6 variants. The most recent cases reported to WOAH were identified at the end of March, and involved the H5N5 virus. Further poultry outbreaks in Bulgaria, South AfricaLast week, presence of the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype was detected at two more farms in Bulgaria.Based on WOAH reporting, these bring the nation’s total outbreaks so far in 2024 to 16, directly impacting more than 803,000 poultry.Latest cases were at premises in the central province of Plovdiv, and in Haskovo in southern Bulgaria. A further HPAI outbreak in South Africa has been reported retrospectively to WOAH by the national veterinary agency.It also involved the H5N1 virus variant, which was detected at a farm in Mogale city in Gauteng province in October of last year. Since April of 2023, 29 outbreaks linked to this virus in the country have been registered with WOAH. Around the same time, the H7N6 serotype was detected for the first time among South African poultry, and it has since affected 116 of the nation’s farms. Study: Avian flu virus spreads fast at live bird marketsWhile previous studies show the potential for avian influenza viruses to spread rapidly at live bird markets, new research by the One Health Poultry Hub of the Global Challenges Research Fund demonstrates just how quickly that can occur under practical conditions. Authors report that the findings of the study will support future research into potential measures to control avian flu at such markets. Among the scientific partners were the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) and University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Together with scientists from China, Bangladesh and France, the group used biological data gathered from chickens at live markets. They combined this with computer modelling to calculate virus transmission rates.Researchers selected the H9N2 virus variant for the study. It is classed as low-pathogenic for poultry so it results in low mortality, but infections lead to production losses. Furthermore, this serotype is seen as a potential pandemic threat for humans as its genetic material has been detected in emerging virus variants. The world’s first confirmed case of H9N2 infection in a person was recently recorded in Vietnam.The latest study revealed that more than 90% of chickens that arrive at a bird market without having been exposed to the H9N2 virus will become infected within one day. Furthermore, the time between infection and becoming contagious can be as short as 5.5 hours, and 10% of chickens tested positive for this virus variant on arrival at the market. According to RVC, a previous study had shown that as many as 20-30% of birds entering live bird markets in Bangladesh and Vietnam had already been exposed to the H9N2 virus.

Maeve Cullinan Global Health Security Reporter 14 May 2024 4:48pm BST Health officials have been steadfast in their assurances. The risk of H5N1 bird flu jumping into humans is low, but even if a pandemic were to break out there are millions of doses of vaccine waiting in the wings. Last year the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced it had agreed a deal for millions of life-saving vaccines to be produced in the UK if a H5N1 pandemic was declared.The advance purchase agreement (APA) means healthcare company CSL Seqirus will be on standby to produce over 100 million influenza pandemic vaccines if or when they are needed.Professor Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “We have seen from past pandemic events, including Covid-19, that access to effective vaccines is vital to help save lives and minimise disruption to our lives and livelihoods.“This agreement represents a major step forward in our preparedness against future influenza pandemics”.In America – where experts are on alert after a widespread outbreak of bird flu in cattle – health officials have been making similar noises. The US has 10 million doses stored in bulk, but says it could ramp up to distribute 100 million shots within four months. But is this rosy picture of pandemic preparedness right? Experts in America are on high alert after a widespread outbreak of bird flu in cattle Credit: Kobbi R. Blair/Statesman-Journal via AP “There are H5 vaccines out there, and there are some stockpiled in some high-income countries,” said Dr Nicole Lurie, executive director for preparedness and response at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi).“[But] a lot of things have been frozen for a pretty long time now and are quite old. I think we all hope that they will be fine, but we don’t necessarily know.”Even the optimists point out that even if the stockpiled vaccines do work, existing supplies would barely be enough to cover healthcare workers.Dr Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in the US, said we were better prepared for H5N1 than other viruses but said it would take a while to gear up. “Are we going to have enough vaccine to meet demands in the first few weeks of such an outbreak? The answer to that is clearly no,” he said.There is also the important question of whether the vaccines we have today are a good match for the new strains of H5N1 circulating. The limited data available is not convincing. Only two of the four vaccines currently stockpiled are thought to be a good match for the current H5N1 stain, and even they may not work especially well.Former FDA official Dr Luciana Borio told the World Vaccine Congress in Washington last month that the efficacy is potentially as low as 45 per cent, based on studies looking at antibody responses.A similar problem happened when H1N1 swine flu broke out in 2008/9. Although vaccine stockpiles covered the strain circulating, a study later found it protected young people but had no discernible impact on older adults. In other words: there’s no guarantee a shot would live up to expectations – or arrive in time. With swine flu, the vaccine rollout began in earnest only after the most significant wave of infections had peaked. Thankfully, the virus turned out to be very mild. For H5N1 bird flu, things may prove more difficult still. Research from the mid-2000s found H5N1 vaccines do not trigger a strong immune response unless given in a very large dose and stains vary widely. “H5 strains are quite divergent and could be a challenge, which is why timing is very important,” Dr Katrina Pollock, associate professor in vaccinology at the Oxford Vaccine Group. “Our current vaccines might need to be modified.”And that could take time – quite a lot of it.Although vaccine developers have lots of experience making seasonal flu shots which are adjusted each year, the manufacturing process is old-fashioned with the active ingredient grown inside chicken eggs. The process takes up to six months.“Egg-based vaccines take a pretty long time and there are a lot of uncertainties,” said Dr Lewis. “If you needed to scale fast, then that would be problematic.” There are hopes that newer technologies – especially the mRNA platform that proved so agile and effective during the Covid-19 pandemic – could be deployed.Both Pfizer and Moderna are working on influenza shots and very early trials look promising, but it’s not clear if this will work – and any new vaccine would need testing.“There are only two companies that have a licenced mRNA vaccine – and none have a licence for an mRNA flu vaccine – so this regulatory piece of the puzzle is not inconsequential,” said Dr Lurie. Supplies would also be tight. If a pandemic influenza took off – H5N1 or otherwise – seasonal flu manufacturers would have to shift gear.According to Prof Ian Barr, deputy director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Australia, manufacturing capacity would have to be increased massively.“Unless things got drastically ramped up, [current capacity] would only cover one-third of the [global] population,” Prof Barr said. “It’s a number’s game.” There are also huge geographic imbalances. A WHO analysis looking at flu vaccine capacity in 2019 found that just two per cent of manufacturing capacity was in low and middle-income countries, which are home to 38 per cent of the global population. “High-income countries have pandemic vaccine contracts that are associated with their seasonal flu contracts and have already reserved, in some sense, a capacity to make vaccines for their countries,” said Dr Lewis. “That leaves us back in the situation we were in in Covid, where low and middle-income countries are at risk of being left behind.”Still, the world is not solely reliant on vaccines: it is hoped antiviral drugs could also be used to protect against H5N1.“It’s not time to panic yet about this virus being adapted to humans, but it’s always good to have a backup plan – and clearly the vaccine is one of our backup plans,” said Prof Barr. “The other one is antivirals, and at the moment they look like they will be effective against this virus.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Join the conversation Show comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

PDF FILE In a significant development, China has granted regional authorization to France for importing poultry products despite ongoing concerns about avian influenza. This decision comes after a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, marking Xi’s first visit to Europe in five years. Background Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has had a severe impact on poultry populations worldwide. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks have led to the culling of millions of birds, with France being one of the hardest-hit countries in the European Union. China previously imposed import bans on French poultry between 2015 and 2019 due to avian influenza outbreaks. In 2021, a new outbreak prompted China to reinstate the embargo. However, the recent agreement allows for a more targeted approach. Pork products Pork products exported to China, including stomachs and intestines, are little consumed in Europe, but are very popular in China. "Two market access agreements, signed with the Chinese customs administration, make it possible to open the Chinese market to new French products: pork offal, thanks to a modification of the protocol for pork exports, as well as processed protein pork, " the French Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement. This measure could boost French pork exports by 10%. Soybean meal reduction Last year, China's Ministry of Agriculture issued a three-year action plan to reduce the use of soybean meal in animal feed in a bid to reduce its heavy reliance on soybean imports. It also approved the import of French dairy products for animal feed last year.Continue after advertising. Key Agreements Pork imports: China will now allow the import of porcine protein feed and pork by-products from France, provided they meet the necessary requirements. This move is expected to boost French pork exports by approximately 10%. Regionalization: Instead of imposing nationwide bans, China has agreed to limit poultry embargoes to specific regions where avian influenza outbreaks occur. France becomes the second country, after the United States in 2020, to receive regionalization status for avian influenza outbreaks. Market access: Two market access agreements were signed with China’s customs administration. These agreements open the Chinese market to new French products, including pork by-products and transformed pork protein. Implications Economic impact: The authorization is a positive step for France’s poultry industry, which heavily relies on exports. China is a major market, receiving 55% of French poultry exports. Biosecurity measures: Both countries will continue to collaborate on modifying protocols to ensure safe poultry trade while minimizing disease risks. Strengthened biosecurity measures are crucial to prevent further outbreaks. Conclusion China’s decision to grant regional authorization to France demonstrates a pragmatic approach to managing avian influenza risks. By allowing targeted imports and regionalization, both countries aim to balance economic interests with biosecurity concerns. As the poultry industry adapts to these changes, close monitoring and cooperation remain essential to safeguarding global poultry trade. Sources: Available upon request.

Deposit RM100 and get a RM10 bonus with the code VERSAMM10 By Muhammad Yusry Monday, 13 May 2024 6:01 PM MYT PUTRAJAYA, May 13 — Health Minister Datuk Seri Dzulkefly Ahmad today said Putrajaya is planning to offer free influenza shots to the elderly, as part of the National Immunisation Programme (NIP), from next year.However, Dzulkefly, who is also the Kuala Selangor MP, said any rollout would be subject to Ministry of Finance (MOF) approval.“It is still under discussion. Seniors are most at risk. We will apply to the MOF to put it in the 2025 Budget first,” he said during a press conference after officiating the National Immunisation Day celebration at Zenith Hotel, here.He added that the free shots will be administered once a year to seniors who wish to get one.So far, the free influenza vaccine is only eligible for frontline government health officers.Dzulkefly also said the government has approved a combination tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (D-TAP) vaccine for expectant mothers.“This is expected to start at the end of 2024, to protect newborns from pertussis infections, or whooping cough,” he said.The vaccine will be administered once every pregnancy.In his speech, Dzulkefly reminded the public that vaccines are not only effective, but also scientifically proven to be safe.“We cannot be complacent. This is because certain parties are now actively spreading false propaganda about vaccines.“This is not a matter of knowledge, because knowledge requires discipline and continuous proof. This is not a matter of choice, because choice requires accountability especially to the public. This is a matter of misinformation and disinformation propagated by anti-science ideology, which was initially contagious in the West, but has now become a global phenomenon.“As a result, many parents have chosen to deny vaccines to their children. This has caused cases such as diphtheria and polio that I mentioned earlier, this issue arises again from time to time, thus endangering public health.,” he said.

Photo: 123rf.com / Composite Image - RNZ There's been an increase in cold and flu illnesses, but Covid-19 cases have been around all summer and are expected to spike as winter nears, experts say. "We are starting to see an increase in respiratory illnesses," General Practice New Zealand chair Porirua GP Bryan Betty said. "Those flus and colds you often see in winter are certainly starting to pick up as the weather gets colder." Children were presenting more often but it was starting to affect different age groups too. Schools are splitting classes up and sending students home as they struggle to find enough relief teachers to cover staff sickness. "We're only starting the winter illness season now," he said, expecting an increase in cases in June and July. There were also cases of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and adenovirus that GPs were seeing. Porirua GP Bryan Betty says it is just the start of the winter illness season. Photo: Supplied "General practice is under more pressure at this point. We know that it can be difficult at times to access your general practitioner," Betty said. The national telehealth service, which runs 24/7, was a good start if a GP was hard to access, he said.

It comes as Te Whatu Ora Health NZ looks at extending telehealth to include overseas-based doctors. "We are now in the 'flu season'," Otago University epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker said. It typically runs from May to October in New Zealand. It was also when the highest rates of influenza, RSV, and other seasonal respiratory infections circulate. "Currently we are seeing a large rise in RSV infections, and rhinovirus, as well as moderate numbers of influenza cases (including both influenza A subtypes and influenza B)," Baker said. He said a rise in respiratory infections was in the usual range for this time of the year based on calls to Healthline, and hospitalisations for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). 'Sharp increase' in Covid cases Covid had been around all summer, and it was still circulating through the community, Betty said. "At this point, we're not seeing a huge upswing, however, we would expect to see Covid cases increase over winter." Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker says Covid has been spreading all year round. Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone Baker said while current wastewater testing and hospitalisations showed a "sharp increase in cases, we will need to wait for another week or two to see if this increase is sustained". Covid was not a "seasonal infection" with cases popping up all year round, he said. "Some of our largest peaks have been in summer - such as the fifth wave we are currently coming out of." People should get vaccinated against the flu and Covid, particularly those in an at-risk group, Betty and Baker said. "Stay home for at least five days if you have respiratory symptoms. Wear a mask in enclosed indoor environments with other people, such as public transport and health care waiting rooms," Baker said. And Health NZ was also urging people to have a plan and get vaccinated. For those with pre-existing health issues, who may need more complex medical support, Health NZ primary and community care clinical director Dr Sarah Clarke said contacting their GP was "a critical part of winter preparedness". "If you have conditions like asthma, COPD or other chronic diseases, make sure you make a plan with your GP practice for if you get sick and, most importantly, ensure you have enough medication to last you through the colder months."

Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ivan Hung, who's also a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that influenza virus infections have rebounded to a relatively high level recently, as residents have low immunity to influenza after three years of the pandemic. He said while the peak flu season dominated by the A subtype H3 virus strain ended last October, infections have continued this year and the SAR also has to contend with a peak season dominated by the A subtype H1 flu virus strain. "In January we have already had the influenza peak season for the subtype H3 virus, and then starting in April and May, we had the peak season that's dominated by the subtype H1 virus. “While the H1 virus-led inflections might ease from June and July, there's a chance that we might see the H3 virus making a comeback to form another small peak season from August and September,” he explained. “But I think overall, the H3 virus-dominated peak season might be less serious compared with the one seen last year,” he added. The infectious disease expert again called on parents to take their children to get a flu vaccine shot prior to the summer vacation, as there were many serious cases of children infected by the subtype H1 virus. He also noted that the city’s Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases had recommended that the Department of Health increase the procurement of the nasal vaccine to raise vaccination rates, as young children were more willing to receive the nasal vaccine. Separately, Hung predicted that the new Covid variant - KP.2 strain - that was discovered in the city’s sewage system, will replace the current prevalent variant - JN.1 - as the dominant Covid strain.

This illness is typically found in large-scale poultry farms. Recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture- Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service revealed a notable increase in H5N1 cases across the mainland U.S., with over 3 million affected birds reported in conﬁrmed infected ﬂocks. In response, stringent biosecurity measures are being continued to protect our borders and mitigate the spread of this highly contagious virus.To safeguard against the introduction of H5N1 to the CNMI, a temporary ban on the importation of live poultry and hatching eggs from the mainland U.S. and foreign countries is being continued. Exceptions may be granted for poultry imports originating from Hawaii and Guam, subject to thorough review and clearance by the Department of Land and Resources-Animal Health Division and issuance of an entry permit.For information regarding the necessary documents for clearance and the issuance of an entry permit for live poultry and hatching eggs imported from Hawaii, contact the DLNR-Animal Health division at (670) 256-3319.What can you do?Remain vigilant. If you raise poultry, closely monitor their health and promptly report any signs of illness or unexplained deaths to the DLNR Animal Health Division. Reports can be submitted via email at Lauren.Cabrera.dlnr@gmail.com or by phone at (670) 256-3319.If you come across sick or deceased wild birds, report these instances to the Division of Fish and Wildlife at (670) 664-6000.

Male' | 15 May 2024 | Wed 07:56 Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH) Sun Online Cases of influenza Cases of common cold, diarrhea, influenza drop 33,637 cases of common cold were reported in March 5,428 cases of diarrhea were reported in March Precautionary measures have been detailed Zunana Zalif 8,005 There has been a steady decline in the cases of common cold, diarrhea and influenza being reported across the Maldives. This was revealed by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on Tuesday. As such, HPA’s statistics revealed that a total of 33,637 cases of common cold were reported in March this year, followed by 22,739 during April. Although the number of reported viral flu cases has dropped, HPA has shed light on the importance of taking preventive measures against fever, Covid-19 as well as influenza. HPA has also reported that the number of people who tested for influenza symptoms also came down during April in comparison to April. Out of the 1,058 samples tested so far this year, only 145 returned positive. 220 people tested for influenza during March, out of which 27 tested positive. Further, 117 tested during April out of which eight tests returned positive. Some of the precautionary measures that have been urged include regular hand washing, taking more fluids if one catches the cold, only using paracetamol if one has a high temperature, covering one’s nose and mouth when coughing to make sure that others don’t get infected, wearing long-sleeve shirts and long pants and using mosquito repellent lotions or sprays to prevent dengue fever. HPA has also advised the public to take vaccination and precautionary treatment for influenza in the coming days. While influenza and its complications can be deadly, individuals who are 65 and older, individuals with certain chronic medical conditions like diabetes, asthma or heart diseases, pregnant women, children below five and those who have recently undergone a transplant are more prone to getting complications. HPA has stressed on the importance of adhering to precautionary measures, to prevent the spread of viral flu and common cold cases. The public health authority’s statistics go on to reveal that 5,428 cases of diarrhea were reported during March, with 2,714 reported during April. Some precautionary measures against diarrhea include washing hands with soap before eating or preparing food, as well as after using the washroom or changing diapers. Further, the public has been urged to properly wash vegetables and fruits before preparing dishes and to cook food thoroughly, to avoid diarrhea. HPA also urged the people to ensure that the place used to store food at home is clean, and to regularly clean places and equipment used for food preparation. Individuals are encouraged to use bottled water, chlorinated water, water supply or pre-boiled water to drink and to use in cooking as well. HPA has also revealed that drinking more liquids, helps when one contracts the virus. Breastfeeding mothers are urged to continue feeding sessions without stopping. In addition to this, the public has been advised to not go to crowded places if they exhibit symptoms, especially with children.

A SURGE in influenza cases has gripped Zimbabwe, with health officials reporting a concentration in the Mashonaland East and Mashonaland Central provinces. The outbreak began early this year with over 85 000 people having been affected. About 3 500 new cases were reported last week. “3 634 suspected influenza cases and zero deaths were reported this week. The provinces that reported the highest number of suspected influenza cases were Mashonaland East (977) and Mashonaland Central (1 000). The cumulative figures for influenza are 87 483 and 0 deaths,” the Health ministry said. This influenza outbreak is reminiscent of 2009 when the country was affected by the H1N1 strain. The initial cases were reported in Manicaland province before spreading to Harare, Mashonaland East and Midlands.
