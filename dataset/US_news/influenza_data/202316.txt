Using the Auxin-Induced Degron (AID) system to rapidly degrade proteins, we show that among the nucleoporins localized at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, TPR is the key nucleoporin required for nuclear export of influenza virus mRNAs. TPR recruits the TRanscription and EXport complex (TREX)−2 to the NPC for exporting a subset of cellular mRNAs. By degrading components of the TREX-2 complex (GANP, Germinal-center Associated Nuclear Protein; PCID2, PCI domain containing 2), we show that influenza mRNAs require the TREX-2 complex for nuclear export and replication. Furthermore, we found that cellular mRNAs whose export is dependent on GANP have a small number of exons, a high mean exon length, long 3’ UTR, and low GC content. Some of these features are shared by influenza virus mRNAs. Additionally, we identified a 45 nucleotide RNA signal from influenza virus HA mRNA that is sufficient to mediate GANP-dependent mRNA export. Thus, we report a role for the TREX-2 complex in nuclear export of influenza mRNAs and identified RNA determinants associated with the TREX-2-dependent mRNA export.

TREX consists of a hexameric core termed THO (THOC1-3, 5–7), the RNA helicase UAP56 (56 kDa U2AF-associated protein), the adapter protein ALYREF (THO Complex Subunit 4), and additional proteins1,2. During gene expression, the TREX complex is recruited co-transcriptionally and pre-mRNA processing further mediates TREX assembly on the transcript1. Through the combined action of TREX complex and other mRNA export factors, the major mRNA export receptor NXF1 (nuclear RNA export factor-1):NXT1 (nuclear transport factor 2-related export protein) heterodimer is recruited to the mRNA to mediate nuclear export through the NPC1. NXF1 can also associate with the TREX-2 protein complex (consists of (GANP, Germinal-center Associated Nuclear Protein; PCID2, PCI domain containing 2; DSS1; deleted in spilt hand/spilt foot; ENY2, Enhancer of Yellow 2 homolog; and Centrins) through its interaction with GANP3. The human TREX-2 component GANP is known to mediate nuclear export of a subset of cellular mRNAs4. During mRNA export, TREX-2 interacts with the nucleoporin TPR via GANP at the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC)3,5. GANP binds the NXF1:NXT1 heterodimer3, which then mediates translocation of the mRNP through the NPC. Once the mRNA reaches the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, the RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA-unwinding activities of the DEAD-box RNA helicase DBP5 together with the mRNA export factor GLE1 induce the release of NXF1 from the mRNP, and NXF1 then recycles back to the nucleus1.Influenza virus mRNAs are transcribed in the host cell nucleus from eight unique viral genomic RNAs that enter the nucleus via the NPC6. Six mRNAs (HA, NP, NA, PB2, PB1, and PA) are intronless and hence exported without splicing7. Two of the viral mRNAs (M and NS) undergo alternative splicing, but a pool of unspliced messages is also exported to the cytoplasm for translation into proteins7. It is not yet understood how these unspliced viral mRNAs or mRNAs that undergo few splicing events are efficiently exported. Here, using the AID-tag system to rapidly degrade constituents of the NPC and the TREX-2 complex, we show that influenza virus mRNAs usurp the cellular nucleoporin TPR and the TREX-2 complex for their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We find that influenza virus mRNAs contain RNA features associated with cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for their nuclear export. Moreover, we identify a 45 nt RNA sequence in the 5’ end of viral HA mRNA which is sufficient to make mRNA export GANP dependent. Thus, we uncover the pathway taken by influenza virus mRNAs for nuclear export. Additionally, we identify RNA features and a signal that mediate GANP-dependent mRNA export.ResultsThe nucleoporin TPR (but not NUP153 and NUP50) is required for influenza A virus mRNA nuclear exportDuring mRNP export through the NPC, the first structure mRNPs encounter is the basket localized at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Thus, we sought to determine the nuclear basket nucleoporins (Nups) that are required for viral mRNA export. We used the AID-tag system to selectively and rapidly degrade individual nuclear basket Nups in DLD-1 cells, as we previously reported5, to prevent long term effects of depletion. DLD-1 cells expressing AID-tagged NUP153, NUP50, or TPR (NUP153AID, NUP50AID, AIDTPR cells)5 were infected with IAV (A/WSN/33). After 2 h 45 min of infection, auxin was added to degrade the specific Nup and infection was maintained for an additional 5 h 15 min (Fig. 1a). Cells were then subjected to single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH) to detect and quantify the viral M, NS, and HA mRNAs, which are differentially processed. The M and NS mRNAs undergo alternative splicing whereas the HA mRNA is not spliced7. The probes used for M and NS mRNAs can recognize both unspliced and spliced forms8. We found that depletion of NUP153 or NUP50 did not alter nuclear export of these viral mRNAs (Fig. 1b–o). These results were further corroborated by quantification of fluorescence intensity in the whole cell and in the nucleus, and the results are presented as % nuclear mRNA (Fig. 1e–g, l–n). The levels of NUP153 and NUP50 proteins, before and after auxin treatment, were detected by western blot and auxin treatment led to efficient degradation of both proteins (Fig. 1h, o). In contrast, depletion of TPR robustly inhibited nuclear export of the M, NS and HA mRNAs, as shown by smRNA FISH (Fig. 1p–r) and quantification of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1s–u). The results of auxin treated AIDTPR cells were compared to parental DLD-1 cells as levels of TPR were slightly decreased in untreated AIDTPR cells (Fig. 1v) and were sufficient to induce mRNA export block (Fig. 1p–u). Similar results were obtained by subcellular fractionation in which additional influenza virus mRNAs were quantified in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and were shown to be significantly retained in the nucleus upon TPR degradation (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Thus, among basket nucleoporins TPR is critical for influenza virus mRNA export.Fig. 1: The nucleoporin TPR (but not NUP153 and NUP50) is required for influenza A virus mRNA nuclear export.a DLD-1 cells expressing endogenously AID-tagged basket nucleoporins (NUP153AID, NUP50AID and AIDTPR cells) were infected with influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) and after 2 h 45 min cells were untreated or treated with auxin to degrade AID-tagged proteins. After 8 h of infection, cells were fixed and subjected to smRNA FISH to detect viral M, NS, and HA mRNAs with probes labeled with Quasar 570.

We carried out experiments in DLD-1 cells expressing AID-tagged GANP or PCID2 (AIDGANP, AIDPCID2)5, which are key constituents of the TREX-2 complex. The experimental conditions and assays were performed as described in Fig. 1. We found that depletion of GANP (Fig. 2b–g) or PCID2 (Fig. 2i–n) by auxin treatment prevented nuclear export of viral M, NS, and HA mRNAs compared to cells not treated with auxin. The AIDGANP cells untreated with auxin showed similar distribution of viral mRNAs as parental DLD1 cells (Fig. 1p–u). As shown by western blot, GANP and PCID2 proteins were effectively degraded by auxin treatment (Fig. 2h, o). Additionally, the viral NP (nucleoprotein) and NA (neuraminidase) mRNAs also depend on GANP and PCID2 for export (Supplementary Figs. 1b, c and 2). These results are further corroborated by subcellular fractionation in which additional viral mRNAs were significantly retained in the nucleus upon depletion of GANP or PCID2 (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). The nuclear export inhibition of viral mRNA was also observed in A549 cells and using diverse viral strains (A/California/07/2009; A/Wyoming/03/2003; A/Vietnam/1203/2004) (Supplementary Fig. 3). We have also observed a decrease in viral protein levels and viral replication upon GANP knockdown (Fig. 3). Thus, these findings indicate that IAV exploits the TREX-2 complex for nuclear export of its mRNAs. Furthermore, using AID-tagged NXF1 cells, we confirmed that these viral mRNAs require NXF1 for their export (Supplementary Fig. 4), which is likely recruited by the TREX-2 complex via GANP. The latter results are consistent with previous findings using siRNAs in which NXF1 was shown to be required for influenza virus mRNA export9,10,11,12.Fig. 2: Nuclear export of influenza virus mRNAs is dependent on constituents of the TREX-2 complex.a Schematic representation of the TREX-2 complex interaction with the nucleoporin TPR. b–d AIDGANP cells were infected with influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) and 2 h 45 min post-infection cells were untreated or treated with auxin to degrade GANP.

Since TREX-2 appears to mediate nuclear export of a subset of cellular mRNAs4 and viral mRNAs are usurping this pathway (Fig. 2), we first carried out a systematic identification of the cellular mRNAs whose export is dependent on TREX-2. As GANP is a key constituent of the TREX-2 complex, we depleted GANP to identify cellular mRNAs that are dependent on TREX-2 for nuclear export. AIDGANP cells were treated with auxin for 8 h to degrade GANP and then fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 4a). RNA was purified from whole cell lysates, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and each sample was subjected to RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 1). The presence of high levels of MALAT1 RNA in the nuclear fractions and higher levels of GAPDH or actin mRNAs in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus validated the fractionation procedure (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5).Fig. 4: RNA features associated with cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for their nuclear export.a AIDGANP cells were untreated or treated with auxin to degrade the GANP protein. After 8 h, RNA was isolated from whole cells or cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation to isolate RNA from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. RNA-seq was performed with these RNA samples and data were analyzed to identify RNA features associated with cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for their nuclear export. b–g Boxplots show the distribution of RNA features between export inhibited (right) and export not affected (left) mRNAs upon GANP degradation. The box represents the 75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution, the orange line indicates the median, and whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range of the data for each group. Mann–Whitney U-test (two-tailed test) was used to compare export inhibited (398 genes) and export not affected (3694 genes). Data are derived from two independent RNA-Seq experiments.Full size imageFor selecting cellular mRNAs dependent on GANP for nuclear export, we first identified the mRNAs whose levels were not significantly altered (1 < log2 fold change > −1) in the total cell lysate of GANP-depleted cells compared to control cells. The rationale for this selection is that changes in total mRNA levels may involve other RNA processing pathways. Thus, from this group of mRNAs that are not altered at the whole cell level, the mRNAs whose relative change in nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio was >3.5 upon GANP depletion were considered as export inhibited, and mRNAs with relative change in N/C ratios between 1.5 and 0.66 were considered as not affected by GANP depletion. In this manner, we selected mRNAs whose nuclear export is inhibited with no significant change in their total cellular levels. Upon GANP degradation, we found that 398 mRNAs were accumulated in the nucleus without significant changes in their total levels indicating their dependence on GANP for nuclear export (Supplementary Data 1). Nuclear export of 3,694 mRNAs was not affected upon GANP depletion (Supplementary Data 1).Analysis of shared features among the mRNAs that are GANP-dependent for nuclear export showed that this subset of mRNAs has a small number of exons and long exons compared to mRNAs whose localization was not affected by GANP depletion (Fig. 4b–d). Additionally, the mRNAs dependent on GANP for export have longer 3’ UTR (Fig. 4e) and a slightly overall lower GC content (Fig. 4f), including lower GC content at specific regions in the 5’ end of mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 6), than the mRNA population not affected by GANP degradation. In contrast, the pre-mRNA length is not different between these two groups of mRNAs (Fig. 4g). The 5’ UTR and the mRNA coding region of GANP-dependent mRNAs are only slightly longer than the mRNAs whose export is not affected by GANP depletion (Supplementary Fig. 7). Selected mRNAs accumulated in the nucleus by GANP depletion were further validated using qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 8). These mRNAs again showed higher nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios (N/C) upon GANP depletion compared to N/C ratios in the presence of GANP, corroborating the RNA-seq results. Altogether, these results suggest a potential combination of RNA features that may determine GANP/TREX2-dependency for nuclear export. We then compared the mRNA features of the influenza virus mRNAs with the top 10 cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for export and the 10 top cellular mRNAs that are independent on GANP (Fig. 5a, b). We found that the small number of exons and the high mean exon length are the common determinants between the influenza virus mRNAs and cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for nuclear export (Fig. 5). Together, these results suggest that small exon number and high mean exon length are features that may contribute to GANP-dependent export of cellular and influenza A virus mRNAs.Fig. 5: IAV mRNAs contain RNA features associated with cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for their nuclear export.a Number of exons and mean exon length are shown for the top mRNAs from the GANP dependent and independent mRNA groups. b Number of exons and mean exon length are shown for influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) mRNAs.Full size imageA sequence at the 5’ end of influenza virus HA mRNA coding region can determine GANP-dependent mRNA exportNext, we selected the viral HA mRNA as a model to further investigate GANP dependency. We first used a recombinant influenza virus expressing eGFP mRNA in which the eGFP sequence is flanked by the 5’ end of the HA mRNA [nt 1–77 (5’ UTR: nt 1–32 + coding region: nt 33–77)] and the 3’ end [nt 1651–1754 (last 80 nt of the HA mRNA coding region: nt 1651–1730 + 3’UTR: nt 1731–1754)] (Fig. 6a). AIDGANP cells were infected with this recombinant virus and auxin was added 2 h 45 min post-infection to degrade GANP. After 5 h 15 min of auxin treatment, cells were subjected to smRNA FISH to detect the eGFP mRNA (Fig. 6b). We found that eGFP mRNA flanked by the 5’ and 3’ ends of the viral HA mRNA was retained in the nucleus upon GANP degradation (Fig. 6b) and quantification of fluorescence intensity in the whole cell and in the nucleus further demonstrated the percentage increase in nuclear retention upon GANP depletion (Fig. 6c). These results indicated that there is a determinant(s) within the 5’ end and/or the 3’ end of the viral HA mRNA that makes mRNA export dependent on GANP.Fig. 6: eGFP mRNA flanked by the 5’ and 3’ ends of the HA mRNA is dependent on GANP for nuclear export.a Schematic representation of influenza virus expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-pseudotyped green fluorescent protein (eGFP). b AIDGANP cells were infected with influenza virus (WSN) expressing HA-pseudotyped eGFP protein and 2 h 45 min post-infection cells were treated with auxin to degrade the GANP protein. After 8 h of infection, cells were fixed and subjected to smRNA FISH to detect eGFP mRNA with probes labeled with Quasar 570. DNA was stained with Hoechst. Scale bar, 10 μm. Data are representative of three independent experiments. c Fluorescence intensity of eGFP mRNA was quantified in the whole cell and in the nucleus using the Imaris software (Bitplane). Percentage of nuclear values for each viral mRNA are shown for each cell (dot) (Untreated n = 34 cells and auxin treated n = 32 cells). Cells used for quantification were from three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean values +/− SD. p values were calculated using unpaired two tailed Student’s t test (GraphPad Prism 9). p values ≤ 0.05 are considered significant.Full size imageWe then expressed eGFP mRNA alone from a mammalian expression vector (pCAG) in AIDGANP cells. After 20 h of transfection, cells were treated with auxin for 5 h 15 min to deplete GANP. In this context, nuclear export of eGFP mRNA was only slightly dependent on GANP (Fig. 7a). In the context of the pCAG vector, the eGFP mRNA undergoes one splicing event and has a long exon, which are features common to the cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for export (Fig. 4). However, eGFP mRNA also has a high GC content (61.5%), which is a feature known to promote mRNA export13 that may significantly counteract GANP requirement and explain the low GANP dependency of eGFP mRNA. Using this same mammalian expression vector, we generated a series of mutants in the HA sequences (Fig. 7a). When eGFP mRNA was flanked by the 5’ end and 3’ end of the viral HA mRNA, this mRNA showed increased nuclear retention compared to the eGFP mRNA alone, suggesting that the 5’ end and/or the 3’ end of the HA mRNA contain determinants for GANP-mediated nuclear export. We then fused the 5’ end of the HA mRNA (nt 1-77) alone with eGFP and expressed it in the presence of GANP or upon GANP depletion. We found that this 5’ end region of the HA mRNA is sufficient to mediate GANP-dependent export, as eGFP mRNA was retained in the nucleus upon GANP degradation. In contrast, nuclear export of eGFP mRNA fused with the 3’ end of the HA mRNA did not alter eGFP mRNA upon GANP depletion. These results indicated that the 5’ end of the HA mRNA alone has determinants to dictate nuclear export via GANP. To further map this region, we fused the either 5’ UTR of the HA mRNA (nt 1-32) or the first 45 nt from 5’ end of HA mRNA coding region to eGFP and found that the 5’UTR does not alter GANP dependency of eGFP mRNA upon GANP depletion while the first 45 nt from the HA mRNA coding region was able to significantly increase GANP dependency of eGFP mRNA (Fig. 7a). These results indicated that the first 45 nt of the HA mRNA coding region (nt 33-77) are important to make the 5’end of the HA mRNA a determinant/signal for nuclear export via GANP. Of note, this 45 nt sequence has a region that is GU-rich (Fig. 7b), a sequence motif that serves as a recognition sequence for several RBPs14, and has two predicted stem-loop structures (Fig. 7c).Fig. 7: The 5’ end of the HA mRNA coding region encodes a 45 nt determinant for GANP- mediated mRNA export.a Graph shows percentage of nuclear fluorescence in AIDGANP cells transfected with pCAG plasmids encoding eGFP, HA5’end-eGFP-HA3’end, HA5’end-eGFP, eGFP-HA3’end, HA5’UTR-eGFP, and HA-CDS(45nt)-eGFP (the first 45 nt at the 5’ end of the HA coding sequence fused with eGFP) mRNAs, and with plasmids for the influenza virus minigenome assay expressing the HA5’end-eGFP-HA3’end mRNA. After 20 h of transfection, cells were untreated or treated with auxin for 5 h 15 min to degrade GANP. Cells were then subjected to smRNA FISH to detect eGFP mRNA with probes labeled with Quasar 570. DNA was stained with Hoechst. Quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed as in Fig. 6. “n” in the figure indicates the number of cells from three independent experiments used for quantification. p values were calculated using one-way ANOVA multiple comparisons (GraphPad Prism 9). p values ≤ 0.05 are considered significant. Representative images show AIDGANP cells transfected with pCAG-eGFP plasmid or eGFP mRNA flanked by the first 45 nt at the 5’ end of the viral HA mRNA coding region (pCAG-HA-CDS(45nt)-eGFP). Scale bar, 10 μm. Data are representative of three independent experiments. b The first 45 nt of the coding region of the HA mRNA are shown. c Predicted structure of the HA sequence in b was determined using the RNAStructure software.Full size imageThe 45-nucleotide HA mRNA sequence was aligned against the BV-BRC database and the NCBI database to record sequence conservation. Similar sequence alignment results were obtained in both databases. The 45-nucleotide region of HA mRNAs was shown to be conserved across several influenza A strains. The first 13 strains depicted in Supplementary Fig. 9a are shown to be identical, while strains numbered 13 through 22 have shown to hold at least a 91% identity match. In addition to sequence conservation, secondary structure predictions were compared between these 22 strains using the RNAstructure webserver. The secondary structures of the different sequences obtained from the sequence alignment were predicted and grouped in Supplementary Fig. 9b according to their sequence similarities. The first secondary structure corresponding to strains 1-13, which are identical to the 45-nucleotide HA mRNA region, has shown to form two distinct stem-loops. The first demonstrating a low probability of folding of around 50%, while the second stem-loop shows a higher probability of 80%. In strain 14, the single nucleotide change caused the first stem-loop to unfold, but maintains the formation of the second stem-loop, which is identical to the original structure. In strains 15 through 20, a three-nucleotide alteration caused a complete alteration in the predicted secondary structure compared to the HA mRNA region. Similar observations can be made for strains 21 and 22 with a folding probability of 50%. These low probabilities can be attributed to their dependence on other stem-loops in close proximity to stabilize their structures.We have also observed that when the 5’ and 3’ ends of the HA mRNA flanking eGFP was expressed in the context of the viral minigenome system, in which the mRNA is synthesized by the viral polymerase, the GANP-dependency for export was enhanced as compared to the expression of the same mRNA in the context of plasmid. These results suggest that the viral polymerase may have a role in facilitating GANP-mediated export. In summary, we identified a sequence in the 5’ end of the influenza virus HA mRNA that can mediate mRNA export through the TREX-2 complex.DiscussionHere, we report key players involved in nuclear export of influenza virus mRNAs. We found that the viral mRNAs usurp the TREX-2 mRNA export complex and the nucleoporin TPR to mediate their export from the nucleus. The requirement of TPR for viral mRNA export and not of the other basket Nups (NUP153 and NUP50) is consistent with our previous results showing that TPR, and not NUP153 and NUP50, is required for GANP (TREX-2 component) localization to the NPC5. Hence, depletion of TPR likely inhibited viral mRNA export because of the decrease in GANP localization to the NPC. Depletion of TREX-2 components or TPR resulted in a robust nuclear export inhibition of influenza virus mRNAs, demonstrating an important and previously unknown role for the TREX-2 complex in the influenza virus life cycle. All viral mRNAs were tested and are dependent on the TREX-2 complex components for export. These mRNAs include the ones that undergo splicing, M and NS, and the others that are not spliced. In addition to the TREX-2 complex, IAV M mRNA export also requires ALY/REF, UAP568, NXF19,10,11,12 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, the TREX-2 complex likely functions together with constituents of the TREX complex to mediate influenza virus mRNA export. It has been shown that depletion of TPR significantly reduced the probability of mRNAs entering the NPC for export15. However, NXF1 localization and dynamics at the NPC is independent of TPR5. Since GANP interacts with NXF13 and TPR4, it is possible that GANP interaction with TPR may increase association of GANP-bound mRNPs with the NPC and GANP also acts as an adapter to recruit NXF1.We systematically identified cellular mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for export to gain insights into shared RNA features between the cellular and viral mRNAs that could drive mRNA export via GANP. From RNA-seq data analysis we found that low exon number, longer exons, longer 3’ UTR, and low GC content are associated with GANP-dependent export. Like GANP-dependent cellular mRNAs, IAV mRNAs have low exon numbers (1 or 2 exons) and high mean exon length indicating that these shared RNA features may contribute to the export of influenza virus mRNAs via GANP. Previously, a subset of cellular mRNAs whose export is dependent on GANP has been identified using siRNA4. Here we used the AID-tag system which allows quick degradation of GANP, avoiding long-term effects of depletion. Furthermore, earlier work utilized microarray analysis of the cytoplasmic fraction alone to identify the GANP-dependent mRNAs4, while here we have performed RNA-Seq of both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. In the previous study, mRNAs with low exon number were reported to be associated with GANP dependency4, which is in agreement with our findings. In our current study, we report new additional RNA features (long exons, longer UTRs, and low GC content) associated with GANP dependency. In another study, knockdown of TPR was shown to inhibit export of intronless mRNAs or mRNAs with low exon numbers16. These results further corroborate our findings as TPR is required for GANP localization at the NPC5.Splicing promotes mRNA export by recruiting NXF1 through the exon junction complex (EJC) and/or SR proteins17. One would expect that export of unspliced mRNAs and of mRNAs that undergo few splicing events like influenza virus mRNAs, would be associated with a fewer EJCs and/or SR proteins, which would recruit less NXF1 than mRNAs with many exons. Thus, the unspliced mRNAs or the mRNAs with few exons may use GANP to recruit NXF1. In addition, GANP-mediated docking of mRNPs to the NPC via TPR may promote export of mRNAs associated with less NXF1 molecules. In contrast, mRNAs with high exon numbers may be decorated with a large number of mRNA export factors (such as ALY/REF and NXF1)17, making them less dependent or independent on GANP for nuclear export. It has been previously shown that nuclear export of mRNAs with high mean exon length18 and long 3’ UTR19 are more sensitive to NXF1 knockdown than mRNAs with a small mean exon length and 3’ UTR. These results suggest that this class of mRNAs recruits NXF1 less efficiently or requires higher number of NXF1 molecules to get exported. This NXF1 phenotype together with the RNA features of this subset of mRNAs may again indicate that these mRNAs interact with GANP to efficiently recruit NXF1 and dock at the NPC. Together, these findings are consistent with the RNA features we identified in both cellular and viral mRNAs that are dependent on GANP for nuclear export.Additionally, it is known that mRNAs with high GC content at the 5’ end of cellular mRNAs are more efficiently exported from the nucleus than mRNAs with low GC content13, which may need additional factors, such as GANP, to facilitate export. Recently, the RBM33 protein was shown to bind to high GC stretches on mRNAs and recruit NXF1 for their export20. We found that the GANP-dependent mRNAs have a lower overall GC content than the GANP-independent mRNAs including regions within the first 75 nt at the 5’ end, therefore it is possible that GANP-independent mRNAs may use small GC-rich regions to recruit mRNA export factors to mediate export independent or less dependent on GANP. We have then further analyzed the viral HA mRNA and found that the 5’ end (1-77nt: 5’UTR + 5’ end of the coding region) contains sufficient information required to make a reporter GFP mRNA GANP-dependent for export. The HA 5’ UTR fused with the eGFP mRNA failed to increase GANP dependency while the first 45 nt of the HA coding region were sufficient to promote export through GANP. This 45 nt region is conserved among influenza A viruses and is predicted to potentially form stem-loop structures (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus, these results indicate that the first 45 nt of the HA mRNA coding region have critical determinants for mRNA nuclear export via GANP and may interact with specific RNA binding proteins to mediate GANP-dependent export, which is a topic of future research. We have also observed that the viral polymerase further enhanced GANP-dependency when the eGFP mRNA flanked by the 5’ and 3’ ends of the HA mRNA was expressed in the context of the minigenome system. This finding may indicate that the viral polymerase may facilitate recruitment of factor(s) involved in the TREX-2 export pathway. Together, these findings suggest that influenza A virus mRNAs as well as a subset of cellular mRNAs encode a combination of RNA features that determine GANP-dependent nuclear export. In sum, we uncovered a novel role for the TREX-2 complex in nuclear export of influenza virus mRNAs and identified RNA determinants, which alone or in combination, are associated with GANP dependency for nuclear export. This knowledge provides insights into potential antiviral strategies that could be developed for inhibiting influenza virus mRNA export and consequently virus replication.MethodsCell lines and cell cultureDLD-1, NUP50AID, NUP153AID, AIDTPR, AIDGANP, and AIDNXF1 cells5 were generated as previously described5. To generate the AIDPCID2 cells, the PCID2 gene was tagged with a 1xmicroAID21 and HA-tag at the N-terminus using the following gRNAs CATGGGAGCGCCGCCGAA and GCTGCAGGTACTGGTTAA (Supplementary Fig. 10a). The repair template for PCID2 gene targeting has been assembled using Gibson assembly reaction (E2621S, NEB) and Platinum SuperFi DNA polymerase (12351010) with the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table 1. To verify the homozygosity of clones, we performed genotyping of DLD-1 cells using the protocol previously described5 and two independent sets of oligonucleotides: Fin CCTCGCCACTGGACCC, Rin CCACAGCCTCGCGCT, Fout CCGGGACGTGCCCTAAC, Rout CCTCAGCCCACCCATTCTTATT (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Ubiquitin ligase TIR1 was knocked-in into the Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1, NC_000001.11) locus using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated recombination as described previously5 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). AID-mediated degradation of PCID2 in the presence of auxin was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10c) and by label-free quantification proteomics of cell lysates (Supplementary Dataset 2). Total cell lysates were prepared according to a previously published protocol5. Auxin (1 mM) was added to degrade the specific AID-tagged proteins, as described in the figure legends. MDCK cells were used for virus amplification. Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) and MDCK cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). All cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco) medium with 10% FBS (Atlas) and Pen/Strep antibiotics. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2.AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used for western blot analysis: NUP50 (Catalog # A301-782A; dilution 1:500), NUP153 (Catalog # A301-789A; dilution 1:500) from Bethyl Laboratories, HA-tag(C29F4) (Catalog # 3724; dilution 1:750) from Cell Signaling Technology, β-actin (13E5) (Catalog # 4970 S; dilution 1:1500) from Cell Signaling Technology, GANP (Catalog # A303-127A; dilution 1:500) from Bethyl Laboratories, NS1 (Catalog # GTX125900; dilution 1:500) from GeneTex, anti-influenza A virions (Catalog # B65141G; dilution 1:1000) from Meridian Bioscience, β-actin (Catalog #A1978; dilution 1:5000) from Sigma Aldrich, and TPR rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution 1:200) as previously described22.VirusesAll virus work was performed as per CDC guidelines for biosafety level 2. Influenza A viruses (A/WSN/33, A/Vietnam/1203/04, A/California/04/2009, and A/Wyoming/03/2003) were generated and tittered, as previously described23. Hemagglutinin-pseudotyped green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing Influenza Virus was generated as described24.InfectionCells were washed with EMEM infection medium [EMEM (ATCC), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 0.125% BSA (Gibco), 0.5 µg/mL TPCK trypsin (Worthington Biomedical Corporation)] and incubated with A/WSN/33 for 1.5 h. Cells were then washed with EMEM infection medium and incubated in the same medium throughout the experiment. MOIs are indicated in the figures and/or legends.PlasmidspCAG-EGFP was a gift from Wilson Wong (Addgene plasmid # 89684; http:/2t.net/addgene:89684; RRID: Addgene_89684)25. The 5’ end of HA mRNA (nt 1-77) fused with eGFP and the 3’ end of the HA mRNA (nt 1651-1754) were amplified from the pPOLI HA (45) GFP (80) vRNA plasmid24 and cloned between MluI and NotI restriction sites to generate pCAG-HA5’end-eGFP-HA3’end, pCAG-HA5’end-eGFP, pCAG-eGFP-HA3’end and pCAG-HACDS(45nt)-eGFP plasmids. Single stranded oligos and eGFP PCR amplicons were assembled between MluI and NotI restriction sites to obtain pCAG-HA5’UTR-eGFP plasmids. All cloning was performed using the NEB HiFi assembly kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.TransfectionsFor imaging experiments, cells were forward transfected with plasmids using lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) in 24-well plates on glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich). For experiments using siRNAs (Dharmacon), A549 cells were reverse transfected with 30 nM siRNAs in 24-well plates using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 60 h and then infected with influenza viruses for 8 h. Cells were then subjected to smRNA FISH or western blot. Regarding the plaque assays shown in Fig. 3, cells were reverse transfected for 48 h and then infected as indicated in the figure legend.Minigenome assayCells were reverse transfected with equal quantities of pPOL1-HA(45)eGFP(80), pCDNA3 NP, pCDNA3 PA, pCDNA 3 PB1, pCDNA 3 PB2, pCAGGS NS1 and cultured on glass cover slips coated with 0.2% gelatin. After 24 h of transfection, cells were untreated or treated with auxin for 5 h 15 min and then subjected to smRNA FISH24.smRNA FISHsmRNA FISH was performed as previously described8. M, NS and HA RNA FISH probes sequences are available in earlier articles8,26. The sequences of NP and eGFP mRNA probes are available in the Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.Fluorescence microscopy and data analysisImage capturing and analysis were performed as previously described8. In brief, smRNA FISH images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M automated microscope and the Micro-Manager version 227,28 or AxioVision 4.4 softwares. A Zeiss ×63 Plan-APOCHROMAT lens (1.4 numerical aperture) was used. Multiple Z planes of 0.3 µm thickness was captured to collect signals from both the cytoplasm and the nuclear compartments. Images were deconvolved using AutoQuant X v3.0.4 software. Deconvolved images were analyzed by Imaris 9.2 software (Bitplane) using surfaces tool for segmentation and signal analysis within the whole cell and the nucleus. Fiji software was used to process microscopy images to generate figures29.Western blotCells were washed in PBS and harvested in 2× sample lysis buffer (125 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). Lysate was subjected to sonication and 10 min boiling. Protein concentration was quantified using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit. Samples were loaded onto Bolt Bis-Tris Plus gels (Invitrogen) and subjected to western blot analysis as previously described30. Full scan blots can be found in the Source Data file.Extraction of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAAll samples and buffers were kept on ice throughout the experiment. All centrifugations were performed at 4 oC. Cells (100 mm dish) were washed in 10 ml ice cold PBS and then incubated in 9 ml of ice-cold PBS with 10 mM EDTA. After 3-4 min, cells were gently harvested using a scrapper and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. Supernatant was removed and cells were gently washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g. Supernatant was removed and gently suspended in ice-cold PBS to obtain 6 × 106 cells per ml, which were transferred to a pre-chilled 1.5 ml tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. PBS was removed and cells were gently resuspend in 450 µl of buffer A (15 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 8, 0.5 mM spermidine, 80U/ml RNAse inhibitor, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). Buffer A (450 µl) with 0.4% NP-40 was then added to the cell suspension, which was mixed by inversion (6x), incubated for 5 min on ice, and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g. Supernatant (700 µl) was removed without disturbing the nuclear pellet and transferred to a new tube on ice (cytoplasmic fraction). The nuclear pellet was gently suspended in 450 µl RLN buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 80 U/ml RNAse inhibitor, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). RLN buffer (450 µl) with 0.5% NP40 was added to the nuclear pellet, which was then mixed by inversion, and incubated for 3 min on ice. While nuclear pellet was incubated on ice, the cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged for 1 min at 500 × g and 550 µl was transferred into a new tube on ice. The nuclear fraction was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g immediately after the 3 min incubation. Supernatant was removed from the nuclear pellet and the nuclear pellet was placed on ice. The cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged at 9300 × g for 2 min and 450 µl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube placed on ice (final cytoplasmic fraction) and then mixed with 3 times volume of LS-TRIzol (Thermo Fisher). The nuclear pellet (final nuclear fraction) was suspended in 1 ml regular TRIzol. Pipetted up and down to completely resuspend the nuclear pellet. RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, RNA was dissolved in 100 µl nuclease-free water. RNA was further purified using the Qiagen RNeasy plus kit with the modifications below. The RLT plus buffer (350 µl) was added to 100 µl RNA, mixed well, and passed through gDNA columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ethanol (100%; 250 µl) was added instead of 350 µl of 70% ethanol. Subsequent steps were performed as per manufacturer’s instructions. To increase RNA yield, pass RNA elutes again through the same column in the last step. This is a modified version of a fractionation protocol from Igor Ulitsky’s laboratory.RNA-seq and data analysisRNA samples were subjected to RNA-Seq as previously described26. RNA-Seq was performed with samples from two independent experiments. In brief, RNA quality was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (RIN Score 8 or higher). The Qubit fluorometer was used for determining RNA concentration. Strand-specific cDNA synthesis was performed after poly(A) RNA was purified and fragmented. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with paired end 150 bp reads. Raw sequence data was trimmed using Trimmomatic31. QC filtered trimmed sequences were aligned to hg19 using STAR32. All subsequent analysis was performed using R version 4.0.2 and Bioconductor 3.11 in RStudio33. Raw counts were obtained from BAM files using FeatureCounts from the Rsubread package34, and TPM was calculated from raw counts. The DESeq2 package was used for differential expression analysis between control and auxin treated cells, with Benjamini and Hochberg correction (FDR < 0.05)35. Transcripts whose levels were not significantly altered (1 < log2 fold change > −1) in the total cell lysate of GANP-depleted cells versus control cells were considered for further analysis to identify export inhibited and not affected mRNAs. TPM values of transcripts from nuclear fraction and cytoplasmic fraction were used to calculate N/C ratio for untreated and GANP depleted samples. Relative change in N/C ratio was calculated comparing N/C ratio of GANP depleted sample with untreated sample. Transcripts with relative change in N/C ratio >3.5 in two independent experiments were considered as export inhibited mRNAs and transcripts with relative change in N/C ratio between 1.5 and 0.66 in two independent experiments were considered as not affected mRNAs. Features of export inhibited and not affected transcripts were extracted based on Ensembl GTF annotations (GRCh38, release version 104) for each Ensembl Canonical transcript. These features represent information regarding the number, length, and GC content of the exons and introns of each transcript as well the entire transcript or various mRNA transcript regions (i.e., the 5’UTR, CDS, and 3’UTR). Boxplots were plotted to compare the distribution of these feature values between the export inhibited and not affected groups and significance was assessed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-rank test in Python.qRT-PCRSuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize cDNA using random hexamers (for cellular mRNAs) or oligo d(T) and 18 S reverse primer mix (for viral mRNAs). cDNA (1:3 diluted) was mixed with Roche 480 SYBR Green I Master, as per manufacturer’s instructions, and primers were added to the samples in qRT-PCR 96-well plates. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler 480. Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 4.BV-BRC database and NCBI database sequence alignmentThe uridines in the 45-nucleotide HA mRNA sequence were first replaced by thymidine. The sequence was then blasted in the BV-BRC database (https://www.bv-brc.org/) with alignment parameters specifying the search to be within a taxon of order Articulavirales with the database type set to “genes” and with the maximum hits parameter set to a 100. The NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM = blastn&PAGE_TYPE = BlastSearch&LINK_LOC = blasthome) was also used to blast the sequence using the default setting.RNA structural predictionsThe mRNA sequences were inputted in the RNAstructure webserver under “predict a secondary structure” using default parameters. The Connectivity Table (CT) file is then extracted and inputted into VARNA for optimum visualization quality.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

By Tim Schnettler, Texas A&M University School of Public Health April 19, 2023 Share ShareTweet0 Shares Air pollution, which is a worldwide environmental health issue, is responsible for one in nine deaths with an annual premature mortality of more than 7 million.Getty Images During pregnancy, women are more susceptible to severe respiratory infections from multiple viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, pregnant women are disproportionately affected by influenza, resulting in a more than 10-fold increase in hospitalization risk. A new study led by Dr. Natalie Johnson, associate professor in the Texas A&M University School of Public Health’s Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, shows that exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) during pregnancy enhances respiratory viral infection risk. The results of the study were published recently in Particle and Fibre Toxicology. “We know that air pollution affects the pulmonary immune system, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections,” Johnson said. “We also know pregnant women are already at increased risk for severe flu. Surprisingly, studies have not interrogated the combined effects of pregnancy, air pollution and influenza. Our findings demonstrate the need to further study these interactions in order to prevent short and perhaps long-term impacts on maternal health.” In the study, Johnson and her co-authors point out that there are several physiological characteristics that explain maternal susceptibility to viral infection. Among those are increased cardiac output and decreased tidal volume — the amount of air that moves in or out of the lungs with each respiratory cycle — as well as immunological changes such as selective modulation of immune cell subsets to protect the developing fetus. The research team also highlights that vaccination compliance during pregnancy is generally below 50 percent, despite vaccination against influenza being safe and effective, leading to increased risk for developing respiratory infection. As a result, air pollution, which is a worldwide environmental health issue, is responsible for one in nine deaths with an annual premature mortality of more than 7 million. A mixture of gases and tiny airborne particulate matter, which is categorized as UFPs, are critical to recognize and identify, especially to protect vulnerable populations. The research team says these findings support future clinical and regulatory interventions for protecting pregnant women and controlling UFPs. According to the researchers, it is imperative that pregnant women in urban cities, where influenza and UFPs are more prevalent, are provided vaccinations and preventive measures limiting UFP exposure to protect maternal health. “Air pollution is a pervasive environmental health issue,” Johnson said. “Strategies to protect the most vulnerable, like pregnant women, are of high priority to decrease adverse health effects.” Additional authors include Nicholas L.

And we now have the highest amount of poultry loss to avian influenza, so this is a worst-case scenario.”Some 58 million domestic poultry were infected or were killed to stop the spread of infection in the US, as well as 7 million in Canada, researchers found.The latest outbreak of avian flu may have also shifted to a year-round disease from a more seasonal disease in previous outbreaks.The 2015 avian flu outbreak generally happened in the fall, when farmers could prepare and have more time to recover from losses. But the latest outbreak is occurring throughout the year, in the summertime for wild birds and during the spring and fall for domestic poultry.Researchers concluded that the deadly impact of the disease on wild birds and the change from seasonal infections to ones occurring year-round could signal a dangerous change in the avian flu in the US.The team also concluded that the avian flu will probably become endemic, which could affect food security and the economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is commonly accepted that no adequate mucosal immunity is achieved by inactivated vaccines, which was widely used to prevent and control avian influenza virus infection. Thus, an improved vaccine to induce both mucosal immunity and systemic immunity is urgently required to control H9N2 avian influenza outbreaks in poultry farms.MethodsIn this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the HA1 proteins derived from an endemic H9N2 virus strain and chicken IgY Fc fragment. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc strain.ResultsOur data demonstrated that chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, mucosal secretory IgA, T cell-mediated immune responses, and lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, following challenge with H9N2 avian influenza virus, chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc strain showed reduced the weight loss, relieved clinical symptoms, and decreased the viral titers and the pathological damage in the lung. Moreover, oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding of the H9N2 influenza virus was detected in chicken immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc after infection, the results showed the titer was low and reduced quickly to reach undetectable levels at 7 days after infection.ConclusionOur data showed that the recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc strain could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity, and this study provides a theoretical basis for improving immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection. BackgroundAvian influenza virus (AIV) has brought great threat to the health of both poultry and human population worldwide. Avian influenza H9N2 virus (H9N2 AIV) pose a significant economic burden to the commercial poultry industry as they cause signs of mild respiratory illness and reduced egg production [1, 2]. It has been reported that some strains of H9N2 AIV can cause severe clinical symptoms and high mortality [3, 4]. At the same time, co-infection of H9N2 AIV with other pathogens can leads to more serious economic losses [3, 4]. Moreover, H9N2 AIV can directly infect humans and other mammal [5, 6]. The H9N2 AIV has played a significant role in the production of new influenza viruses, such as the H7N9, the H10N8, and H5N6, and these internal genes are mainly derived from the H9N2 AIV [7], which shows the control of influenza virus is very important.At present, vaccination with the inactivated vaccine is the major tool for the prevention and control of H9N2 AIV in the poultry industry. Although inactivated vaccines are used in the poultry industry to prevent and control influenza, influenza still occurs frequently. That is to say, the inactivated vaccines cannot provide the desired protective effect; the possible reasons could be low mucosal immunity and cellular immunity. H9N2 AIV mainly spreads through respiratory mucosa, so mucosal immunization plays a crucial role in controlling avian influenza infection. Therefore, increasing mucosal or cellular immunity might be pivotal to relieve the limitations of the inactivated vaccine immunization. Given that oral vaccine can induce mucosal immunity and systemic immunity, it is expected to be an effective way to prevent and control H9N2 avian influenza infection.L. lactis is a kind of food-grade lactic acid bacteria, which is considered as an ideal host bacteria for expression of recombinant antigens of pathogenic microorganisms. Actic acid bacteria occurring naturally in the intestines of humans and animals can suppress the reproduction of harmful bacteria, keep the balance of gastrointestinal flora, and improve gastrointestinal function [8]. In addition, Lactic acid bacteria can activates immune cells, improves mucosal immune mechanisms and immune responses [9,10,11]. It has been reported that Lactic acid bacteria is used as the potential vehicle for protein delivery and induce effective antiviral immune responses, such as rotavirus spike-protein subunit VP8, infectious bursal disease virus VP2 and VP3 [12, 13]. Moreover, L. lactis was widely used for mucosal delivery of therapeutic proteins [9, 14]. So the recombinant proteins expressed by L. lactis vehicle can induced mucosal and systemic immunity and well protect the challenge animals [15]. So as a safe oral live vaccine delivery carrier, L. lactis has a potential application considering its excellent immune effect.Mammalian IgG molecules can be divided into two Fab fragments, which combine highly variable antigens, and one Fc regions, which recruits and activates immune effector leukocytes. The Fc fragment can bind to its receptor FcR widely expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and mucosal epithelial cells, and the interactions of Fc with activating FcR can activate macrophages, mediate antigen capture, increases the efficiency of the antigen-presenting cells for antigen presentation and triggers effector functions for the immune response [16, 17]; it can also strongly influence the production of cytokine by stimulated macrophages [18]. The most striking feature of macrophage activation is an increase in phagocytic activity, which contributes the antigen presentation to T cells to triggering adaptive immune responses [19]. In avian species, although the Fc segments of IgY is different in structure structures, IgY is similar to mammalian IgG in terms of functionality [20, 21]. It has been reported that the linked IgY Fc mediated the interaction with macrophages and increases the efficiency of antigen-processing, thereby improving the immune response induced by the antigen [20].The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) of IgG is expressed on the surfaces of antigen presenting cells and mucosal epithelial cells in adulthood. FcRn can transport maternal IgG to the newborn before the immune system of the newborn matures, so that the newborn can acquire immune defense against pathogens to resist external diseases [22]. Numerous reports have confirmed that targeting protective antigens to FcRn can increased humoral and cellular immune responses [23,24,25]. In avian species, the Fc receptor with the requisite properties for IgY transport from yolk to embryo, named FcRY, were isolated and characterized from chicken yolk sac [26]. It was reported that besides the yolk sac membrane, FcRY expression was also observed in most tissues, incluing liver, ovary, oviduct, ileum, and spleen [26]. This may reflect the role of IgY is similar to FcRn’s function to IgG in mammals [27, 28]. So, in our study, we targeted protective antigens of H9N2 AIV to FcRY to explore whether the linked chicken IgY Fc fragment fusion could increase immune responses.Hemagglutinin is the main surface antigen of influenza A virus and the primary target for the production of specific neutralizing antibodies [29,30,31]. So HA antibody is particularly important in the fight against infection and disease and is a crucial target for vaccine development. HA is a homotrimer, each monomer is synthesized as a single polypeptide (HA0) that is split into two HA1 and HA2 subunits by matriptase in host cells [32, 33]. The N-terminal of HA1 forms a globular head structural domain; the HA1 domain contains many antigenic determinants that stimulate the production and binding of neutralizing antibodies. HA2 forms a stem structure; HA2 domain anchored to the viral envelope can fuses the virus envelope with the cell membrane and release the nucleocapsid of the virus particle [34]. In a word, the sequence of HA1 can stimulate neutralizing antibodies production; therefore, in this study the oral vaccine based on the region of HA1 is being considered.In this study, we used the L. lactis MG1363 to express a fusion protein containing the chicken IgY Fc and HA1 of H9N2 AIV. The immunogenicity of this recombinant L. lactis strain was then evaluated. The protective effect of this recombinant L. lactis strain against H9N2 AIV challenge following oral immunization was also evaluated aiming to explore a complementary method for the prevention and control of H9N2 subtype AIV.Materials and methodsBacteria, virus, and inactivated vaccinesThe H9N2 influenza A/pigeon/Hebei/02/2017 virus (H9N2 virus) strain was isolated (GenBank accession numbers Mk995886-Mk995893) from the intestinal tract of a pigeon in Hebei Province and stored in Hebei North University. L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e (L. lactis), L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e-HA1 (L. lactis HA1) was stored and prepared as a vaccine candidate from a L. lactis MG1363 system in Hebei North University. For inactivated H9N2 vaccine production, A/pigeon/Hebei/02/2017 virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. Allantoic fluid was harvested 72 h after inoculation and treated with formalin (final concentration of 0.2%) for 24 h at room temperature. Then the allantoic fluid was emulsified in Montanide ISA70 (SEPPIC) at a ratio of 30:70 (v/v).Construction of recombinant L. lactis To recombine HA1 of A/pigeon/Hebei/02/2017 virus fused to IgY Fc at the N-terminus, the recombinant plasmids pMG36e-HA1-Fc was constructed, and the HA1 gene and the IgY Fc gene were connected by a fifteen-amino acid linker (3XGGGGS). The IgY Fc fragment of chicken was obtained from GenBank (X07174.1). With HA1-Fc gene for the selected target gene, SalI and HindIII restriction enzyme cutting sites were added and were chemically synthesized by Gene Wiz, Inc. (Suzhou, China). Then the HA1-Fc gene was cloned into pMG36e vector by digestion with the SalI and HindIII restriction sites to create pMG36e-HA1-Fc. Subsequently, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into L. lactis MG1363 by electroporation, then the clones were sequenced in Gene Wiz, Inc. (Suzhou, China), and the confirmed positive recombinant L. lactis MG1363 was named L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e-HA1-Fc(L. lactis HA1-Fc).Western blotting analysisTo examine HA1-Fc expression, the recombinant L. lactis and L. lactis HA1-Fc were cultured in MRS medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml erythromycin. When an OD600 = 0.8 was reached, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in TBS buffer, and then were disrupted with sonication. The cell lysate was used to detect the presence of recombinant protein. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The presence of the fusion protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal to Avian Influenza A H9N2 Hemagglutinin antibody (Novus Biologicals) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (abcam). Visualization of the immunobinding was conducted by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Vaccination and challengeOne-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were randomly divided into five treatment groups of 25 chickens each, PBS group, L. lactis group, L. lactis HA1 group, L. lactis HA1-Fc group, H9N2 inactivated vaccine group. PBS group of chickens were orally immunized with PBS (0.2 mL/chicken). L. lactis group, L. lactis HA1 group, L. lactis HA1-Fc group of chickens were orally immunized with 109 cfu/mL of the L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e, L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e-HA1 and L. lactis MG1363-pMG36e-HA1-Fc(0.2 mL/chicken), respectively. H9N2 inactivated vaccine group of chickens received intramuscular injections of H9N2 inactivated vaccine (0.2 mL/chicken). Chickens in all groups except the inactivated vaccine group received a first vaccination at 1, 2, and 3 days and a booster vaccination at 14, 15 and 16 days. Chickens in the inactivated vaccine group were immunized on the first day. Then sera, BALF, spleen, intestinal samples, and feces were collected from immunized chickens on 10 days after the first and boosting vaccination for antibody assays, cytokine detection and lymphocyte proliferation assays. Then, all groups of chickens were intranasally challenged with 106.0 EID50 of A/pigeon/Hebei/02/2017 AIV in 0.1 ml of PBS on day 24, and clinical signs, the body weight, protection rates, viral shedding, pulmonary pathological changes and lung tissue virus titers of each group were analyzed. The challenge test with live H9N2 virus was done in the poultry isolators with Hepa Filter.HI assaySera were collected from all groups of chickens at 10 days after first and boosting vaccination. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) antibody titers of serum antibodies were determined following the previous study [35]. The highest serum dilution capable of preventing hemagglutination was scored as the HI-titer.Mucosal SIgA and serum IgG antibodies assaysSera, BALF and feces samples were collected from all groups of chickens at 10 days after first and boosting vaccination. The sIgA antibody levels were measured using the Chicken sIgA ELISA Kit (Lengton Bioscience Co., LTD, Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer’s protocol for BALF and feces samples. Serum-specific IgG antibody levels were detected by the indirect ELISA method, according to a previously reported method [36]. Briefly, 96 well plates were coated with 1 mg/ml of synthetic HA1-peptide (23 amino acids, 2–26, KICIGYQSTNSTETVDTLTENNVPV, synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, China) specificity H9N2 subtype AIV HA1 protein, in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After blocking, serum samples were loaded on peptide coated plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, plates were washed and incubated with goat anti-chicken IgG-HRP conjugates (SigmaAldrich, USA) for another 1 h at 37 °C. The color reaction was developed with TMB, and absorbances were read at OD 450 nm. The optical density represented total mucosal sIgA and serum IgG specific for HA1-Fc. For comparison between groups, the averages of A450 values of different sera were analyzed [37].Real-time PCR assays for detection of intestinal mucosal cytokinesIL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ in Intestinal samples were measured by real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from RNA with cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification assays were performed with a SYBR Premix Ex Taq II kit (TaKaRa) on an ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The target gene expression was normalized on the basis of β-Actin expression. The 2−ΔΔCT method was used to normalize the data. The experimental primers were listed in Table 1 [15, 38].Table 1 The primers used in this studyFull size tableProliferation assayTo detect splenic lymphocyte proliferation of vaccinated chickens, lymphocytes were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/ml, the cultures were stimulated for 48 h with 5 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma) as positive control, 5 μg/ml of synthetic HA1 peptide as specific antigen, or RPMI 1640 as negative control, and proliferation rate of the splenic lymphocyte was detected by Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Kit (Roche, Germany), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbances were read at 450 nm. Results were expressed as a stimulation index (SI), which was described as the ratio of the average OD of antigen-stimulated cells to the average OD of non-stimulated cells, and the stimulation index is used to express a proliferative response against synthetic HA1 peptide of splenic lymphocyte.Analysis of protective immune responsesChallenged chickens were monitored for clinical symptoms and mortality, and changes in body weights were recorded. To detect viral shedding, cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from challenged chickens on days 2, 4, and 7 post-challenges and suspended in 1 mL of PBS. These time points represent the peak for oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding [39, 40]. Moreover, five randomly-selected chickens from each group were sacrificed and lung tissues were collected, on days 7 post-challenges. The viral titers in the lungs were measured by EID50. Pulmonary pathological changes was visualized by hematoxylin and eosin staining.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performe International Immunopharmacology d with the SPSS statistical software package for Windows, version 18.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are presented as the means ± SD. Statistically significant differences among groups were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.ResultsIdentification of recombinant proteinsHA1-Fc gene was cloned into the expression vector pMG36e and verified by sequencing, and the recombinant plasmids pMG36e-HA1-Fc was transformed into L. lactis MG1363 by electroporation. The expressed protein bands corresponding to 74 kDa in the positive recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc were observed through western blotting. The result confirmed the expression of the recombinant HA1-Fc fusion proteins and the good reactogenicity to the Avian Influenza A Hemagglutinin antibody (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Western blot analyses of L. lactis HA1-Fc.

Then HI antibody levels were measured to determine whether the L. lactis HA1-Fc could stimulate the body to produce specific antibodies. The result showed that chickens orally vaccinated with L. lactis HA1-Fc had obviously higher HI antibody levels than the chickens that were orally immunized with L. lactis or PBS (P < 0.01). Moreover, HI antibody levels in chickens orally immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc increased significantly compared with chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1 (P < 0.01). Our data also showed that although vaccination with the inactivated vaccine induced high HI antibody, no significant differences in HI antibody were detected in chickens immunized with inactivated vaccine and L. lactis HA1-Fc (Fig. 2A). This result proved that recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc can stimulate the body to produce specific antibodies and Fc fragment plays an important role in the production of specific antibodies (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2HI Antibody levels and the specific IgG levels induced by L. lactis HA1-Fc. A Antibody titers determined by HI assay after the chickens were vaccinated with PBS, L. lactis, L. lactis HA1, L. lactis HA1-Fc and inactivated H9N2 vaccine.

The data were showed as means ± SD (n = 5). **P < 0.01 relative to PBS and L. lactis. ##P < 0.01 relative to L. lactis HA1Full size imageThe specific IgG Levels enhanced by L. lactis HA1-FcTo investigate the specific IgG levels in chickens after oral vaccination with L. lactis HA1-Fc, the serum samples from various groups of chickens were detected by indirect ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2B, compared with the L. lactis group and PBS group, the L. lactis HA1-Fc group had a much higher specific IgG levels after oral immunization (P < 0.001). Notably, the specific IgG titers in the serum from chickens orally vaccinated with L. lactis HA1-Fc was increased obviously compared with the L. lactis HA1 group (P < 0.01). As with HI antibody levels, there was no obvious difference in specific IgG titers between the L. lactis HA1-Fc group and the inactivated vaccine group (P < 0.01). Therefore, our data can infer that L. lactis HA1-Fc is capable of stimulating a strong humoral immune response in chickens.SIgA antibodies in the feces and BALF following vaccinationTo evaluate whether recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc can induce body mucosal immunity, sIgA antibodies of all groups of chicken was measured after each immunization (Fig. 3). The results showed that intestinal sIgA levels in the L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccinated group were higher obviously than those of the PBS vaccinated group and L. lactis vaccinated group (P < 0.01), and chicken immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc showed higher titer of sIgA antibodies compared with chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1 (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, sIgA levels in the L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccinated group were also significantly higher compared with the inactivated vaccine group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). SIgA levels in BALF showed a similar trend to intestinal sIgA levels (Fig. 3B). SIgA levels in the L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccinated group were significantly higher than those in the PBS vaccinated and L. lactis vaccinated groups (P < 0.01), and chicken immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc showed higher titer of sIgA antibodies compared with chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1 and inactivated vaccine (P < 0.01). Moreover, there was statistically significant difference in the induced sIgA antibodies in the feces and BALF samples between L. lactis and PBS immunized groups of chicken after immunization. Therefore, Lactococcus lactis can improves mucosal immune mechanisms and is a good vehicle for protein delivery. L. lactis HA1-Fc could induce enhanced mucosal response.Fig. 3Mucosal antibody levels induced by L. lactis HA1-Fc. SIgA antibodies in the feces (A) and BALF (B) were assessed by ELISA after the chickens were vaccinated with PBS, L. lactis, L. lactis HA1, L. lactis HA1-Fc and inactivated H9N2 vaccine. The data were showed as means ± SD (n = 5). ▲▲P < 0.01 relative to PBS. **P < 0.01 relative to PBS and L. lactis. ##P < 0.01 relative to L. lactis HA1. $$P < 0.01 relative to L. lactis HA1-FcFull size imageIntestinal mucosal cytokines induced by L. lactis HA1-FcCytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and are involved in immune responses, IL-2 and INF-γ primarily stimulate cell-mediated immune response, and IL-4 primarily stimulate antibody production and mediates humoral immune responses [21]. Therefore, in this study intestinal tissues were collected from all chickens and mucosal cytokines levels were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4, levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-4 (as a marker of Th1 and Th2, respectively) in the L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccinated group were significantly higher than those in the L. lactis vaccinated group and PBS vaccinated group, and the L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccinated group showed significantly increased levels of all three cytokines compared with the L. lactis HA1 vaccinated groups (P < 0.01). There were higher levels of cytokines of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ in the inactivated vaccine groups, but chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc showed higher levels of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ than those immunized with inactivated vaccine (P < 0.05). Moreover, there was statistically significant difference in the induced mucosal cytokines levels between L. lactis and PBS immunized groups of chicken after immunization (Fig. 4). Therefore, the results indicated L. lactis HA1-Fc fragment significantly promoted the secretion of cytokines in chickens. Lactococcus lactis can activate immune cells and improves immune responses [9,10,11]. The levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ in chicken immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc were greater than IL-4 levels, which showed the greater Th1-type than Th2-type immune response in chicken.Fig. 4IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ levels in intestinal tissues induced by L. lactis HA1-Fc. Chickens were vaccinated with PBS, L. lactis, L. lactis HA1, L. lactis HA1-Fc and inactivated H9N2 vaccine, respectively, then intestinal tissues were collected. IL-2 (A), IFN-γ (B), and IL-4 (C) were detected via real-time PCR. The data were showed as means ± SD (n = 5).

Stimulation index in L. lactis HA1-Fc group was significantly higher than those in groups L. lactis and PBS group. Notably, the group L. lactis HA1-Fc showed significantly higher stimulation index than group L. lactis HA1 after the first immunization and boost immunization (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were higher stimulation index in the inactivated vaccine groups, but chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc showed higher stimulation index than chicken immunized with inactivated vaccine (P < 0.05). These results suggested that L. lactis HA1-Fc significantly promoted immune responses in chicken.Fig. 5T cells proliferation assay. T cells proliferation was examined by Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Kit, and results were expressed as a stimulation index (SI) of chickens vaccinated with PBS, L. lactis, L. lactis HA1, L. lactis HA1-Fc and inactivated H9N2 vaccine.

From day 3 after viral challenges, all the challenged, PBS and L. lactis vaccinated chicken exhibited apparent clinical signs including: depression, poor appetite, ruffled feathers, respiratory sounds, and eye redness from 2 to 8 days post-challenge. About half of chickens in group L. lactis HA1 showed clinical signs, and three-quarters of chickens in group L. lactis HA1-Fc showed no clinical symptoms. Moreover, the clinical signs were delayed for 1–2 days in the chicken vaccinated with the L. lactis HA1-Fc and L. lactis HA1, in which the chicken showed mild clinical signs for 2–3 days, and the clinical signs in the chicken vaccinated with the L. lactis HA1-Fc were milder than those vaccinated with the L. lactis HA1. There was no significant difference in clinical signs between chicken immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc or inactivated vaccine. By day 5 post-challenge, the chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc showed some recovery. On day 7 post-challenge, chickens were behaving normally and their activity and appetite returned to normal levels.The body weights of the L. lactis group and PBS group exhibited downward trends after H9N2 virus infection, and both were obviously lower than the other three groups (P < 0.01) (Fig. 6). The chicken in L. lactis HA1-Fc group showed less weight loss than that observed for the chicken in L. lactis HA1 group, but the weight changes between these two groups were not statistically significant. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the L. lactis HA1-Fc group and the inactivated vaccines group (P > 0.05).Fig. 6Weight change of the vaccinated chickens after challenge with H9N2 avian influenza virus. Chickens were immunized with PBS, L. lactis, L. lactis HA1, L. lactis HA1-Fc and inactivated H9N2 vaccine. 10 days after the boost immunization, the immunized chickens were challenged with H9N2 influenza virus. The weight loss was recorded daily for 2 weeksFull size imageNone of the chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1-Fc or inactivated vaccines died after infection with H9N2 avian influenza virus, whereas five of the 25 chickens immunized with PBS and L. lactis and two of the 25 chickens immunized with L. lactis HA1 died from the disease.To investigate virus shedding, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected from all chickens on days 2, 4 and 7 after infection with H9N2 avian influenza virus, and virus titration was measured in MDCK cells. The result showed that all chicken in PBS, L. lactis and L. lactis HA1 groups showed respiratory viral replication, and several chicken in L. lactis HA1-Fc groups did not showed respiratory viral replication at days 2, and 4 post-challenges. The chicken vaccinated with L. lactis HA1-Fc had overall significantly lower oropharyngeal and cloacal viral shedding than did the challenged PBS, L. lactis or L. lactis HA1 immunized chickens (P < 0.01). At day 7 post-challenge, no viruses were isolated from oropharyngeal swabs of the chicken vaccinated with L. lactis HA1-Fc and inactive vaccine; whereas, viruses were isolated from oropharyngeal swabs of the other infected chickes. As far as the periods of viral shedding was concerned, the chicken vaccinated with L. lactis HA1-Fc had lower periods of virus replication (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Viral shedding from cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. Immunized chickens were infected with H9N2 avian influenza virus, cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from challenged chickens on days 2, 4, and 7 post-challenges. Viral titers were detected from oropharyngeal swabs collected from challenged chickens on days 2 (A), 4 (B), and 7 (C) post-challenges. Viral titers were detected from cloacal swabs collected from challenged chickens on days 2 (D), 4 (E), and 7 (F) post-challengesFull size imageHistopathologic evaluationTo further evaluate the protective effect of the L. lactis HA1-Fc, pathological changes in chicken from each group were assessed. As illustrated in Fig. 8A–E, chicken in PBS group and L. lactis group showed significantly pathological changes, including increased blood, and lymphatic cells; hyperemia; the lung chamber collapsed, and the pulmonary epithelial cells detached.Fig. 8Protective effect of L. lactis HA1-Fc on lung injury induced by H9N2 influenza virus infection. Seven days after challenge with H9N2 avian influenza virus, lung tissue of PBS group (A), L. lactis group (B), L. lactis HA1 group (C), L. lactis HA1-Fc group (D) and H9N2 inactivated vaccine (E) was evaluated by histopathological analysis. The sections were stained with H&E. Objective magnification, × 200 (A–E). (F) The virus titers of lung samples from vaccinated chickens were obtained at 7 days after challenge and infectivity was measured by EID50. The data were showed as means ± SD (n = 5). **P < 0.01 relative to PBS and L. lactis. ##P < 0.01 relative to L. lactis HA1Full size imageBy contrast, there were only minor pathological changes in the L. lactis HA1-Fc group and the inactivated vaccine group. Moreover, the pathological changes in L. lactis HA1-Fc group were significantly lighter than those in L. lactis HA1 group. The results confirmed that oral-administration L. lactis HA1-Fc could provide protection against the H9N2 AIV virus via reducing pulmonary pathology.Lung tissue virus titers assaysTo evaluate the protective effect of recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc strain on the H9N2 subtype AIV, lung tissue virus titers of each group were detected. The results showed that the lung virus titer in L. lactis HA1-Fc group was obviously lower than those in the PBS and L. lactis group (Fig. 8F). Moreover, compared with the L. lactis HA groups, the lung virus titer in L. lactis HA1-Fc group was also significantly reduced (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in viral titer between L. lactis HA1-Fc group and inactivated vaccines group.DiscussionAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) have brought great threat to the poultry industry. At present, vaccination with inactivated vaccines for all poultry was the most common strategy for prevention and control of avian influenza. However, the immunogenicity of current AIV inactivated vaccines that mainly induce humoral immunity was limited. H9N2 influenza virus is mainly transmitted through the respiratory mucosal pathway, so mucosal immunity is considered to play a good role in controlling avian influenza infection. In this study, we fused IgY Fc and HA protective antigen genes of H9N2 AIV, thus constructing the recombinant L. lactis strain of HA1-Fc. The evaluation of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy showed that the recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc strain induced substantial mucosal immunity and systemic immunity and had a good protective effect against H9N2 AIV challenge.For a vaccine to be effective, the vaccine strain must have genetic and antigenic characteristics similar to those of the currently circulating field viruses. Therefore, it is pivotal to select the vaccine strain to prevent the spread of the virus. Since the mid-1990s, two different lineages of H9N2 AIV, called chicken A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94 and quail A/HongKong/G1/98, have been circulating in land poultry in Asia. The HA gene of A/pigeon/Hebei/02/2017 influenza virus was similar to the Ck/BJ/94-like lineage [41]. So we exploited a recombinant anti-H9N2 AIV vaccine based on this virus.HA antibody is particularly important in the fight against infection and disease and is a crucial target for vaccine development [29]. It is reported that vaccines derived from HA gene as a protective antigen can induce subtype specific immunity and show efficacy against challenge with homologous virus [30, 42,43,44]. The HA1 domain contains many antigenic determinants that stimulate the production and binding of neutralizing antibodies [45]. Therefore, oral vaccine of recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc was developed using HA1 as the target protein in this study, and our data showed that it could induce plentiful production of specific antibody. Although vaccination with the inactivated vaccine induced high HI antibody, no significant differences in HI antibody were detected in chickens immunized with inactivated vaccine and L. lactis HA1-Fc.The linked IgY Fc mediated the interaction with macrophages and improved the expression of MHC-II molecules on macrophages. The upregulation of MHC-II promoted APC to present antigenic peptides to CD4+ T cells, which drive the activation of naïve T cells and obtain the help or regulation from CD4+ effector cells or regulatory T cells. So IgY Fc regions stimulates the activation of macrophages and increases the efficiency of antigen-processing, thereby improving the immune response induced by the antigen [20]. Therefore, the recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc was constructed by connecting Fc to the target gene HA1 in this experiment, and the results showed that the oral vaccine of recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc stimulated immune response, as evidenced by improved specific antibody and sIgA antibodies levels, increased lymphocyte proliferation, and increased IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ levels.AIV utilize the host respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces to initiate infections, therefore the ideal vaccine should stimulate mucosal and systemic immune reactions to restrict virus infection. So delivery of vaccine antigens through the mucosal surface would be an ideal approach to attain mucosal and possibly systemic immunity. However, mucosal epithelium is a natural barrier to a vaccine antigen transmission. On this basis, different approaches have been explored to solve this problem. FcRn can transport maternal IgG to the newborn via the placental path or intestinal [22], numerous reports have confirmed that targeting protective antigens to FcRn can increased humoral and cellular immune responses [23,24,25]. FcRY, the Fc receptor of avian IgY, was isolated from chicken yolk sac in 2004, and has been reported to expressed in many other tissues including intestinal tract [26]. Therefore, it is believed that FcRY has a similar transport function to mammalian FcRn, which can transport IgY in poultry intestinal tract [27, 28]. So we constructed a novel L. lactis HA1-Fc strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the HA1 proteins and chicken IgY Fc fragment. Our results showed that the oral vaccine of recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc showed increased mucosal immunity, as evidenced by improved sIgA levels in BALF and intestinal samples. The sIgA immunoglobulin is a critical component of the mucosal immune system. It can form a protective barrier by attaching to epithelial cells and it also can attach to newly synthesized viral proteins in infected cells, interfering with the assembly of virus particles. Notably, the sIgA level induced by recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc was significantly higher than that induced by inactivated vaccine, so the recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc oral vaccine induced higher mucosal immunity. Moreover, the probiotic effect of L. lactis promoted cellular response, and we also detected an up-regulation of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ cytokines which promoted the activation and proliferation of the intestinal mucosal lymphoid B cells and induced the secretion of specific sIgA. They participated in the transmission of information and played an important role in the biological processes of the organisms. Our results show that immunization with L. lactis HA1-Fc can produce higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ.After virus challenge, our results showed that recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc significantly inhibited weight loss, histopathological damage and inflammatory response in chickens, decreased virus titer in the lung, which was consistent with the immune protection of inactivated vaccine. So the recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc can produced immune protection in chickens. Moreover, virus shedding was detected in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs in the recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc immunized chickenes at 2 days after challenge, and the titer was low and reduced rapidly to reach undetectable levels at 7 days after challenge. These results showed that the oral recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccine in this study could significantly inhibit the virus shedding. At present, inactivated H9N2 vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in protecting against clinical disease, but variable results have also been observed in reducing the mortality and the level of viral shedding in chickens. It was reported that H9N2 AIV causes no death in chicken after intranasal challenge in control group [46] and no virus shedding in inactivated vaccine vaccination group [47]. However, other studies have shown that H9N2 AIV can cause death in chicken after intranasal challenge [48,49,50], and intranasal challenge of H9N2 virus resulted in different degrees of virus shedding in the inactivated vaccine group [46, 50,51,52], which was consistent with our results. Our previous studies demonstrated that intravenous rather than intranasal challenge of the H9N2 virus resulted in an extremely low degree of virus shedding, however, in order to mimic the natural route of infection, intranasal challenge of the H9N2 virus was chosen in this study. Indeed, our previous results are in line with findings that has been reported, whereby intravenous challenge of the H9N2 virus resulted in an extremely low degree of virus shedding [49].ConclusionThis study demonstrates that oral recombinant L. lactis HA1-Fc vaccine obtained good immune effect and can be used as a candidate vaccine for avian influenza prevention and control to compensate for the functional deficiency of inactivated vaccine.

Oudkerk6 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 13, Article number: 6589 (2023) Cite this article 1156 Accesses Metrics details Subjects Cancer screeningLung cancer AbstractWe evaluated the impact of the influenza season on outcome of new lung nodules in a LDCT lung cancer screening trial population. NELSON-trial participants with ≥ 1 new nodule detected in screening rounds two and three were included. Outcome (resolution or persistence) of new nodules detected per season was calculated and compared. Winter (influenza season) was defined as 1st October to 31st March, and compared to the summer (hay-fever season), 1st April to 30th September. Overall, 820 new nodules were reported in 529 participants. Of the total new nodules, 482 (59%) were reported during winter. When considering the outcome of all new nodules, there was no statistically significant association between summer and resolving nodules (OR 1.07 [CI 1.00–1.15], p = 0.066), also when looking at the largest nodule per participant (OR 1.37 [CI 0.95–1.98], p = 0.094). Similarly, there was no statistically significant association between season and screen detected cancers (OR 0.47 [CI 0.18–1.23], p = 0.123). To conclude, in this lung cancer screening population, there was no statistically significant association between influenza season and outcome of new lung nodules. Hence, we recommend new nodule management strategy is not influenced by the season in which the nodule is detected.

In 2020, it accounted for 1.8 million deaths worldwide1,2,3. Therefore, in the United States it is highly recommended high-risk individuals undergo low-dose CT screening for lung cancer4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, many European countries are still debating whether to recommend low-dose CT screening to high-risk individuals, despite the recent publication of the positive results from the largest European lung cancer screening trial12,13. Only a small number of countries, such as the United Kingdom and Poland, have introduced lung cancer screening programs. In 2003, the aforementioned Dutch-Belgium Randomised Lung Cancer Screening trial (NELSON) was launched14. The final results have shown that low-dose CT lung cancer screening can reduce lung cancer mortality by 24% in males and 33% in females, in high risk ex-smokers aged 50 to 75 years old13,15.A drawback in lung cancer screening is the high rate of false-positive screen results caused by the large number of (mostly benign) lung nodules detected. This high false-positive rate has already been reduced through the use of volumetric measurement and volume doubling time (VDT) follow-up, however for the optimisation of lung cancer screening, false-positive results should be as low as feasibly possible16. A sub-study of the NELSON trial has shown solid new nodules have a significantly higher risk of malignancy compared to baseline nodules, and are detected at each screening in around 5–7% of subjects17. Therefore, more attention is now being paid to the new nodules detected17,18. We know that a large part of the benign new nodules disappear at follow-up CT imaging, however factors predicting resolution have –until now– not been identified.In a previous study of the general Dutch population, a seasonal variation was found in the presence and characteristics of LDCT-detected lung nodules19. Significantly more baseline lung nodules were detected in the summer months (April to September) when hay fever is most prevalent (56% in summer versus 44% in winter; OR 1.255, p = 0.002), and a seasonal variation was seen in lung nodule characteristics. More spherical nodules were detected in summer whereas more polygonal and irregular nodules were detected in winter. In the winter, more nodules were located in the left upper lobe, and there were significantly more atypical perifissural nodules detected19. This study however only included baseline nodules and no nodule follow-up or pathological outcome data was available, and it was not a lung cancer screening trial.Research has shown there are a greater number of hospitalisations during winter for respiratory diseases than any other season20. In the Netherlands and Belgium there is an influenza outbreak in winter almost every year for approximately 14 weeks. Cases have been reported from October onwards, with the peak incidence being between December and March21,22. Since it is expected that most of the resolving new nodules are infectious, it can be hypothesized that more new nodules will be found during the winter influenza season, with a higher rate of these nodules resolving. The Netherlands and Belgium have an almost identical climate across all provinces due to the relatively small size of the countries. Therefore, this study is unique in that the climate for each season is the same for all provinces.Our study therefore aims to evaluate the impact of the season of the year when respiratory illnesses are most prevalent, winter (influenza season), on outcome of new lung nodules in NELSON-trial participants.MethodsStudy and participantsThe NELSON trial study design and participant recruitment has been documented numerous times before14,17,18. In short, the NELSON trial began in December 2003 and 15 822 participants from the Netherlands and Belgium were registered up until July 2006. The participants were each assigned to receive low-dose screening (n = 7915) or no screening (n = 7907) at random. The eligibility and exclusion criteria have been published previously14.Baseline screening (year one) was carried out between April 2004 and December 2006. Follow-up screening was carried out in years two (second round), four (third round) and six (fourth round), after a 1-year, 2-year and 2.5-year interval respectively. For this study, we identified all participants who developed a new resolving or persisting solid or subsolid lung nodule during screening rounds two and three, registered by NELSON radiologists as new or smaller than 15mm3 (study detection limit) at previous screening rounds. For this, we used the NELSON management system in which information of all NELSON scans was stored. The NELSON trial was approved by Ethics Committees of all participating centres in the Netherlands and Belgium (University Medical Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Kennemer Gasthuis Haarlem, and University Hospital Leuven) and authorised by the Dutch Health Care Committee. All participants gave written informed consent. The study was performed in accordance with relevant guidelinesegulations and with the Declaration of Helsinki17.NELSON screening CT scan protocol, analysis and data managementThe CT scan protocol of the NELSON trial has been previously published14,17,18. All screening sites had a 16-multidetector or 64–multidetector (later screening rounds) (3 Sensation-16, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany; and 1 Mx8000 IDT or Brilliance 16P, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) and CT scanner and conditions were standardised. Reconstructions were made with 1.0 mm slice width and 0.7 mm interval. CT scans were read by two or more independent radiologists with one to 20 years’ experience in the first two screening rounds, and following rounds were read by a single radiologist with a minimum of six years’ experience. CT scan analysis for semi-automated volume measurement was performed on Siemens Leonardo workstations using the Syngo Lungcare software package (version Somaris/5 VA70C-W, Siemens Medical Solutions)14. For subsequent CT scans, nodules were individually matched on previous scans depending on consistency, size, and location (the software’s matching algorithm). If the nodule was not present previously, or was smaller than the detection limit (< 15mm3) at previous scan, it was classified as a new nodule17.This study used information at first nodule detection as reported in the NELSON management system. In this study, we excluded all nodules from screening round four, as this round was a sub-group of the participants who were predominantly current smokers. Additionally, we excluded lung nodules which were either: deemed “too small” (< 15mm3) in retrospect, from participants with a non-matched lung cancer or a metastasis (renal and prostrate), and those nodules leading to an immediate referral or no additional screen, or missing participant characteristics. A total of 820 new (sub) solid nodules were analysed, an overview can be seen in Fig. 1.Figure 1Overview of new resolving and persisting (sub)solid lung nodules included in this sub-study of the NELSON trial. *a nodule had no follow up scan when a participant was referred immediately to a pulmonologist for further diagnostics, or the participant did not require an additional CT scan according to protocol.Full size imageNodule managementThe NELSON nodule management protocol has been explained in detail previously14,17,18. In short, all solid nodules detected were categorised in one of four ways (NODCAT I, II, III, IV) based on their size and characteristics. NODCAT I was considered negative, NODCAT II and III were considered intermediate, and NODCAT IV was considered positive. Following initial detection of a nodule, subsequent evaluations were based on both the volume doubling time and the growth of the nodule.New nodule outcomeFor a nodule to be classified as resolving, it should not have been registered on the NELSON management system on the follow-up LDCT. This could be because the radiologist considered the nodule to have disappeared, to be non-measurable, or they registered the nodule as calcified. Resolution of a nodule was considered spontaneous during this trial as no intervening therapy was issued. Further, lung nodules were matched retrospectively to pathologically confirmed screen detected lung cancers.Seasonal influenceFor this study, we had a specific interest in the winter (influenza season) in comparison to the summer (hay fever season). The Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) suggests that the yearly influenza epidemic is usually between December and March, with cases recorded as early as October22. There is a yearly peak in pollen levels, and subsequently an increased prevalence of hay fever cases, between April and September23. Therefore, we decided to compare two seasons; winter (influenza season) defined as 1st October to 31st March, and summer (hay fever) defined as 1st April to 30th September.Participant and nodule level analysisThe total number new nodules and number of participants with ≥ 1 new nodule was calculated for rounds two and three combined. To analyse the data on nodule level we looked at the total new nodules detected per month and per season. To analyse the data on participant level, we looked at the largest nodule per participant and excluded any multiple nodules in the same participant. The number of resolving and persisting nodules, and nodules matched to screen detected cancers was calculated.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics were used to report absolute frequencies and percentages. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate a possible seasonal influence on resolution of new lung nodules, and screen detected cancers at participant level. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate a possible seasonal influence on resolution of new lung nodules at nodule level. Variables included in the aforementioned analyses included; season (summer and winter), age, gender (male and female), smoking status (former and current). Separate analyses were performed which also included the following nodule characteristics; nodule volume and nodule location (upper and lower lobe), see supplement. In case of missing nodule size or location, those nodules were excluded in the regression analyses.ResultsParticipant characteristicsThere were 1563 new (sub)solid nodules detected in screening rounds two, three and four, as previously reported24,25. In our dataset there were 820 new resolving or persisting nodules detected in 529 participants who underwent a LDCT thorax scan in screening rounds two and three of the NESLON trial. An overview of participant characteristics, including distribution based on nodule outcome (resolved versus persisted), can be seen in Table 1. Median participant age was 59 years (inter-quartile-range [IQR] 55–63), 411 (78%) were male, 330 (62%) were current smokers, and the median pack-years was 39 (IQR 30–50). 316 (60%) of individuals (with ≥ 1 resolving or persisting new nodule) were scanned in the winter, and 213 (40%) in the summer.Table 1 Characteristics of participants with ≥ 1 resolving or persisting new nodule reported during screening rounds two and three of the NELSON trial, including distribution based on nodule outcome (resolving versus persisting).Full size tableNew lung nodule outcomesMonthly and seasonal distribution of total new nodules, participants with > 1 new nodule and new nodule outcome for both resolving and persisting nodules detected during screening rounds two and three can be found in Table 2. Of the total 820 new resolving and persisting lung nodules, 482 (59%) were reported in winter. When looking at new nodule outcome, 226 (67%) of the new nodules reported in the summer (n = 338) resolved. In winter, 304 (63%) of the new nodules reported were resolving. Similar percentages were seen when looking at the largest nodule per participant. In summer, 139 (65%) resolving nodules were reported in the 213 participants with ≥ 1 new nodule, compared to 188 (60%) resolving nodules reported in 316 participants in winter. In a further nuanced analysis of new solid (780 [95%]) verses new subsolid (40 [5%]) nodules, 457 (59%) of the new solid nodules and 25 (63%) of the new subsolid nodules were detected in winter. The percentage of new resolving solid nodules was equal to the percentage of new resolving subsolid nodules (504 [65%] solid versus 26 [65%] subsolid), and 289 (57%) new resolving solid nodules versus 15 (58%) new resolving subsolid nodules were detected in the winter. Again, similar results were seen when looking at the largest nodule per participant. Number of screen detected cancers on the other hand followed a different trend. A total of 23 screen detected cancers were present in this study population. Of the 213 participants with ≥ 1 new nodule in the summer, 6 (2.8%) had a nodule that was retrospectively matched to a screen detected lung cancer. This was comparatively less than in the winter; 17 (5.4%) of the 316 participants.Table 2 Monthly and seasonal distribution of total new nodules, participants with ≥ 1 new nodule and new nodule outcome for both resolving and persisting nodules, and screen detected lung cancers reported during screening rounds two and three of the NELSON trial.Full size tableWhen performing logistic regression analyses, summer season does not significantly predict new nodule resolution. This remained true at both nodule and participant level analysis (OR 1.07 [CI 1.00–1.15], p = 0.066 and OR 1.37 [CI 0.95–1.98], p = 0.094, respectively). Additionally, we observed no significant association between season of year and screen detected cancers (OR 0.47 [CI 0.18–1.23], p = 0.123). A more detailed outline of the results can be seen in Table 3.Table 3 Logistic regression analyses of nodule outcome (resolved versus persisted) and screen detected lung cancers during screening rounds two and three of the NELSON trial.Full size tableOne variable which was significantly associated with the resolution of new nodules was gender. Female gender was associated with resolution of a new lung nodule at both nodule level analysis (OR 1.16 [CI 1.06–1.26], p = 0.001), and participant level analysis (OR 1.85 [CI 1.18–2.92], p = 0.008). When nodule location was added to the multilevel regression analysis, a nodule located in the upper lobe was negatively associated with its resolution (OR 0.90 [CI 0.84–0.96], p = 0.002). This remained true for the participant level binary regression analysis (OR 0.57 [CI 0.39–0.85], p = 0.005), when looking at the largest nodule per participant. Nodule location and screen-detected lung cancer outcome followed a different trend. Albeit non-significant, we observed nodules located in the upper lobe were positively associated with screen detected lung cancer (OR 2.41 [CI 0.86–6.73], p = 0.095), see supplementary results for an overview of regression analyses including nodule characteristics.DiscussionIn this NELSON lung cancer screening trial sub-study, we aimed to investigate whether the season of year when most respiratory illnesses are prevalent, winter (influenza season), had an impact on outcome of new lung nodules detected. We can report, no statistically significant association was found when looking at all new nodules and the largest new nodule per participant in a lung cancer screening population (OR 1.07 [CI 1.00–1.15], p = 0.066 and OR 1.37 [CI 0.95–1.98], p = 0.094 respectively). Additionally, we saw no statistically significant association between screen-detected lung cancer and the season of year (OR 0.47 [CI 0.18–1.23], p = 0.123).Our findings are not in agreement with what we had hypothesized; that more of the new lung nodules detected during the winter (influenza season) would be resolving due to the increased incidence of respiratory illnesses. Our results would therefore suggest that new nodules detected during the winter (influenza season) require the same careful attention as those detected in summer, as it cannot be concluded that they are simply infectious nodules. Furthermore, as we see a considerable number of resolving nodules during the summer (April to September), we can speculate that hay fever (allergic rhinitis) suffers could present with more new resolving nodules during the hay fever season when taking part in a lung cancer screening trial. Existing research on associations between allergic rhinitis, smoking and lung cancer is limited and often conflicting26,27,28. There have however, been previous links suggesting an association between chronic rhinosinusitis and lung cancer29,30. As the upper and lower airway have a similar pathophysiology, it could be speculated that an inflammatory response in the upper airway could trigger an up regulation of the immune response in the lower airway, resulting in the development of lung nodules31. As far as we know, no research has looked at a possible connection between participants with allergic rhinitis and the development of new lung nodules and therefore this could be a potential for future research. Additionally, it might be interesting to investigate if more women with allergic rhinitis develop new lung nodules that go on to resolve. We reported female gender was positively associated with the resolution of a new lung nodule when looking at the largest nodule per participant (OR 1.85 [CI 1.18–2.92], p = 0.008), however no existing research could be found to explain this outcome.These findings also support, in part, those reported in the ImaLife study representing the general Dutch population, where presence of lung nodules was increased during the hay fever season on baseline LDCT thorax scans19.The trend we observed between new lung nodule location and screen detected cancers (11 [48%] of the screen detected lung cancers were located in the right upper lung) is supported by existing literature. Horeweg et al. reported 45% of all lung cancers detected in the NELSON trial were located in the right upper lobe32. A similar result was seen when a univariate analysis was performed for solid new lung nodules in the NELSON trial: new lung nodules located in the right upper lung were significantly more likely to have lung cancer as an outcome than those in a different location (OR 1.9 [95%CI 1.2–3.1], p = 0.011)33. This is a result of unequal distribution of airflow in favour of the right upper lobe during the beginning of inspiration, and henceforth an increased accumulation of tobacco smoke particles34. What remains unexplained is the negative association between resolving new nodules and the upper lung lobe. This should be investigated further in future research.Unsurprisingly, the majority of participants in this study were male and current smokers. This can be explained by the inclusion criteria used in the NELSON trial. Mean age (59 years) however cannot be explained in the same way. Participants in the NELSON trial were aged between 50 and 75 years, hence a higher mean age would also be expected in this study. It can be hypothesized that the younger age of participants with new nodules, the majority of which resolving, is due to an increased immune response to antigens. Research has shown that increasing age is accompanied by immune system remodelling. Changes usually begin in the sixth decade and progress over time to a state of immunosenescence. Therefore, younger participants may be more likely to have a stronger response to antigens leading to the development of inflammatory lung nodules35,36.This study was unique because of the small size of the countries where the study took place. The Netherlands and Belgium have a similar climate throughout the provinces. A study by Hatch found that the mean minimum and maximum monthly temperatures differed by < 0.5 °C nationally37. For this reason the climate will be the same for all participants for each month and therefore each season. Additionally, this study added to previously reported seasonal variation research, by also reporting on nodule outcomes. However, a possible limitation to this study is that the exact timing that new nodules appeared is unknown. The date of detection of new nodules may not be the exact date at which the nodule developed. Therefore, a new nodule detected in April; the start of the hay fever season, could have already been present in one of the winter months (influenza season) and vice versa. Furthermore, the sample size of our sub-study could be the reason for the lack of significant findings. By increasing the sample size, and in turn the power of the study, we may have seen a statistically significant association between season and new nodule outcome.Future research could investigate whether there is a seasonal influence on the outcome of new lung nodules in the general population, but also more specifically in persons who are diagnosed with allergic rhinitis or other inflammatory respiratory conditions.To conclude, we report that no statistically significant association was found between the winter (influenza) season and the outcome of new lung nodules in this lung cancer screening population. Therefore, underlying pathophysiology of resolving nodules remains uncertain. Hence, we recommend that all new nodules should be treated with the same careful attention irrespective of the season in which they are detected.

Download PDF Copy By Bhavana KunkalikarReviewed by Lily Ramsey, LLMApr 19 2023 In a recent study published in the Particle and Fibre Toxicology Journal, researchers explored the impact of exposure to ultrafine particles during pregnancy on the risk of influenza infection. Study: Maternal exposure to ultrafine particles enhances influenza infection during pregnancy. Image Credit: KaterynaKon/Shutterstock.com Background Identifying interactions between infectious agents and air pollution is crucial, particularly for safeguarding vulnerable populations. The susceptibility of pregnant women to influenza and air pollution exposure is a matter of concern, but the relationship between the two is not fully understood. Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) in mothers can cause distinct immune responses in the lungs. About the study In the present study, researchers hypothesized that exposure to UFP during pregnancy could result in abnormal immune responses to influenza, which could increase the severity of the infection. In the study, pregnant mice were exposed to either UFPs or filtered air (FA) equivalent to a 24-hour average of 25 µg/m3 during gestational days (GD) 0.5 to 13.5. The study involved inoculating dams with either heat-inactivated (HI) control virus or live Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) virus and evaluating them three days after infection. The viral titer of PR8 was measured in the lung using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine its infectivity. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to evaluate pulmonary histopathology three days after infection. The study examined T cell responses in maternal lung samples from different exposure groups, specifically T1, T2, T17, and CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lineages. Results Plug-positive female mice in all exposure cohorts had a pregnancy rate of at least 60%. UFP exposure did not impact pregnancy loss due to comparable pregnancy rates among the groups. Related StoriesPhysical activity in pregnancy reduces asthma risk in offspringUnraveling the mechanism of Shufeng Jiedu Capsules in influenza treatmentHeat exposure significantly heightens risks for maternal and newborn healthThe FA-HI cohort did not show a significant difference in percent weight gain compared to the control mice housed in a different room. The percent weight gain estimated for FA- or UFP-exposed dams inoculated with PR8 showed significant differences, suggesting a strong infection. Both infected groups impacted percent weight gain, suggesting a successful infection. No variations in the weight gain percentage were observed between UFP-HI and UFP-PR8 or between FA-PR8 and UFP-PR8. The UFP-PR8 group had the highest expression in the qPCR examination of the influenza A segment, with a 3.7-fold increase compared to the FA-PR8 group. The UFP exposure group showed more PR8 cytopathic effect (CPE) than the FA exposure group during TCID50 analysis. This was observed through cell lysis, excessive cell rounding, and multifocal cellular destruction. Apart from one dam from the UFP-HI cohort, which displayed mild and focal inflammation, dams from the UFP-HI and FA-HI groups did not show significant inflammatory infiltration. The FA-PR8 group showed mild to moderate inflammation, primarily in perivascular and peribronchial regions with lymphocytes, plasma cells, scattered neutrophils, and macrophages. The UFP-PR8 group showed only minimal aggregates of lymphocytes and no significant inflammation. The UFP-PR8 cohort did not have inflammatory infiltrates, unlike the FA exposure group, indicating a suppression of the innate immune system. The exposed and inoculated cohorts showed changes in their immune cell profiles, indicating potential lung immunosuppression. The UFP-PR8 group exhibited reduced levels of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. The UFP-PR8 group showed a decrease in CD8+T cells, indicating early immune suppression in the adaptive arm. This is consistent with the reduced tissue pathology and high PR8 lung titer. Five genes showed detectable expression. Sphk1 showed a moderate positive association with PR8 lung titer, while interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7), transforming growth factor (TGF-β), and interleukin-33 (IL-33) had little correlation. The higher Sphk1 and Il-1β corresponded with a rise in viral titer. The UFP-PR8 group exhibited around five times higher levels of Sphk1 in comparison to the FA-PR8 group. Increased Sphk1 levels and activity are observed in severe cases of influenza infection, which can promote the replication of the virus. The expression of Il-1β was significantly higher in the UFP-PR8 group compared to the FA-PR8 cohort. Conclusion The study findings highlighted various pieces of evidence that suggest a higher vulnerability to influenza infection due to exposure to gestational UFP. These include reduced weight gain, increased viral titer, reduced lung inflammation and T-cell response, and changes in inflammatory mediators and pro-viral variables. The study's findings provide an initial basis for safeguarding pregnant women and managing UFPs through clinical and regulatory measures. Vaccination for pregnant females is crucial in urban areas where influenza and UFPs are prevalent. Preventive actions are necessary to safeguard maternal health by limiting UFP exposure and promoting vaccination. Journal reference: Drury, N. et al.

The current disease outbreak has pushed workers extremely hard as they deal with depopulating flocks, nonstop testing and the uncertainty of not knowing when the next positive case will appear. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Although it’s been more than a month since a positive case of avian influenza has been detected in a Pennsylvania poultry flock, the impact of the disease is still being felt by those on the frontline of the outbreak.Dating back to the start of the current outbreak last spring, approximately 5 million birds from commercial and backyard poultry flocks combined have been put down in Pennsylvania. In March alone, avian influenza was detected on 21 farms, totaling more than 119,000 birds.The magnitude and duration of the current outbreak has taken a toll on workers, according to Chris Herr, executive vice president of PennAg Industries Association. Compounding the situation is the uneasiness of waiting for the next positive case to appear, even though the outbreak is in a lull in Pennsylvania. “There’s a nervous anticipation just knowing this is out there,” he said. “As this drags out, you wonder how many months can you continue at this pace.”The stress is especially notable with two types of responders.The sheer number of tests required has been overwhelming at times. According to Herr, over 400,000 tests have been conducted in Pennsylvania as of early April. Nationally, 20% of influenza-related testing has been in Pennsylvania.For veterinarians and technicians, it means working late nights and weekends on top of long days.“A veterinarian with the state agriculture department, typically it’s an 8-4 job and now it’s 60-70 hours a week,” Herr said. “They’ve stepped up and done it, but there’s a real fatigue factor involved in testing.”The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture declined to be interviewed for this article.Herr said the volume of testing is just one challenge.The process of depopulating affected flocks can take an emotional toll on farm families and workers, he said.Flocks are depopulated via several methods, including suffocation with foam or carbon dioxide, or ventilation shutdown.“I’ve watched these birds fade, and you know it’s the right thing to do, but it’s still not easy,” Herr said. “When you’re pulling that foaming unit down a 400-foot barn knowing in 15 or 10 minutes you’re part of putting these birds down, it’s a somber thing.”The toll of the current outbreak is also being felt by other state agencies. The Pennsylvania Game Commission will raise 298,000 pheasants to be released for hunters in the fall and winter. The agency purchases the birds as chicks from a farm and raises them at two Game Commission facilities in outdoor pens covered with netting.Both of the Game Commission farms are enrolled in the National Poultry Improvement Plan certification program, which requires periodic testing for avian influenza. Any birds that perish on the farm from other diseases such as coccidiosis are also tested for influenza.While the Game Commission’s pheasant farms have not had any positive cases of influenza, if the disease did appear the birds would have to be depopulated, according to Ian Gregg, chief of the agency’s Game Management Division.The risk of avian flu being detected on a pheasant farm can be a serious financial blow to the agency. Gregg said almost $464,000 is spent to purchase chicks, and it costs $16.81 per pheasant to raise it to the point where it can be released for hunting, which typically occurs at 20 weeks of age.Add it all up, and Game Commission personnel are feeling the stress of avian influenza just like their counterparts in the domestic poultry industry.“The extra precautions, extra testing and stress level of these different scenarios that you don’t know if they will happen, it’s a lot,” Gregg said. “But the stress of the unknown is a bigger factor than all the extra work.”Herr said Gov. Josh Shapiro has been fully engaged on the issue, and financial resources from the state have been critical.But when it comes to alleviating the stress on responders, building depth within the ranks is what’s needed, he said.That means looking to other state agencies and even volunteer fire departments that may be able to help if the outbreak resurfaces.“We’re impressed with the work that PEMA (Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency) does in handling situations. There are entities out there that do emergency management well, and we probably need to include them in our discussion,” Herr said. “Maybe it’s working with volunteer fire departments and training them in aspects of this. There are entities out there that are already doing these things well, and we need to take a look at expanding what they do.” Newsletter Success!

WEATHER ALERTView full list of active weather alerts Closings and DelaysCheck the latest school closings and delays in Central Ohio (File Photo) CDC investigating influenza's impact on canines By Camri Nelson Columbus PUBLISHED 11:00 AM ET Apr. 19, 2023 PUBLISHED 11:00 AM EDT Apr. 19, 2023 SHARE COLUMBUS, Ohio â The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently investigating various strains of canine influenza after a recent outbreak in Minnesota. Itâs a virus thatâs prompting a warning for pet owners. What You Need To Know CDC is currently investigation different strains of canine influenza Canine influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that impacts dogs and cats, but not humans Although there are currently no outbreaks in Ohio, there was an outbreak years ago in central Ohio Clear nasal discharge, coughing and fever are some of the symptoms H3N2 and H3N8, which originated from birds, are currently the two canine influenza strains found in America. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, itâs a highly contagious viral infection that impacts dogs and cats, but not humans. âWhat we know about influenza viruses, though is that they do like to change,â said Dr. Kimberly West, a Health & Harmony Animal Clinic veterinarian. âAnd so the changing is what I think the CDC is watching right now.â While West hasnât seen any animals impacted by these strains this year, she said there was a major outbreak nearly five years ago in central Ohio. âIt really took a lot of day care facilities and boarding facilities and hit them pretty hard and it was a pretty bad upper respiratory infection that we did see,â said West. So how do you know if your pet has canine influenza? West said there are a few upper respiratory symptoms to look out for. âItâs going to be that clear nasal discharge, coughing, lethargic, fever, not wanting to eat. Just kind of being down in the dumps,â she said. If your animal is displaying any of these symptoms, make sure to contact your vet. To prevent your pet from getting the virus, West suggests you avoid contact with dead birds and places where there are a lot of animals in one place. âIf youâre boarding your dog, if your dog is going to go to a high population, just make sure that the place that youâre taking your dog requires vaccines,â she said. There is currently a canine influenza vaccine and medication available for dogs. But with there currently being no outbreaks in central Ohio, West said thereâs really not much to be worried about right now. âWeâre probably not going to be testing until somebody either from the AVMA or the CDC lets us know that we are really starting to see that these arenât just spill over events. These are true infections," she said.

During a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry, USDA veterinarian Dr. Alecia Naugle said it’s a whole-of-industry response and, “We do provide cooperative agreement funding directly to states that are impacted by HPAI to assist with their response as well as education and outreach with those local producers.”When asked if there is an end to the current HPAI outbreak, USDA Undersecretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Jenny Lester Moffitt told subcommittee members she cannot predict the end of the current outbreak but USDA is incorporating lessons learned from the 2015 outbreak. “Looking at and evaluating biosecurity and what more can we do on biosecurity because we know that it’s the one most effective thing in reducing lateral spread, but also how we’re looking at and reducing the attractiveness of wild birds because we know the virus load is very strong in the wild bird population.” The subcommittee is evaluating existing animal disease and prevention efforts in preparation for the new farm bill. 0 comments Tags: Dr. Alecia Naugle, high path avian flu, highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, Jenny Lester Moffitt, Poultry, USDA Add Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

alternative to current flu vaccinesPfizer says its mRNA-based influenza program, in collaboration with BioNTech, has potential to succeed current vaccination technologies.Anna BrownApril 20, 20232 Min ReadImage: DepositPhotos/ AndreyPopovPfizer says its mRNA-based influenza program, in collaboration with BioNTech, has potential to succeed current vaccination technologies.With influenza causing 650,000 global deaths every year, developing a more flexible and accurate vaccine is in the interest of global health.Last September, Pfizer initiated a Phase III study of its messenger RNA (mRNA) based flu vaccine, following a 2018 partnership with a then little-know German biotech BioNTech.Image: DepositPhotos/AndreyPopovIn 2020, both BioNTech and mRNA were thrown into the global spotlight due a successful COVID-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech in just nine months.Now Pfizer is leveraging a similar approach to mRNA beyond COVID through a roadmap that aims to reduce bureaucracy and increase collaboration.According to Pfizer’s VP of mRNA Commercial Strategy & Innovation and Global Pandemic Security Lead Jane True speaks, mRNA-based vaccines have the ability to replace current technologies in the long-term.Speaking with Informa Connect’s Lottie Leinfellner ahead of the virtual event Influenza mRNA Vaccines,True focuses on the lessons learned from the pandemic and the need for preparedness. “If one person is sick in the whole world then the rest of us are at risk,” she says. “Now is the time for vigilance.”Pfizer’s mRNA techThe influenza mRNA program is designed to provide an alternative approach to current egg-based influenza vaccines.Conventionally, influenza vaccine development involves growing the virus of interest in chicken eggs. The virus is then inactivated and processed into a vaccine. This approach faces challenges such as updating vaccines to keep up with influenza strain changes, and generally only offers 40-60% protection against circulating strains.Pfizer’s program involves the development of a quadrivalent nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) vaccine candidate, designed to target four influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The vaccine only requires the genetic sequence of the influenza virus and provides a more flexible approach in which the mRNA can be replaced with the gene of interest.The flexibility of this approach could potentially allow better strain matches and improved protection against influenza.Additionally, due to the rapid manufacturing of mRNA technology this could allow for the rapid, large-scale manufacturing of vaccines for future influenza pandemics, says Pfizer.The program is supported through a partnership with Codex DNA, which allows Pfizer access to Codex’s enzymatic DNA synthesis technology. This could further accelerate mRNA manufacturing by moving from biologic to synthetic DNA, therefore, reducing mRNA vaccine production time.To catch Pfizer’s presentation on mRNA technology and pandemic preparedness, sign up here.About the AuthorAnna BrownSee more from Anna BrownYou May Also LikeWebinarsAsk the Expert webcastsATE WebcastsRegister Now: AAE-MS™: A Powerful Method to Assess Host Cell Protein ELISA Fit for PurposeRegister Now: AAE-MS™: A Powerful Method to Assess Host Cell Protein ELISA Fit for PurposeAsk the Expert webcastsATE WebcastsRegister Now: Evaluation of a New Multimodal Anion Exchange Resin for Emerging Biotherapeutic Process ChallengesRegister Now: Evaluation of a New Multimodal Anion Exchange Resin for Emerging Biotherapeutic Process ChallengesAsk the Expert webcastsATE WebcastsRegister Now: Linking mAb Product Quality Profile Changes to Your Bioprocess: Case Study of Dynamic Glucose Level Control in CHO Process Improves Product QualityRegister Now: Linking mAb Product Quality Profile Changes to Your Bioprocess: Case Study of Dynamic Glucose Level Control in CHO Process Improves Product QualityLatest ContentRegister Now: Linking mAb Product Quality Profile Changes to Your Bioprocess: Case Study of Dynamic Glucose Level Control in CHO Process Improves Product QualityNov 8, 2024Empowering Modern Drug Product Development: Breakthroughs in High-Concentration Formulations and Drug-Device Combination ProductsNov 8, 2024|1 Min ReadRedefining Scalability: Strategies for Enhancing Early Drug Development to Future-Proof Later StagesNov 8, 2024|1 Min ReadTalent dearth continues to puzzle life sciences industry, says recruitment expertTalent dearth continues to puzzle life sciences, says recruitment expertNov 8, 2024|2 Min ReadGet the NewsSUBSCRIBESUBSCRIBEInnovationsWuXi Bio white paperSponsored ContentEmpowering Modern Drug Product Development: Breakthroughs in High-Concentration Formulations and Drug-Device Combination ProductsEmpowering Modern Drug Product Development: Breakthroughs in High-Concentration Formulations and Drug-Device Combination ProductsNov 8, 2024Bora white paperSponsored ContentRedefining Scalability: Strategies for Enhancing Early Drug Development to Future-Proof Later StagesRedefining Scalability: Strategies for Enhancing Early Drug Development to Future-Proof Later StagesNov 8, 2024ValGenesis Ask the Expert webinarSponsored ContentOut of the Box Computer Software Assurance with ValGenesis VLMSOut of the Box Computer Software Assurance with ValGenesis VLMSNov 7, 2024BPI PodcastsContent SpotlightPodcast: Sustainability is about health equity, says ScaleReady and GermfreeScaleReady and Germfree discuss the need to rethink sustainability and move towards a more standardized and simplistic manufacturing model to ensure health equity can be achieved.Listen NowBPI ContentBPI ArchiveBioProcess Insider NewsSubscribe to BioProcess Insider NewsletterResourcesEventsWebinarsWhite PapersPostersVideosPodcastsAbout BPIWho We AreEditorial AdvisorsAuthor GuidelinesAdvertising/Media KitList Rental/ReprintsCareersJoin UsSubscribeFollow UsCopyright © 2024 Informa Connect Limited.

The Metrix COVID-19 Test is being designed for sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2, and the Metrix COVID/Flu multiplex test is being designed to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B. Aptitude Medical Systems announced today that it has received an award up to $53.7 million from Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The funding supports the development of over-the-counter molecular diagnostics capable of delivering lab-quality results in 15-30 minutes while approaching the cost of antigen tests. BARDA is part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the US Department of Health and Human Services. The first phase of the award will build out Aptitude’s MetrixTM testing platform through $19.6 million in funding to develop and validate at-home COVID and COVID/Flu tests. Additional funding options worth up to $34.1 million may be exercised to develop multiplex tests for other infectious disease threats. This BARDA award will support development of these diagnostics through FDA 510(k) clearance. Aptitude’s COVID-19 Test is the first product on the Metrix platform and received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA in Oct 2022. It will be closely followed by the Metrix COVID/Flu Test and software to integrate patient, providers, payers, and public health. Metrix tests enable the use of nasal swabs or saliva samples (depending on disease) and require inserting a disposable cartridge into a reusable reader, providing results in 15 to 30 minutes. The use of either saliva or nasal swabs as the clinical specimen increases access to high quality diagnostics by leveraging an easily collected sample. Upper respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19 and the flu, can cause similar symptoms, especially in early stages of infection. At-home diagnostics can empower individuals with actionable information about their infection status so that they can self-isolate and seek medical care and treatment early in the course of any infection. Aptitude aims to make molecular tests as accessible as antigen tests, according to JP Wang, PhD, Aptitude CSO and co-founder. “The value of that upgrade is clear – a PCR-quality molecular test means that you can detect an infection earlier to avoid spreading to your family, friends, and coworkers. Antiviral treatments are significantly more effective if given at the start of an infection –not mid-infection. So, detecting sooner means you can recover sooner because the treatments actually work better. Traditional healthcare is too slow to deliver this value to most people.” Sources: Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Aptitude Medical Systems At-Home Diagnostics BARDA Biotechnology COVID-19 Editor Pick Emergency Use Authorization Rapid Diagnostics Share.

It involves transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic changes and can be local or systemic, with the latter effect leading to changes in bone marrow progenitors [2]. Little is known about the role of trained immunity in antitumor responses, and whether sustained antitumor functions are achievable in tissue-resident macrophages is unclear.The authors showed that in a mouse model of sublethal IAV infection and injection of B16 melanoma cells 30 days later, IAV infection induced pulmonary antitumor immunity. The infected mice showed a significantly reduced lung tumor burden and increased survival after tumor challenge (Fig. 1A). A consistent antitumor phenotype was observed when B16 cells were inoculated 60 or 120 days post-IAV infection as well as following adenovirus (AdV) infection. These antitumor effects were not observed after subcutaneous injection of B16 cells, but in spontaneous lung metastases in a breast cancer model. Furthermore, the effects were independent of changes to hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, showing that respiratory viral infection triggered long-term antitumor immunity specifically in the lung.Fig. 1Acute IAV infection induces long-lasting antitumor immunity in the lungs (A). Natural killer cell-derived interferon (IFN)-γ trains antitumor effector functions in embryo-derived resident alveolar macrophages and renders them resistant to tumor-induced immune suppression (B). The figure was created using BioRender.comFull size imageDepletion of T cells or AMs and adoptive transfer of virus-exposed AMs to naïve recipients showed that IAV-induced antitumor immunity was independent of adaptive T cells but depended on virus-exposed AMs. Analyses of the transcriptional profile, phenotype, immune functions, and chromatin accessibility in AMs 30 days following IAV infection revealed cardinal features of trained immunity: profoundly altered gene transcription, increased major histocompatibility complex class II expression, increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion after stimulation, sustained metabolic rewiring and increased chromatin accessibility in genes related to immune activation and macrophage effector functions. Using different approaches, the authors showed that IAV-trained AMs developed independent of circulating monocytes. An analysis of the proliferation status of the AMs at different time points after infection suggested that despite substantial losses during acute infection, the AMs were replenished via the proliferation of embryonic-derived resident AMs, which then induced tissue-specific trained immunity.To identify the mechanism by which IAV-trained AMs exert antitumor immunity, the authors employed a number of approaches. Abundant AMs were detected in juxtaposition to B16 cells in tumor lesions, and higher rates of tumor cell phagocytosis by IAV-trained AMs than by IAV-naïve AMs were observed. Upregulated transcription of gene clusters closely related to macrophage antitumor functions identified in RNA-seq data obtained from IAV-trained AMs supported the hypothesis suggesting that AMs promote antitumor immunity through enhanced phagocytosis and tumoricidal functions. In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated significantly decreased survival of B16 cells in the presence of AMs from IAV-infected mice compared to those from PBS-treated mice. This difference was not observed when cells were separated by transwell membranes, indicating contact-dependent mechanisms. Flow cytometry and imaging of cocultured cells confirmed phagocytosis of tumor cells by IAV-trained AMs. The killing of phagocytosed cells was independent of AM death, but the degree of tumoricidal functions was reduced when mitochondrial oxidation was suppressed. This outcome suggested that AMs depend on enhanced mitochondrial oxidation from fatty acids and glucose. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) derived from tissue-resident macrophages harbor the potential for both protumor and antitumor functions and are important to oncogenesis [3]. Immunosuppression of TAMs is a key mechanism in tumor cell immune escape. For functional characterization of IAV-trained AMs within the tumor microenvironment, peritumoral AMs were purified after the establishment of B16 cell lung tumors and subjected to ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses. The resulting data suggested that tumor progression induced the establishment of an immune-suppressive microenvironment to which IAV-trained AMs were epigenetically and transcriptionally resistant (Fig. 1B).Prompted by findings from AdV-mediated trained immunity [4], the authors asked whether IAV-mediated trained immunity depends on T cells and/or interferon (IFN)-γ. When CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were depleted from day 3 post-infection until inoculation with B16 cells, a reduced tumor burden was nevertheless evident in IAV-infected mice. Analyses in IFN-γ and IFN-γ receptor knockout mice showed that IAV-mediated antitumor immunity depended on IFN-γ. Natural killer (NK) cells are significant sources of early IFN-γ following IAV infection [5]. Depletion of T cells or NK cells and analysis of antitumor functions in the lungs revealed that NK cells, but not T cells, were critical for IAV-induced antitumor AM functions.To determine whether their observations applied to human lung cancer, the authors sought to identify trained AMs in human lung tumors and determine whether they are associated with antitumor immunity. Analysis of published single-cell RNA-seq data from non-small cell lung cancer tissues led to the identification of multiple AM subsets, one of which harbored transcriptional profiles characteristic of trained immunity. These trained AMs were enriched with relevant gene clusters, and the frequency of these cells was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues with high immune activation compared with those with low immune activation in the tumor microenvironment.This study presents intriguing new aspects of trained immunity. In a broader context, the observations contribute to evidence suggesting the significance of multiple, sequential triggers for tissue immune homeostasis and emphasize the thin line between the good and bad outcomes of respiratory microbial infections. IAV remains a serious potentially life-threatening pathogen that predisposes patients to severe bacterial pneumonia [6]. Also in this study, mice were highly susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae during acute IAV infection, but they showed increased survival and reduced bacterial burden after a lethal pneumococcal challenge 30 days post-infection. Ultimately, detailed mechanistic knowledge is essential to exploit protective mechanisms. As the lung represents a preferential site for primary and metastatic tumors with unfavorable prognoses, there is a clear need for novel therapeutic strategies [7]. Since IAV-trained antitumor immunity prolonged survival by only a few days, the induction of sustained AM antitumor activity might not represent an ultimate cure. Nevertheless, it is a promising contributor to successful antitumor immunity in the lung. ReferencesWang T, Zhang J, Wang Y, Li Y, Wang L, Yu Y, et al.

Here’s how to prevent bothBYErin PraterWhen looking at the percentage of those infected who develop post-viral illness, as well as the severity of symptoms, post-viral illness from COVID generally isn’t more of a problem than that from flu—in the Omicron era, at least. That’s according to new findings presented this week at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in Copenhagen.Getty ImagesFlu or COVID, it may not matter—the post-viral illness you potentially wind up with could look pretty similar, according to new research released this week. Long COVID is a post-viral illness that occurs after infection with COVID. Also known as PASC, or post-acute sequelae of COVID, it’s typically defined as new symptoms that develop after infection and persist for at least four weeks—often for months, and sometimes for years. Similar post-viral illnesses can occur with other viruses, too, like the flu, herpes, Lyme disease—and even Ebola and SARS. Post-viral illnesses often have a chronic fatigue syndrome-like presentation, with symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, and post-exertional malaise, in which symptoms get worse after mental or physical activity. When looking at the percentage of those infected who develop post-viral illness, as well as the severity of symptoms, post-viral illness from COVID generally isn’t more of a problem than that from flu—in the Omicron era, at least. That’s according to new findings presented this week at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in Copenhagen. The research took place among residents of Queensland, Australia, where more than 90% of the population had been vaccinated before Omicron burst onto the global scene in early 2022. For 12 weeks, researchers followed nearly 2,200 adults who had been diagnosed with lab-confirmed COVID, and nearly 1,000 adults who had been diagnosed with lab-confirmed flu. Of those who experienced Omicron, a fifth (21%) had ongoing symptoms at 12 weeks, and 4% reported symptoms that had a moderate or severe impact on daily living. When it came to those who had experienced the flu, the numbers were almost identical, with 23% reporting ongoing symptoms at 12 weeks, and 4% reporting moderate or severe impacts on daily living. But there’s a reason why long COVID is having an outsized impact on the health care system, researchers from Queensland Health said in a news release: the sheer volume of COVID infections. There have been more than 11 million lab-confirmed COVID infections over Australia in the last three years, according to the World Health Organization—a number that is likely a massive undercount. By comparison, Australia only recorded only a little more than 225,000 lab-confirmed cases of flu last year. “In our highly vaccinated population, the public health impact of long COVID does not appear to result from any unique property of SARS-CoV-2,” Dr. John Gerrard, Queensland’s chief health officer, said in the release. “Rather, the impact results from the sheer number of people infected over a short period of time.” Long COVID risk factors Interestingly, the study noted that those who were members of the following groups were less likely to report moderate or severe functional limitations on their daily lives after Omicron or flu: older individuals members of indigenous populations Around 5% to 10% of Australians who’ve had COVID report symptoms lasting for longer than three months. People who are part of the following groups seem to be at greater risk, according to the country’s federal health agency: female middle age those who’ve had severe COVID In general, people with the following health conditions are at a greater risk of developing long COVID, according to a March journal article in Health Affairs: hypertension chronic lung disease obesity diabetes depression How to prevent long COVID The best way to prevent long COVID continues to be to prevent COVID infection, by doing the following, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: masking social distancing frequent, quality hand-washing staying away from those with known illness It’s widely thought that COVID vaccination could reduce the risk of developing long COVID. Just a single shot could reduce your risk by 35%, according to Harvard Health. When it comes to reducing long COVID risk, “vaccinating goes a very long way,” Dr. Luis Ostrosky—chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at UTHealth Houston and Memorial Hermann in Texas, and the infectious diseases director for UTHealth Houston’s COVID-19 Center of Excellence—tells Fortune. How to prevent post-viral illness from the flu If you’re looking to prevent potential post-viral illness from the flu, the same recommendations apply, Ostrosky says: “The premise is that the best way not to get long COVID or post-flu issues is to not experience the diseases themselves.” “COVID was a real eye-opener for all of us as to the power of masking and hand hygiene,” he adds. “It’s no longer automatic to get sick in the winter. You can very likely avoid it.” A COVID vaccine won’t help you when it comes to the flu. But a flu vaccine could reduce your risk of developing post-viral complications from the flu, he advises.For you: The Well Adjusted newsletter: Sign up to get simple strategies to work smarter and live better, in your inbox three times a week.

Screenshot: San Jose City Hall webcamTwo of California’s most iconic endangered raptors have been hit by the devastating strain of avian influenza ravaging domestic and wild birds worldwide. On Wednesday, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that at least seven endangered California condors found dead in Arizona tested positive for avian influenza. The virus is suspected to have also killed 11 more area condors; test results are pending. This story was produced by Bay Nature magazine and first appeared on its websiteMeanwhile, Shasta, a female peregrine falcon nesting atop San Jose City Hall, was confirmed to have died from avian influenza in late March. Shasta was the mate of Sequoia, the offspring of the beloved UC Berkeley campanile falcons Annie and Grinnell. “I’m concerned about all of our falcons,” says Zeka Glucs, director of the Predatory Bird Research Group at UC Santa Cruz. “All it takes is one infected meal. Peregrine falcons are, unfortunately, specialists in the species that are really good reservoirs for this virus.” That includes waterfowl and shorebirds, which falcons can pluck out of the air mid-flight. There are currently an estimated 300 peregrine falcon mating pairs in California. A select few, including the UC Berkeley and San Jose falcons, have become social media stars via nest webcams. In March, viewers of the San Jose City Hall webcam alerted the Predatory Bird Research Group that Shasta was behaving oddly, bobbing her head and flying in a strange, uncoordinated way. Soon after, a passerby found her injured on a nearby sidewalk, and she was taken to the Silicon Valley Wildlife Center. She died the next day, and a necropsy test confirmed avian flu. Sequoia disappeared shortly after Shasta became ill, and has not been seen at the nest since. It was the falcon pair’s first year nesting together.“They were ready to lay, before she got sick,” says Glucs. “It was heartbreaking, to watch her be sick, to be able to see her on cam and the distress she was in.”Bay Nature traced the history of the latest avian pandemic, and what makes it so weird. The Latest Bird Flu Pandemic Is Terrible—And Strange Avian Flu Isn’t Just for the BirdIn early March, a California condor in Arizona was found dead below her nest after showing signs of distress. At first, lead poisoning—the leading cause of death for wild condors—was suspected. A lab test revealed the condor was infected with the latest strain of avian flu, which produces similar neurological symptoms as lead poisoning. “I’m very concerned, especially for the condors,” says Glucs. “Folks have done all they can to try to prepare for something like this, and really boosted the population in the wild. But at this point, it seems like maybe an inevitability that [more populations] will be exposed.”In 1982, there were only 22 California condors left in the wild. Tremendous efforts have been spent on recovering the species. As of 2022, there were 561 California condors worldwide, with 347 of them flying in the wild, according to the National Park Service. There are five wild California condor flocks, concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Central California, Southern California, Baja California, and Arizona/Utah. Now, the latest avian influenza may pose another major threat to their recovery. “The California condor is a very iconic species, well known, well loved, well recognized across the country, and especially in the areas where we have populations,” says Joanna Gilkeson, spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “We’re working with our partners to do everything we can to try to limit the spread of HPAI and help those birds currently affected.” The latest strain of avian flu that has been sweeping the globe and more recently California is the deadliest and most infectious bird flu ever to strike North America, according to wildlife epidemiologists. The strain is known as Goose/Guangdong lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza, or Gs/GD HPAI. As of February 2023, Gs/GD HPAI has been detected in wild birds in 47 out of 58 California counties, including all nine Bay Area counties, and has been found in every U.S state except Hawaii. The virus has ravaged domestic poultry flocks, and has sickened and killed more species of wild birds across a greater geographic area than any previous outbreak. As of this month, the virus has affected more than 52 million domestic poultry birds in the U.S. and has been detected in 6,542 wild birds across the country. This is likely a vast underestimate, since most sick birds are never tested.Infected birds show telltale neurological symptoms like Shasta’s—swimming or walking in circles, seizures, head tics, or twisted necks. Once they’re showing symptoms, birds go down quickly. For raptors and poultry, the virus has a 90 to 100 percent fatality rate, and there is no treatment. Infected birds can shed the virus through bodily fluids or excretions, mainly feces, that end up in the water other birds use. Raptors and other scavenging species, including some mammals, can get sick from eating diseased carcasses. Waterfowl, seabirds, and raptors are highly susceptible, while songbirds account for only 2 percent of detections.Wildlife epidemiologists expect that Gs/GD HPAI exposures are likely to increase during wild birds’ spring migration to northern breeding grounds. What to do if you see a sick birdIf you see raptors, waterfowl or other wild birds showing signs of avian flu, report them to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife online or call the California Department of Food and Agriculture’s sick bird hotline at 866-922-BIRD (2473). Signs and symptoms include lack of coordination, twisted necks and head tics, walking in circles, and unusual numbers of dead birds in a single location. Do not touch or handle dead or ill wildlife.

This compared to 23% of those with influenza who reported ongoing symptoms and 4% with moderate to severe functional limitations.Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, lauded the results of the study on Monday, saying her government’s policy of strict border control until the state had achieved high vaccination rates now appears to have helped suppress the severity of long-Covid symptoms.The state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said the study showed Queensland was “a textbook example of how to respond to a one-in-100-year pandemic”.“The study is also a reminder that the best way we can continue to protect ourselves is remaining up to date with vaccinations,” she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Faux agreed with that sentiment, but said there was no indication as to whether the two cohorts had been matched in terms of gender and comorbidity and that long Covid could only be diagnosed after 12 weeks.“Then we’ve got to have the persistence of the symptoms for two months and you’ve also got to have an exclusion of any other causation for the symptoms,” he said. “And none of that was done.”The state’s health department told Guardian Australia it had plans to monitor the same cohort of patients for 12 months and that those results would be reported later this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The UK government recently announced that as of April 18, poultry and captive birds can be kept outside again as the threat from bird flu eases. These mandatory housing measures were introduced across England and Wales in the autumn of 2022 following the unprecedented spread of bird flu in the UK and Europe. Indeed, the past two winters in the UK have seen our largest and most prolonged outbreak of bird flu in modern times, leading to substantial controls in poultry production, the mass death of seabirds, cases in wild mammals and a single human case. So how did we get here, and has the threat in the UK really receded? Let’s take a look. Read more: Bird flu: domestic chicken keepers could be putting themselves – and others – at risk Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by the influenza A virus which can lead to disease in many hosts including humans. However, its ability to infect and transmit to different hosts depends on which subtype or serotype of influenza A is involved. Influenza A serotypes are designated based on two proteins found on the virus’s surface called neuraminidase (N) and haemagglutinin (H), each of which come in several different types. The combination of H and N types (for example, H5N1, H1N1 or H3N2) defines the serotype. Within the serotype there can also be a number of variants called clades. The current outbreak in the UK and elsewhere is caused by a 2.3.4.4b clade of the H5N1 serotype. Typically, horse strains of influenza A are H3N8 and H7N7, pigs and humans are susceptible to H1N1 and H3N2, and avian influenza encompasses H5 and H7 serotypes. In general, human influenza viruses have little capacity to infect animal species and vice versa, but sporadic infections can sometimes occur between species. How did the current outbreak spread? The origins of all influenza A serotypes are thought to be in aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, gulls and wading birds. The 2.3.4.4b clade of the H5N1 serotype, for example, is descended from the goose/Guangdong lineage, first isolated in a goose in Guangdong, China. This clade emerged around 2021 and has caused several outbreaks globally, including in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, most likely spread by migratory birds. As many geese and duck species can carry the virus and shed it in their droppings without becoming ill they can easily transmit virus to other bird species. Normally in the UK we see a number of localised bird flu outbreaks each winter, but the levels of the current virus – identified in more than 300 UK poultry farms in the past two years – is unprecedented in modern times. And while avian flu has traditionally been a problem primarily for chickens and other domestic birds, this outbreak has been unusual in its capacity to cause disease and death in wild birds too. This strain has been found to cause disease in over 60 wild bird species in the UK, including many not previously known to be affected. The reasons for this are not clear but could include changes to migratory flyways (the routes birds use for migration) and increased susceptibility due to climate change or pollution affecting the general health and immune systems of seabirds. This outbreak has unquestionably been deadly. Across 37 countries affected, more than 50 million birds have been culled. Beyond birds Mammals can become infected with bird flu as a result eating infected birds – through predation or scavenging – or from coming into contact with bird faeces. In the UK most mammalian cases are in species likely to have consumed infected birds including foxes, otters and weasels. The UK Health Security Agency has a zero to six level of threat for pandemic avian influenza. The alert level has remained at level 3 (limited transmission in mammals other than humans) for some time, with the only evidence of transmission between mammals from a mink farm in Spain. Bird flu has been detected in mammals such as otters. Chrispo/Shutterstock Since December 2021 there have been seven reports of human infection with 2.3.4.4b H5N1 around the world. Generally, the risk of transmission of avian influenza to humans is low. Most cases are through direct contact with live chickens or ducks. In the current outbreak cases in Spain and the US were found in poultry workers and the single UK case in a man keeping infected ducks in the household. A nine-year-old girl from Ecuador who contracted the virus was reported to be in contact with backyard poultry. Balancing risk with animal welfare Over the past two winters mandatory orders to house birds, including free-range and backyard flocks, have helped reduce the potential for transmission into, within and from poultry. The greatest risk of influenza to poultry is through the autumn and winter months with the migration of birds, such as barnacle geese. As we move out of peak influenza season, the risk should be lower in the short term. The removal of housing restrictions is a decision that balances infection risk with animal welfare. Almost two-thirds of UK egg production is free range and it’s thought there could be as many as one million UK households that keep backyard chickens. Allowing these birds back outside will benefit their health. Read more: Avian flu has jumped into wild seabirds and is spreading fast That said, it’s increasingly likely that H5N1 is here to stay and will remain a problem for poultry production and wild birds, and a threat to other species. For now, advice to avoid contact with infected birds and report any suspected cases is sensible. We will need ongoing surveillance of poultry, wild birds and mammals to assess risk and potential emergence of more transmissible strains in the future.

By FERN's Ag Insider FERN's Ag Insider The Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN) is the first independent, non-profit news organization that produces in-depth and investigative journalism in the critically under-reported areas of food, agriculture, and environmental health. Through partnerships with local and national mainstream media outlets, FERN seeks to tell stories that will inspire, inform, and have lasting impact. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 19, 2023 Close The government will stamp out bird flu through aggressive culling of infected flocks and is unlikely to turn to vaccines as a tool against the disease, said Agriculture Undersecretary Jenny Moffitt on Tuesday. Moffitt told lawmakers the USDA has devoted $1.3 billion to quell a 14-month-old outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza and to keep African swine fever out of the country. Both diseases have high mortality rates and pose a threat to food supplies. A record 58.7 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens and turkeys being raised for meat, have died of bird flu since outbreaks began in February 2022, helping to drive up egg prices. African swine fever, which is harmless to humans but kills almost all of the hogs it infects, was confirmed in Haiti and the Dominican Republic in summer 2021 — its first appearance in the Western Hemisphere in decades. "At this stage of the outbreak, continuing our current strategy of eradication or 'stamping out' HPAI is our best and most effective option," said Moffitt in testimony at a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing. "We continue to stress more than anything else the importance of strong biosecurity to every producer." USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing a vaccine to use on bird flu strains "so that we are prepared in the unlikely event if we should ever have to turn to vaccination to complement our eradication efforts," she said. It would be 18-24 months before a vaccine would be available and there are many factors to weigh about using it, particularly the impact on international trade. Roughly 15% of U.S. poultry meat is exported. U.S. trading partners would have to agree to accept meat from vaccinated birds and the United States would have to prove the meat was free of the virus. The HPAI tests now in use do not easily distinguish between infected and vaccinated birds, so a new protocol may be needed. USDA chief veterinarian Rosemary Sifford will discuss with other livestock welfare officials "if we need to look at vaccination differently" at a World Organization for Animal Health meeting in May, said USDA official Alecia Naugle, who accompanied Moffitt to the hearing. The USDA took several steps, including establishment of a protection zone around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to reduce the chance of African swine fever reaching U.S. territory. "We have removed feral swine in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands because feral swine are a natural reservoir for the disease and could help the virus spread quickly if it moved into those territories," said Moffitt. The ARS is working on a vaccine against the disease. "I remain confident we can keep the disease away," said Moffitt.

(AP Photo/LM Otero) Share Indigenous groups are disproportionately impacted by influenza in numerous countries worldwide, including Canada, according to the first study to measure this issue on such a wide scale. The study, published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, found Indigenous people in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia were three to six times more likely to be hospitalized for influenza than non-Indigenous people in those countries. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia, Indigenous people were more than five times as likely to be hospitalized with influenza. "It is critical that governments ensure that people who have the flu have equitable access to healthcare and that vaccination rates are as high as possible," Dr. Katherine Gibney, an epidemiologist at the Doherty Institute and Royal Melbourne Hospital as well as senior author of the study, said in a press release. "When we are planning for seasonal flu, but especially pandemic flu, we need to have specific and targeted plans for First Nations people that are generated by First Nations people." Although this issue has been recorded in previous studies, researchers say this is the first time that this inequity has been estimated on a global scale. Although influenza is a common illness, it still is responsible for thousands of deaths a year. There are more than 50 million influenza infections and more than 100,000 deaths due to influenza each year, according to this study. And for Indigenous people, the rate of hospitalization and mortality is much higher, researchers say. In order to get a broad picture of how Indigenous groups were impacted by influenza, researchers performed a review and meta-analysis of 36 studies that looked at data relating to influenza hospitalizations and deaths for Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations worldwide. All of the studies were from high or high-middle income countries, with researchers noting there is a lack of studies on this topic from low-middle to low income countries. All studies were published prior to July 13, 2021. Four of the studies had been performed in Canada, making up 11 per cent of the sample. The rest of the studies included 15 from Australia, 10 from the U.S., six from New Zealand and one from Brazil. More than half of the studies had extractable data relating to hospitalization, while five had extractable data only relating to mortality. A total of 26 of the included studies were looking at hospitalizations and deaths that had occurred during the 2009 pandemic of H1N1, a type of influenza known as swine flu. Across the board, researchers found there was a consistent pattern of Indigenous groups seeing statistically significant higher hospitalization rates. When looking at seasonal influenza specifically, the biggest disparity was in Auckland, New Zealand, where Maori children were around eleven times more likely to be hospitalized for influenza compared to other children during the winter months of 2014-2016. "For many global Indigenous populations, including those from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States and Brazil, the experience of colonialism is the common factor driving health inequities," researchers wrote in the study. "While particular circumstances differ between populations, the effects of violent dispossession from traditional lands, policies of exclusion and ongoing experiences of racism and discrimination, particularly within the healthcare sector, continue to unjustly manifest in worse health outcomes for Indigenous peoples." The study was limited by the lack of data from low income countries, as well as the lack of data focusing on seasonal influenza, with many of the studies focused on the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Gibney said governments should collaborate with Indigenous communities to address these inequities. "Australia did a fantastic job during COVID of having First Nations-led plans that worked well," she said. "And if that can be applied to the flu, it would be incredibly valuable." "Our research emphasises the widespread and ongoing impacts of colonisation on the health outcomes of First Nations communities," Dr. Juliana Betts, co-author of the study with Monash University, added in the release. "Solutions to these health gaps largely sit outside of the health sector, in policies that address the many social determinants of health including poverty, housing, education and racism." Researchers are also calling for better data to be gathered, so the factors behind this inequity can be explored further. "When we get information about flu hospitalisations and deaths, we need to capture that individual’s First Nations status to determine whether the gap we have described is closing over time, and to continue to advocate for resources to reduce the disease burden in First Nations populations," Gibney said.

Elyse Russo, Walgreens Stories April 19, 2023 Copy to clipboardCopied to clipboard Linkedin Facebook 2 mins read While flu cases are ticking upward in parts of the U.S., flu season as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally defines it, is over. Peak flu season typically begins in December and ends in February. A second wave of flu cases usually comes sometime in late January through early March. But that second wave never came—just one of a few oddities tracked during the 2022-23 flu season. In fact, it was the first time in Walgreens surveillance history, which began in 2018, that the Walgreens Flu Index did not show a second wave of flu.Anita Patel, vice president of pharmacy services development at Walgreens"It's not unusual to see a surge in cases of influenza B later in the season, but we've really seen no evidence of that this year,” says Anita Patel, vice president of pharmacy services development at Walgreens. So, why was there no second wave? Patel says it could be because vaccines and circulating flu strains were reasonably well matched this season. "According to data shared by the CDC, this season’s flu vaccine effectiveness against the predominant H3N2 viruses was 45% among children, which has been around 30% during previous seasons," she says. Additionally, vaccinated adults aged 18 to 64 were 51% less likely to have a flu-related hospitalization, the CDC reports. Another strange thing about this year's flu season: a very early start. The Walgreens Flu Index began tracking flu activity as early as August, which is far earlier than usual. As flu cases climbed in the fall, Patel noted that people were more vulnerable to respiratory infection as they returned to pre-pandemic activities and spent more time indoors without a mask or social distancing.Even though this flu season was unique, Patel says the resulting illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths from flu matched up with pre-pandemic seasons—no second wave needed.“So far this season, the CDC estimates there have been at least 26 million illnesses, 290,000 hospitalizations and between 19,000-56,000 deaths from flu, so despite the absence of a second wave, this burden of disease is in line with previous pre-pandemic seasons,” Patel says.The Walgreens Flu Index is an interactive tool that allows users to search by market or state to see where their geographic area ranks for flu activity in any given week.

Bird flu or the avian influenza virus is mutating. Read on to know everything. Bird Flu Outbreak: H1N1 Strain Infects Cats, WHO Explains The Risks For Humans Written by Satata Karmakar |Updated : April 16, 2023 2:09 PM IST Amid rising fears about a possible fifth wave of COVID-19 in India, experts have warned about the massive spread of Bird Flu virus in the country. In the latest report issued by the health officials of India, the government has sounded alert in Bihar after several cases of H5N1 virus were confirmed in the state. What is more concerning at the moment are the new mutations which experts have noticed in the virus. Let's understand how threatful are these new mutations in the virus, and where India stands when it comes to facing an outbreak of the H3N1 virus or the bird flu virus. New Mutation In Bird Flu Virus Shows High Potential For Humans OutbreakBird flu is an air-borne infection caused by strains of the influenza virus that primarily infect birds. The mode of transmission of this virus is via infected body fluids of the birds. The virus mainly affects the avian community of the environment. What about the humans? Although experts had shown cases of human transmission of the H3N1 0r H2N3 virus and the possibility of it entering and evading the immune system, the chances of it causing severe outcomes for humans were too low. But this is not the case anymore. A recent study has revealed something unusual and new. According to the scientists, they have identified new mutations in the avian influenza virus H5N1, which recently infected a man in Chile, and may pose a risk of spreading in humans. According to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), the risk of spread from human to human remains low but the new changes seen are 'concerning'. It also suggests that the potential risk of human spillover is increasing.

As per the medical reports, the man was reported to be in serious but stable condition with a severe pneumonia-like condition. China Reports First Bird Flu DeathThis comes a few days after Chin confirmed the first human death by the Bird Flu virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the death of a 56-year-old Chinese woman due to the H3N8 bird flu strain that is rare in humans. The H3N8 subtype of avian influenza is a rare strain of the virus and it is unusual to spread among the human community. Talking about this rare case of bird flu death in China, the WHO confirmed that the virus responsible for the infection was influenza A(H3), which is very common in birds and extremely rare for humans. As per the global health body, there were no additional cases reported among people who had been in close contact with the infected individual.

The symptoms that are commonly reported by the patients are like the common flu, such as fever, body aches, sore - throat, and cough. Speaking to the media, Richard J. Webby, a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital stated that to become threatful to the human community the H5 virus will have to undergo three major categories of changes. "The sequences from the person in Chile have one of those classes of changes. But we also know that of those three sets of changes, this is the easiest one for the virus to make," Jude was quoted as saying. How to detect the H3N1 virus infection in humans? Bird flu infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the upper respiratory tract of the sick person. "The disease can carry high mortality in humans. Some antiviral drugs, if taken within two days of symptoms, may help. Oseltamivir or Tamiflu is one of the drugs effective against bird flu," said Dr Nitin Verma Director Pediatrics Rosewalk Healthcare.Bird Flu Outbreak: How Big Is The Threat For India?As the speculations of the H5 virus turning into a human virus from a bird virus is on the rise in India, we spoke to Dr Anamika Dubey, Senior Consultant, General Paediatrician, Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital, Malviya Nagar.Dr Dubey said, "In the United States, there are repeated outbreaks of H5 N1 in wild birds and poultry since 2022. In India H5N1 in poultry farms was first reported in 2006 in Maharashtra. Since then outbreaks of Avian influenza A in poultry farms is reported every year. One human case of H5n1 was notified on 21 July 2021 from Haryana state." TRENDING NOW Talking about the safety measures that one can take during a bird flu outbreak, Dr Dubey said, "As advised by WHO, at all times the public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. Hand hygiene with frequent hand washing with soap and water is recommended. Good food safety practices should be followed. There is no evidence to suggest that Influenza a or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked poultry. There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that people have been infected with avian influenza virus by consumption of eggs or egg products. However, eggs from areas with outbreaks in poultry should not be consumed raw or partially cooked." Bird Flu Bird Flu in India bird flu news Bird flu symptoms Don’t Miss Out on the Latest Updates.

ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO Salma KhalikSenior Health Correspondent Updated Apr 17, 2023, 02:36 PM Published Apr 16, 2023, 06:58 PM More Whatsapp Linkedin Twitter FB Messenger Email Print Purchase Article Copy permalinkCopy to clipboard https://str.sg/i469 SINGAPORE - Covid-19 has not been shown to be more deadly than the flu, said local experts responding to two recent studies that say Omicron, while not as virulent as earlier variants, caused more fatalities in the last winter season than influenza. Almost all Covid-19 infections today are caused by Omicron and its sub-variants. The first study, by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), looked at more than 11,000 people who were hospitalised after confirmation of either Covid-19 or the flu, between Oct 1, 2022 and Jan 31, 2023. The results, published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 6, found that 6 per cent of Covid-19 patients died, against 3.7 per cent who had the flu. The article said: “Compared with hospitalisation for influenza, hospitalisation for Covid-19 was associated with a higher risk of death. The risk of death decreased with the number of Covid-19 vaccinations.” The second study, by the Rabin Medical Centre in Israel, compared outcomes among 167 hospitalised Covid-19 Omicron patients and 221 patients admitted for flu in December 2021 and January 2022. This study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was a special early release from the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, which is meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, from last Saturday to Tuesday. In this cohort, the mortality rate was 26 per cent for patients hospitalised with Omicron against 9 per cent of those with the flu. Dr Alaa Atamna, who led the research team, said: “A possible reason for the higher Omicron death rate is that patients admitted with Omicron were older with additional major underlying illnesses such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease.” Covid-19 is of particular interest now following news of a more virulent variant dubbed Arcturus, which has caused a surge of infections in India. There was also a spike in infections here at the end of March. In the week of March 26, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 28,410 Covid-19 infections – almost double the 14,467 reported the previous week. The number of cases over the previous three weeks was also higher than in the first two months of 2023. However, that jump in cases did not presage a new wave of infections, as the number dropped to 16,018 in the week of April 2. On the other hand, the number of flu cases has been increasing, with confirmed cases more than doubling each month – from 96 in January to 421 in March – based on the MOH monitoring of polyclinic cases, which is used as a yardstick for infection rates in the country. More On This Topic What is Arcturus and what are the symptoms of the new Covid-19 sub-variant? Thailand, Indonesia gird up for holidays-fuelled spike in Covid-19 cases Dr Asok Kurup, an infectious diseases specialist in the private sector, said: ”I am personally seeing several cases of severe influenza infection requiring hospitalisation.” He said he has already seen about six older patients with severe influenza this year. There were also three younger patients, aged 17 to 33, who had to be hospitalised, though none needed intensive care. Dr Kurup said the flu should not be trifled with. “Not enough people are getting vaccinated, especially over the last few years. So the flu is back with a vengeance.” Professor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-NUS Medical School, a medical doctor specialising in microbiology, said the two foreign studies were too short and not suited to compare the deadliness of the flu versus Covid-19. He added: “Genetic drifts that occur over the course of months and even years in influenza viruses can give rise to strains with greater propensity to cause severe lung infection.” More On This Topic S’pore in midst of new Covid-19 wave, with 3 in 10 cases reinfections Surge in Covid-19 cases unlikely to overwhelm S’pore hospitals: Experts Professor Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases specialist at National University Hospital, agreed with Prof Ooi that the studies were not designed to compare mortality rates, and that the severity of the flu bug varies from year to year. He added that previous studies have shown that Singapore gets about 50 deaths a month from the flu. The latest Covid-19 data from MOH shows there were 12 Covid-19 deaths in January and five in February. Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the VA study showed mortality only among those hospitalised, and not of those infected. He said: “It’s not a like-for-like comparison, and I don’t think that saying ‘Omicron is more severe than flu’ is warranted.” His colleague, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, pointed out that the studies merely showed the number of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 or the flu who had died, and not that they had died of Covid-19 or the flu. Some patients may have been hospitalised for some other problem, but happened to be infected. Said Prof Hsu, who is an infectious diseases expert by training: “My own take is that both are non-trivial illnesses in the elderly.” More On This Topic You can get flu and Covid-19 at the same time, say health experts S’pore residents can book flu jab with GP via govt health appointment system Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said whether there is a seasonal pattern or a predictable pattern for Covid-19 is uncertain as the virus is still evolving. She said the disease can be mild and inconsequential to younger adults, but can be severe in older people as there is an “age effect”. “We have to do our part to protect our elderly and those vulnerable. Keeping an updated vaccination against the Sars-CoV-2 (virus) is critically important for the older population.” All the experts agreed that vaccinations will continue to play an important role in reducing severe illness and death in older people and others who are vulnerable because of other illnesses they may have. Said Prof Ooi: “I think these studies strongly reinforce the notion that vaccination is critical for preventing severe Covid-19. How frequently booster vaccinations against Covid-19 are needed in the more vulnerable group really depends on the ongoing studies.” While Prof Hsu said he is not sure if vaccination is the way to go for Covid-19 the way it is for the flu, “perhaps this is the less harmful practice for the elderly as far as Covid-19 is concerned, until we have better data and evidence”. Added Prof Leo: “The mRNA vaccine is highly effective but it is limited in durability – to whom, when and how frequently to give booster doses needs further study.” More On This Topic Covid-19 jabs will remain free, but treatment and testing no longer 100% subsidised 3 mRNA jabs enough to keep healthy people well-protected, even for new Covid-19 variants: Expert Your browser does not support iframes, but you can use the following link: Link Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.

winter with free flu vaccines available this May Stay well this winter with free flu vaccines available this May News story All Western Australians will have the opportunity to receive a free flu vaccine during the month of May 2023. Last updated: 5 July 2023 Listen to article Your browser does not support the audio element. With winter approaching, Western Australians are encouraged to get vaccinated for influenza and stay up to date with the latest dose of their COVID-19 vaccination. In May 2023, everyone in Western Australia can get a free flu vaccine to protect themselves over the peak influenza period. It is especially recommended for young children, older adults, those with underlying medical conditions, and for healthcare workers and staff working with children. Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can cause life-threatening complications and getting vaccinated will help prevent people from severe illness this winter. Getting a free flu vaccine in May should optimise protection over the peak period for influenza transmission in Western Australia – typically from June to September. Currently, government-funded free flu vaccines are available throughout the flu season for the following groups: children from 6 months to under 12 years. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 6 months or older. pregnant women (at any stage of pregnancy). people aged 65 years and over. those who are immunocompromised or have medical conditions (such as cardiac disease, chronic respiratory conditions, neurological conditions, renal disease, haematological disorders, or diabetes). people experiencing homelessness and residents in congregate living settings, such as residential aged care, disability care, mental health hostels and youth group houses. WA Health staff. As COVID-19 infections continue to increase in the community, Western Australians are also encouraged to also take their COVID-19 vaccination, which can be received on the same day as the flu vaccine. To get your free flu vaccine in May, book your appointment at participating GPs, community pharmacies and Aboriginal Medical Services. Stay healthy this winter by continuing to practise good hygiene habits such as washing your hands, staying home if unwell, and keeping up to date with your vaccinations.

REUTERS/Mike Blake Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save REUTERS (Chicago) — The U.S. government is testing four potential bird flu vaccines for poultry, officials said on Friday, after more than 58 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have died in the nation's worst outbreak ever.The trials, conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service, are the first step in a lengthy process toward the possible first use of vaccines to protect U.S. poultry from the lethal virus.Bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), has killed hundreds of millions of birds around the world, raising interest in vaccines. The virus is largely spread by wild birds that transmit it to poultry.The USDA is testing one vaccine from Zoetis Inc, one from Merck Animal Health, and two developed by the department's Agricultural Research Service.Zoetis said it previously supplied its vaccine to a USDA stockpile in 2016, following a massive 2015 outbreak, but it was never used.Initial data from a study using a single dose of a vaccine are expected in May, while results from studies on two-dose vaccine regimens are expected in June, the USDA said.If the trials are successful and USDA decides to continue development, it would take at least 18-to-24 months for a vaccine that matches the current virus to be commercially available, the agency said.The government needs to ensure vaccinations would not disrupt trading with major buyers, said Greg Tyler, president of the industry group USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.Governments have previously focused on culling infected flocks to control the virus due to concerns importers would block shipments of vaccinated poultry to avoid the risk of infections.The USDA said on Friday its "current strategy of stamping out and eradicating HPAI... continues to be the most effective strategy because it works."France said last week it was launching an order for 80 million doses of vaccines to use in ducks in the autumn if final trial results are positive, the first EU member to start such a plan.

Exposure to ultrafine particles during pregnancy enhances the risk for respiratory viral infection, shows a study. During pregnancy, women are more susceptible to severe respiratory infections from multiple viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, pregnant women are disproportionately affected by influenza, resulting in a more than 10-fold increase in hospitalisation risk. "We know that air pollution affects the pulmonary immune system, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections," said Dr. Natalie Johnson, associate professor in the Texas A&M University School of Public Health. READ MORE UAE launches marine plastic waste monitoring programme Kids spending excessive screen time during summer vacations In the study, published in the journal Particle and Fibre Toxicology, the team pointed out that there are several physiological characteristics that explain maternal susceptibility to viral infection. Among those are increased cardiac output and decreased tidal volume — the amount of air that moves in or out of the lungs with each respiratory cycle — as well as immunological changes such as selective modulation of immune cell subsets to protect the developing foetus. The researchers also highlighted that vaccination compliance during pregnancy is generally below 50 per cent, despite vaccination against influenza being safe and effective, leading to increased risk for developing respiratory infection. As a result, air pollution, which is a worldwide environmental health issue, is responsible for one in nine deaths with an annual premature mortality of more than 7 million. A mixture of gases and tiny airborne particulate matter, which is categorised as UFPs, are critical to recognise and identify, especially to protect vulnerable populations. The team said these findings support future clinical and regulatory interventions for protecting pregnant women and controlling UFPs. AIt is imperative that pregnant women in urban cities, where influenza and UFPs are more prevalent, are provided vaccinations and preventive measures limiting UFP exposure to protect maternal health, they noted. "Air pollution is a pervasive environmental health issue," Johnson said. "Strategies to protect the most vulnerable, like pregnant women, are of high priority to decrease adverse health effects."
